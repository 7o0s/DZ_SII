Riders reach speeds of nearly two hundred miles per hour and lean so hard into turns that their bodies just hover off the ground.  The slightest miscalculation or lapse in concentration will send a rider careening into another racer or hurtling headlong into the pavement.  Ubi Soft's Suzuki Alstare Extreme Racing (~SAER~ for short) jettisons the subtlety and grossly exaggerates the speed of real motorcycle racing to create a pure arcade-style racing game that takes place in colorful fictional environments instead of closed racing circuits.  Also available on the Dreamcast and Game Boy Color, SAER has a definite console game feel.  In the main game, you compete in a series of championships composed of a handful of races each.  If you finish first in the points standings of each championship, you get to progress to the next one, opening both new tracks and motorcycles.  Your goal is to work your way through the novice races, then join the Suzuki Alstare Racing reserve team, and then the full team.  As you open new tracks, you can play them in a quick single race mode as well, though it would have been more enjoyable if you could simply access whatever track you want right from the start.  Once completing the main game, you get to race the tracks in reverse at the expert level.  Since the game tends to be fairly easy once you're familiar with the tracks, you won't get much of a challenge, regardless of the level you've reached.  For tougher competition, there's online multiplayer that supports up to eight players.  There's also a two-player split-screen mode, though on a typical computer monitor, each viewing window is too small to be practical.  What should have been a strength of SAER turns out to be pretty irrelevant.  This is a licensed game, so you get to race against real Suzuki Alstare team riders Stephane Chambon, Katsuaki Fujiwara, Fabrizio Pirovano, and Superbike star and fan favorite Pierfrancesco Chili.  In game terms, though, these are just meaningless names, since all the riders perform in totally exaggerated ways to fit the overall feel of the game -- don't expect elite racing competition.  Do expect reckless aggression from the AI racers, though, as they have no compunction about slamming into you for no apparent reason.  It's a shame the game didn't at least include some information on the real-life riders it purports to represent; they're some of the world's top racers, after all.  The same license irrelevance holds true of the bikes, which are very loosely based on the real-life Suzuki GSX-R600 and GSX-R750.  Unlike reality, from the very first race of the game you can hit speeds of nearly 300mph, and you also get a limited turbo boost that sends you rocketing down the track in an utterly implausible but fun fashion.  The game's physics are implausible all around, actually.  If you hit a slight bump, your bike will launch into the air, fly extreme distances, and generally land perfectly.  You can make incredibly sharp turns without having to worry about the bike sliding out from under you.  Crash physics are often unpredictable: sometimes you can hit a wall or ride a few feet up the side of a rocky hill without any problems, while other mistakes will send you flying off your bike.  None of the subtleties of real motorcycle racing are depicted in SAER: you never have to worry about balancing the bike, properly slowing for and leaning into turns, slipstreaming other riders and so forth.  Then again, the action is blazingly fast and can be fun, at least in short bursts.  In addition to selecting automatic or manual transmission, the handling of each bike can be modified, but only in a simplistic way.  There aren't any detailed settings for steering geometry, suspension, gear ratios, and the like.  However, you can alter power, steering, and braking; an increase in one will typically lower another.  You'll most likely want to increase power at the expense of steering, since there's no controller sensitivity slider, and the bikes' default steering is very twitchy.    The options in the game tend to be quite limited all around.  Not only are there few motorcycles to choose from, but you can only choose three different styles of racing leathers to set the look of your rider, and you can't change the color scheme of the individual bikes.  You can race against no more than seven opponents.  You can't choose how many laps you'll race.  Other than a simplistic automatic replay at the end of each race, there are no substantial replay options.  You can't alter the weather during races for the added challenge of wet-weather riding.    Fortunately, you do get some nicely varied tracks.  In SAER, you don't race on any real racing circuits, but instead tear across picturesque country roads, rocky beaches, crowded industrial zones, and snowy Alpine peaks, among others.  There are twelve tracks in seven environments, all told, and they tend to have interesting layouts with tight turns for challenge and elevation changes for visual interest.  You'll need fast reflexes to navigate these tracks smoothly, avoiding shipping crates by a dock or boulders on a beach, for instance.  An area where SAER generally succeeds is its graphics. Each environment is colorful and filled with detailed and realistic textures.  Sandstone mesas, gritty pavement, massive bridge piers, rustic stone walls, and snow-covered pines are all vivid and attractive.  The overall color palette of the game is very vibrant, ensuring that each environment feels unique.  The artists did an especially nice job blending the 2D backdrops into the 3D foregrounds.  There are some odd quirks, though, like lens flares sometimes appearing when there aren't any clearly visible light sources.  Racing through these colorful tracks, you can use multiple camera angles, including a first-person view, though this tends to be hard to use since you don't see the front of your bike for reference.  It does convey a powerful sense of speed, though. Unlike the scenery, the bikes and riders look pretty poor.  Bikes tend to feature too much reflective sheen, and rider animations are very jerky, especially compared to the smooth motion-captured animations in EA Sports' superb Superbike 2001, for instance.  Unlike the graphics, SAER's sound is bland all around.  Nondescript techno music accompanies each race, and while the fast beats match the almost frenzied pace of the game, each track tends to merge forgettably into the next.  There aren't many in-game sound effects, other than the bike engines.  According to the game box, these were captured from the real motorcycles, but they still sound underpowered and dull.  Overall, Suzuki Alstare Extreme Racing is a mediocre game.  While the graphics can definitely be attractive, and some of the tracks are interesting to race, the lack of realism and options ultimately detracts from the total experience.  Of course, not everyone wants to play a hardcore racing sim, but a game needs a bit more sophistication and challenge to remain interesting in the long term.  Still, if taken for the pure arcade-style racer that it is, Suzuki Alstare Extreme Racing's brand of motorcycle action can be fun for a brief diversion.  -- Scott Osborne      Want to share your opinions with the world?
