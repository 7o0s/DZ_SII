It's an online adventure game, yet the bulk of its content is tailored for solo play. That's mostly because the majority of Uru Live's puzzles and environments were already released in 2003 with Uru: Ages Beyond Myst and its expansions. If you weren't aware, Uru Live was originally supposed to have been released in 2003, but the online portion was axed and thought to be lost. Uru Live was eventually picked up again, and the result of Cyan Worlds' renewed development efforts is what you see today, a version of Uru that finally works online.   A few new Ages, the Myst mythos' term for puzzle areas, have been added, two of which require up to eight players to band together and solve cooperatively. Though these puzzles can be fun and require precise, coordinated actions, they're over rather quickly. As a result, Myst veterans uninterested in plugging through Uru's content again will be left with a dearth of things to actually do, shifting the onus of gameplay creation to the community. Old Ages can be played through again with others, which can be helpful if you're stuck, but there's no pressing need as their design caters to solo play. Cyan Worlds is currently working to add new content and curiosities, but as of yet, there isn't that much new to see. If you're a casual fan of adventure games and never played Uru before, you'll have significantly more to accomplish, including tangling with some challenging puzzle designs. Otherwise, you may want to carefully consider what diving into Uru Live entails, since as of right now it's basically Uru: Ages Beyond Myst with an online infrastructure.    Upon loading up a game, customizing your avatar's appearance with a fairly limited character creator, and setting foot in your home base, an Age called Relto, you immediately encounter Uru Live's most distinct feature: an unprecedented lack of direction. This isn't an MMOG where you collect experience points, grind mobs, and strive for more powerful items. It's a game for puzzle aficionados and, more specifically, those who enjoy a distilled and very specific form of role playing. The first thing you'll need to do is collect a Ki, which acts as the game's communication device. Through the Ki's clumsy interface, you can chat with other players in the game, write notes, and take pictures. Acquiring it is a bit of an adventure in itself, but if you watch the cheesy tutorial video on Uru Live's site you should be fine.   Eventually you'll find yourself in the Cleft, an Age vital to rediscovering the history of an ancient race called the D'ni. If you haven't experienced Uru: Ages Beyond Myst and are unfamiliar with the storyline, you'll be in for a tantalizing narrative. After completing each of Uru's Ages, you're treated to bits of an intriguing and well-paced storyline that gradually disentangles itself from its initial state of incoherence. To complete an Age, you'll need to find special cloths scattered around to unlock the exit door. For any Uru veterans, this is old news, but the previously released content remains a worthwhile adventure experience to anyone that missed out in 2003.    To test out the new material, you'll travel through linking books in your Relto's hut to an area called the Nexus. Here you'll find a server list allowing you to hop into one of the game's many lobbies, called Bevins, where you can interact with other players. Inside the various Bevins, which are all slightly varying instances of the same underground city, you'll find link books to new Ages (though one tends to float between servers), some mini-games, a poetry hall, and a few other link books, including The Great Zero antechamber where you'll get a task that might actually prompt you to check out bits of the old content. You'll also find out how to reach The City, a sprawling D'ni metropolis which ties together many of the Ages.   If you jump into the Guild of Greeters Bevin, which you should if you're just starting out, you'll find avatars known as greeters, who welcome you to the Bevin and happily help with any questions you may have. This is where you'll need to spend some time getting acclimated to Uru Live's universe, and can even take a tour in the Beginner's Bevin. Since greeters are real people, they'll not only provide helpful hints but also drop clues as to how to go about accessing the game's content, and make leading comments about possible changes to the game world.     In addition to the cooperative Ages, you can invite players to your private Relto Age. The motivation for doing so is largely social, as you'll be able to see how other adventurers have customized their private age with waterfalls, thatched roofs, and elaborate bridges. Relto modification is yet another reason to plough through the old content by finding special cloths that allow for these types of aesthetic changes to take place. And that, without getting too embroiled in detail, is the game.   The question remains, why bother playing a four year old game that's been retrofitted with an online substratum? At this point, the only two reasons are community and potential. Myst Online: Uru Live could become a great game replete with all the mystery and player driven intrigue that's been promised for so long. As it stands, there isn't all that much to wonder about because there literally isn't much new content in the game. Even so, there's a certain allure to logging on and patrolling the streets of the Bevins, The City, or jumping into any of the strikingly otherworldly Ages. You'll also find a mature, helpful, and generally good natured player community. These people are committed to Uru's fantasy, and are an excellent asset to making your game experience more enjoyable by keeping the focus on cooperation, not competition.    This isn't the flashiest game out there. The textures look blurry and dated in some spots, but you can't help but be impressed some of the Ages' art design, which can be beautiful. Character model designs and animation, on the other hand, are pretty poor in comparison to what else is out there. Uru Live's sounds hold up much better, with minimalist soundscapes throughout each Age that effectively emphasize eerily ominous atmospheric underpinnings. Unfortunately the game can't escape some technical issues. When wandering about the more populated areas, lag frequently becomes an issue. We also experienced a few seemingly random game crashes and freezes.   Like its offline predecessor, Uru Live features a notably wonky third-person control scheme. If you can recall the first Resident Evil, you'll have an idea of the imprecise, tank-like maneuverability of your avatar. The camera further compounds the problem, sometimes refusing to orient itself properly. Normally this is only a minor irritant, but in some of the areas that require platform hopping the camera has a tendency to completely obscure your jump's target area. Though falling into a chasm doesn't actually kill you, it does force you to retrace your steps by restarting you in your Relto.   If you're unsure about this game, there's a free trial available through GameTap, though it's heavily feature limited. Even if you decide to take the plunge, you'll still find this game costs less than most retail releases.Myst Online: Uru Live was supposed to come out in 2003. Instead, nearly all its content was released with only single-player support. Now in 2007, we get to experience what Cyan Worlds had originally envisioned. The only problem is there's barely any new content to run through. Recently a new Age, called Negilahn, was released, and the entire Uru Live community went ballistic trying to figure everything out. Such a singular, fanatical focus exemplifies the dedicated, collaborative nature of the community, but also to the lack of new challenges in the game. If you never played Uru when it first released, you'll find an excellent adventure game here, with some of the best puzzles and atmosphere out there. For those that already chewed through Uru's Ages, you'll only be presented with a handful of new challenges along with the online features. As of right now, Uru Live is an empty house with an attic full of old content. Those interested may want to wait for Cyan Worlds to add the furniture before moving in.", "date": "Mar 6, 2007"}
