It seems all those years of deliberately and very carefully avoiding any and all relatives categorized as the forgotten dregs of the extended family was a damn good idea.   Buddy, our inappropriately named moron of a cousin, is having some difficulty running his Las Vegas casino. His problem, which will soon become our problem, is that he didn't use a bank to fund his operation. Rather, Buddy opted to take advantage of a different kind of ill-gotten cash dispersal system: the lowbrow mob. Now it's up to us to go in and cover his flagrant ineptitude by building Buddy's Slum of a Slot House into something classic: Buddy's Not So Slum of a Slot and Jack House. Strange that old Buddy couldn't do this himself, since making a little good out of a lot of nothing in Casino Empire is extraordinarily simple.  Know what a tycoon game is? Isometric, hand drawn economic management, Casino Empire is all about the art of luring customers and making money. Unfortunately, this is an apparently easy craft to master. Even those subjected to the ritualistic torture of any California public high school can become proficient at managing a casino empire. Since nearly half our students failed the mandatory exit examination tests, it's a pretty painlessly obtained credential.  In a lot of ways, Casino Empire is very much like high school. It's not hard. You don't want to be there. It's very dull. It's very tiring. And, if you leave for a good fourth of the year, you can still come back and pass with little to no problem.  I was in Vegas not too long ago. In addition to teasing Jeremy Conrad into a fever about the possibilities of bringing his DVD-RW drive to the hotel room and ordering movies like Spider-Man and Attack of the Clones, I also learned that it's a place of decadence and the sinful relinquishment of one's monetary reserves. Inside the smoky chambers and extravagant halls of any and every building in the torrid, bright desert, there is a near infinite amount of entertainment. To some small extent, Casino Empire delivers this home. But, the game's purpose of running an immense establishment is lost and wholly unfulfilling.   Two modes make up the play. Empire charges players with taking on one casino after another and making each into a formidable business capable of competing with the best. Sandbox allows each conquered casino to be revisited in a freeform fashion. The problems of the first seep into and ultimately ruin the halfhearted second.   If only Buddy were related to his famous namesake. Maybe then all this misery could fade away like Scott Baio's career.   Unlike other topnotch sim/tycoon games, empire mode does not offer nearly enough to hold interest. For one, aside from the usual switches in scenery and new twists, too much of the last mission's strategy carries over to the next. Certainly each gets progressively more difficult (which isn't saying much), but none ever requires a drastic rethought and retooled approach.   What makes this worse is the game's startlingly easy play and insistence upon creating challenges that, rather than revolving around some kind of logic, strategy, or meticulous planning to solve, require the player to haphazardly stumble about a cluttered and often oversized scene searching out that key character to resolve that key issue. It's a very cumbersome and ultimately drab way of retaining interest and making what would otherwise be a simple game of furniture layout interesting.   But there is still some modicum of enjoyment to be found in putting stuff down and setting sliders. Provided intricacies are not necessary to win (I actually left my game running for twenty minutes on a couple of different casinos and still successfully completed the missions), but they do help speed things along and act as small attention grabbers to give intrepid gamers something extra to lookout for, if so desired.   At a very rudimentary level, games like slots and tables make money (and there are plenty -- some can even be played as a sort of mini-game), dcor brings people to the games, services keeps people happy, and all work to bolster the casino's rep. Services are both required and optional and sometimes even come with personnel to manage. Don't fret, or start fretting a lot... There's no real micromanagement in this department. There'll be wayward guards that need redirection, but tending to the needs of employees is not in here.   Roaming security brings up an interesting point... The people in Las Vegas are just as daft as Buddy. Visitors complain about one thing, but give vocal indications and move in ways that seem to suggest they're displeased with another. They'll pass up restrooms and head to the caf even though they're properly nourished and bickering about a desperate need to urinate. Anyone who's not satisfied (getting a red flagged customer is just as hard as losing) can be easily cheered up with a quick and dirty comp. So long as satisfaction is up and games are laid out, scenarios get won.  And, even though there are different types of patrons (tourists, gamblers, VIPs), I never has to specifically cater to their needs or build my casino to fit a particular taste. The key to success here is actually what foolish people initially do and fail at in other tycoon games: have no strategy and just build as much of everything as is humanly possible as quickly as possible. It somehow all works out. Even cool things like adjusting the alcohol level in drinks, changing the leverage on tables, altering table buy-in, cheating, and so forth, are completely superfluous. And that's sad, since inclusions like those and the more sinister side of gaming, such as sending spies to do dirty work, are Casino Empire's greatest assets.  The goal of the empire mode is then not to satisfy customers (who are always happy anyway), or even to deal with intricate, complex, or otherwise difficult problems as they occur, but rather to utilize common sense and be able to logically and sequentially place one thing after another and watch as the money rolls in. There's good reason a speed slider was omitted from this game, such a thing would make everything absolutely pointless, as would command control during a pause.   After each casino has been beaten (a good day's work for anyone who's even the least bit familiar with the genre), head on over to sandbox mode, where the same thing can be repeated, only without a time limit.   It's like forcing a person to drive from point A to point B (a 10 minute trip) on a one way street in 30 minutes or less and then asking him or her to do it again without that constraint. It's still the same trip, the same stretch of road, the same unidirectional, boring drive, only with even less challenge.  The themes of the casinos and the fact that they're casinos with unique objects are all that retain interest. The Egyptian Luxor knockoff, the Medieval Excalibur look-alike, the Solid Gold Hard Rock, and the Bellagio's own evil twin the Poseidon all make appearances.  Still, Casino Empire is in some ways very much like traditional tycoon game. It looks and sounds like them.   Many poorly animated, but now standard people scurry about a colorful and flashy, yet still static environment normal for this type of game. Transparent indicators for security and sanitation coverage are hard to see; it's also difficult to pick certain people out of the crowd; and, things get so cluttered that placing new objects is often troublesome, especially since the tile layout follows a nonsensical pattern. But the worst aesthetic grip is definitely the lack of rotation. What the hell's that all about?  The music shines, and keeps on shining in a repetitious way. Thankfully, some serious thought went into this department and the people at Sierra tossed in MP3 compatibility, granting us all the ability to copy our legally obtained songs into a designated directory and enjoy whatever the heck we like. It's a bit primitive, but nevertheless functional. Hit and miss voice work rounds out whatever's left.  And that's about where it ends.   Aside from the above problems, where are the downloadable, user-created objects and casinos? Where are the more detailed rooms, different time periods, in-depth exterior customization, mob involvement, and staff management? Not here.   Closing Comments: A tycoon game with zero lasting appeal and even less challenge (oddly true) is simply not a tycoon game.   Like the real Vegas, the posh nature of Casino Empire is only skin deep. When more robust titles are as readily available as they are, the stringy meat behind this one's superficial veil of lights and glitzy attractions is so thin and unpalatable that it barely warrants a passing mention, even if only in jest.   Gameplay that builds upon troublesome and confounding faults lurking deep in an unaccommodating interface to create effortlessly conquered pseudo-challenges is not a substitute for tried and true thought, strategy, and managing practices. Coupled with a narrow scope, this broken design only swells the greater problem of there simply not being much to do. Unfortunately, what is to be done is only taxing on a player because of the troubles inherent to the game's design. It's dull and it's easy.  An exercise in tedium and frustration that's best left in the box, Casino Tycoon's few positives do little to balance out a mass of overwhelming negatives that avid players of the genre and even casual fans will find sorely displeasing.  It's a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live here.  A tycoon game with zero lasting appeal and even less challenge (oddly true) is simply not a tycoon game.
