For all practical purposes, save its two-player mode, Top Gear Rally beats the pioneering arcade game from Sega and rises to the level of elite racers in the crowded genre for Nintendo 64.   Not everyone will like Top Gear. Many will reach a high level of frustration early on and quit, declaring, ~this game sucks~ -- the typical response from someone who's only spent five minutes playing, and usually a gamer who sucks anyway.   For car lovers and speed fanatics, Top Gear Rally achieves an amazing level of suspense and speed. It features a stunning suspension system, a jaw-dropping physics model, courses that are long but never dull, and powerslides were never better than this.  Top Gear Rally provides yet another reason to take a serious look at what third parties can perform on the Nintendo 64. The graphics are amazingly clean and crisp, with subtle anti-aliasing and mip-mapping creating faint blurs on slanted edges, rather than fat heavy lines that distort the overall picture. It's true that many of the textures are repeated too many times, or the dirt roads look far too clean for dirt roads, but so what -- the gameplay and overall graphics beat the pants off those weak arguments. Plus, gamers can repaint their cars in a cute little paintshop area that will surely be copied in other games.  In a game of subtlety like Top Gear Rally, Daytona drivers are going to have to play for some time before they get the hang of these seemingly heavy, clunky cars. But, if anyone remembers playing Sega Rally, they'll remember how heavy those cars felt, too.   By beating each season in Championship mode, you're rewarded with new, quicker-turning, speedier cars, as well as new courses. Each new course brings more demands, and whether you're in the driver's seat view or using the over the shoulder perspective, the sense of speed will knock your Docs off. Also, the season mode really works, so that rain hampers your ability to steer, and racing in snow, well, it's just like racing in snow. It's hard.  Another surprise which we didn't notice in the preview versions manifests itself in the amazing jumps and crash scenarios that will blow you away. End-over-end triple twists and serious airborne flights will take you higher, oh yes.  There are some problems with Top Gear Rally, however, which are a little disappointing. Little things like collision detection that lets two cars melt into one another when they're side by side, though without interfering with the driving. Several times on different courses, we ended up stuck on slanted roadsides (after crashing of course), simply unable to reverse out of our sticky predicaments. Sure we were able to restart, but the point is that Boss's testers should have eliminated any such situations.  There are never more than two opposing cars on the screen at one time, clearly a reason to believe that Boss couldn't figure out a way to program the game to handle any more than that. but in other games, like F1 Pole Position 64, as many as 10 appear all at once with the same amount of slowdown.   The music is simply weak, with the possible exception of the Mountain course, and is as thin and ineffective as music in an 8-bit game when compared to PSX's Final Fantasy VII. We wish there was something about it we liked but there isn't. Sound effects, however, are cool, with crashing  effects and suspension bounces bringing a real feel of driving an off-road racer at 115 MPH.  And then there's the two-player mode, the biggest disappointment. The horizontal split-screen is crowded in by a vertical black bar on the right which both keeps processing time generally at 30 frames per second, but it nearly wipes out your ability to see what's coming up in front of you. The courses, which seemed long before seem even longer here because you're racing against only one other player, and most of the time, you feel as if you're the only one racing at all. Top Gear Rally beats Sega Rally on all other counts. 1. The Road isn't boxed in like in SR and players can drive right off the road into dirt, mud, sand, water, and keep on going. 2. Cars can, like we said, take flight in major crashes, and still land on their wheels ready to race. 3. Cars take damage, which never happened in SR. 4. There are more courses. 5. There are more cars. 6. There are secret passages. 7. And finally, the cars, at least the faster ones, feel better, with a more realistic physics model providing better overall realism. What can we say? -- except that we'll be playing this game for a long time coming. This is pure rally goodness.", "date": "Oct 4, 1997"}
