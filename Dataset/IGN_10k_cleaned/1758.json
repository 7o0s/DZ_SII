For handheld gamers, that's meant a slow but steady trickle of Lynx titles -- some interesting new projects the Lynx never got to see, some rebirths of games never released, and some throwbacks to games the system did well. Remnant: Planar Wars 3D falls into this third category, a space shooter with scaling effects and relentless enemies in mocked-up space combat. It's an Atari game through and through, for better or worse, with gameplay that goes back two decades now to those old pseudo-3D shooters.  Features  Endless supplies of aliens to target and destroy Five kinds of attackers, including UFOs and meteors Monstrous final boss Only for the Atari Lynx   Where Remnant has trouble fitting into the grand scheme of things is that this type of game has been done before, even on the system it's published on, and done better. Turbo Sub and Hydra weren't great flying shooters, but their terrestrial control was worlds tighter than the slow-moving space ship in Remnant. Players will spend too much time fighting the control in Remnant, and that's an unnecessary frustration. If this were for the sake of realism, say to falsify the movement of the ship in 3D space to give players the feeling that they're pilots rather than a free-floating space turret, then it might make sense, but there's no physics or speed governor to make this anything other than an interstellar turkey hunt.   It's at least a challenging fight, as wave upon wave of enemies drift out and challenge your floating craft. The only controls are to re-aim the trigger and fire shots -- evading is simply done by scooting the view screen away from what's being shot at you -- so the arcade gameplay can get pretty fierce. If only the game's programming weren't unfair to players, it could have been an intense experience. But firing attackers usually drift around behind their shots, and the only way to destroy an impending photon torpedo is to shoot down its launcher. Unlike Blue Lightning, where you could shoot down enemy missiles, your ship is defenseless unless you get really lucky on offense. Since the enemies hide behind their shots, and since the control is too sluggish to avoid as it should be in a dogfighting space fighter, there's a lot of unavoidable hits in every fight.  Visually, it's up to average with what the Lynx did with its scaling engine, but at such a slow speed, the slack graphic engine never comes together. Ships start off clunky and scale in to thick pixels without ever really coming into focus. In Blue Lightning, that was never a problem -- fighters zinged by and never said a word bad. But here, there's little more than the gray and dark gray roving blobs of asteroid to hide the engine behind. Ships designs do get much better after the first wave -- the Sleds are sharp as they zip in and out -- but it's nothing the Lynx hadn't seen before in other games, and the gameplay (which is incredibly grueling) doesn't push gamers to go deeper. Old-school blast-a-thons like Remnant are a rarity these days, and unfortunately, Songbird Production's newest Lynx Game (premiered at the Computer Game Expo 2000) is proof of why. While old classics like Star Raiders were winners in their day, times have evolved greatly. Perhaps not all for the better, but a classic throwback has to at least give a reason to return -- intense gameplay or clever challenge. Remnant's simplicity could never be confused for Colony Wars, but if all there's to be had is combat, then that combat engine should whip and ride like a pro. Think of how the classic Atari Star Wars Arcade aspired to a level of excitement beyond the technology. Remnant doesn't need that level of involvement or story, but it's screaming out for that same intense gameplay. Hopefully a sequel could leave this game out with the stardust.", "date": "Feb 2, 2001"}
