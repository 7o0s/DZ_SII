Even if you've never picked up a videogame in your life, not only could you pick out Pac-Man in a blind line-up, you could figure out how to play in literally five seconds. It's the ultimate pick-up-and-play design, and one of the most successful game designs ever created.  Back when we game editors were getting Atari 2600 under our Christmas trees, the one game everyone got in 1981 was the first home conversion of the arcade game. Finally! No more going to the arcades and wasting our hard-earned quarters...we can get the same experience at home. Right? Uhh....  See, all the home conversions of Pac-Man were secured by Atari, and even if the hardware could pull off the game, the company wasn't really set on accuracy. Rather, it just wanted to be known as the company with the rights to Pac-Man. The 2600 version was flat-out awful, but it was the closest we could get at home...until the company put out the Atari 5200 and Atari XL editions. Close, but still not quite the same experience.  So, while we had to put up with substandard ports in the US, Namco brought forth its own arcade conversion on the Famicom system in 1984. And it's clear that the company's focus was on absolute accuracy. This version looked and played as close as you could get without hauling an arcade machine in your house, right down to the speed and behavior of the four different ghosts travelling through the mazes. And now, this version returns in Nintendo's Classic NES Series as one of the first third-party titles in the batch so gamers can see how this home version matched up with the arcade game.  The problem is, of course, that the game is the NES game and not the arcade original...something that has already been converted to the Game Boy Advance in the launch title compilation, Namco Museum.And selling now, new, for a pricetag far cheaper than the single Classic NES Series cartridge. The value just isn't there. And years ago, Namco even upped the ante with Pac-Man on the Game Boy Color with its Pac-Man: Special Color Edition, adding an amazing two player mode where any ghost swallowed on one player's maze will appear on the other player's maze. In the Classic NES Series version, it's just two player alternative, either on one system, or through the link support via cable or Wireless Adapter.  There is one benefit to this edition over the others: since Nintendo includes a cartridge save in all of the Classic NES Series games, players can finally save their high scores for future prosperity. Something the past GBA versions don't do.Yes, you're getting a decent, full-screen version of Pac-Man with the Classic NES Series version. But that's not really all that impressive considering it's already been available on the GBA since the system's launch, and in a package that's a much better value.  If you must get the game to complete the collection, go for it...but the version here doesn't offer anything more than what's already shipped for the system three years ago.", "date": "Jun 4, 2004"}
