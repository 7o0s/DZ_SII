The British victory in the air eventually forced Hitler to abandon his plans to invade England. The Battle of Britain has always held a fascination for sim fans. For some it's the context of the fight; for others it's the machines. No matter what the attraction, there's no denying that the Battle over the skies of England serves as a fantastic setting for a flight simulation. Shockwave Productions, creators of the popular Firepower mod, have opted to remake the original game, bringing it up to date in terms of graphics and technology. While Battle of Britain II can be considered a sequel, fans of the first game will find themselves in very familiar territory here.   To begin, there's no change to the plane list for this remake. Sim junkies will still get to try their hand at the heavy players of the Battle of Britain. The nimble (and oh so twitchy) Spitfire and the robust, heavy punching Hurricane are available on the RAF side. Flying for the Luftwaffe, players will have the opportunity to get into the cockpit of the Me-109, the Bf100 and the dive-bombing menace known as the Ju-87 Stuka.  The plane modeling is great. Though I've obviously never flown any of the planes in this game, they all exhibit the characteristics they're known for. The Hurricane isn't quite as maneuverable as the Spitfire for instance, but it makes a much more stable gun platform. The British planes also have gravity-fed carburetors that tend to conk out when pulling negative Gs. The Me-109's narrow landing carriage makes for some very spotty landings. All the planes' performances are detailed in a very extensive series of charts and tables in the manual.  AI is relatively good all around and can be scaled to fit your challenge level. Enemy pilots tend to react a little slowly sometimes but they seem to have a good overall concept of energy management and make smart decisions when it comes to trading speed and altitude back and forth. The German bombers' tendency to stick in formation even as they're being chewed up may seem hardheaded to some but it represents historical tactics.  An instant action mode lets you jump into any number of training missions or combats. A variety of parameters let you set up (almost) exactly the encounter you want. Numerous historical missions where the skies are filled with planes are also available. Sadly, the multiplayer functionality from the original game has been completely stripped away here making Battle of Britain II a solo affair.  While there's a lot of focus is on the flying, the real meat of the game is the strategic campaign. Here, you're placed in the shoes of Dowding or Goering and tasked with either fighting off the waves of Nazi bombers or of crushing RAF Fighter Command into the dust. To be honest, neither is an easy proposition so the challenge level will be high no matter which side of the Channel you're sitting on.  The strategic game models all sorts of amazing factors as the days wear on. Pilots who have to ditch over the Destruction of enemy staff buildings results in a slower response to attacks. Destruction of factories means fewer planes will be entering service. I myself made a fatal error as the head of the Luftwaffe during one campaign; I spent all my resources attacking airfields but this left the British factories and radar posts intact. With those two areas of their infrastructure largely undamaged, the Brits could almost always put more planes in the air wherever I happened to attack. Finding the right balance of targets is a tricky proposition.      On the British side you have to worry about which targets you should best defend. Let your radar posts fall and you'll have to rely on ground observers and will have less time to react to enemy incursions.  Focus on protecting your radar posts and the enemy might just take out your factories, leaving you with little chance to intercept the raids you pick up. You'll also need to debate the wisdom of putting your planes near the coast. They'll be more vulnerable there but they'll also be able to intercept raids before they can do much damage.  The interface for the strategic game is as good as it ever was. Players will be able to allocate planes and targets with the click of a few buttons. It's especially easy if you just put together the raids you want and let the AI suggest potential targets. Even with the AI handling this aspect of the game, you'll still be in charge of numerous tactical decisions -- whether or not fighter escort stick with the bombers or fly ahead; whether or not fighters will strafe targets of opportunity; whether or not bombers will plan to hit secondary targets or fly at high or low altitudes. The list of options is pretty exhaustive.   As the planes reach their targets or encounter enemy opposition you'll be prompted to jump into the cockpit and experience the action firsthand. You can choose from any of the planes involved on the mission and even take a seat as a gunner on one of the larger German bombers. Jumping in and out of the action like this allows for a nice change of pace between the map and the cockpit. One real problem with this approach however  is that you never really feel attached to your pilots. Having a dedicated career mode where players are responsible for just one pilot throughout the course of the Battle would really help to increase immersion.  On the subject of immersion, it's sometimes hard for a single pilot to make much of a difference given the size of the combats here. Sure, the vast flotillas of bombers and huge furballs of fighters is a huge part of what defines the Battle of Britain experience, but it means that the player's sense of value is going to be minimized. Being just one plane out of 300 involved in a given combat doesn't really give you the opportunity to feel like you can really make a difference.  The massive flotillas can also cause serious problems for even high-level machines. The off-the-shelf version of Battle of Britain II runs like crap. You can tweak all sorts of settings to get a playable frame rate but even the most drastic compromises aren't likely to lead to smooth performance. You can tell from the screens in our media section that we're not running the game with all the bells and whistles (the weather effects are particularly nasty) simply because we wanted to enjoy the game without constant hiccups.  Some of the stuttering performance problems and the occasional crashes have definitely been smoothed out by the latest patch but Battle of Britain II is still a real resource hog. Even if you do manage to get the patch, you're not advised to even consider this game if your machine only meets the recommended requirements. We're running well above the specs on the box and still having to turn of numerous graphical effects just to stay within the 20-30 fps range.  Nevertheless, Battle of Britain does look good. Stack it up against the latest from 1C and you'll find that it holds its own. The plane models are just as detailed with loads of effective weathering. Chipped paint, powder burn, grease stains make each plane look more like a real artifact than a computer model. The cockpits are even better. All the instruments and switches work and can even be controlled by the mouse.      Sadly, the damage effects aren't great. Bullet holes are simple decals that are repeated over large sections. Also, the planes tend to fall apart the same way under enemy fire. If an older game like Fighter Ace can include numerous damage points, there's no reason why the planes in Battle of Britain II all have to fall apart exactly the same way. To be fair, there are tons of great new particle effects that really enhance the smoke and flames trailing from a damaged enemy but you'll definitely start to get bored waiting for the Dornier's wing to break off at exactly the same spot.  Finally, the sounds in Battle of Britain II are quite good. The wind buffets are a great little cue that you're pushing your airframe to its limits while the sounds of engines racing by your cockpit let you know that you're not alone up there in the skies. Weapon sounds are a bit less effective. They sound appropriate enough but they lack the weight of the wind and engine sounds.   Battle of Britain II offers up several lines of radio chatter. Nearly every aspect of the game has some sort of associated comment. While it's nice in the case of occasional cues, like you're falling out of formation, for more frequent events, say blowing up an enemy bomber, the responses can become repetitive. With so few sim titles on the market, you have to take what you can get, particularly so if you're interested in a particular theater. On that count, Battle of Britain II is a sure bet for sim fans looking to take part in the epic struggle that may very well have ensured Nazi Germany's defeat in World War 2. The context for the battles provides a wonderful sense of drama and the planes that were involved have an attraction all their own.Still, there are plenty of shortcomings that are bound to frustrate even the most die-hard sim fan. Many of the worst technical issues have been addressed in the recent patch but stability and performance still seem to be a bit of a problem. The dynamic strategic campaign is simply brilliant but the lack of a developing career mode keeps you from becoming too invested in the actual aerial action.", "date": "Nov 28, 2005"}
