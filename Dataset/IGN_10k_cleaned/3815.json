At the time, the Shrek branding was being tarnished with downright awful games, from the Xbox adventure to the absolutely terrible GBA racer Shrek Swamp Kart Speedway, but Hassle in the Castle turned out surprisingly well as a unique and fun platformer based upon the movie's storyline. There was certainly room for improvement, but the foundation was solid; and we were certainly looking to see if the game design would improve in the announced sequel, Shrek: Reekin' Havoc. But while the graphic and gameplay style remained the same in this follow-up, the game design actually takes a turn for the worse with more redundant level designs and the removal of elements that gave the original game more variety. Reekin' Havoc is still an OK romp, but it's definitely not as impressive as its origin. Features Six levels Play as Shrek or Fiona Cartridge save (three slots) Only for Game Boy Advance   Last years Shrek: Hassle in the Castle was based entirely on situations in the Dreamworks motion picture; but for Shrek: Reekin Havoc, the development team had to create its own story and situations. This works a bit against the designers since their original ideas don't come out nearly as good as the ideas based upon the situations from the film. In Reekin' Havoc, the ghost of Lord Faarquad (he was eaten by a dragon, remember?) is possessing the Fairy Tale creatures, and it's up to Shrek and Princess Fiona to defeat these possessed forest inhabitants and defeat Faarquad's ghost. Curiously, it's never explained why Fiona's back to her human form when she was permanently changed to an ogre at the end of the film (and still in this form during the game's sprite-based introduction).   The game design is nearly identical in gameplay to Hassle in the Castle, which means players simply move in a side-scrolling environment and attack any enemy that comes into punching or kicking reach. Like last year's game, the combat engine is quite solid, which means very satisfying collision detection in its combo-linking attacks. In Reekin' Havoc, players switch from playing as Fiona to Shrek depending on which of the six levels they're in; players can't choose who they want to play as, and the game never tells the player why they're playing as Shrek or Fiona at that particular level. What's more, the two characters are virtually identical in abilities, so the change in character is simply arbitrary.  At first look, Reekin' Havoc appears nearly identical in style to Hassle in the Castle, since the development team didn't change the big-headed graphic style. And there's actually nothing wrong with it; the superdeformed style gives the designers a bit of freedom to create sprites without worry that they're not spot-on with the model used in the movie. But looks aside, Reekin' Havoc doesn't play quite as well as Hassle due to the new level designs. In Hassle, challenges were spread across many different point A to B level layouts. In Reekin' Havoc, there are only six levels, but they're spread out in a branching ~dungeon-esque~ layout. These level layouts are a bit too large and artificially extensive; the designers wanted to give the new game more of an ~exploration~ feel with its ~search and collect~ design elements, but the original Hassle game design got the action down pretty well. Reekin' Havoc just isn't quite as fun to play.  But the designers also yanked out other things from the Hassle in the Castle design. We can understand why the designers omitted the intermission mini-games from the original game, since they didn't offer much gameplay challenge and were in there only for story continuity's sake. But we can't understand why the developers didn't offer another single-cartridge multiplayer game to follow up the option the team introduced in Hassle. It was a fun little game, and it added additional replay for folks who have finished the entire adventure. It's sorely missing in Reekin' Havoc, especially since this sequel doesn't have a whole lot of variety in its design. At least the developers increase the gameplay with a scoring system offered at the end of each level; players will definitely want to best their scores and record them to cartridge on the next time through. Even if Tose kept Reekin' Havoc's game design pretty much spot on with the original Hassle in the Castle, I'd probably be more enthusiastic about its review. But the team changed the design, mostly for the worse; sure, the action remains fun and challenging thanks to a solid combat engine, but the level layouts are far more cluttered, and seem to go on for longer than they should. And there's only six different areas; Hassle in the Castle was already pretty short, but this one seems even moreso. Add to that the lack of the multiplayer gaming that was offered in last year's game, and you've got a sequel that's significantly inferior to its original. It's still a fun GBA game, but if you haven't Shrek'ed out on the GBA yet, get Hassle in the Castle.", "date": "Aug 4, 2003"}
