Majesco has released a color rendition of Monopoly for the Game Boy Color. And even though it has a few obvious limitations, this version of the popular board game is a good departure, and good practice for those who want to bone up on the real thing (the board game, not a real-life real estate monopoly). Features Game Boy Color version of the popular board game Computer AI for solitaire matches For one to four players For Game Boy or Game Boy Color   If you have no idea what Monopoly is, stop reading this review now. That's right,click the close button, turn off your computer, head out to the toy store, and pick up a set. Every household should have an edition of the game, and if you don't you're absolutely depriving yourself of a life pasttime. So don't come back to this review until you've played a few games of the real thing  you owe it to yourself.  Everyone else still there? Good. Monopoly on the Game Boy Color does everything in its power to bring the game home  in all honesty there's not much the developer could do differently to make the game better to play. You've got the board that spans the border of the Game Boy Color screen  each tile is represented by the color strip of the property, or an icon for the railroad, chance, community chest and the other stray spaces. When you roll the dice (represented by a shaking hand that holds onto the dice until you release the button), the camera zooms in on the particular place on the board to show you what it is. The graphics are limited by the resolution of the Game Boy screen, but since you've played the game before in its original format, you know exactly where you're landing.  One of my biggest beefs with the Game Boy rendition is the fact that you have to play by its rules. I don't know anyone who plays Monopoly by the original rules. If you land on an available property space, you have to buy the property or it gets auctioned off. Most house rules by pass this rule, but in the Game Boy version, you have to go to the auction house. You can make this work to your advantage, since you can see exactly how much your computer opponent has  -- if he only has 50 bucks in the bank, and you land on Boardwalk (a $350 property), you can refuse to buy the property and put in on the block. This way, you can get the property for a little more than 50 bucks.  The AI of the computer opponents is rather good. When you want to trade for properties, it'll know what's a good deal and what's not...and what deals are worth the risk. And unlike a few computer versions of Monopoly, the Game Boy computer player doesn't accept dinky offers for expensive properties.  You can play this game with multiple players, but since you have to do that huddled over the same system it's not really worth it as a multiplayer game. Play the game on a real board if you really want to play your buddies. This is good for a solitaire game, but put it away if your friend wants to play and crack out the Monopoly board.  The Game Boy Color Monopoly is simply a colorized version of the Milton Bradley game  released on the Game Boy almost a decade ago. It still holds up well. I wish the interface in terms of trading items was a little cleaner, but since Monopoly is such a complex board game, there's not much you can do on the little screen to make it easier. As a portable rendition, Game Boy Color Monopoly is good fun. But like I said in this review many times  play the board game. It's more social.", "date": "Oct 13, 1999"}
