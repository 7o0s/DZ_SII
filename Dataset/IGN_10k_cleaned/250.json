{"name": "Pandora's Box", "name_review": "Pandora's Box", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/09/24/pandoras-box", "text": "Like Allen Ginsberg, I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by Solitaire, starving in frustration, clicking, never realizing that an hour and a half had passed and they had completely missed the train to work. You've seen it happen  a friend, family member or sibling purchases a new computer, and sooner or later they discover the game folder, and the sinister, oh-so-clickable icon for on of the most time-consuming games of all time.   Pandora's Box has been painstakingly crafted from the same pixels as Solitaire, and it comes across almost as well.  The designer of Tetris, Alexey Pajitnov, has designed PB to be a much, much different sort of puzzle game. Ten different puzzles take basic puzzle concepts and give them computer-only twists, such as Overlap, a visual puzzle which plays like a jigsaw puzzle, but with pieces that overlap one another. Focus point has you flipping pieces of a picture back and forth in an odd-shaped grid, in order to form a coherent picture, while Outer Layer has simple square blocks to place, but a 3D image to put them on.  The game allows you to solve every puzzle in the game individually, or play through the story mode, which involves, surprisingly enough, Pandora's Box. Seven tricksters have escaped, and it's your job to explore the world looking for a variety of objects in order to capture them and place them back in the box. As you begin your search for one of the tricksters (there are seven in all, including Eris, Puck, Maui, Monkey and Anansi) you'll have the option to pick one of a few cities around the world, and select from 10 puzzles in each city, one of which holds one of the four pieces you need to find to capture the historical prankster. Certain puzzles will give you bonus hints or free puzzle tokens, which will automatically solve an extra-hard puzzle or place a piece you're confused about. Once you've found the four objects on a side of the box (which, depending on how lucky you are in finding the special object, could take up to 40 games), you then get a ~boss~ puzzle, an extra difficult version of one of the ten puzzles. For Maui, this means having to piece together a lot of very, very similar fish in a very similar looking blue ocean. Frustrating fun, like any good visual puzzle.  Bill Gates Has Approved These Graphics  The graphics are clean, crisp, and very nice on the eyes, especially seeing as how you'll be staring at the menus for hours at a time. Bill Gates owns the digital rights to nearly every piece of major art on the planet, which, though horrifying, does make for some pretty pictures in the game. The game allows you to travel everywhere from Machu Picchu and Istanbul to Kyoto and Philadelphia, each with an individual representation of its art, architecture, and sculpture and used in its game. The variety is a welcome relief from most puzzle games, which are content to throw you variations of the same color scheme  though Rio de Janiero is represented as a party town rowdy enough to rival Animal House, since every piece of art concerns itself with Carnival. The 3D puzzles look nice, and the animations concerning Pandora's Box are brief, but very cool. Except for that, like Stephen said, Pandora's box was actually a vase  but who are we to argue?  Each trickster has a story to go with it, told in a robust style similar to that which you would hear during story hour at the library, and it gives a quick summary of each character's place in mythology, and history. It's a nice touch, especially paired with the simple but nice box animations, which give you the satisfaction of knowing that you've captured another pleasant maker of mischief. But the music  the muzak! Thank god you can turn it off. Unless you find the chimes and delicate piano keys of Yanni something close to a 24 hour rockathon, you'll quickly tire of elegant flutes and lacing guitar turned to ~non-offensive~ on the dial. I'm sure Microsoft didn't make the music for people like me, but since this is my review, this is my turf, and anything's fair play. In the game's defense though, the clicking noises are some of the most satisfying clicks I've heard in a long time.  The Puzzles  Any game is only good as the sum of its parts, and Pandora's Box is no different  in fact, it relies on the sum to survive. For the most part, the game supplies some intriguing new deviations from the classic puzzles you're familiar with, but a couple in particular not only add nothing new to the genre, but actually take away from the gameplay. Rather than review them as a whole, I've decided to give you the rundown on each puzzle individually:   Overlap: Tile-based pieces of a picture must be placed together and overlapped to finish the puzzle. Though rarely frustrating, Overlap provides some challenge, and the same fun gameplay as a real puzzle, with a computer twist. Unfortunately, the pieces are much too large, and you'll have to play for quite a while (or just access the later puzzles in puzzle mode) to play some of the more challenging creations.  Rotascope: Like those square moving tiles puzzle you used to play in school where you put the numbers in order, or completed a picture, but with the added catch that this is a circular puzzle that you must put together to create a complete photo. Not only do you have to figure out how to place the pieces, but you need to figure out what pieces go where. Resolution, fortunately, is a perfect clue. If it's fuzzy, than it's wrong. If everything's fuzzy, then you should probably think about purchasing some glasses. I could play this forever, and at times, I did.  Outer Layer: Another personal favorite of mine, especially when you get later in the game and have to place texture blocks on real objects like butterflies and fish. A variety of objects need texture, from vases and headdresses to chariots and Toucans, and as the game progresses, the amount of textures needed to complete the puzzle (as well as the size) diminishes. Unfortunately, you can't rotate the object any way you'd like  you can only turn it 90 degrees, which makes for some frustrating scenarios, especially when you're trying to get a better look at a dark corner of the object. No 3D support as well? Sad. This program is meant for mainstream, casual gamers, but accelerated support would have been a welcome bonus.  Lens Bender: This puzzle doesn't appear until very late in the story game, and for good reason. It's almost too complicated to explain without actually demonstrating it personally to you (which I will, for air and hotel money). A piece of an unfinished picture lies in the middle, and it's your job to use the distorted pictures in the magnifying lenses around the picture to put it together. It involves a lot of peering very, very closely at the screen, and a lot of trial and error. Sometimes it works like a charm, and other time you can finish a puzzle through some monotonous trial and error.  Focus Point: Mmm... Focus Point. Swap the pictures around the different rectangular shapes in a grid to complete a puzzle. It's simple to play  but deviously challenging, and had me glassy-eyed and clicking forever, to the point where my coworkers had to physically pull me from the keyboard.  Find and Fill: This plays like a picture-based version of a word find puzzle, with the outlines of characters from a photo or painting jumbled together, for you to color in and separate. Once you get the hang of it, the game works very well. I only wish that you could get a closer look at the painting that you're working from (it's represented as a thumbnail sized photograph).   Jesse's Strips: You must use a series of strips to finish a piece of artwork, with a variety of the strips placed on different ~trays,~ to help you organize what goes where. It plays very similar to Overlap, with individual pieces also able to overlap one another. This plays the most like a traditional puzzle game. I liked this game, but felt like it didn't really add anything new to the PB repertoire.  Image Hole: The worst, most bad, not even close to good puzzle. Moving holes shaped like objects in the picture underneath bounce around the screen, and it's your job to guide them to the correct object. Most of the time this mean using the largest hole to scour out every object, and then committing yourself to the tedious task of placing the smaller objects. Ug. Not in the least bit entertaining.  Interlock: Take a look at the screenshot. Look familiar? Yes, it's just like all those puzzles you've seen at the gaming store, only with a pretty picture underneath. Fun to play, but an odd choice for the game, since it's not in the least original.  Slices: Like a 3D building kit, Slices let's you put together famous object like the Sphinx and Shakespeare's bust, which have been sliced into pieces, Wonder Bread style. These aren't the most challenging puzzles, but they are the prettiest visually, and provide a good sugar rush between the other, more elaborate puzzles.   The Puzzle Mantra  Like Stephen mentioned in his preview, the one major drawback to Pandora's Box is the lack of rising challenge as you progress through different challenges  your third trickster feels just like your first, with the exception of the more difficult puzzles, such as Lens Bender, that are introduced in later ~levels.~ As you progress farther into the game though, you get the feeling that that was exactly how the ~still not intercapped~ Microsoft planned it. The game is a glorified, glamorized retelling of the Solitaire tale, and it works almost as well. Though some of the weaker puzzles snap you out of your clicking mantra, for the most part, Pandora's Box does a successful job of giving you a great challenge without ever quite frustrating you. Unfortunately, through all the steady gameplay, the worst aspect is that it actually has to end  something inevitable for most games, but something that could have been avoided in PB. The game provides a massive amount of puzzles, but without the ability to customize or change the skill level in any way. An individual puzzle can't be reconfigured for different difficulty levels, or scrambled up  in other words, after you've played a specific puzzle once or twice, every time you go back it stays identical, up to the actually initial placement of the pieces. Since good puzzle games, specifically computer-based puzzle games, are based on replayability, the lack of options makes for an abrupt end to a game that could have possible had infinite variations. Still, 350 puzzles make for some elaborate gaming, and Microsoft has done a great job of providing a variety of pictures, objects, and skill levels to keep you interested.  It's easy to see a grandmother wasting half a day on this instead of spending her valuable time watching daytime television, or a cube-prisoner wasting precious office hours on some of the meatier puzzles. Which is exactly what Microsoft wants. Though this may not have the addictive quality of a Tetris, or even a Solitaire, it will certainly push that same drool-inducing pleasure center enough to warrant a purchase. I do have to add though, that this doesn't actually come with Pandora's Box. I own the only version of that, and last time I opened it, other than thousands of horrifying screams and a wave of demonic energy that busted through the windows of my house, it was completely empty. Worst $666.66 I've ever spent.  -- Vincent Lopez", "date": "Sep 24, 1999"}
