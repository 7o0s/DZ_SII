{"name": "Platoon: The 1st Airborne Cavalry Division in Vietnam", "name_review": "Platoon", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/12/19/platoon", "text": "Vietnam was a war that most people would like to forget. Lucky we have movies and videogames to remind us that we as a country can make mistakes and suffer for them. While it's not exactly what I had in mind, Digital Reality's new Platoon sure as hell reminds us what kind of a crap war we were in and just how much reliving the experience can make us suffer, but for all the wrong reasons. Platoon isn't a terrible idea, its just executed so poorly that I actually hit my desk so hard enough in frustration to hurt myself fairly badly yesterday making it hard to type for the rest of work. We'll call it a war wound. Really, I think I deserve some kind of medal for having to play this latest entry into the bloated RTS market.   Platoon is loosely, and I mean loosely, based off of the 1986 Oliver Stone movie about the craziness of the Vietnam War. It was a very good movie. The game didn't follow the movie. It did however loosely follow some of the campaigns run during the war as you trail along and participate in the exploits of Sgt. Lionsdale, a new kid on the block that is getting ready for his first real action. There really isn't much of a story here with the only coherence being journal entries that Lionsdale has made. These can be read before entering each mission and provide an inkling into his life at home and the upcoming mission. It could have been a pretty nice and personal touch if the entries didn't read like they were written by a robot in search of a personality. I mean, who writes in a journal like that? Where's the cussing? Where're the crazy stories about your squad? Where're random observations? Who would be so damn boring and proper when writing a journal in the middle of Vietnam? The presentation in this game is devoid of personality. At least the menu screen was a little creative with a view through the eyes of a lookout in an Army camp.   The look of the game fared significantly better than the level of presentation. While the models themselves weren't incredibly detailed, they were animated well and looked good enough. Lush greens of the jungles and rice paddies and other types of terrain were done amazingly well. At least as amazing as I can imagine from what I've seen from news programs and movies, considering I've never actually been to Vietnam. It certainly gave the impression that bad guys could jump out of a bush at anytime.   Which is part of the problem. The enemies really did jump out of the bush at anytime, usually without any warning. The reason this is a problem is because your units apparently don't give a crap about living anymore after so much time in the war. They'll just sit there and be shot at if you don't give them direct orders to fight back. The only reason I can see that this could have been seen as a good idea was to the units wouldn't go running into the bush trying to find enemies or turn to fight enemies in a new direction in the middle of another firefight. Why not have a hold fire option or an aggressiveness option? I don't understand this choice considering all of the better options available. I know Digital Reality has made RTSs before, how is it they didn't know this? Bad form.   I'm pretty sure if someone was firing at me, I would at least turn to see what was going on. If enemy units pop up behind your squad, forget about it. They aren't even going to turn around to take a look. They'll just sit there complaining, ~we're taking enemy fire!~ Then do something about it you assholes! Crimeny... deep breaths... calm....   The only thing that even remotely saves this idiocy is the pause and command feature. Everytime you see a yellow icon appear in the top left corner of the screen you immediately hit the pause button. Every time that you hear your units saying they're taking fire, you hit the pause button. Unfortunately, you can't be fast enough every time and your units will end up taking more damage than you can afford.     Losing units in these missions can be downright disastrous given the difficulty level. Especially considering that there is no mid-mission save. I'm not sure how many times I've had to say this over the years I've been working here. Don't leave out the mid-mission saves in RTS games! Completing parts of this game are hard enough as they are. Having to begin again and redo an entire mission from the start can make a person more than a little pissy. Especially when one little mistake can cause such an occurance. Hey, but at least they made the levels uninteresting enough that you'll know where the enemies are coming from and where they're going to be after a few runs through. Too bad that really just makes it boring. Especially when there's so few occasions to actually put your brain to work to make some creative tactical decisions. Mostly, you'll just find yourself running from heavy cover to heavy cover in order to minimize the inevitable damage your units will receive.   Which strangely is one of the strong points in the game. The terrain, aside from looking good, all is assigned different levels of visibility and cover. So jungle will defend your units better than elephant grass, which is better than an open road. Sadly, your units and the enemy units, when provided with a situation where they are right next to cover, won't move towards it. Often the enemy units would just stand in a road, which actually gives minus defense points, and be fired at from a dense forest which is the heaviest natural protection you can get. They won't even drop down into the prone position to give themselves a fighting chance. Why they didn't take the good terrain idea and actually work with it is beyond me. Imagine the units diving behind trees or into scrub when getting shot at. Hell, just imagine them having some sort of desire to live; I'll even go for that.   Units in the game can range from the normal rifleman squad, which annoyingly enough come in a connected group that have to be ordered together (forget about flanking or maneuvering in combat), to specialist and hero units. Hero units are faster, have more hitpoints and are generally better shots than the rest of your troops. If they die, it also means your mission has failed. You'll also have one of those specialists in your group like an M-60 gunner, medic or engineer. These guys very useful to your group, but lag hardcore when it comes to movement. Let's take the M-60 gunner for an example. When you order your units to walk along, he'll lag waaay behind the group and have to catch up meaning that if you run into trouble, you'll be without your most powerful weapon in a surprise fight. Now again, I wasn't there, and I've never been in the armed forces, but I'm pretty sure these squads (with the exception of a scout unit) would stick together and walk at the same speed. Now if this guy just ran slower than the rest of the squad, I could understand, but this is just stupid. The same thing goes for the engineer. He's also slower which can be insanely annoying when you're both looking for mines and trying to protect your engineer so that he can look for mines. Advance in a group and your riflemen will walk ahead and blow themselves up. Use your engineer on his own and he'll be all by his lonesome when he gets attacked by a group of enemies.    What did you think of Platoon? Finally, what's up with the explosive weapons in the game? Why do they suck so horribly bad? Hitting a soldier in the chest with a grenade isn't going to kill him? How about a group with a mortar? Does that not do a significant amount of damage? I was pretty sure it would until they got up and kept running. Gargh!!!!I should stop writing about this because it's making me angry thinking of it and I don't want to go into my holiday vacation angry. So I'll end this simply. While the Vietnam War is an interesting subject no matter how it fared for our country, this game is not an interesting subject. Frankly, I'm surprised I managed to write this much without punching my computer screen. Half of my frustration stems from the fact that I can imagine a ton of ways this could have been a really good game. I'd love to recommend another good squad based RTS set in Vietnam, but there isn't one. If you're looking for something akin to this, you could try out Soldiers of Anarchy, which is great except for the pathfinding (which you can pray they fix) or even go back to the good old days and pick up one of the Myth series or even Commandos 2. But don't waste you're money here.", "date": "Dec 19, 2002"}
