Whether it's substantial enough to warrant its own Game Boy Advance cart is up for debate. For those unfamiliar with the classic card game, it involves distributing a deck made up of cards that each have a number and a color. A card is placed in the middle of the table, and players take turns covering the top card is with one of their own, matching either the color or the number. The idea is to get rid of all one's cards before the other players. Anytime a card can't be placed, more must be drawn and there are loads of special cards that speed up the process or punish the other players. When players get down to just one card, they must shout ~Uno!~ or else take two additional cards for their silence.    Uno 52 is a variation of that game where the deck is made up of 52 standard playing cards (deuce to ace), split into four colors instead of four suits. Essentially, players are enjoying Uno and Poker simultaneously, by alternately getting rid of cards in the center of the table (Uno) and swapping them out in a 5-card hand off to the side (poker). At the end of each hand, both the player without any cards left and the player with the best poker hand share the winnings.    And that's pretty much it, which is the only real disappointment with the game: the lack of additional modes and gameplay variations. DSI and Black Lantern have also released Uno/Skip-Bo and Uno Freefall on the Game Boy Advance, each on their own cart. It's a shame that these games are being marketted separately, instead of as one larger Uno package. The games although fun on their own are all pretty shallow, so a compilation release would have helped increase the value and made them a pretty essential buy. On its own, Uno 52 is a very polished effort that will appeal only to fans of Uno 52.    In terms of graphics, presentation and options, the developers did a top notch job. Menus are incredibly easy to navigate through and look fantastic. There are a ton of options available in regard to how many players, how many game-controlled players, music, avatars, names, backgrounds, difficulty, game length, music/effects volume and a robust help section that describes the rules and controls very clearly. They even include a tutorial on which poker hands beat which, something often lacking from even the best poker video games out there. Nobody playing this game will ever be lost or confused, and the developers have to be commended for covering absolutely every single base in regard to options, information and minor customization.       One thing the developers did miss an opportunity with is the betting. The game features a very nice chip system, but it's completely automated so players can never raise or lower their bet per hand. Players bet a single chip with each hand, and the first player to dump their cards gets ten chips while the player with the best poker hand (who can be the same player) gets five chips. I'm not sure if adjustable bets would have been against the traditional Uno 52 rules, but it would have added to the strategy and risk of the game. As it stands now, the betting is barely noticeable and players will probably just ignore it.    Up to four players can play the game, filling up the remaining slots with game-controlled opponents or leaving them empty. The catch though is that all four players have to use the same Game Boy Advance, passing it around between turns. This actually works a lot better than one might think, since Uno is a pretty slow game and involves a lot of waiting and very little momentary strategy. The only problem is it pretty much removes the risk of having to belt out ~Uno!~ in time, as players can hold onto the system as long as they want before passing it to the next player. Still, a couple of kids in the backseat on a long trip could do a lot worse for handheld multiplayer fun.Uno 52 is an enjoyable little game and the developers have done a fantastic job polishing the menus and visuals for this version. It's just surprising how shallow the game is. At $15 or less, it's worth picking up for fans of Uno or the 52 variation. Just know that you're getting nothing beyond that core game.", "date": "Nov 22, 2006"}
