Practically everything scheduled to come down the pipe on the PC side of things has been unceremoniously cancelled and a slew of titles on the console side seem to feloniously blow goats. Why is it that when given killer licenses even the mightiest of development teams falter when it comes to transmogrifying beloved and cherished bastions of goodness and courage to the realm of gaming, a place where they should, by all respects be welcomed and uninhibited?   All of us, from our youths onward have delighted at the prospect of being able to bust through walls as Superman, skulk around as Batman, or even defy the laws of physics as Spider-Man only to be dashed time and again by the likes of N64 Superman and PSOne Spawn and Batman Beyond. Sure, quality titles few and far between have broken the mold and delivered something spectacular (the Marvel series of 2D fighting games brilliantly done by Capcom come to mind), but for the most part, the gaming world has suffered a terrible, less than heroic fate when it comes to enjoyably portraying those we wish and dream to be.   Fear not fellow daydreamer, there is light at the end of the proverbial tunnel, a silver lining in the proverbial cloud, cheese for the proverbial macaroni. Titles the likes of Freedom Force, and Batman Vengeance show a lot of early promise and strive at obtaining the goal of cool superhero game. But, they're all coming later on... What do we have to chew on now? Spider-Man! But it's more of a chew the fat than swallow the bacon kind of thing (you're not the only one who has absolutely no idea about what that saying means).   Possibly superest to me among all superheroes is Spidey; everyone's favorite wall crawling, nerd bit by a radioactive spider, crime fighting, wise cracking, villain stomper. It's no wonder then that I awaited his PC arrival with somewhat bated breath (I had already purchased and blazed through the Dreamcast version). Too bad this game pretty much sucks. It's Spider-Man sure enough, the only superhero of relevance who, when not adorning his costume, has to go to school and live with his aunt, but the game just falls so far short in so many respects that I honestly can't, in good conscious, recommend it to anyone but the most die-hard of die-hard Spidey or PC platformer fans, and even then these people must be able to contend with said faults.  Story-wise, Spider-man, in what has come to be classic Spidey shtick, is being framed for a bank robbery he did not commit. Too bad for the wall-crawler, in dealing with this unfortunate circumstance he also finds himself contending with an overzealous police force, and an onslaught of baddies from goons scraped straight off the bottom of the barrel, such as Scorpion, all the way to arch nemeses Venom and Doctor Octopus.  The story is furthered along through brief cutscenes delivered at the beginning of every level. Cutscenes that are equivalent to quality found in the pre Ultima VII era of gaming. I'm talking the first load of crap that came on CD-ROM and even twenty diskettes looked better than this. The models appear to be slightly touched up or even nearly indistinguishable versions of the in-game models themselves, only in a low-res Internet Porn fashion gone fullscreen. Thankfully the voice acting accompanying this is, for the style, well done and accurately delivered. This Spider-Man is an honest to goodness legitimate portrayal of a character botched by practically all others (don't even get me started on the Fox cartoon). It's not that he sounds completely different from the other actors whom have taken on the role (in fact it could very well be the same guys for all I know or care), it's just the way in which the lines are delivered, in this case good and never annoying.  In fact, the game's entire compilation of sound and music is both pleasing and/or normal. Never annoying equals good, is what I always say. In fact, I actually like the campy soundtrack and cheese-ball Stan Lee commentary found throughout, regardless of the fact that it brings back painful memories of the short-lived Hulk and Fantastic Four cartoons of late (they would make a skunk's eye's water). Adding a lighthearted substance and feel to the title that furthers its design and general basis, is both the intended and delivered purpose of the combined sound and music assortment. Not too shabby; probably one of the highlights of the title.  Graphically sub par to say the least, Spider-Man is not nearly on the same playing field as pretty much any credible 3D title on the PC within at least the last year or two. It has the distinct ~I've been ported from a Dreamcast port of a sorry looking, dated Play Station game.~ There's also the whole fog thing that has engulfed the entire lower half of New York City as well as limiting your field of vision to only the most nearby buildings. Of course, easily written off by way of the classic, ~our game engine doesn't do that so let's make up a fictional excuse for it~ excuse (some bad toxic fog has been released).  Characters are all blocky, textures are drab to acceptable, and the thing runs surprisingly poorly on even reasonably high-end machines (PIII 600 and a GeForce 3). Why even some kind of an overhaul, however miniscule was not done is beyond me. The PC has so much potential for scalability, but it seems as though the title is content with being a direct port of the Dreamcast version with only the added options for higher resolutions and color depths. Some gnawing problems also exist with the fundamentals of the game's aesthetics untouched in the porting. Animations, for instance, are sometimes stiff and feature poorly done transitions, a terrible, terrible thing for a character whose entire allure revolves around his nimble nature.  Gameplay is where the game really starts to light up your life. Oh wait, did I say light up your life? I meant not light up your life, more specifically darken your life. Really, really darken like a big old darkening thing. Not so much because it's the most God awful atrociously playing thing under the sun, but more because the sloppy delivery across various gameplay departments hampers what had the potential to be an otherwise astounding product.  First and foremost, I simply have no tolerance for improper camera implementation, and believe you me, Spider-Man has some of the worst camera problems in all of gaming. It's both frustrating, confounding, dumbfounding, and generally asstastic. Do you like being mauled and teased by a Himalayan Yeti or an Australian Yowie? Well, then you'll like dealing with Spider-Man's horrendous camera system, because both are terrible, terrible things. The camera system has the innate ability to zoom, crunch, and wildly swing on the player with even the most gentle of movements; add to that the fact that it will completely and constantly flip the control when navigating walls and ceilings (up goes left, down goes up -just plain lame).  If you can get past the lacking camera, you'll find an equally annoying control setup. Spider-Man has plenty of moves, sure enough (impact webbing, the web dome, web spikes, web entangle, kick, punch, web draw, etc.) though the exclusion of any and all kinds of ground based acrobatics such as somersaults and cartwheels is unacceptable. Unfortunately, aligning your hero at a villain, or worse yet, multiple villains, is another bout in frustration as control is more of a segmented, incremental affair, then a flowing movement; that is, hit left and he moves a whole lot to the left. There is auto-aiming to compensate, but that only takes it so far.  The combination of both camera, and control problems wouldn't be so bad had the levels been designed to accommodate them, but the majority of the game consists of relatively tight areas. The fighting off of lizard henchmen atop a moving subway train and practically all of the boss encounters are the most prevalent situations in which the lacking nature of the title's gameplay can truly be felt. Fighting off three lizard guys on a tiny train roof with a wild camera and touchy control is downright hurtful. Yet still, despite its abundant problems, Spider-Man is remarkably easy, taking only a day or two at best to beat.  Oh, so many problems and so much undelivered potential. Nevertheless, it is a superhero game, a Spider-Man game (the best superhero no less), a platformer game, and of all things, a PC game, so props are given just for the attempt. One of those guilty pleasures you'll pick up just to pick up, and then shelve just to shelve, Spider-Man may make it into your heart if you're a die-hard fan of the fiction, but if you're in it for the game and the play alone listen to your spider-sense and stray away.  -- Ivan Sulic      Want to share your opinions with the world?
