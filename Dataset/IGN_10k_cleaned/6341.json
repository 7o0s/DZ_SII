Nearly six years later, Codemasters brings what was once an elite military simulation to the Xbox and makes us question what we ever saw in the game. Operation Flashpoint: Elite faced several delays in the last few years, and it's become apparent that some things are better off left in the past, like apartheid and disco. In fact, this version of ~Flashpoint~ probably refers to the amount of time this shooter will actually spend inside your Xbox.  Before the people at Codemasters start firing RPGs at me, let me say, to be fair, that the development team made an excellent port of a great PC game. Operation Flashpoint: Elite is pretty much an exact copy of Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis from the PC. Included is the entire Cold War Crisis campaign mode and the new ~Resistance~ campaign, which is unlocked after you beat Cold War Crisis.   The problem is that Operation Flashpoint: Elite looks and plays like it's five years old. Following the success of the Rainbow Six series, you just can't rest on five-year-old laurels in this competitive genre. Tactical shooter fans, first-person-shooter fans and gamers in general want and deserve more heading into the year of the next-generation. Codemasters did a good thing by keeping the solid, tough enemy AI and short, concise mission structure but failed to utilize current graphics and sound technology and update the gameplay.   First: the good. Some nice voice acting helps drive the Cold War Crisis story between missions via cutscenes. It's the Cold War and Mikhail Gorbachev has just come to power in the Soviet Union. A rogue Soviet force has attacked NATO territory and you're going to fight the battle over three islands using a nice variety of weaponry and vehicles.  The tough difficulty settings mean you will die a lot. Time to pray.Back is the simple-to-use menu system, in which you scroll through various actions and radio commands to your team. The missions are short and sweet in true military fashion. You're not going to be commanded to single-handedly take out the entire Soviet army in 30-minute long missions. Instead, you're going to steal a truck here and bomb an enemy convoy there. Sometimes the missions seem like they end a little too fast, but this is the military realism that made Operation Flashpoint a hit in the first place. Get in, accomplish the objective and get out.   The short mission structure is balanced by the fragile soldier you control. In real life, if you take a bullet to the chest, you're going down. Unlike a lot of games with medical kits scattered everywhere like it's a Red Cross convention or some games with regenerating armor, Codemasters kept it real. Like a real soldier, when the guns start a shootin', you better start a crawlin' or else you're going home wrapped in a flag. The one-or-two-shots-you're-dead mechanic can stretch your playing time considerably if you are used to running and gunning.   Operation Flashpoint: Elite is playable in first and third person, nice for foot combat and using vehicles, respectively. On foot, you will be gathering a lot of weapons and ammo off dead soldiers because there aren't shotgun shells randomly lying around in the middle of the woods. You can heal yourself from a medic in the field or in a tent. Again, this all adds to the military realism.   There is a tremendous variety of vehicles ranging from tanks to tractors and all manner of helicopters. Like in EA's Battlefield series, if you see a vehicle, you can probably drive it.  With the suspect controls you will have no problems crash landing this bird.Here's where the problems begin. The vehicle controls are pretty awful, to say the least. It will take you a while to intuitively move your helicopter in the desired direction, and you can pretty much forget about landing the thing. Most of the vehicles move rather unrealistically as you can spin donuts in a truck like you were spinning a basketball on your finger. Cars don't move like that. It's almost too funny to be in first-person mode while driving a car as your hands remain stationary and a big, ugly octagon steering wheel spins around on its own. Little things like this should have been cleaned up along time ago.   The graphics didn't receive an update either and trees and bushes still look pretty bad. The whole game looks like it's running on a very mediocre PC from 2001, in general. The player models' faces are made up of about four triangles and characters run like marionette puppets on speed. The in-game voices are pretty terrible and radio traffic sounds like Steven Hawking's voice box machine gone haywire. ~ENeMY soldier IS histORY,~ if you get my drift.  Putting the poor control and graphics aside for a moment, Codemasters did well to include co-op multiplayer and online play via Xbox Live. It's still a good time to play capture the flag or have a deathmatch with a buddy, but you can do that with a variety of other games as well. Hardcore fans of the game will enjoy the mission editor mode in which they can place a poorly controlled tank or helicopter anywhere they want on a custom-made map.  In the end, only hardcore military simulation fans will derive pleasure from Operation Flashpoint: Elite. A purchase is a little iffy at the $39.99 price-point for a very dated game when there is very strong competition already on the market. As Xbox Live is the only serious upgrade to the title, you are probably better suited to buy a $10 copy of the original Operation Flashpoint and play it on your computer.", "date": "Nov 14, 2005"}
