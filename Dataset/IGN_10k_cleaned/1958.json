But after some play, we can honestly say it's not all that bad -- and that's a lot of praise for a game that comes from Infogrames (lousy French) and WizardWorks, perpetrators of the whole Deer Hunter disaster. Developed by Carapace, the game is actually quite a bit of fun, if not overly pretty.   Players in the game are a little overly polygonal -- in other words, they're a bit too angular. But other little graphical touches take your mind off the triangular arms and legs. As players walk in the sand, for instance, their feet partially disappear, just as they would at the real beach. Some problems with the graphics include the way the net is drawn. Rather than a completely transparent mesh, the net appears as a light gray rectangle.  The animation is fairly good, though a little choppy at times, with player movements looking very realistic. Especially good are the diving animations, as players stretch and reach for spikes and digs. Shadows are well drawn and nicely done, too, a must for a game that takes place almost entirely on the beach.  The game's animation does offer some nice little touches, too. When players miss the ball, you'll see them kicking the sand in disgust. And the sand flying up behind players' feet is well done as they walk, run, and dive around the court.    The targeting system makes it easy to line up your hits. As the ball flies over to your side of the court, a gray, transparent bullseye target appears on the sand. Your job, should you choose to accept it, is to get in the middle of the bullseye for the hit, then press the appropriate button. One button will make a regular hit, another will perform a strong hit that will travel a little further than the other type, useful if you're trying to get it out of reach for the other team.  Sound in the game is not very good, and fairly repetitive. You hear occasional murmurs from the crowd, and that's about it from the spectators. As for player comments, about all you get are phrases that are repeated entirely too often. From ~Help me!~ to ~Go! Go! Go!~ your players don't say much of consequence. And what they do say gets old very quickly.  The game offers 50 pro volleyball players to choose from (we didn't know there actually were 50 pro players), from 13 countries. Included is hottie Gabrielle Reece, probably the biggest volleyball star in existence. Or at least the cutest.  Also included is a player editor that will allow you to create your own player. It's fairly comprehensive, allowing you to choose the player's skin tone, outfit, hat, sunglasses, and their ratings. Your must distribute points to the player's strength, serve, block, pass, set, and attack ratings.  During the game, in addition to just hitting the button for your shots, you also can use a tactical shot to try to outwit your opponent, or you can give an order to your teammate to have them move to a certain spot on the court. Hold down the button a little longer to get a more powerful shot, and chose the direction of your hit with the D-pad. Just be careful, aim your hit too much in the wrong way, and your bump will go out of bounds.  Before you start playing, you've got to choose the court you want to play on. There are eight different courts, with six more that must be unlocked through gameplay. You can play during the day or at night, which is kind of cool, because we didn't know you could play volleyball in the dark. All the courts are on the beach, so there's not much difference in how the games are played from court to court.  Gameplay is actually quite a bit of fun. Maybe that owes a bit to our Pong-playing past. Scooping out the digs and spiking it past the computer was very satisfying the more we played. The game itself is actually very enjoyable, and we found ourselves hooked on it, trying to win just one more match.  All in all, Power Spike: Pro Beach Volleyball is a very fun game that will hook you in once you start playing. While the graphics could use some work, after getting into the game, you won't even notice the little touches that seem to be missing. You'll just be having fun. And aren't that what games are for, after all?  -- Mike Morrissey      Want to share your opinions with the world?
