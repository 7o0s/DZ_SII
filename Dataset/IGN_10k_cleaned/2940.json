Case in point: this brand new game for the e-Reader, which as of yesterday we didn't know a single thing about, and now we have playing on our Game Boy Advance systems!  Of course, a tiny, simplistic game of Air Hockey isn't quite the kind of thing that would the Nintendo press office, but that's the beauty of the e-Reader. Essentially, anything at any time by licensed e-Reader card makers (that is, if Nintendo lets anybody at this tiny little gem) can be picked up in a store, card shop, baseball game, magazine, birthday party, or what-have-you event that Nintendo or a licensee decided to offer cards for. Scan the card's dot strips, perhaps combine it with other cards, and you've instantly got an interactive program running on your Game Boy Advance.  Here's the card you're looking for -- ask and you shall receive!  This particular game is a freebie that, so far, is apparently only available in Toys 'R Us stores (however, there's no TRU logo or anything of that nature on the card saying that it's an exclusive to that company, so it may be available elsewhere if things follow what's happened with a few other TRU exclusives.) We don't mean to be shills for Geoffrey the Giraffe -- we do that enough with our own IGN GameStore -- but if there's a store near you who'd carry this card, get out there and get one now. There's no telling how long these cards will be available, and they're absolutely free to pick up -- just ask for the e-Reader card at the counter. Of course, even though you don't have to buy an e-Reader there to get the card, we'd suggest buying somewhere if you get one -- otherwise, you can't play the game.  And what a game it is!!! Actually, that's fake enthusiasm for a very simplistic game. However, the game is not just a simple Pong clone as one would first expect from a freebie. Nintendo (we're assuming it was Nintendo who made the game since they're the only ones making games for the e-Reader -- there's no menu screen or anything in the actual game) really recreated the ~arcade~ game, with small round bumpers as your controls, small open goals with a surrounding perimeter of safety boards, and full access to your side of the game board left to right and from front to back. Not to hard to pull off, obviously, but we were just expecting Pong, and this was so much more.  Like the real game of Air Hockey, you can create a real mess for yourself by losing your cool -- it's quite easy to send the puck backwards or bank it into the corner of the net while trying for a save that probably wasn't necessary in the first place. The AI is also fairly cleverly designed to be more like a player and to provide more challenge -- the first few points, he plays leisurely and takes risk towards center 'ice', but in the final few rounds as you play to 10 points, the AI literally jitters with anticipation in the back of the rink, playing safe and yet sending returns with force.  It's a good thing that the CPU AI is good (and damned hard, we might add -- we've only played a few rounds that came close, but we've yet to sink that 10th shot for the win against this determined opponent,) because there's no Link Play to the game. There's also no options to tweak -- 10 rounds take a long time, and the hard opponent AI will shut down a lot of kids. If it weren't for the complete lack of options, this little freebie would have been as much fun as the some of these e-Reader NES games! Still, you can't complain much about something that's free, and it's pretty impressive that such a simple game still included full, resonating sound effects and MIDI music with just two simple swipes of a single card.  Sure, it's not a classic by any means -- we didn't even plan to offer up a review of the game, but what the heck. But it does show the versatility of the e-Reader -- if Nintendo is able to capitalize on it the way that we're hoping they do, these kinds of small surprises may await you everywhere you go.", "date": "Sep 18, 2002"}
