In fact, they've only made one: Giants: Citizen Kabuto. Granted, Giants was an excellent game that combined beautiful imagery, innovative gameplay, and a wicked sense of humor to create a game that more than a few people - including us - named ~Game of the Year,~ but we still weren't sure whether Planet Moon was a one-hit wonder, or a genuinely fine developer. Now we know. (The latter, mind you).   Gameplay Armed and Dangerous, at its core, is about shooting things. Lots and lots and lots of things. The game places you in the role of Roman, the leader of a small group of thieves known as the Lionhearts. The group initially sets out to steal the legendary Book of Rule, but the heist becomes much more complicated, ultimately weaving the band of thieves in a treacherous rebellion to topple the tyrannical King Forge. Sounds deep, doesn't it? Even though the plot of the game may sound epic on paper, the story is much more Mel Brooks than Mel Gibson.   First you've got the cast of characters. Though Roman is a ~standard~ human, his two buddy thieves aren't. Jonesy, a Scottish mole miner, is, um, a talking mole that has a promiscuous mother and small genitalia (or so the game says). Q1-11, or ~Q,~ on the other hand is a robot who became self-aware through his unconditional love for tea. Yes, tea. Then there's Roman's foster father, Rexus, a two-foot blind man with supernatural powers. (Coincidentally, Rexus bears an uncanny resemblance to the Smarties in Giants) Now, if that's not a motley crew, we don't know what is. The same goes for the opposing side, where the King's son is a Frankenstein-like creature with the mind of a four-year old.   In case you haven't guessed, this game does not take itself seriously. And that's a good thing. Like Giants before it, Armed and Dangerous is full of witty humor that is genuinely funny and sharp. You'll literally laugh out loud as you watch each and every cutscene, though those easily offended should maybe stay away - nothing is held back in this game. From bodies stuck in colons to ~mom jokes~ to even jokes about genitalia and sexuality, this game is not for those without a sense of humor. But if you do, this is one game that you'll have a ton of fun with.    Now, as mentioned before, the gameplay is all about shooting. Played from a third-person perspective, Armed and Dangerous plays very much like Giants did when you were the Meccs. You even have two AI buddies - Q and Jonesy - that will help you. This leads to our first problem with the game: the AI. Frankly, your two compadres are worthless. They'll take fire like it's no one's business and give it out like it's the last priority in the world. Too often they'll just die early on and you'll just have to make it without them. You can give them some primitive commands (defend area, return to me, defend me) but again, it's all pretty worthless. In fact, we found ourselves ordering them to stay behind while we finished the level without them.   The enemy AI is also a bit wonky, sometimes being way too smart while other times being way too dumb. For example, enemies will often ~see~ you and attack even before you're in view. Other times, you can shoot a soldier in the head and have his buddy that's standing right next to him not notice a thing. But even with the AI - both your teammates and the enemies - being a bit off, the game maintains a high level of fun. Why? It's hard to say, really. But we're inclined to think that it has something to do with the game's difficulty. Let us explain.      This game is hard. Yeah, there are some tough games out there, but this game is really, really hard, especially on the hardest level. Most gamers' intuition will tell them to run into a level and shoot everything in sight. And for some games, that strategy works. Try it in Armed and Dangerous and you'll be dead in literally ten seconds. But while the game may seem frustratingly hard at first, if you plan ahead and strategize your attacks, you'll find that each and every level isn't so bad. Here's where the AI comes in. Having slightly dumbed-down AI (for the enemies) seems to make the battles a bit more balanced and ultimately beatable. If each enemy were wickedly smart, this game would be impossible. Perhaps testing the game showed that the current level of AI was just right in order to make a balanced game. Maybe we're just imagining all of this and just trying to sound smart. Whatever the case may be, the simple fact remains: Armed and Dangerous, despite the sometimes imbecilic nature of the CPU characters, is still a ton of fun to play.  Now, a little more on the gameplay variety: Many of the levels in the game will ask you to destroy a certain number of buildings and/or enemies. Other will ask you to find, rescue, and deliver captured peasants to their homes (also taken from Giants). Then there are missions where you will have to defend a house or your teammate for a certain amount of time. All of these are played from the standard third-person view, though each level has a preset selection of weapons and items that will be available. These weapons and items can be found in a pub located in each level. At the pub, you can select new weapons, refill your health, and save your game. This is also taken almost directly from Giants, health pool and all. PC players (vs Xbox players) get the advantage of a save anywhere feature, so the hit-and-run tactics that can be used in the console version are not needed. But this also makes the game slightly easier to progress through, as you can kill a few enemies, save, and repeat. Additionally, the use of mouse over a controller has its benefits, so we suggest playing on the hardest difficulty level.  Also worth mentioning are the levels where you are placed inside a gun turret along a wall. Placed on a moving horizontal track, the storyline will have you defending a wall against huge armies of opponents. The goal of these levels is to not let any of the troops climb over before time runs out. Let 100 enemies over and you lose. These turret levels are fun to play and just as cool to look at. There's nothing like seeing hundreds of troops in the background making their way forward as you try and blast them all. Our biggest gripe about these levels, though, is that they are simply way too easy. Not once did we have more than five troops make it over the wall - and that was before we realized we had rockets we could use too. Then that five dropped down to a zero. Additionally, it's a bit strange that every wall, regardless of location or story context, looks the same. While fun, the levels could've been a bit more diverse in visual presentation as well as gameplay.   Graphics While Giants was full of super-vivid, almost tropical colors, Armed and Dangerous takes a more muted approach - think green and brown and gray. The environments correspond accordingly, and take place in remote villages, snowy (or not) mountains, fantastical forests, and rocky seaside cliffs, to name a few. The neutral scheme works well within the context of the story, but we do wish there was a bit more color to the worlds. With the game's sense of humor, it's almost as if the dull tones bring the mood down.  The game's system requirements call for a 1GHz processor, 256 MB of RAM, and 32 MB video card. We played the game on a 2.6 CPU, 1 GB of RAM, and a GeForce FX 5200 with 64 MB of RAM, and were able to play the game with all settings turned up at a resolution of 1024x768x32 (no anti-aliasing). At these settings, the game ran smooth, even when the action got really heated. Bumping it up to 1280, the game still ran well but chopped up a bit when there were big explosions (of which there are a LOT).       One thing we're pretty disappointed about are the cutscenes. Rather than using the game engine to do real-time cutscenes, what we get are game engine cutscenes that have been recorded and are played back as highly compressed movies. There are a large amount of artifacts in the video, and the models and animation just don't look that good. DivX is even used for the videos, so the compression is almost an anomaly. Fortunately there's enough wit and clever dialog to make up for the lackluster visual presentation.   Overall, Armed and Dangerous is a solid (but not great) looking title that looks best during gameplay. We would've liked some more special effects and a wider color palette, but the charming character designs and overall scope of the environments and enemy numbers (read: large) are more than enough to create a good level of immersion.   Sound When it comes to sound quality, Armed and Dangerous ranges from good to excellent. The good comes from quality explosions and gunfire. While not as booming as they could be, each weapon does it job in sounding fierce and deadly. Also good are the ambient sounds and almost-epic score. You might expect some generic action tunes when you first boot up the game, but when you hear the first notes of the cinematic score, the pleasant shock is a nice surprise.  Where Armed and Dangerous really excels, though, is in the voice acting. Being a game that features a ton of voiced dialogue - that has to be funny no less - the quality of the voice acting is of paramount importance. Fortunately for us, the voice acting couldn't be better. Each and every line is delivered on point, with just the right amount of sarcasm and sincerity to make the characters real - and funny. This goes a long way in making the game as enjoyable as it is, as the cutscenes are a big part of what gives Armed and Dangerous so much character and charm. Well done, Planet Moon. We liked Armed and Dangerous. Yes, its all about shooting and blowing things up, but when did that become stale? In our minds, it hasnt. Of course, there are some games where shooting is very boring. Luckily, Armed and Dangerous, believe it or not, is a smart shooter that actually requires some brain activity and/or superhuman reflexes. We also really loved the humor in the game. Without it, the game would still be a good shooter  just not as fun.If youre looking for a deep story, look somewhere else. The narrative for Armed and Dangerous is merely used a vehicle for assigning (sometimes) outrageous goals rather than telling a rich story. Still, the light-hearted nature of the story is enjoyable bringing to mind a more vulgar, Mel Brooks-produced Shrek; not the story really, but the overall feel and theme of the humor.On the other hand, if youre looking for a challenging shooter that features tight controls, decent graphics, and a wicked sense of humor, Armed and Dangerous is your game.", "date": "Dec 4, 2003"}
