It didn't help that EA changed its mind a couple of times during the game's development over the course of this year.  SSX: DVD was apparently a special edition, or SSX 1.5.  Then, as the content started balooning, it was about SSX one-and-three-quarters a bit after E3.  When Tricky finally shaped up into playable form by late in the summer, it was an official sequel, if one with a similar name -- or at least that was EA's line.  After finishing Tricky, though, if they want to call this a sequel, that's A-okay with me.  Only two of the courses are ~new~ in name, but every single track has been vastly reworked.  On top of that, you have better graphics, better framerate, new characters, new tricks, ridiculous new ~uber~ tricks, tweaked control, more and better music and sound, and a boatload of DVD extras showing how the whole package came together.  If that's not a sequel, what is?  And this is a very, very good sequel, one that builds and improves on a game that was already brilliant.    If you played the first SSX, Tricky is still worth your money, and if this would be your first exposure to the concept, run out and buy it as soon as you can.  Don't say ~nah, I don't like snowboarding games.~  This is not a snowboarding game.  It's SSX.  In other words, it's much, much better.  Gameplay  Go into the DVD extras section and you can get a brief primer on ~What Is SSX,~ but since I'm presumably trying to convince you to buy the game here, I'll explain as well.  In theory, this is a snowboarding game, but it's a much more effective blend of racing and tricks than ever managed in such a game before.  Add to that a touch of the Wipeout action-racing concept, with just a few small combat elements to spice things up, and inflate the scale of the game beyond any expectations.  SSX was the first EA Sports BIG game, and fittingly so -- everything in the game is very, very big.  The tracks are big, the air is big, the tricks are big.  Realistic no, entertaining very much so.  As I say, SSX blends stunts and racing into a single, playable unit.  When you race, tricks add to the boost meter you use to gain speed and pull ahead, and boost is most certainly required to win races.  Thus, you have to pay attention to your trick ability as you develop your character and hone your reflexes for performing tricks, even if you don't necessarily get a kick out of doing stunts (although you should).  Luckily even for the non-trick-inclined, the controls are friendly, responsive, and tuned for more precision in comparison to the first game.  The pre-wind system (where you hold a direction while preparing for a jump to prep a flip and spin) still works very well, and now it's easy to use the analog stick to finish off an errant flip.  The shoulder buttons still combine together for a wide variety of grab tricks, but now there are also ~uber~ tricks, signature moves for each character.  As you build up your boost meter, you also occasionally activate the ~Tricky~ meter, which gives you a short window in which to pull off an uber-trick.  Grab plenty of air, hit a shoulder button, tweak it with the square button, and get ready for some extremely impressive animations.  Characters spin, flip, and pirouette on their boards, performing tricks quite beyond the realm of possibility.  For the extremely astute, five uber-tricks in one run will let you perform a super-trick -- apparently ~super~ is even cooler than ~uber.~  The track design in every level has been heavily modified, and of course Garibaldi and Alaska are completely new.  The scale of the courses at this point is such that it's entirely possible to get lost, or as lost as you can be when you're just supposed to go downhill.  Run through Tokyo, Hawaii, or Alaska several times and you'll still wind up in sections of the course you haven't seen, especially in the Showoff mode.  Showoff throws all kinds of extra elements into the courses, more rails and kicker ramps to increase trick potential, and the resulting rail lines demand serious skill to take advantage of the best trick potential.  Race mode also gets some new kinks in the form of the aggression system, which builds on the distinctive personalities of the characters.  Each character (there are several, with distinct looks and moves) begins the game with a couple of friends on the circuit, a couple of enemies, and a neutral relationship with other riders.  This determines their propensity for giving you a hard time on the race track -- SSX lets you shove and be shoved as you jockey for position.  In the World Circuit mode, splashing other riders will increase their level of aggression toward you, making it more likely that they'll try to push you around in a future race, or even later on in the current one.  This isn't a major factor in races, since the pack tends to thin out after the first few legs, but an unfriendly rider definitely acts more aggressively.  Revenge is a noticeable factor in single races, too.  Crash someone else and don't be surprised if they pull back up and smack you around a little.  Topping all this off are a selection of fun little cutscenes that occasionally play after a race where you behaved very aggressively.  Watching riders talk trash to Kaori is pretty entertaining -- she just chirps back at them in incomprehensible Japanese.  In other AI issues, the nasty spike in the difficulty level on the third heat is gone.  Race mode challenges you to beat three heats of a single track before you score a medal for the World Circuit -- in the first game, the opposition would suddenly be twice as fast the third time through.  Now, the difficulty ramps up more kindly, which is one of several tweaks that makes progression easier.  There's also now an instant restart, which lets you begin a race or showoff run over again without having to go all the way back to the beginning of the heat.  This doesn't unbalance the game too badly, though, because you don't want to restart after you're more than a minute into a run.  To ice the cake neatly, the interface is streamlined with better looks and shorter load times.  Graphics  In the first SSX, many gamers complained about the inconsistent framerate -- it had a tendency to drop down into the thirtyish range when you'd enter a curve, a large area, or someplace crowded with several other riders.  This is no longer a problem.  Tricky still skips here and there, but very rarely, and nowhere does that affect gameplay.  The improvement is immense, especially when you consider that the tracks are now bigger, with more detailed textures and lighting.  We actually have a hard time going back to the first SSX, now that Tricky looks so much better.  And that's pretty good, considering that this was already a very good-looking series.  Tricky is like a bright, expansive, snow-covered funhouse, stretching off into the distance as far as you can see.  There are gigantic chunks of architecture laid on top of gigantic chunks of architecture, lined with little details like billboards, fireworks, rails, and other accents.  Taking in the massive scope is at least as much fun as checking out the small extras here and there.  The character animation, of course, is another area that's much improved.  I've already feted the superb uber-trick animations, but I say again, these are something else to watch.  Seeing all the different signature stunts is reason enough to go to the trouble to play with all the different characters.  Everyone also has more little bits of animating detail, from Eddie's wobbling puffball hat to Psymon's dreads to Kaori's fluttering jacket.    The DVD Content section (not exactly a graphical element, but even less like anything else in the game)  represents a trend that I'd love to see in more games: including extra features of the kind that have become commonplace on movie DVDs.  Along with an audio jukebox, Tricky includes long documentaries from all the different game creators talking about tricks, courses, characters, voice acting, music, and more, with guest appearances by Mix Master Mike and the celebrities who supplied the acting.  It's a huge collection of background stuff, and a great window into the ideas and the people behind the game.  I could think of any number of other games where I'd love to see similar extras -- congratulations to EA for being one of the first to take the step.  Sound  SSX Tricky is a very ~cool~ game.  This is a harder thing to achieve than you might initially think.  The pop-culture wasteland is littered with the wreckage of media artifacts that tried, and failed, to carry off some particular attitude -- hip, hop, ~edgy,~ whatever, they're all trying to be cool, and they're all pretty bad at it.  Something about SSX, though, some gestalt of visual and aural design elements, makes it work.  You think ~Yeah, this is cool,~ instead of ~Yeah, they're trying pretty hard to be cool.~  The music, sound, and voices are a vital part of that.  SSX is tracked with a combination of original work (mainly by EA's ace John Morgan), plus licensed cuts by artists like Hybrid and Mix Master Mike, who also contributed to general sound and music design.  That aspect of the game is superb, with a realtime mixing system that kicks up or holds back the pace of the music depending on your performance.  There is also, of course, the eponymous Run-DMC track, in both original and remixed form, which also gets mixed in with the regular soundtrack whenever you power up the ~Tricky~ meter.  It's a weird sort of crash between breakbeats and hip-hop, but the overall effect is great, and the songs are tailored towards the individual courses.  The Untracked course gets the ethereal sound of ~Finished Symphony,~ while courses like Merqury City get a heavier, rougher sound.  EA also opened up the wallet for celebrity voice actors to give life to the characters, but this was perhaps a more questionable venture.  It's not that the new voices don't sound cool -- they do, and the dialogue is very well-written -- it's just that I'm not sure I can tell the difference between most of the new voices and their equivalents in the original game.  I nearly bet Dave Z 20 dollars that Elise's voice actress hadn't changed before I had the sense to trust the press releases.  That issue aside, though, the character voices add another facet to the game's personality, and dang, Kaori is cute.  Almost too cute -- every character has a little FMV sequence that plays when they go up a development rank, and hers seems to be the result of a bad acid trip in a Sanrio store.  Cuteness...gives...shivers...Coolness does too, though.Maybe I've missed a few points here and there, but the overall argument is inescapable: SSX Tricky is a very good game.  It's the best snowboarder out there, 1080 be stuffed, and the originator when it comes to making tricks and racing into a working whole.  Notice how many games released just a while after SSX nicked that very same boost meter element?  That's when you know a game is good these days, when everything starts reminding you of it six months later.Like I say, this is a good buy whether you played the first one or not.  It's just that if you didn't play the first one, it's much better.  Find out what the fuss is all about and get this one as soon as you can.Oh, and HEY!  *arm waving*  The Digital Theater Sound in SSX Tricky is great if you have an expensive enough system to do it justice.  I (David Smith) don't have that kind of money, hence the lack of effusive gushing on the subject in the original review.  The other Dave (Dave Zdyrko), however, affirms in his preview coverage and at present that the DTS surround-sound is brilliant and should be taken advantage of by all of you who have the chance.", "date": "Nov 7, 2001"}
