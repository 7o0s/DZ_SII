Whether it's on overpriced restaurants, expensive clothing or Halo 3, we have no problems opening our wallets and purses. It's the reason why gambling games, on any platform, are so popular. Superscape's Capone Casino II continues our quest for striking it rich by giving the player a multitude of games in which to win or lose while adding in a nice story mode to top things off.   You are Jimmy Player on trail of the person(s) responsible for killing your brother Tony. Tony worked at the casinos and as you earn enough cash in the VIP room, you gain access to the next casino and the next journal entry in solving the mystery of your brother's death. Along with the usual assortment of old school gangsters and thugs, you'll encounter a few surprises including a dame who may or may not be on your side. The story mode is very colorful, but there weren't enough sound effects to compliment it.   But the story mode is just a nice little bonus to help your feeling of accomplishment as you work your way up to gaining access to Capone's casino. What players are really interested in are the games, and this is the area where Capone Casino II shines. Everything from various slot machines to Roulette, Texas Hold 'Em, Craps, Video Poker, 7 Card Stud, 5 Card Draw and Blackjack is represented in colorful fashion.    The slot machines are fun. There's even a progressive machine called Aardvark Invasion with Gangster Goods and Plum Crazy rounding out the action. Each slot machine has a mini game, that when completed successfully earns you a cheat token you can use any time during play. Using a cheat token makes the slot machine continue to spin until you win. Video Poker offers three different ways to play from the Loose Deuce (Deuces wild), You Dirty Rat (Jokers are wild) to Jack Attack where you need Jacks or better to win.    The card games are nicely animated and your character opponents are very cartoon-ish and actually play with some semblance of AI. It's nice to see a computer opponent actually fold his raise if you re-raise him in Hold 'Em instead of going all-in every hand, or calling your all-in every hand, which is a flaw in a lot of Hold 'Em games. The other thing I didn't like is there are only 5 players at a table. Sacrificing the animations for a table with more players would have made more sense. Blackjack is once again the merciless whore I expected it to be since I've never had any luck with the game in both the virtual and real world.    If you happen to run out of cash you can visit the loan office to get more money. There's no game over option in these casinos so you can keep rolling the dice at the craps table until you win enough dough to get to the next Journal entry. Get used to asking for more money. Like the real casinos, you'll lose more than you'll win. Money management was a bit confusing because at times I would reach the next chapter unaware I had earned enough money to actually access it. Maybe the hypnotizing spin of the Roulette wheel confused my small monkey brain.   The Tournament Casino allows you to play against other players over the network, although I'm not sure I ever truly played with an actual person. None of the other players had names attached to them.  Capone Casino II is a good addition to your wireless gaming collection and your vice for gambling. Offering a variety of action alongside the story mode should keep you entertained for hours. Some small annoyances may keep you from thinking this is the best casino game out there. The games can be ruthless and just like in real life, it's tough to beat. But that's the chance you take anytime you roll the dice.", "date": "Sep 25, 2007"}
