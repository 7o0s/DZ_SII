Remember when seeing that bright shining logo on a Batman title or a Dragon Heart game meant that you'd be treated to a grand tour of the dirty basement of game development? Recent titles like Re-Volt, Shadowman, and Trickstyle have tricked you into thinking that things had completely changed, and that the company had mastered the art of creating hot new franchises to complement its purchased ones. Well I'm happy to say that Acclaim is back in full force with South Park Rally, not the first and certainly not the last in a series of horribly implemented video games based on the TV Show.  To put it into layman's terms, what Acclaim has done with the South Park franchise is to take all the elements of the series and throw them into a rusty meat grinder, scooping up random bits and fitting them into cartridge and CD shapes for a variety of systems. We've seen a wretched shooter hit the consoles, a sad quiz game sprayed over any format imaginable, and now a Mario-Kart rip-off that seems to be pitched better than all the rest, and played out worse than most.  In theory, this could have been a great game. Instead of following a standard cart formula like a host of other cart-racing games, it looks as if the developers of South Park Rally actually thought about how to make the game stand out from the pack. Instead of standard races, SPR is made of a variety of games like the Rally series (which has you chasing four checkpoints in order to make informal ~laps~) to the slew of ~collect and drop off~ games like Cow Day, Valentine's Day, and Read-A-Book Day. Most of the non-rally games play very, very similar, but at first glance it's a step in a good direction. More importantly, it looks as if the design team took a lot of time to recreate all of your favorite characters from the show (35, to be exact), as well as record custom shouts, screams and ugs for every single one. The humor, at least in terms of the cars and the weapons, is completely intact. Mephisto drives a replica of the Back to the Future DeLorean while Chef drives a miniature version of his green station wagon. The weapons take that extra step towards gross, and down towards the anal region with powers that range from the innocuous Cheesy Poofs to Dildos, Salty Balls, Herpes, and Anal Probes. You don't even want to know what the last two do. The characters are nice 3D translations of their 2D counterparts, and the environments that they run around in are fleshed out and full of big round edges and bright colors. Some of the levels go beyond the call of duty by delivering some interesting areas like the twisted Sewer map, and the unholy yet somehow wholesome Farm.  Too bad all of this is broken to pieces by the horrible gameplay and control scheme, not to mention the general bugginess of the game. Controls can be wrangled by a gamepad, but are a little clumsier with a keyboard -- the main problem comes in the details, namely the horrifying goal structure set by the game. The Rally option is a confusing mess, as you're left with an unintuitive map and a guiding arrow that seems to decide on its own whether or not to actually stay onscreen and help you. And the competition? Pure computerized evil. Everyone else knows exactly where to go and what to do, while you're left to flounder and ponder your frustrations as you slip over someone's Explosive Diarrhea. Even if you play a perfect Rally game, you may find yourself in fifth place for no apparent reason other than the other characters perfect track record. The other courses get old quickly, and you're left with no salvation but the hopes that the multiplayer game will somehow be just a tiny bit more fun. Which they are -- kind of.  We played a LAN game with four players, and found it to be insanely off the mark in terms of lag and logic, especially when a timed race gave us the 15 seconds left bell, and then proceed to continue for another two minutes for no apparent reason. It was impossible to attack enemies that chunked across the screen because of lag, and more often than not you wouldn't want to anyway -- you were too busy squinting at the confusing map trying to figure out where the hell the one drop-off point was for your chickens/turkeys/candy/etc. Despite the smart initial designs of SPR, what they forgot was the fun, and the game suffers tremendously for it. The secret joy of hearing Cartman say ~here is something for your ass~ only lasts for an hour or so before you're left with the fact that the computer keeps crashing every time you change menu options, and that you're just plain tired of collecting horrible crap. The fact that a fast PC would have to deal with menus that bring the game to a standstill, and  a multiplayer interface that's confusing at best just add to the general frustration of this game.  If you're bent on purchasing every piece of South Park memorabilia, then you'll probably find a way to love this game to death for its assets. But for the rest of you, just stick to the show and lighting your own farts in the backyard.  -- Vincent Lopez", "date": "Feb 11, 2000"}
