A land where purple skin, huge, bulging eyes, rainbow tattoo marks, a colored afro and a permanent smiling joker's face are perfectly normal. If his unnatural smiling face doesn't send opponents running, his frog-like, lemon-sized eye-balls are sure to frighten them to death. Either that, or it will send them into fits of laughter, which may, in time, render them helpless or unconscious entirely. Kyoya is but one of many terribly designed fighters that make up the cast of Konami's Nintendo 64 3D fighter, Deadly Arts -- a game that, had it appeared alongside Nintendo 64's launch two years ago, would have sucked.  Deadly Arts, to the dismay of many Japanese gamers, has been available in Japan under the title G.A.S.P!! Fighters' NEXTream since March. Despite its enticing name, the game wasn't well-received, which begs the question: why release it in the US? We're not exactly sure.  The game revolves eight or so characters, all designed in a fashion that is sure to give War Gods a good run for its money. There's the lovable Kyoya, who we've already written about. There's Kongo, an overpowering giant with bald head and goatee. There's Azami, a Chun-li rip-off in more ways than one. And, of course, there's Kai, your basic Ryu. Bear in mind that each character looks like a cheap imitation of a cheap imitation of Ryu or Chun-li. Fighters duke it out in a boring selection of various locations ranging from a car garage to a mine, to the insides of a building and so on. It's highly generic fighting void of any real substance.  Gameplay Two minutes with this game and you'll be begging for mercy. Control is nearly nonexistent, slow, tedious, and uninspired. The fighting system is sub-par, boring, and unresponsive. Learning the moves isn't rewarding, it's frustrating. And when one does learn a new move or ~combo,~ there's no point in executing it as the results are highly unimpressive. Gameplay, unbalanced and untested, is equally simplistic and, for lack of a better word, crap. It's conceivable to beat the entire game by simply pressing the A and B buttons repeatedly. Environments are interactive, meaning the game's 3D backdrops can sometimes be broken, or various objects used to a fighter's advantage, but even that is executed poorly. We're running out of negative adjectives to describe just how poor Deadly Arts plays, but trust us, you won't like it. Run, fellow Nintendo 64 owners. Run for your lives!  Graphics It's true what you've heard, Deadly Arts does have graphics, but just barely.  We won't go into how terrible the game's character design is any further, so let's talk about framerates and animation. Equally rubbish, the game animates stiffly and, despite dithering, terrible low-res textures and 3D models constructed of five polygons, framerates drop considerably often.   Sound Like all Konami games, Deadly Arts does sound good. Sure, character noises are laughable, but they're clear and, sadly, fitting. Some bearable ~new age~ music cuts highlight the game's, uh, action, and though they are similarly clear, they don't offer much in the way of repeated listening.  Options This game's true redeeming factor lies in its variety of options, from training characters to multiplayer brawls. Possibly the game's best feature, create-a-fighter, is actually rather well done, sometimes funny (given the off-the-wall fighters that can be designed), but it unfortunately ultimately falls victim to the game's second-rate gameplay and graphics. If you're into pain then we see no reason why you shouldn't give Konami's Deadly Arts a rent, or, if you hate life, purchase. Bear in mind though that the title offers nothing new in the way of 3D fighter, and, in fact, offers nothing new period. Stale, sub-first-generation graphics, terrible control and detestable framerates do no make for good fighting games. Shame on you, Konami. Deadly Arts should have never found its way to US shores. Our recommendation: don't even rent it. Protest it.", "date": "Oct 20, 1998"}
