Motorhead is just a plain racing game. There are no power ups here. No weapons. No cash prizes to upgrade your car. Nothing but straight racing. And when I say straight, I mean full of tight corners and curves. You race against seven other computer or human players in an effort to become the Transinternet Speed League Champion.  There are ten different cars to choose from in Motorhead. Initially only three are available. You earn the opportunity to race in the other cars by finishing league races. Each car is rated in three performance areas-speed, acceleration and grip. There's a pretty fair mix here of the different possible configurations. You can also choose to drive each car with an automatic or manual transmission. Manual shifting is fairly straightforward. Luckily there's no clutch so you can shift up or down at the touch of a button.  Each car also comes equipped with a horn. You can choose from one of several different horn sounds ranging from traditional ~beep, beep~ type horns to those that imitate a cow's moo. This option is really only useful in multi-player modes as the computer racers don't seem to acknowledge the horns at all. There's also a handbrake in each car, but I'm still not sure what its use is. Obviously, I know what a handbrake does, but why you would use it, I'll never know. I mean, you're not parking this thing on any hills.  You can steer the car with the arrow keys. Up accelerates and Down brakes or throws the car in reverse. If you're driving a car with a manual transmission you'll have independent controls for shifting as well. Steering is relatively realistic but it's hard to make the transition from gas pedal to brake. I either slowed down too much or not enough. I suppose with a bit of practice I could get better, but it's frustrating to be either too wide or too tight in the turns.  It's not as if you can damage your car though. This to me was the most disappointing aspect of the game. While I didn't expect collisions to be handled totally realistically, I did expect something to come from them. Here crashing into another car, or the wall for that matter, does zero damage to you. The cars are totally invulnerable (I guess if you're invulnerable, by definition you are totally invulnerable). This totally kills the realism of the rest of the game. Since everything else is handled so realistically, why not crashes?  One of the most fun (and frivolous) features is the car color scheme selector. You can pick up to three colors from a big palette to customize the appearance of your car. While this is purely a cosmetic change, I did a lot to get my enthusiasm up. You can set your racer name and also set hot key chats for multi-player. There are 10 slots for preset messages. In the race, you just hit the corresponding key, and all players on the track receive your message.  The game can be viewed from a number of cameras. The best view is an outside chase view. This allows you to see your car and the areas directly around it. The 1st person view is nice but it lacks the sense of place that you get from the chase view. I found that I would hit the walls a lot more in first person than I did in third. There is also an option that allows you to look behind you, but I fail to see the wisdom in doing that. It's hard enough to race as it is.  There's also a racetrack camera. I have no clue how this is supposed to be used in a real race. When selected, this view switches from camera to camera along the side of the track. Each is in a fixed position and turns to follow your car around the track. It's hopeless to race in this mode. I think its main use is in viewing replays. You can also set any of the three views to follow any other cars on the track. You can view any of the other racers in first, third or trackside views.  Ultimately there are 8 different tracks you can choose from. When you start playing however, you will only be able to pick from two. Once you begin to place in League mode, you will gain access to other tracks. They range from tight, downtown locations to sprawling Mediterranean tours. Most of the tracks have tight corners and these are usually placed to ensure that you loose a lot of time going through them. I understand that the game is supposed to be challenging, but why put the sharpest turns right after the highest jumps?  There are several single player options in this game. Single races are just that; one time, scoreless trials. You are limited to the cars and tracks you have available from league play. In the beginning this amounts to very little. Time trials are also available. These are races without any other cars cluttering up the tracks or getting in your way. There is also a Ghost Race mode where you can replay a previous race where the other cars are visible but intangible.  The heart of the single player game is League mode. The competition consists of several circuits. You must place high in the individual races to progress to higher divisions. Before each race, you select your car. Each finishing place is worth a certain number of points. You must finish first or second overall in the division to move ahead. Each new division adds more tracks and more cars. I think there's an extra surprise waiting for you once you win the entire league, but I'm not going to say what that is.  There are two ways the game tries to level the playing field. You can choose to enable the special ~catch-up~ feature. This allows cars in the rear of the pack to receive a slight performance boost, thereby allowing them to catch up with the leaders. In league mode starting positions are determined by finishing positions in the previous race. Unlike most games though, this game puts the losers in front and sticks the leaders in the back.  You have the option of recording your races. You can then go back and review them from several different perspectives. This is a good way to improve your performance on a specific track. Seeing things from a new perspective will give you ideas on how to adjust your style to the individual tracks.  The multi-player element runs one of two ways. You may set up your games individually or you may choose to play on Mplayer. I know the game hasn't been out that long, but I only ever found one race on Mplayer.com and there were only 4 people racing. There was also one poor sap all by himself in the chat room but I'm not going to worry about that right now. The whole multi-player experience is painless, but failed to generate the excitement that you would expect from the Transinternet Speed League.  Sound is good in this game. The noise of the track is rendered pretty faithfully. There are sounds for engines revving and tires squealing. Each of these is pretty impressive. What's missing is a good crash sound. Good crashes are also missing come to think of it. When two cars collide, there's no satisfying crunch. When you hit a wall, there's no sound of metal bending or glass shattering. It really stands out in its absence.  The graphics are superb. Everything looks so good. The track itself is wonderfully detailed. You'll see tons of signs, pylons, trees, gas stations...the list goes on. The cars are all great looking too. Each car has a unique color scheme.  Lighting effects and texture mapping are better than in most racers I've played recently. A real emphasis has been placed on realism here. Skid marks appear on the track anywhere the racers lose control. By the end of the race, you'll be able to see the problem areas pretty well. Just look for tire marks on the walls.  The game has three separate difficulty settings. To be honest I didn't see much difference between them. I don't expect the easy setting to be a cakewalk, but here it wasn't much easier than the medium difficulty setting. The real problem here is that the computer racers are too good.  They always maintain control of their car and always maintain the optimum speed in corners. I hate them. While I'm crashing into walls, and in one frightening episode actually flipping over in the air, they're just tooling along without a care in the world. Only one time did I see a computer racer at a dead stop due to poor driving.  In the end, Motorhead was a fairly empty experience. The tracks and cars all look good but the excitement wasn't there. It penalizes players who don't pick it up quickly. There isn't really a very steep learning curve, but if you fail to get past the first division of league play, you're stuck playing the same two tracks over and over again.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "May 18, 1999"}
