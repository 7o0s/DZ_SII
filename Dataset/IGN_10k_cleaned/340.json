That would have to be Rising Zan: The Samurai Gunman.  Rising Zan is like a lot of other PlayStation games, but there is no other game quite like Rising Zan. This game successfully blends a huge variety of game play elements into a title that is both fun to play and an original experience.  You're Zan, a child of the Wild West who learned early that evil is bigger than your gun. You went to the Far East, learned the secrets of the sword from a mysterious Samurai master, and have returned to kick ass and take names. Gameplay Rising Zan is a linear game. You start at point A and continue on to point B, hacking and shooting your way there in a third-person perspective familiar to anyone who has seen a Tomb Raider game. In this respect, it is a lot like the 2D side-scrollers from the 16-bit era. You move forward or you die. It is that simple. Despite what may sound like a tired way to deliver a gaming experience, the developer, UEP Systems, has managed to liven it up with a variety of gameplay mechanics that seem pulled from the very best games.  Being an old west hero, Zan totes a six-barrel cannon you can use to dispense western justice. Zan also caries a Samurai sword that can carve an opponent in two. Combined, you get the sword fighting action of Tenchu and the shooting action of Tomb Raider.  The sword play really is a lot like Tenchu. Zan has moves that he can use to carve up enemies, splitting them through the center and sending up gushing towers of blood. Since the game is in a 3D environment, you can be tackling three, four or five enemies at once, with a single slice going through several of them. Beyond that, the similarities to Tenchu end and the fighting game techniques pick up. Earn a bit of Hero Power and your sword triples in length and Zan can run like the wind. Combine different attacks and you can deliver special crushing blows.  The gun fighting works a lot like shooting in Zelda does. Lock on to a target and keep firing until it goes down. The combination of the sword and gun make for a pretty devastating, and entertaining, combination.  The game unfolds through a number of Japanese RPG style cinematics, where the Bad Guy will deliver his warnings to follow no further (which you ignore) and shows off his super human powers. All the boss characters have exaggerated features and abilities, but naturally, none of them can stand up to Zan.  There's also some arcade-style button mashing where you have to nail every key on the PlayStation pad to get a bonus or immediately take down an opponent.  The linear levels themselves are well designed, with lots of tasks to perform. In one case you must defeat a group of enemies before a barrier will be lowered allowing you to attack a walking bomb. If the bomb reaches the water tower before you destroy it, well, you know what happens. It sounds like something that has been done before, but the combination of spaghetti western trappings, samurai sword fighting, and Japanese characters delivers an experience that feels new, even if it isn't. Graphics Rising Zan won't win any awards for the graphics engine, but they do the trick. All the characters have a unique look and the environments have a distinctive Japanese/Wild West feel.  Aside from some seeming, the textures all look good, with lots of detail and a broad palette. The game's framerate is also solid, offering great performance even when there are a dozen enemies on screen and two of them are squirting red.  Graphically, Zan's best quality has got to be character design. The boss characters are all straight out of a Japanese RPG, but you're fighting them in 3D instead of on a 2D plane. Your standard opponents like the Red Ninja's are a bit more generic, but still detailed and well animated. Sound The sound effects in Rising Zan are dead on. Your sword swishes, your gun thunders and your enemies, well, they die with satisfactory aural accompaniment.  The music is neither obvious nor offensive, which are good qualities. To be honest, I didn't even notice the music until I had to decide what to write about it. Changes in tempo or tune coincide with new threats and there is enough variety that it won't quickly get stale. Overall, the developers should be commended for not falling into the music trap that so many games don't seem to avoid.Most of the best qualities of Rising Zan are recycled from other great games. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Rising Zan pays homage to a lot of really good games. No doubt some reviewers will knock Zan for being so imitative, but the result is a genuinely enjoyable game that is, in its own way, unique.", "date": "Oct 22, 1999"}
