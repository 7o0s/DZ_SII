Every so often, however, among the hordes of arcade renditions and repeats Capcom is well known for, it comes out with a quirky, unusual title that stands out from the crowd using its old characters. The Misadventures of Tron Bonne is one of those true standouts, appearing as a side story in the newly vamped Mega Man Legends series.   Gameplay While most folks, including myself, may have believed that Tron Bonne is simply a Mega Man action-adventure game with the evil villain as the central character, this game is far from it. You play as Tron Bonne, the female nemesis of Mega Man, who starred most recently as one of the main bad guys in Mega Man Legends. She is part of a family of bad guys who just to happen to be fantastic mechanics and space pirates that keep the likes of Mega Man in business. Your mission in this multi-genre game is to rescue Teisel, your brother, from Glyde Loathe, who's kidnapped him to retrieve the money he's owed, and to collect as much Zenny (cash) as possible, all the while searching for a rare jewel.   In efforts to save your brother, you have only a few items in your arsenal, but mighty elements they are. First is the Gustaff, a rather large, powerful robot that Tron climbs into and in which she can walk, run, jump, shoot plasma shots, pick up things, throw items, and more. Second in your library of goodies are the Servebots, 40 Servebots to be exact. These are the little Lego-lookalike robots that have an amazing amount of personality and surprising abilities. They aren't quite human, but they're learning how...  While in the Gustaff, you can control the Servebots by pointing at an area, treasure chests, cracked rocks, small caves, and enemies, among other things, and have them do your bidding, or perform tasks that you can't do on your own. This is easily performed by pressing R2 and X. This little ability is just the coolest. It's not only helpful, it's fun, and innovative in a game that could have been so much less.   The game itself, thankfully, is not a clone of Mega Man Legends, the stiff action-game that sought to bring in RPG and adventure elements into its fold. Instead, while the action aspect of Mega Man Legends is a core part of the game, it's just one aspect among many. Adding in with equal weight are puzzle-based levels, minigames, RPG elements, management tasks, and even nurturing aspects.   The core part of the game, however, is really focused on relating tot he Servebots, which are simply the funniest, quirkiest, and most irresistible little critters around. I can personally resist any platform character's pathetic attempts to humor and woo my admiration, but I simply could not hide from the charm of the Servebots. You are able to speak with them throughout the game, and each of the 40 is given some kind of major personality trait -- grumpy, lazy, flaky, hard worker, serious, strategist, musician -- and it's you job to find out how you can maximize their strengths to your advantage.   In between levels you can send them out to scout other sectors of the map, while you go on missions. They find weird little items, usually food, sometimes gems, comics, or other little items, which can be used for you in battle, or are specifically meant to give to the appropriate Servebot. Once given to the right Servebot, it will increase strength, brainpower, etc, and is thus more apt to do your bidding.   After sending a few bots our to scout the land, you can train them, and talk to them. You can simply try and place them in different rooms in your HQ to see how they fare, or use them in battles to raise their strengths. Whatever the case be, it becomes quite clear that this game is more about playing with Servebots than anything else, and it provided me with several hours of childish bliss that I cannot deny.   Graphics Let's face it, the graphics in this game aren't what makes it fun. The game is made up of sprites and polygons, all flat shaded, and simply drawn, and everything is created with a simplicity and bareness that's truly more reminiscent of old PlayStation and Saturn games than of current ones. However, the character design, and the hilarious comic book expressions of all the characters are truly fantastic. The game doesn't need cutting edge graphics to make it shine, it's got more personality than it a half a dozen platformers to make up for its graphics.   Sound One thing can be said for sure, Capcom got the voice acting done by a group of true professionals who understood the game when they ported over The Misadventures of Tron Bonne to North America. The voice-acting is perfect. Teisil alone, with his grumbling, long silences, and hilarious over-the-top expressions is worth the game's weight in gold. But it's the Servebots, with their cute loyalty, ~Yes, Miss Tron!~ or ~Curry and Rice~ that wins my heart over and over again. I could play this game simply just to listen to them blunder around and talk.Rarely do I ever like games that look and play like this. I've just seen too many bad ones on the PlayStation to waste my time with them. But The Misadventures of Tron Bonne is a hilarious game that is truly sown with an equal amount of little RPG elements, nurturing, action, and puzzles to make it a must-have game. It's a gem than I couldn't ignore. Perhaps my biggest gripes with it are the long and multiple loading times, as well as the rather clunky movement and control. The Gustaff moves OK, but it's still damn stiff and annoying. My other complaint is that the actual time you take in playing the missions is ridiculously short. Obviously, the game isn't just about the missions. You spend a lot of time training and talking to the Servebots, and experimenting with which ones work in what situations. But once you add in all of the hours spent just playing with your little Bots, the game is still brief, probably under 10 hours, but it's still great fun in every single one. Luckily, the game comes with a demo of Mega Man Legends 2, so it does have that extra little bonus to make you want to buy it.If you had to make a choice between this and Mega Man Legends, I would DEFINITELY pick this one, it's just too good to resist. (Oh, and yes, we did give Mega Man Legends too high of a score.)", "date": "Jun 8, 2000"}
