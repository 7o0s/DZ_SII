From the minute I got my copy of WipEout Fusion to the very second I had to relinquish it to write this review, I played it non-stop. It is that much fun. Despite the fact that all the parties involved in the original WipEout titles have long since departed the franchise, Fusion offers up the core of the game, ultra fast racing, wicked tracks and vindictive combat, in a slick package that is more remake than sequel.   I should confess that I am a huge fan of the Wipeout series and have played every iteration on every platform, including the most recent port of XL for the Mac. Being such a big fan, I had very high expectations for Fusion, in part because it is part of my favorite game franchise, and in part because it has taken so darn long to come out in the US. After about five minutes of playing Fusion, however, my over-familiarity with the series left me with a, well, rather negative perception of the game. Fusion was simply not a WipEout game as I had come to know them.   The look is different, the gameplay is different, the developer is different, hell, this game was not WipEout. By the end of minute six, I didn't care. By the end of minute 10, I realized that Fusion was something more than a sequel to one of my all time favorite games, it was a full on remake the way Kaufman remade Invasion of the Body Snatchers or Burton remade Batman (let's not go into Planet of the Apes.) You can love the original while appreciating and enjoying the work that went into a new version for a new generation, and that is exactly what happened to me with this newest incarnation. By the time I'd finished my sixth course, I could see where Fusion drew on the WipEout legacy and where it offered completely new, and possibly more compelling, gameplay options. Bottom line, fans of the original will need time to readjust, but it is worth taking the time to get over the initial shock.   Presentation  Fusion gets high and low marks here; first the good. The classic Designers Republic look that defined the first two WipEout games is there in vestiges, but the new developers have taken it in a new direction that has a more Star Wars feel than anything else. I was stricken by the way the game visuals felt like the visuals in Attack of the Clones. There are tons of detail, highly visual, and a lot of very different styles. Where XL was a consistent, sleek, futuristic look, Fusion, as the name suggests, is an amalgam of looks and styles that combines for a pretty rich environment. The variety of ship designs is wider even than in Wipeout 3.   The look of the tracks has also changed. Gone are the high tech roller coasters on reclaimed titanium surfaces. In are desert canyons, arctic landscapes, jungle scenes, and of course the reclaimed titanium surfaces. There is more course variety, in appearance, than in any other Wipeout title.   The sound design for the game is perhaps the closest in spirit to the original Wipeout and Wipeout XL. Strong techno beats raise your pulse as you hit corkscrews or rapid descents.   Where the presentation fails a bit is the manual. There are enough changes in the way that Fusion plays that there should have been some tips and basic piloting instructions. I'll get to this in the gameplay section in more detail, but there is no longer a 3-2-1 countdown in Fusion. That is a pretty big deal and the manual doesn't address it.   Graphics  I have to admit that I'm just a little disappointed by the Fusion looks. The game has been around for a very long time. I played at E3 in 2001. The graphics look like early first generation PS2 game graphics, and a lot of the learning that has gone into the most recent PS2 games just hasn't been put to use. If Fusion had come out a year ago, or even six months ago, it would be less of a big deal, but the game is beginning to look a little dated.    Bitching aside, the frame rate stays high and steady virtually all the time. In 32 hours of play I only experienced one bad framerate experience, and that happened when there were about nine ships on screen, I had just set off a quake weapon, there were nine or 10 rockets in the air, and one ship was exploding. Even when it did choke, the framerate didn't drop to a point that it was unplayable and it only lasted about 10 seconds.   The ship designs are very nice. One of the many big differences between earlier WipEouts and this one is that as you play you can upgrade your ship. As you upgrade your ship it takes on a completely new appearance. Some ships that start out looking very cool end up kind of bland once they're all tricked out. Others start out kind of generic and end up fully transformed into a vicious looking anti-grav racer. It is a small touch, but makes racing much more interesting visually.    The track visuals lack some of the originality that marked Wipeout and XL, but where they aren't quite as innovative, they are still interesting. If you were to compare the tracks in XG3, Kinetica and Fusion, WipEout would by far be the most visually appealing. As I mentioned before, you get to race in a lot of new environments like jungle settings, cities, ice locked mountains and desert canyons. What is neat about the new settings is that they seamlessly flow from a sandy surface that kicks up dust to the clean metal of an antigravity track.   Sound  The soundtrack to WipEout is as integral a part of the game as the design, and in this area I have to give credit to Fusion. It sounds spectacular. The sound effects of all the track surfaces, the different ships, and of course, the music, are dead on for a member of the Wipeout family.    When WipEout and XL were released, the soundtracks were good enough to buy separately. Bands like The Prodigy, Future Sound of London and Chemical Brothers all contributed great tracks to the mix before they hit big in the US. The soundtrack for WipEout 3 did a very anemic job of aping the music of XL, but just didn't cut it. Although it doesn't live up to the breakthrough nature of XL's soundtrack, this version does a great job of re-creating the sound experience by offering new tracks from a lot of the same artists that made XL so great.   I do have one sound complaint. Unfortunately, the digital voice of the announcer in XL that would say ~Contender Eliminated~ after a kill is gone, or mroe precisely, it's so quiet and downplayed it's barely distinguishable. Eliminations play a much bigger role in Fusion and there was nothing quite so satisfying as hearing Contender Eliminated. It should be be and loud.      Gameplay  There is so much to write about here that the blisters on my fingers are starting to swell. First, some statistics.    32 ship models  16 different pilots  45 tracks build from 7 different courses  6 single player modes  5 multiplayer modes  26 weapons     Compare that to the ships and courses in XL and you have about four times the amount of options.   Let's talk tracks, shall we? I've always felt like there just weren't enough tracks in every Wipeout game I've ever played. Not so in here. While there are only seven courses, each course has a variety of blocks that can be opened and closed to make new layouts a la Ridge Racer. The courses are also raced backwards and in combination with a different blocks being opened or closed. While backwards courses sometimes feel like a cheat, in Fusion they really do feel like completely different tracks.   The tracks also have a number of features new to the franchise. By racing over activation pads you can change the layout of the course opening up stretches with more speed pads for example. You can also hit gravity pads that flip your ship up to the roof of the track to race.   Of course, tracks are worthless without craft to race on them and the new ships in the Wipeout 9000 league are top notch. You start the game with only three ships to choose from, each representing slightly different racing characteristics, like maneuverability or bulk. Each craft has it's own pilot with his own racing abilities. You unlock more craft by racing pilot challenges as you progress through the game. You also get to upgrade your craft with better shields, more powerful weapons, or a higher top speed by purchasing these upgrades with cash you earn in league play.   Fusion has six single play modes, arcade, league, and elimination, time trial, endurance and a speed zone mode. Arcade and time trial are holdovers from earlier games. Elimination requires you to, well, eliminate players. Zone requires you to stay the course as your ship races progressively faster and faster. Make it through 30 speed zones and you gold. Endurance is a lot like last man standing.   League mode is by far the most entertaining. The 45 courses are broken up into different leagues that get progressively harder and harder, and longer and longer. By placing high in the league standings and doing damage to your opponents, you earn cash that you can use to upgrade your ship.   There are of course multiplayer modes as well so you can tear your friends to pieces in elimination matches.   There are two big play changes that Wipeout fans are going to notice right off. The first is that the ships in Fusion fly very differently than they did in the previous games. In every other wipeout the center of gravity was always in the back of the ship and some of the faster, less maneuverable ships drove a lot like old Cameros. In Fusion, the ships all fly from the center more like rally cars, or dare I say it, XG3 bikes. The best analogy I can use however is that they fly like the ships in the old N64 game AeroGague. If you played it you know what I'm talking about. The way they fly isn't bad, but it is very different.   The second big change is combat. You always used weapons to get an edge in the Wipeout series, but if you would rather just race, you could still win. In Fusion, you can eliminate your way into first place and you must master weapons to come in first.   The worst thing I can say about Fusion is that it is buggy. It locks up. Not a lot, but it does. Every 15 races or so, it will just stop responding and I have to restart the PS2. The game, thank your deity, has an auto save feature, which I highly recommend using.I mentioned several times in this review that Fusion is a remake, not a sequel, and that really is the best way to look at it. If you come in expecting an iteration of XL or 3, you will be disappointed for at least a little while. On the other hand, if you go in with the idea that this is Wipeout with a new creative force behind it that used the classic game as inspiration, you will be thrilled.I could go on for another 1000 words about the nuances of the gameplay, about the different pilots you can open up, about how the final league you get to build yourself, but I would just be reiterating a theme. Wipeout Fusion is a lot of fun. It is the best combat racer for the PS2 yet and it is possibly the fastest racing game on the system as well. There is so much to do and so many different ways to play that you will get at months of playing out of this game.", "date": "Jun 18, 2002"}
