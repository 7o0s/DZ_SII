Kids love him for obvious reasons, and parents love him for what he does for their kids, namely keeping them delightfully occupied. To the average teenager, Pooh represents a bunch of fond memories or a sickly-sweet children's property that refuses to die. Whatever the case may be, Winnie the Pooh videogames were a no-brainer. And while some of them may have offered tasty visuals, such as the Doki-Deki developed Piglet's Big Game, most have lacked compelling gameplay.    Before going any further, it serves to note the latest Winnie game, titled Disney's Winnie the Pooh's Rumbly Tumbly Adventure is a kid's game. And when I say kid, I mean kid -- not young adult, teenager or borderline adolescent. Disney Interactive is rightfully marketing this title to children, meaning the 10 year old and below crowd. From screenshots, Rumbly Tumbly Adventure may look like your average platformer, but it's not. It's actually far simpler so that the youngest tots won't have a hard time exploring the Hundred Acre Wood.   The story, like the rest of the game, is simple and decidedly cute. Pooh and Christopher Robin are taking a leisurely stroll in the Hundred Acre Wood when Pooh's stomach goes all rumbly. Christopher Robin suggests to Pooh that he recall happy memories to psychologically block his hunger pains. Pooh finds this to be a sound suggestion and starts thinking back to the birthday parties of his furry friends in the forest.    At the start of the game, you choose between three distinct game modes, including: The Birthday Adventures, Junior Mode and Multiplayer Games. The closest thing to a main adventure or quest in the game is The Birthday Adventures, where you play through five chapters, each representing someone's birthday. Junior Mode lets you explore the Hundred Acre Wood at your own pace without limitations or objectives. Lastly, the Multiplayer Mini-Games mode lets you play a collection of single and two-player mini-games. Both Junior Mode and the Multiplayer modes represent the simplest form of ~pick and play~ imaginable. Aimlessly exploring the Hundred Acre Wood will only appeal to wide-eyed tots, and most of the mini-games revolve around collecting things. It's simple fun for the little ones -- no more and no less.      Selecting the Birthday Adventures Mode lets you choose Pooh's or Roo's birthday, with the rest locked until you beat one of the opening chapters. Each birthday ~quest~ is made up of several objectives, ranging from collecting a certain number of honey pots to helping a character find a missing tool. Seeing this is a kids' game, none of the objectives present much of a challenge. On the contrary, they'll gently lull all but the youngest gamers to sleep. You'll receive challenges from the different characters in the forest, and most of them come in the form of fetch quests.    It seems Kanga, Piglet, Tigger, and the rest of the Hundred Acre gang are among the laziest, most accident prone animals in all the world, as they're always in dire need of Pooh's help. You'll spend hours mending bridges, finding tools, collecting honey (for others,) and fixing machines. That may sound varied, but you complete most of the objectives the same way. A character will request an item (or number of items) and will then tell you where it's located. Everything is always found at a handful of locations, such as Tigger's house or Rabbit's house. There's little to no variation. You're told what to find, then promptly told where to find it.    Navigating the Hundred Acre Wood is a major pain. It sure looks pretty, but the game world lacks size and complexity. The forest splits between a number of fenced areas, each painfully small. A three-second jog in any direction will cause the game to load a new area. Since each fetch-quest requires you to cross several of these tiny chunks of forest, you'll easily encounter five load screens before finishing the objective. And loading in Rumbly Tumbly Adventure goes slow. Loading each area feels like it takes longer than it should, considering the size of the area, so you can imagine how irritating it would be to have the game load every few minutes, or less, given the situation.   During each fetch quest, Pooh and company encounter a number of obstacles, usually in the form of Heffalumps and Woozles. Each playable character (Piglet, Pooh, Eeyore and Tigger) faces the same obstacles a little differently. Pooh runs from his enemies and scares them away by popping balloons, for example, while Tigger needs to sneak by instead. Piglet actually faces each of his enemies and scares them away by making scary faces. Players accomplish this by pressing button combinations that appear on screen. Unfortunately, none of these encounters provides much challenge. They're all simple, quick and devoid of much fun, boasting as much cerebral involvement as chewing bubblegum.    Perhaps the most engaging challenge in the game is catching butterflies while riding the chronically depressed Eeyore. With net in hand, Pooh runs around the screen chasing after elusive butterflies, usually under some kind of time limit. It's fun the first time, but the activity wears thin excessively fast. Pooh also needs to solve a few puzzles, yet none of them require much thought. At times, the road to a character's house will be blocked by boxes, which Pooh then needs to push aside to proceed. Since each roadblock is comprised of three or so boxes, there's a good chance no one will have trouble clearing these puzzles in a matter of seconds.    As simple as the gameplay in Rumbly Tumbly Adventure may be, the visuals and sound still impress. The game boasts an awesome sense of style, rekindling memories of the Saturday morning cartoon. Developer Phoenix Studios faithfully recreated everything from the beloved property, from the Hundred Acre Wood to the characters, to the omnipresent narrator. Each of the characters feature silky smooth animation, with voice work matching the quality and charm of the classic show. The game makes extensive use of the infamous ~glow~ seen in games such as Beyond Good & Evil, so the Hundred Acre Wood looks just as magical as you'd imagine. The FMV sequences in the game also look fantastic. It's just too bad there aren't very many; the game engine handles a bulk of the cinematic duties.     Disneys Winnie the Poohs Rumbly Tumbly Adventure offers tantalizing visuals, but doesnt back it up with equally engaging gameplay. Developer Pheonix Studios designed the game for kids, so its understandably simple and short, but it still suffers from heinous load times. Furthermore, the game just doesnt offer much in terms of solid gameplay. It really wont appeal to anyone above the age of nine or ten, unless theyre really into Winnie the Pooh. Still, the game looks and sounds great, and the gameplay, simple as it is, would really appeal to younger kids. A definite rental for parents, and a very cautious rental recommendation for anyone else.", "date": "Feb 17, 2005"}
