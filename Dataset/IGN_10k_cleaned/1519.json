Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf, released by THQ last year on the Game Boy Color, was easily one of the worst golf titles to be released for the handheld system. But when EA Sports wanted to get back into the game on the system, the company oddly recruited the same developer of Tiger Woods for its Cybertiger property.  But it's obvious the team learned from its previous mistake, as Cybertiger is an enjoyable, quick-paced game of links. It definitely doesn't topple Mario Golf as the game to get on the handheld, but for a brief diversion around the course it's worth a look. Features Four different characters Three courses Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Color   Just by the title you know the game's not a simulation of golf. Cybertiger takes quite a few liberties in the realm of gameplay to offer a unique style on the sport. The game's got three 18-hole courses in extreme locations -- the Grand Canyon, Hawaii, and gasp a volcano. They're not as wild and wacky as you'd expect from these locations, as each hole has a standard fairway layout. And even though there are three different locations, they all offer the same exact penalty hazards -- the water in Hawaii, the sand in the Grand Canyon, and the lava in the volcano. Each hole also has a few ~secret~ Cybershot zones where the ball will transport from spot to spot towards the hole -- you can gain a cool 500 yards just by landing the ball on these ground blemishes.   The real hook in Cybertiger is its use of power-ups. Scattered along the fairway are tiny icons -- float your ball over them (it'd be crazy to expect players to duff a shot just to ~touch~ a power-up) and you'll collect the special power for your reserve. Power-ups range from a super powerful shot to a ball that can pass through any object on its way to the hole. Power-ups can also be used against a player -- Shatter Ball causes the opposing player to crack his ball and lose a stroke, where the Whirlwind sends a tornado onto the field, blowing his ball off-course (literally). The power-ups are a great feature, but admittedly they're just not ~extreme~ enough -- it feels like there should be more of them, and crazier ones at that.  The interface of Cybertiger has been influenced by Mario Golf, no question about it. The powerbar is similar, as is the top-down perspective. The powerbar is just a little sloppy and takes a bit to get used to, as half the bar is dedicated to overswing and the timing zone. Very little area is offered for the power percentage to select, so it's tough to time a 25% shot because the dang bar moves too quickly.  The game unfortunately shipped with a major bug that should have been caught in testing -- the distance indicator (the number of feet or yards your ball sits from the cup) fails to properly switch from yards to feet or vice-versa. So you can sit on the green, and the indicator will tell you that you're 49 yards away from the cup, when realistically it's 49 feet. Big difference. Same thing on the fringe of the green when you duff a putt -- you may be 18 yards from the cup, but it'll tell you that you're 18 feet away. That's a serious problem.  But the best feature is the game's link cable play -- it's identical to the one-player Rapid Fire mode where both players shoot at the same time, racing for the hole before the other guy can get to it. That's where the power-ups can really enter play, since you'd be screwing the other player with exploding balls and crazy shots -- and the fight for the power-ups on the ground can get seriously intense.  And for crying out loud, EA -- if a game requires a password as obscure as AH3#$6G>-=!6DQ39, seriously consider using a battery to save the game in progress. Give the kids a break!   The game is nowhere near as deep as Mario Golf, so if you're looking for the end-all be-all Game Boy Color golf game, choose that one. Xantara, Cybertiger's developer, did a nice job on this title, despite some quirks and the mentioned distance bug -- the game is good for a short diversion, but the fun doesn't last too long because there's only so much variety that three courses and a predictable computer AI can offer.", "date": "Nov 23, 2000"}
