You're a little ship, poised at the bottom of the screen, facing off against a slinky predator.  Fire as fast as you can, as accurately as you can.  That was the clean, simple premise of the arcade classic Centipede, and we all loved it for it. Can that twenty years of good will help overlook any potential shortcomings to this mobile version of the game?  Features: Classic arcade game High-score board  Unfortunately, the answer is a rock-solid ~no.~ This go-go version of the classic is a pale, awful recreation that bears little of the fun that made it a huge quarter-muncher back in the day. Of course, the first problem is the disconnect by not having a trackball. Fumbling with the touchpad to move your ship is a total pain. Half the fun of Centipede was the ease of control, whizzing your craft all over the board or using the trackball for very precise movements. You get none of that here.  And, since this is a cell game, most of the sound has been completely stripped out of the game. A shame, since the ~bleeps~ of Centipede were some of the best, and most memorable sounds of yeateryear's arcade -- right next to the opening Pac-Man jingle and the sounder Frogger made when he jumped into his hole.  Visually, things are completely horrible. The screen is roughly a sixth of the game screen you recall, meaning there is no room to set up the strategies that made Centipede famous. You know, blasting a particular path through the mushrooms to make the centipede follow the exact path you wanted. All in all, this is some dismal classic gaming. Bad graphics, bad sound, and bad control -- the trifecta of doom. Centipede is only two bucks to download, but that's two buck you could have put toward an ice cream cone or an issue of ~Mini Trucker Magazine.~ Avoid this pest.", "date": "Oct 7, 2003"}
