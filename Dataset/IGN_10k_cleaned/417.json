They threw together fast-paced arcade-style gameplay with cute characters (such as young Tiger Woods), but failed in creating the same experience that one received from Hot Shots Golf.   Gameplay  One of the few positive points in CyberTiger is that it has a vast array of gameplay options that stem out from the two main modes: Single and Career.  In the Single gameplay mode the player can choose between several of your basic play types that are typically in most golf videogames, such as Stroke Play, Tournament, Practice, Range, Foursomes, Four Ball, Shoot-out, and The Skins Game. For veterans of golf, most of these are pretty much self-explanatory. Here's a brief run-down of each play mode for those who may not be familiar with the sport:  Stroke Play is simply a round of golf that supports up to four players (combination of 1-4 human and/or CPU controlled players). Tournament allows the player to compete in an 18-, 36-, or 72-hole tourney against a large field of golfers. In Practice, the player gets the chance to play any of the holes in the courses that have already been opened. Range is similar to Practice, but instead of taking on the different holes, the player gets to take practice swings at a range. Foursomes is a two-on-two match where the team with the lowest combined score comes out on top. While Four Ball is a two-on-two match-up where the team wins when it has the player with the lowest score. Shoot-out pits four players in a sudden death three-hole competition, where the loser on each hole is eliminated until there is only one man standing. The last of the play modes, The Skins Game, pits two to four players against each other with a monetary value awarded for winning each hole.  Career is the game mode in CyberTiger that players will find somewhat fresh and unique. In Career, the player can take one of six young golfers through a career that begins on the Junior Tour, advances to the Amateur Tour and climaxes in the Pro Tour. The cool part is that your player's age increases as you progress through each stage.  Anyone, whether novice or expert, should be able to pick up the controls in a snap. The player can choose to use the simple one button technique that is the norm for golf games or the advanced analog method, which allows for more precise control over the golf swing and the spin that's put on the ball.  It is obvious that the developers were looking to mimic the gameplay style of Hot Shots Golf, because CyberTiger has more of an arcade-style approach to golf than being a golf simulation. While it has succeeded in offering arcade-style gameplay, it has failed to match the overall enjoyment and overall gameplay value that one got from Hot Shots Golf.  CyberTiger offers a lot of cool extras like power-up balls, equipment upgrades, new characters and new courses, most of which open up in the Range in Career mode. This is cool, but the problem is that the bonuses are not given in a way that creates a competitive and rewarding atmosphere for the player. For example, in Hot Shots Golf points are rewarded for things like birdies and eagles, in addition to winning rounds of golf. This creates a feeling that every hole is important, thus making each hole much more fun to play. Of all the differences between the two games, this is the biggest reason why Hot Shots is a great game and CyberTiger is only mediocre.  Graphics  The graphics in CyberTiger are definitely not anything to write home about. The characters are animated fairly well, but they're not too detailed and appear to be somewhat blurry. The textures of the grass and water are unimpressive and the sprite-based trees are flat out ugly.   Sound  CyberTiger features the voice of Tiger Woods and includes a lot of nice background sounds such as chirping birds, cheering fans, and airplanes flying overhead.  Tiger's speech doesn't really do much for the game, especially since he'll sometimes say something to the effect of ~good shot~ when you hit a drive into the sand.  I really loved Hot Shots Golf, so when I first heard about CyberTiger I had very high expectations for it. I was hoping that EA would copy everything good about Hot Shots and possibly add some cool new things to it. They didn't. CyberTiger is simply an average golf game that fails to copy the features of Hot Shots Golf that made it a special title.", "date": "Nov 18, 1999"}
