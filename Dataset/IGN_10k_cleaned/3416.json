The N64 had brought with it a drought of such classics, as few developers could squeeze the lengthy titles onto the restrictive N64 cartridges.  But when Nintendo announced the disc-based GameCube system back in 2000, we figured that our favorite console-maker had learned its lesson.  Nintendo gamers were filled with new hope for a resurgence of the genre that had been so recently dominated by Sony's PlayStation.  And to a larger degree, it happened -- the GameCube has been a system with a wider selection of RPG titles than the N64.  But sadly, that's not saying much.  It goes without saying that the latest Sony console has retained its position as the king of the RPG empire.  The best we've had thus far are the two recent Sega hits: Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II and Skies of Arcadia Legends.  Sure, they're both ports of ancient Dreamcast software, but they're still damn good ... and we're still damn desperate for quality RPGs.  Everybody please stand up and pat THQ on the back.  The company has seen the pain in our eyes as well as the glaring hole in the GameCube library and has decided to capitalize.  Thus, today we find a new RPG joining the slim Cube ranks, and we're excited to say that it's one of the good ones.  Note that THQ's Summoner: A Goddess Reborn on GameCube is actually a port of its previously released Summoner 2 title on the PS2.  But don't fret; we're betting that you haven't played the PS2 version yet anyway. And besides that, THQ promises a few handy enhancements to this new GCN edition.  But are the upgrades alone worth it?  Should newcomers be interested in this fantasy quest regardless of the extra spice?  Keep reading for our full verdict.  The Facts:   Control up to three different party members in your quest  Real-time action combat combined with RPG elements such as experience points, item management, and character building  Travel through over 30 fantasy-based landscapes  Lengthy single player adventure spanning over 30 hours of gameplay, in addition to optional side-quests  GameCube optimizations, including enhanced framerate  Requires 19 blocks of Memory Card space  For one player only  Gameplay The Summoner franchise has an interesting history dating back to the birth of the current console race.  The first game in the series coincided with the highly anticipated PS2 launch in October of 2000, and thus expectations were high that it would be a huge milestone in next-generation RPG gaming.  Instead, gamers were met with a wonderful-yet-flawed experience that was considered enjoyable despite its shortcomings.   THQ took their mistakes to the drawing board, and returned late last year with its PS2 sequel, Summoner 2.  IGN PS2 lauded the game as a worthy enhancement to the original, featuring both improved gameplay, visuals, and sound.  With this success in mind, THQ deemed the title worthy of a GameCube release, despite the fact that Cube gamers missed the first iteration of the series years ago.  This sequel is a great standalone RPG offering, thus to avoid confusion among Cube owners, it has since undergone a name change, dropping the ~2~ and adding the ~Goddess Reborn~ suffix.  If you haven't played the first Summoner on the PS2, then don't be discouraged -- as far as you're concerned, this GCN version is where our story begins.   And what a great story it is.  As with most RPGs, players assume the role of a mighty hero that must wander vast lands, meet a multitude of interesting CPU-controlled characters, and ultimately cast evil from the realm.  This classic RPG formula is put to use as such: your name is Maia, and you are the Queen of Halassar: an all-powerful warrior and savior of the people of your land.  As the game opens, players take control of Maia as she raids an evil pirate ship in the midst of the Midnight Sea.  Later in the game, other characters will join your party, thus founding the unique forte of this action-oriented gameplay experience.      Like a fair percentage of other RPGs out there, the Summoner series fits into the ~action~ sub-genre.  Players control all of the sword-hacking and spell-casting mayhem via a real-time control scheme that is similar to titles such as The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.  The R button locks onto targets, and successively clicking it will cycle through the available goons in the area.  The B button swings your sword, Y uses your equipped action (such as spells or items), and the L trigger raises your defense.  The A button is used as the generic ~action~ button for interacting with your environment, speaking to other characters, and opening doors.  Developer Volition, Inc., has implemented a very handy system to give players a clue when the A button is appropriate by placing subtle icons above your head when an action can be performed.  For example, a mouth means that you can talk to someone, a blinking eyeball means that you can investigate something, and a treasure chest means that you can pick up an item from the ground.  It's completely non-obtrusive, and it denies the need to randomly mash the A button as you travel.  The icons really work wonders in keeping the action flowing forward and making the interaction with this fantasy world a seamless one.  Another creative gameplay technique employed in Summoner is the party control and management system.  Throughout the story-driven action, players will control up to three different characters at a time via a very comfortable switching technique.  Pressing the L button on the directional pad will instantly cycle through each of the players in your party, allowing you to quickly position them, cast spells, attack, grab an item, etc.  This technique is the cornerstone of your Summoner fun.  You'll soon be switching between characters effortlessly as swarms of vile creatures surround your party and attack from all sides.  While players control one character, the rest of your team will typically follow closely behind.  Otherwise, you can choose to ~enter solo mode~ by pressing down on the directional pad, thus breaking your character from the party and leaving the rest standing in place.  When the computer AI has control of your unused members, you'll also be able to assign a specific behavior to them -- called ~scripts~ -- such as melee, support, healer, or caster.  This will give them some sort of brain and assigned role to play while you're either away or the entire party is engaged in combat.  It's an ideal level of party power that grants players maximum control without becoming a tedious exercise in micromanagement like other slower-paced RPGs.  The entire gameplay system works nicely to grant you full, real-time control of your entire party in a way that empowers the player to take full advantage of each warrior independently.  As RPGs go, this gameplay system is fresh, functional, and fun.  Another key Summoner gameplay component ties directly into its name.  Throughout the adventure, your party hero, Maia, will learn new spells which will summon huge beasts from scary, far-off places and allow her to transform into these hulking demons for a limited time.  The transformation will come at the cost of your regenerating ability points and is both effective and highly entertaining in combat.  You'll lumber around as an overgrown bull and pummel your foes with your fists until the spell wears off and you're able to cast it again.  The variety of summoned creatures that this gameplay element adds is just another reason why Summoner's gameplay is both unique and rewarding.  And what would an RPG be without your typical collection of spells, items, abilities, and experience points?  Summoner fully meets this genre definition, as players must navigate and operate a concise menu system to perform tasks such as equip players with weapons, distribute experience points among specialized abilities, and check the status of your entire party.  The game also features a handy log that tracks your all of your quests (completed, main, and optional) in addition to the story via the transcribed ~lore~ section.  If you've played an RPG at any point in your gaming career, then you'll feel very comfortable both understanding and implementing the concepts in Summoner.  The magic system is not as complex as perhaps the latest Final Fantasy iteration, but it gets the job done convincingly and with plenty of depth to satisfy any RPG fan in the audience.      With such a well-balanced game design in place, it's disappointing to find some areas of its execution less polished.  Namely, where the game shines in RPG party control and management, it plays less brilliantly in the pure action and fighting elements.  While the concept of switching between players in mid-combat is a great one, doing so effectively can sometimes be frustrating and disorienting.  Players must suddenly adapt to a new viewpoint and attempt to regain control of a previously CPU-controlled member, meanwhile leaving their previous character at the whim of the computer and free to start casting spells and wasting your precious resources.  It won't discourage you from switching through the ranks, but it will take some getting used to and a generous dosage of patience.  In the end, the distinctive Summoner gameplay is a novel treat for GameCube fans who are both hungry for an RPG and hungry for something new in their RPGs.  The entire quest is more than lengthy, spanning some 30+ hours of gameplay not including the countless optional quests that you can choose to tackle on the side.  The combat system is a bit clunky, but it works, and it's tough to not enjoy balancing your party inventory while simultaneously hacking the native creatures to bits with your broadsword.  Graphics When THQ first announced that Summoner would be hitting the GameCube, the publisher made it clear that the GCN version would be more than simply a direct port of the title.  Internal studio Cranky Pants was brought onto the project specifically to enhance the game and take advantage of Cube-specific hardware features and optimize the code from the inside out.  Some of the promised upgrades included, ~improved texture resolution and lighting,~ ~new lead character models and animations,~ and a brisk ~60-FPS~ framerate.  But in the end, one out of three is better than nothing -- right?  Sadly, the only such improvement that we can confirm with our own eyes is the boosted framerate (which is thankfully much improved).  While it's hard to debate exactly how much better than the PS2 version this rendition appears onscreen, suffice it to say that it does look better.  But honestly -- not by much.  While the PS2 version of Summoner 2 garnered an 8.0 in the graphics department, the visuals found in this latest translation do not live up to recent Cube standards set by other recent titles on the system.  Character models are passable but are a bit too blocky to truly impress the eyes.  Texture work is most pleasing on the main characters in your party, but other characters and (especially) environments are wrapped with blurred, stretched, and extremely repetitive textures -- complete with texture seams -- that are noticeably poor.  There is a touch of dynamic environment lighting throughout the quest, but other light sources such as spells and particle systems do not have the same illuminating affect.  Considering the vast scope of the game, it would be a true feat to wrap the fabric of this world with visuals that were richer with detail and variety.  Unfortunately, we cannot credit Volition and Cranky Pants for doing so with its Summoner GCN debut.  Sound The fantasy-based aural effects in Summoner are fairly diverse and fitting in all situations.  Creatures each have signature sounds, with original noises for grunting during an attack and moaning with pain during a death sequence.  Spells all chime and ring with unique flavor, and swords swoosh and clang nicely.  On the less impressive side, footsteps echo as you run through your surroundings but sound consistent no matter what footing you traverse, unlike the dynamic range of effects found in more polished games such as the Resident Evil remake for GCN.  The background music and environmental noises are commendable, with tribal chants banging, birds chirping, and waves of water heard lapping against the shoreline.  Unfortunately, the sound quality is -- not surprisingly -- slightly more compressed on the smaller Cube disc than what you'll hear in the PS2 release.  And to make matters less thrilling, there's no Dolby Surround support of any kind; strictly mono or stereo.  Not exactly a crowning technical achievement for the next-gen Nintendo console, Summoner has its merits in the much more important gameplay category.For the RPG-starved Nintendo crowd, the past couple of months have seen our first true tastes of quality choices.  While THQ's Summoner: A Goddess Reborn is not the best of such RPG hits, it certainly deserves to be ranked among them.  The real-time action and classic leveling-up elements blend to create a memorable gameplay experience that is well worth the investment.  If you're looking for a prettier adventure to feast your eyes upon, then there are always other alternatives to be found.  Playing and loving this game requires a certain ability to ignore its weaker technical qualities and instead embrace its unique construct and lengthy, epic quest.  If you consider yourself a fan of the genre, then we consider it our responsibility to recommend that you check this one out and see if it's something that you could loose yourself in for the 30+ hours of gameplay that it packs.", "date": "Feb 4, 2003"}
