But as time went on, so did the company's experience on the system  and while the still has yet to create the ultimate portable game, Tiertex's quality in programming and game design is definitely improving. Toy Story Racer is a decent kart-style racing title on the handheld  its impressive in graphics and tight in the gameplay, but it's the ultimate lack of variety that keeps this speedster grounded. Features 10 racing tracks based on the Toy Story world  Four playable characters, several hidden  Helping and hindering power-ups Only for Game Boy Color  Toy Story Racer is a what-if situation: what if the toys were bored just sitting around with no one to play with them? And what if no one was looking? According to Activision, they'd hop on little toy cars and race in the familiar locations all across the Tri-County area. Naturally, this little race breaks the plane of ~reality~ a bit, but hey  put on your Suspension of Disbelief cap, and drive...this game isn't to debate the possibility of this situation ever happening, it's just to have a little fun.  Tiertex's Championship Motocross 3D-style racing engine is at work for the third time on the Game Boy Color in Toy Story Racer, and it's probably the finest use of this creative graphic technique. See, the game is nothing more than a series of rendered road animations strung together as one continuous looping track  in other words, it's a full-motion video playback device. The character sprites are overlaid on top of the video, and react to the defined edges as if they were real.  The plus side of this engine use is simple  the game looks really, really cool. The game has a very 3D-style to it, because the graphics have been pre-rendered from the perspective of the cars  they'll zoom by couches and tables in Andy's house, scurry over benches in Pizza Planet, and race on realistic-looking suburban sidewalks in the neighborhood. You can't do these types of graphics in real-time on the Game Boy Color, so the next best thing is to fake it on the handheld  and Tiertex has done a really nice job ~cheating~ to get 3D on the system.  There are downsides, of course. The tracks are all of the drive-forward type -- you can't stop and turn the other way, simply because the tracks are pre-determined in their course. Locations have a specific look  each area has around a dozen pieces of track that are stuck together, and to keep the tracks going longer several pieces are reused as many as three or four times in a circuit. The problem here is that you can't mentally note where you are  it's never made completely clear which lap you're on, other than keeping a tally on how many times you've made it through the finish line (a number which is tucked away at the upper right of the screen).  Ultimately, it's up to the gameplay to determine whether or not the game's worth playing  and in this case the game is fun...for a short while. It's not much like other games in the kart-racing genre, since all of the power-up icons affect you  you can't use any weapons against the computer opponents. They'll either slow you down, stop you completely, or turn your steering all crazy-like. You'll have to avoid most of the icons rather than run into them  but there are a couple that help: an invincibility token, a grip enhancer, and an icon that'll keep you moving at top speed. The game starts out difficult since the steering is a little on the loosy-goosy side  but then the learning curve catches up to you. The game then becomes pretty easy, until the later races emphasize the game clock  if the time runs out, you move onto the next race but lose that character. And when you only have four characters to choose from, you'll run out rather quickly.  When you've only got a couple of gameplay modes on-hand, the stale taste sets in. Toy Story Racing is a nice diversion, but it's not going to hold your attention for very long. Still, the trip through is unique and challenging, and Tiertex has built the game upon a strong engine to make it look as good as it can.", "date": "Mar 15, 2001"}
