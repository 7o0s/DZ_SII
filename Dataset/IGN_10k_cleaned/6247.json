And, and a lot of gamers -- myself included -- did. After all, we were in a drought, desperate for anything to play after beating Feel the Magic. Funny that now, ten months later, you can download the same game for only $5 on your cellphone -- and nothing has been lost in the translation. This animal-matching game is just a fun, frivolous way to blow through the occasional down times of your day.   For one thing, the game is cute. Cuter than it deserves to be. The little animal heads that blinks and smile and grimace are adorable. Whoever came up with the designs for these little hippos, monkeys, alligators, giraffes deserves a raise -- and a t-shirt line for kids.   The mechanics of Zoo Keeper DX are pretty simple to get. Kind of like, say, Bejeweled, you switch pairs of animal heads to make lines of three or more. Match 'em up and they vanish from the screen, causing more animals to cascade from the ceiling. Some times they will make matches, causing combos that result in greater scores. There is also a ~lucky~ animal for each round, which is worth more points to clear. Along the bottom of the screen, there is a time meter that constantly ticks down.   And that's pretty much it. There are other play modes in Zoo Keeper DX, such as a time attack where you have to keep filling the time meter with matches. But I suspect a lot of gamers will just stick to the basic game. And they should -- it's good fun.   Now, Zoo Keeper DX is not going to supplant Tetris or Zuma as one of the classic puzzlers. There is a sense of randomness to it that will keep it away from the crown. In those other games, there is a sense of place -- puzzle pieces appear for a reason and if you are fast and smart, you can line them up properly. With Zoo Keeper DX, it seems like the animal heads just sort of appear. I never had a problem making matches, but I wish I was able to easily find rhyme and reason while playing some of the later levels of the game.   One thing about Zoo Keeper DX that I found a little strange, though, is that while playing it on a Sony Ericsson 710a, the game screen was a square sitting in the center of a pretty thick border. I'd say that half of the screen is taken up by this colorful border, leaving the animal heads to appear kind of small. This bothered me a little, even though it didn't get in the way of my enjoying the game.  Zoo Keeper DX is a good puzzle game -- not a great one. But it's cute as hell, and that will enough to put it over the top for some gamers. It's a pleasing game to look at, all those animal heads with their smiles. But it's not one of the classics, thanks to an odd element of randomness. Its not worth $40, but at $5, it's definitely worth a look for real puzzle fans. Especially if you have a younger gamer around that is curious about your cellphone. It's a good game to hand off. And after a while, you'll probably want it back.", "date": "Nov 1, 2005"}
