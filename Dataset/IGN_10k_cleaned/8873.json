And if you don't, then you have zero interest in the sport and can likely just skip this review. There are dozens of poker games fighting for your download dollars, such as Hands On's most excellent World Poker Tour: Texas Hold'em 2. But now Glu is extending its World Series of Poker license to include the celeb-heavy Pro Challenge. The Texas Hold'em game employs a charming gimmick that should interest players that really get into the overall scene and know all the big names on the circuit.   Pro Challenge stars top-tier players like Chris Ferguson and Annie Duke, plus it includes flashy celebs like Shannon Elizabeth of ~American Pie~ fame. Instead of sitting around a table with a collective, Glu pits you in one-on-one matches against these name brands. Keeping an eye on your opponent is actually a key feature, because everybody in the game has tics and tells you must pick up on if you want to succeed. Watch eyes, hands, and mouths to see if your opponent is wielding a strong hand or is trying to buy a pot.   Beating your opponent increases the tilt meter, a gauge that tracks the frustration of the player. If you keep them on their heels and fill that meter, your opponents start making errors. Things can really snowball from here, giving you opening to big bet and win bigger. It's a cool, arcade-y feature that helps set Pro Challenge apart from more hardcore poker sims. It's important to note that Pro Challenge is no lightweight -- it follows all of the WSOP rules. There's jus a breezier feel to this game.   You can either jump in and just play against these name players in a basic versus mode, but there is a deeper career mode. You chase down the bracelets needed to advance in the high-stakes World Series of Poker. The career mode adds longevity to the game, but I was actually more into the signature chips. These chips, earned for hitting in-game requirements, are a lot like the achievements found in Xbox 360 games. I'm an achievement junkie (when time and patience allows), so this feature was indeed a welcome one.Pro Challenge is a good complement to the hardcore poker sims out there, such as WPT: Texas Hold 'Em 2. They could both co-exist on your handset quite nicely. The large portraits of each player are solidly detailed, the pacing is great, and the gimmicks are expertly woven into the overall poker mechanics. Both newcomers looking for something with a lighter touch and experienced players will find something to like here. Recommended.", "date": "Aug 9, 2007"}
