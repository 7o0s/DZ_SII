Comparisons aside, Hi-Octane is a pretty good game. The graphics, while not as smooth as WipeOut's, hold their own and do have some charm. The varied landscapes that the tracks run through are very nicely done, and the addition of off-road conditions to the usual paved tracks is a nice touch. The ships handle a lot like the WipeOut hover-crafts: extremely fast and loose. The element of combat is much more furious in Hi-Octane. You're always being shot at, and enemy bullets leave holes in your windshield.  The similarities between Hi-Octane and WipeOut are many. Since both the games were in development at the same time, it's hard to say who ripped off whom. If you liked WipeOut, chances are you'll get a kick out of Hi-Octane. It's not a bad game, really. It just doesn't compare to WipeOut.   Adam Douglas", "date": "Mar 3, 1997"}
