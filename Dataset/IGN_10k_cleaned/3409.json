Blame it on the fact that the Game Boy Color didn't have the necessary power to pull off a realistic playing game or perhaps that many of the big console sports game makers simply handed off their franchises to other parties in the past, but 8-bit sports games will definitely not be remembered for their gameplay and replay value in the future. Thankfully, it looks like things are changing for the better. After delivering a respectable version of Madden for Game Boy Advance, EA is back with an all-new soccer game that looks, sounds, and plays better than any of the other GBA footie titles thus far released in the US.  Features  FIFA, FIFPro and MLS licensing Season mode: play an entire MLS season or lead your team through the international league of choice Six country settings (determines language and default teams): Germany, UK, Italy, France, US, Spain Four difficulty settings Adjustable half-time lengths and extra Two control settings Player name and radar displays Automatic and manual replays Two-player link-up Cartridge Save (two save spots + options back-up) Only for Game Boy Advance   FIFA Soccer 2003 on GBA is an impressive package. When we first saw the features list EA had put together we thought someone had just copied and pasted the console versions' features without adjusting it for the ~GBA factor~ (ie: taken out everything, then add ~two-player link-up~). In this case, though, the game does really have four difficulty modes, four goalkeeper settings, auto and manual player switching, variable pitch settings, wind, replays, an on-screen radar, selectable formation and style, detailed match stats, licensed players and teams, the English Premiereship, German Bundesliga, Italian League, K-League, Ligue de Football Professionel, MLS, Norwegian Tippeligaen, the Scottish Premier League, Spanish Primera, Allsvenskan, Swiss National Liga A, 16 other teams, and 40 international teams. Oh, and yes, two-player link-up (two cartridges required).   UK developer Exient, the team behind Total Soccer and the GBA version of NHL Hitz has done a great job at taking the feature-rich presentation and look of the FIFA series and adapting it for handheld players. The outcome is a football game that looks like EA's FIFA Soccer, but controls more responsively. Though the players are reasonably well animated, the game uses far less frames when turning with the ball, which in this case isn't a bad thing at all. You no longer have to wait for the players to go through their animation cycles before you can change direction or shoot, which gives the game more of an ISS64-like feel.   The game is played from a side-scrolling 3/4 overhead perspective with the camera fairly close to the action. But don't take that as indication of style over the substance. The zoomed in view makes it a lot easier to see the players and their moves on the GBA's small screen, and the added radar at the bottom (which defaults to on, unlike in most of EA's other FIFA games) helps you keep track of where your teammates are. Given the single pad/four button setup of the GBA, controls are simple, but get the job done. On offense, A is shoot, B = pass, and L = lob (with A doubling for headers when the ball is in the air and for one-timers when the ball is being passed). Defensive play is: L = slide tackle, A = conservative tackle, and B = switch player. R is always used for sprinting. The passing system is semi-automatic. The ball will automatically find its way to the foot of the nearest player if you're aiming in the direction of a teammate. If there is no teammate in your line of sight, the player will perform a through-pass instead. There's even aftertouch control after you've passed the ball. FIFA purists may bemoan the switch away from ~tap-sprinting~, but the sparse button layout of the GBA makes this really the perfect setup. Intuitive throw-in, corner and free kick controls round off the well-thought and very functional controls. At the same time, the lack of buttons does limit what developers can do with sports games on the GBA as there's simply no way to add a more advanced passing system or dribbling to the system's four buttons. What you're left with is inevitably a less complex game when compared with console soccer games, but still with a reasonable amount of depth and enjoyable gameplay to boot.   Feature-wise, the game is loaded. In addition to the licensed players and game modes mentioned above, you can also change your team's formation, select your tactics for each map (ranging from defensive to offensive), and determine corner takers, penalty takers, and the team captain. AI-wise, the game fairs much better than other GBA soccer games out there. Your teammates behave realistically and move with the ball, but they do leave most of the attacking up to you, so don't count on sitting back and letting your teammates steal the ball (even on the most aggressive tactics setting). Your teammates will run up to the player with the ball, but it's up to you to then perform the tackle. The default difficulty settings for both the CPU team and goalkeepers are ridiculously easy and even beginning players won't have much trouble getting ahead quickly, but the higher difficulty settings provide enough challenge for die-hard football fans. Finally, if you've got a friend or a sibling with a GBA and a second FIFA 2003 cart, a two-player link-up mode offers that extra challenge that only a human player can provide.  Good graphics and great, atmospheric crowd noises (that vary depending on the action) complete a well-put-together soccer game that will hopefully signal a new era of sports gaming on GBA.It's taken awhile, but the GBA has finally gotten a worthy entry into the soccer genre. Slick graphics and sound complement a nicely designed soccer game that succeeds on every level. The lack of a one-cart and/or four-player multiplayer mode is a minor annoyance and penalty kicks could have benefited from a different viewpoint (as the angled sideview doesn't allow for precise aiming and isn't as dramatic as the traditional head-on view), but overall this is one fine soccer game that shows that not all handheld sports games have to be dumbed-down action titles that barely resemble the console game they're based on. Good job!", "date": "Feb 3, 2003"}
