And I would probably be horrified to know how many hours I've spent playing Red Alert in my life.  It was pretty much my major in college ... at least I spent a lot more time blowing the crap out of my roommates in multiplay Red Alert than I did on my studies.  So when Warzone 2100 rolled into the offices I was eager to install it and try it out.  So many recent RTS titles have been boring rehashes of the same old thing, and I haven't played a really good RTS since Total Annihilation.  Well, after playing non-stop for a week, I have to admit that I'm happily surprised with Pumpkin Studios' foray into the RTS market.  The story behind Warzone 2100 is a post-apocalyptic tale that we've heard all too many times. A technical glitch in a satellite defense system triggered the launch of three nuclear warheads aimed at Beijing, Moscow and Washington (could it have been the Y2.1K bug that caused the problem?).  Automatic ground defenses were launched in response to the attack, throwing the earth into a full-scale nuclear war.  Less than a million people survived the destruction and the remaining individuals banded together in tattered scavenger groups fighting amongst themselves for the scarce resources left in the rubble that was once civilization.  Your ultimate goal is to rebuild North America--to restore civilization.  You've got to whip the scavengers into submission and enact a New World Order.  OK, so the story behind Warzone 2100 isn't all that original, but the designers over at Pumpkin Studios did manage to sneak in some fresh new features into this RTS which, while not breaking the mold by any means, offer some tasty enhancements to a genre that has seen just more of the same for several years.   For starters, instead of moving from one map to the next after completing a major objective, the map expands outward so you can continue to explore the area without losing any of your units or buildings.  This means that all of the resources and time put into constructing a solid base and a horde of tanks won't go to waste.  In addition your units will gain battle experience and become more effective fighters as they progress from mission to mission.  Of course, this isn't new to the RTS genre, but it is a nice feature and well implemented in Warzone 2100.   Pumpkin Studios has also done a good job handling the R&D side of things. As you progress from location to location, you'll acquire ancient artifacts that your scientists can use to research new technologies such as radar jammers, improved structures, production enhancements and new weapons techs.  Ahhhhh ... weapons techs.  You can use these new augmentations to design your own vehicles, adding different weapons, armor and mobility options such as wheels, tracks or anti-gravity hover technology which allows your vehicles to travel over water.  Sweet!  All in all you can make over 2000 different combinations, a mighty vehicle compliment for any desktop general.  As in most RTS games, you'll have to gather resources to fuel your economy.  Warzone 2100's resources of choice are oil and power.  The more oil you control, the more power you can produce.  With increased power comes increased vehicle production, building construction and research speed.  Unlike most other real-timers, you don't have to worry about getting your resources back to your base.  All of the power is just transferred to your grid, so there's no lone transport vehicle to worry about protecting while you build your forces.  There are three campaign areas, each with several varied missions and objectives.  You'll begin the game in a dusty, hilly desert terrain with only three construction vehicles and four military vehicles.  As you progress, you'll eventually duke it out in the Rockies and in an urban wasteland.  As stated earlier, when you complete an objective, the map usually expands rather than transporting you to an entirely new  theatre of operations allowing you to explore the area even further.  The missions themselves are fairly short, but there are lots and lots of objectives in each campaign, so it will take you a while to complete each campaign.  Overall, the short missions were quite satisfying as you never lose interest in a task before moving on to the next one.  And for those of you looking for a quick solo game, there's also single player skirmish mode so you can go at it without having to worry about anything but pure destruction.  Warzone 2100 uses a 3D engine and the terrain looks excellent, complete with hills, valleys, canyons and ruined buildings.  The urban settings are especially robust graphically with burnt out building husks left standing after the nuclear destruction. To ease in navigation, you can adjust the camera angle on the fly with the mouse and you have full control over camera angle, heading and zoom level.  Camera control was really quite intuitive and the movement is flawless if you have a 3D accelerator, even on slower systems.  The only problem I had with the game graphically is that your units are rather had to distinguish when you have the camera zoomed out.  Overall, an impressive job on the graphical front, though.  The AI in Warzone 2100 is well implemented and I was impressed with how many tasks your units will perform completely on their own.  For example, your repair vehicles will cycle through the damaged units within a close proximity without you having to click a mouse button.  Brilliant.  Now you can really focus on the action without having to constantly micro-manage your forces.  I also didn't encounter any glaring pathing problems with Warzone 2100, although a few errant units can still be easily lured away from the pack into an early grave unless you tell them to stay in place. The enemy AI is also quite smart, using terrain to their advantage and using advanced tactics like flanks instead of just rushing into the fire of your strongest units on the front line.  Of course, every RTS player wants to know about multiplay.  Warzone 2100 supports up to 8 players over a network or the Internet.  There are a number of multiplay options, ranging from starting base size to beginning power allotment, and eleven multiplayer maps included in the package, so there's a lot of variety here.  Unfortunately, Pumpkin Studios hasn't included a map editor in the final game, so you won't be able to find player created maps on the web ... at least not yet.    In the end, there's not much wrong with Warzone 2100, it just doesn't progress the RTS genre in many ways. Mostly it boils down to taking great ideas found in other RTS titles and combining them into one.  Pumpkin Studios did a fantastic job with that task and this one is certainly worth playing all the way through.     -- Tal Blevins I'm a huge Warcraft II and Starcraft fan, and so that's what I compared this game to in my head more than any other game. However, Warzone 2100 is probably more comparable to Total Annihilation. It's vehicle heavy and the vehicles are small and boxy. I liked Warzone 2100 way more than I suspected. It's not flashy or fast, it's not terribly gorgeous looking either, but it's engaging for several reasons. Aside from vehicle construction and tons of different commands, the aspect I didn't mention above was the level variation. From the beginning levels all the way to the end, the missions are mixed with a solid, engaging array of attack-and-seize, explore-and-retrieve, and transport style (timed) objectives. It's not a wild, revolutionary set of missions that blew my mind, but they ranged well enough and were organized smartly enough so that when I did repeat an objective-type, I didn't even think about it. In the end the weird truth is that Warzone 2100 is one of the best RTS on the system. While that shows there aren't a whole lot of these style of games on the system (and in a way it's sad), it's about time someone started doing something about it.", "date": "Apr 17, 1999"}
