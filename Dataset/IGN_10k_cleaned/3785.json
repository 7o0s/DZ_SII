There initial batch of Intellivision ports was a promising start, but it seems the developer/publisher has much bigger plans for the wireless arena, and this motorcycle racer is part of phase one.  But will MotoGP rev your motor, or does it deserve to be left in the back of the racing pack?   Features: Three tracks Licensed teams Pseudo-3D graphics  Racing games have been a tough genre for handsets to handle.  A successful racer must inspire a sense of speed, first and foremost, and the current crop of handsets just don't seem to have the guts to deliver this.  MotoGP, for all of THQ's efforts -- and those efforts seem strong -- falls victim to underdeveloped, first-year tech.  It comes across as a competent racer, but it's just not an exciting one.  Perhaps the second biggest problem, after the lack of speed, is the control.  Sure, you steer by pressing left or right on the touchpad (or 6 and 8 on the number pad), but to accelerate, you have to press up.  Braking requires you to push down.  Well, in the never-ending quest to deliver small and small handsets, we all know how teeny-tiny touchpads and number pads have become -- and how our fingers have not exactly shrunk in proportion.  This makes controlling your little bike, and maintaining a race-winning speed, quite a nimble-fingered chore, especially on the curvier of the three courses.  MotoGP contains three game modes: Quick Race, Time Attack, and Grand Prix -- which is based on the actual racing event.  Quick Race is a good way to get acquainted with the different tracks, as you just race against four other bikes on a single-course run.  Time Attack is a lonely race, just you against the clock.  Grand Prix is a three-course run, jockeying with the other racers for position and a shot at the winner's circle.  The tracks are actually fairly well-represented.  They're modeled after real-life tracks, and while the backgrounds don't exactly betray their real-world locales, at least the curves are right on.  The game tries to create a 3D sensation by scrolling the ground underneath you, not unlike Yu Suzuki's seminal racer, Out Run.  MotoGP is a rather colorful affair, too, but the bikes are not exactly that detailed.  The animals in Barnyard Bouncin' bear more distinguishing features.  And now, if we're not mistaken, these bikes are fairly loud.  MotoGP, on the other hand, is not.  We understand the audio increases the footprint of these games, but sometimes it would just be appreciated, such as in the case of MotoGP.  With the lack of speed already working against it, a high-pitched motor sound effect or squealing tires might have helped.Bottom line, this isn't the racer your handset has been waiting for.  And considering this just joins the pile of uneventful racers crowding the handset gaming scene, methinks the tech just isn't capable of providing an adequate racing experience.  MotoGP is a worthy try, but only the most hardcore of bike racing fans (and preferably, only the ones with tiny fingers) should give this DL a DL.", "date": "Jul 15, 2003"}
