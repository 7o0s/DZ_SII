Not that NBA Live 06 is the end-all, be-all powerhouse event. It's not -- it has some flaws and few detractions that keep it from stomping the competition completely. But this is such a solid package that I'm already curious to see what NBA Live 07 could bring to the smallest screen.   Five-on-five is a tricky proposition for mobile. Even on a handset with a good-sized screen, keeping track of 10 little players is not easy. There's a reason why other publishers have trimmed it down to three-on-three -- the key to solid mobile gaming is easy play mechanics. Control is tantamount in a sports game, and when you're trying to maneuver a little orange ball around a crowded screen with a crappy d-pad, frustration occasionally creeps in where it's not wanted.   Take passing, for example. Try passing to the player you want every time. You can't -- the game controls who the ball goes to, and when you are trying to set up a play, nothing is lamer than hoping the computer's choice in ballers is aligned with yours. Want to feed the ball to Shaq, who is nudging his way under the basket? Try to get close and maybe -- maybe -- the AI will connect the dots. Otherwise, its matter of passing the ball around until the desired shooter gets it. And too much passing leaves you wide open for a steal which happens with a solid amount of frequency, just like a good real-world basketball game. Realistic or not, I know some steals could have been avoided if I completely controlled whom I passed the ball to.   But there's the catch. Look at your handset and try to come up with an easy system of pass selection. This is why I'm not ragging on EA too hard for this shortcoming, because you only have two thumbs and only so many easy to reach buttons. Imagine trying to dance all over the handset, selecting a shooter, passing, passing when that shooter gets blocked, and then going for an easy jumper. My thumbs already hurt just thinking about it. And that's why other publishers trim players.   At least you can switch active players. If you make a fast break, it's easy to select the player with the ball and make a run on the basket. Dunking is a simple push of the button, and the resulting animation is mildly satisfying.   NBA Live 06 enjoys a complete license, which it puts to good use. Every single team and NBA star is in here, and while the sprites are too small to make them out, the game does cue you as to whom the big performers are. The game offers an easy Quick game option, as well as a truncated season. Instead of playing 80+ games, you can complete an entire season in just fourteen matches, not including the playoffs.   The game itself looks pretty solid. Again, the sprites are a little on the small side -- a sacrifice that had to be made to get so many players on-screen. Uniform colors are accurate and different team logos appear on the courts. The camera is dynamic, with options for a side-view, behind the backboard, and an isometric view that looks cool, but makes it occasionally difficult to spatially plan plays. The action is accompanied by voice calls from an announcer, as well as crowd reactions.  NBA Live 06 does a few things right -- and it may be enough to satisfy some mobile ballers. The full NBA license is good, the dynamic camera make things look exciting, and the announcer is just a solid addition. Controlling the action can be iffy, thanks to the game's approach that puts only some of the decisions in your hands. If I was forced to play 88 games to see a sort of conclusion to a season, I'd be tempted to give up, but the short season offers some gratification without a major time investment. It will be interesting to see what EA Mobile tries next year, as this is a solid foundation to build on.", "date": "Feb 7, 2006"}
