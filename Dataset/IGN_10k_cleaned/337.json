And Digital Eclipse is the team to go to for the best Game Boy Color conversions possible for these classics. Unfortunately, Digital Eclipse isn't infallible  Spy Hunter/Moon Patrol isn't exactly the cream of the crop from the troop. Features Conversions of two arcade classics For Game Boy and Game Boy Color Spy Hunter/Moon Patrol is a pack with two games: Spy Hunter from Bally/Midway, and Moon Patrol from Irem (and released by Williams). Spy Hunter (1983). This classic arcade game pits you in a fast-moving, souped-up vehicle with front-mounted machine guns. The idea is simple  get as far as you can in this overhead racer, shooting bad guys (dark blue cars) and avoiding civilians. Accidentally shooting civilians nets you no points. Some enemies are bullet-proof and can only be gotten rid of by acquiring enhanced weaponry: smoke screens, oil slicks, and missiles. How do you get these spiffy add-ons? Every so often a weapons van will roll up next to you  slow down and try and drive into the back of that vehicle. If you accidentally crash your car, you lose any extra gadgets you earned, so it's in your best interest to stay alive. Moon Patrol (1982). In Moon Patrol, you have to get to the end of the moon in your buggy equipped with vertical and horizonal-shooting guns. Each level is split up into five checkpoints, and you have to make your way to the end, jumping over pits, mines, rocks, and shooting alien craft and boulders. One hit and you're toast.  Graphically, these games are as close as you can get on the Game Boy Color. The artists did an absolutely stunning job converting the tiny sprites of the arcade into tiny sprites for the handheld system. Apart from a true emulation on the PC or consoles, you won't find a better looking conversion of either games than on the Game Boy Color.  It's the gameplay that brings the game down. Spy Hunter just doesn't feel natural at all, and in fact, the pattern of when enemy and civilian vehicles show up is totally wrong. And trying to get a handle on the controls in this game is just downright confusing  up/down gear shifting is awkwardly handled by the Start button, and the varying speed of your car is incredibly clumsy. And Moon Patrol, despite looking just like the arcade, doesn't react like the original at all  enemies will throw bullets at you that are next to impossible to avoid. At least you had a chance in the original.  And neither of these games utilize audio from the arcade, like the great Joust/Defender on the Game Boy Color did. These ports aren't up to the standard expected of Digital Eclipse, which is a damn shame. I loved both these games in the arcade, and as much as I wanted to like them on the Game Boy Color...I just couldn't overlook the flaws that differentiated these ports from the original. People who didn't grow up with these games probably won't notice or care, but I do on both counts  if you're going to convert without enhancements, it better play like it should. And in the case of Spy Hunter/Moon Patrol...nope.", "date": "Oct 22, 1999"}
