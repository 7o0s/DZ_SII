Just take some machine capable of great speeds, stick it on any kind of paved course -- city or rural will do just fine -- and toss in all of the necessary AI opponents and modes like Grand Prix and Time Trials. Tada -- you've got yourself a racer.  Someone, somewhere, must have drawn up and passed out such an industry checklist, and that copy has circulated straight through to the Acclaim design team.  It's latest racer, the U.K.-developed Speed Kings, meets all of these necessary racing elements and others, and it attempts to duplicate the success of another Acclaim racing title by the name of Burnout by patterning its risk-taking elements and simply slapping a motorcycle look and feel on the gameplay.  But if only the Climax London development team had worked more closely with Burnout's Criterion creators, then perhaps Speed Kings would actually reflect the same level of racing polish and greatness that the latest Burnout 2 offering delivers.  While the concept of playing Burnout on motorbikes seems like a surefire hit on the surface, it doesn't take many hours of playing this game to understand the differences and disappointments experienced in the two-wheeled spin-off.  The Facts:   Motorcycle street racing where players are rewarded for pulling stunts, kicking other bikers to the ground, and physically dinging oncoming traffic -- umm, yes, more on that later   Race and unlock up to 22 non-licensed bikes that are modeled after their real world counterparts  Five single-player modes: Single Race, Meets, Time Attack, Trick Attack, Head to Head, and Grand Prix  Six multi-player modes: all of the above plus and additional Tag mode  Arcade control and handling -- no manual shifting  Unlock hidden bikes by earning Respect Points  Build up your boost meter and zip ahead  Riders wear Official gear licensed by Shoei and Alpinestars  For one or two simultaneous players   Gameplay As mentioned, Speed Kings offers a no-surprises approach to racing.  The first option on the menu is Licenses, which is really just a quick and dirty (and optional) tutorial mode to get players up to speed on basics such as popping wheelies, handstands, and dings.  Yes, dings.  Where Burnout encourages players to build their ~Burnout meters~ by performing ~near misses,~ Speed Kings shamelessly attempts to one-up the in-house competition by actually forcing riders to build their ~Powerband meters~ by colliding into the sides of oncoming vehicles.  (Burnout, Powerband -- same thing, goofy new name.)  Sure, smashing your kneecaps into the side of a school bus when doing 140 MPH may seem like a cool ~hardcore~ or ~extreme~ racing idea, but in execution, it's laughable.  For a game that's attempting to sell it's officially licensed gear and realistic motorcycle models, adding cornball antics like this really hurts its presentation and gameplay, not to mention its frustration factor.  More times than not, attempting to bump into a passing car will leave your bike crumpled and screeching down the highway -- arguably a matter of Speed Kings skill, but this something we've deemed no longer necessary to master.  Thankfully, dings aren't the only way players can build their Powerband meters and get their nitro boost.  The game has a satisfactory trick system built in that incorporates the use of a trick button plus another odd presses of face buttons and sometimes even a direction on the control stick.  For example, a handstand can be dished out by holding the L trigger, holding the kick button, and then leaning the left analog stick forward.  Now your rider is upside down on his hands until you let go of the trick button, and as expected, your mobility and stability is severely affected while performing most of these wacky stunts.  Others like the ever-popular wheelie are as simple as just holding back on the thumb stick until your front wheel lifts off the pavement and then balancing your bike as you cruise ahead.  The on-screen trick presentation isn't nearly as adrenaline charged as other motocross console racers, but there are a few nice touches, such as a numerical counter that ticks by showing how far you've managed to hold that wheelie or how many feet of air that last big jump netted.  Driving head-on into a purple armored car is a regular Speed Kings pastime. For every trick (and -- *sigh* -- ding) done without crashing, your Powerband meter will bump up a bit until it's finally flashing and primed for use.  Just hit the Powerband shoulder button and your bike will definitely zoom away at near uncontrollable speeds.  In concept, it still sounds similar to Burnout's own meter and nitro effect, but it's much, much more simple and unspectacular in comparison.  There's no combo system to keep building successive boosts, and the graphical, wide-angle blur effect is also extremely silly.  Cars will suddenly sprout colorful streaks shooting from their backsides like something out of the latest Star Trek flick, except we don't have Scotty riding backseat to keep our bikes together as the rainbow blur blinds us and sends our rider wrapping his limbs around the bumper of an oncoming Mac truck.      Other gripes with gameplay include the all-too-often trucks that pull out across the road in front of you and require players to hit the Powerdown button and slide their bikes underneath and then snap back into racing position to continue on their way.  It's cool about the first two dozen times you do it in your first race, but playing an entire Grand Prix and being continually forced to keep an eye out for the predictably scripted trucks is annoying the whole way through.  And when you crash, you'll be treated to sweet messages such as ~Threw Bike Up the Road~ -- no, your rider did not vomit a motorcycle, that's just Speed Kings' way of telling you that you crashed (in case the onscreen bangs didn't clue you in first).  Seeing this over and over and over again throughout a race is enough to give any seasoned racing gamer a bit of nausea themselves.  All gripes aside, Speed Kings does function as promised on the cover: there are virtual motorcycles within the package, and gamers can actually race them around simple street courses through all of the standard race modes.  The bike physics, handling, and race speeds are all barely passable, but none spectacular enough to divert your attention from Moto GP, Gran Turismo, or Burnout for even a split second.  And the inclusion of tricks and very basic motorcycle combat surely won't fill your nostalgic need for classics like Road Rash or the recent crop of extreme motocross titles.  Sadly, the ideas set forth in Speed Kings and the inspiration drawn from Acclaim's far, far, far superior Burnout titles aren't enough to make this racer worth hitting the track.  Graphics Where Speed Kings offers mediocre racing thrills, it's visuals offer even less.  Repetitive and low-grade textures cruise by on buildings and pavement, and in-game models are also annoyingly repetitive.  Seeing the same, blue, armored car coming at you in three different directions doesn't make for a very believable city racing experience. And to make matters worse, only the motorcycle racers are modeled with any kind of respectable detail.  Cars, trees, and buildings are all about as simple as they can get while still managing to fool your mind's eye into buying their virtual existences.  Nothing beats a nice flop on the ground after a hard day's work. Sadly, there are no real noteworthy graphical effects worthy of mention at all here.  There are no reflections or really even lighting effects to speak of at all, particle effects sputtering from wrecking bikes are blocky and unimpressive, and the game even stutters from time to time in the frame-rate department.  The PS2 version of the game suffers from slight fogging, where the GameCube and Xbox versions are relatively polished and tuned in comparison.  Sound Just when you were hoping that the review might end on a positive note, we come to the game's audio offering.  Unfortunately, we cannot bring you such news.  Motorcycles have never sounded more dull and lifeless as they have in Speed Kings.  There's no loud grunting, gargling, and whining of a finely tuned hog or crotch rocket here.  Swishing traffic sounds very repetitive and vague, and worst of all -- the music.  The techno-adrenaline pulsating beats are unimaginative, bland, and like most other aspects of the game: repetitive.  The best words to describe it are annoying and totally unnecessary.With Speed Kings, Acclaim is attempting to tweak and reuse the inspired formula crafted by the Criterion Burnout design team under the guise of a new motorcycle framework with slightly new gameplay twists (those horrible dings as opposed to near misses), but we're not buying it.  There's nothing that Speed Kings does that Burnout 2 doesn't smoke right off the line in every way possible.  Physics, speed, track design, opponent AI, handling, graphics, audio -- Speed Kings really offers much, much less for your money.  Granted, the game is playable, and players looking for a simple motorcycle game to mash the gas button while attempting to pull off ho-hum stunts may find a mindless and unspectacular distraction here with Speed Kings.  But we certainly can't say that we recommend it, and in fact, we highly recommend that speed and arcade racing junkies either run out to buy the still far superior Burnout 2 instead, or simply just dust off the copy they've already got stashed on the shelf.", "date": "May 29, 2003"}
