The game re-wrote some of the rules on how to make a licensed title, such as turning you into a de facto CTU agent controlling agent deployment and computer secrets via your own cellphone. It was one of those ~you are there~ moments, and was justly rewarded. A year later, I-play returns to the scene with a sequel, subtitled Agent Down, and while it improves on the mini-games from the original, it jettisons the innovative casting of the player as CTU agent and zeroes in on series hero Jack Bauer.   The decision is wholly understandable. The character is strong enough to drive an entire show and so I imagine a lot of fans wanting to be Jack, not play catch up. But because this is a cellphone we're talking about, not an Xbox, you don't really get that thrill of stepping into Jack's scruffy anger. Especially considering that Jack is represented by a tiny figure on a thermal read-out for the majority of this 24-hour adventure. I'm not complaining about the graphics, because I think Agent Down continues the interesting look of the original, but it's not entirely easy to connect emotionally with a red and orange stick man.   The story -- which we won't spoil here -- starts with an assault on the Los Angeles CTU office. Terrorists have seized the building and are holding Jack's fellow CTU agents hostage. It's up to Jack to liberate the hostages and neutralize the terrorists. Par for the course in anything 24-related, there is not straight line between points A and Z. At the onset of the game, fan-fave Chloe directs Jack into the heart of the building and provides intel assistance for most of the game via dialogue scenes complete with little character portraits. It's important to note that the story, penned by a 24 writer, is fully in line with the show.   Agent Down is essentially divided into two games. The action scenes show Jack hunting terrorists with a certain amount of stealth mechanics. Jack relies on hiding in shadows to avoid detection and the use of a tranquilizer gun to knock out the bad guys. Once down, you can drag bodies into the shadows so as not to raise an alarm. Jack also has some cool decoys he can place and then detonate remotely, causing a ruckus that distracts terrorists and often clears a safe route to an objective. When brute force is required Jack can call on Curtis to snipe terrorists. While sniping, however, Jack is immobile, so it is in your best interest's to guide CTU's main man to safety before taking to the scope. The sequences are better than the action scenes in the original game, thanks to new tools and just generally smoother presentation.   The other half of Agent Down is the litany of mini-games you must play when you need to pick locks, hack computers, or diffuse bombs. To pick a lock, for example, you must stop a reticle on a rotating series of lights. To hack a computer, you must physically guide a piece of code through a digital landscape by pressing the OK key to keep it aloft through a minor obstacle course. There are number memorization games, block pushing contests, and connect-the-route games, too. All of the mini-games are solid this time out, but my least favorite was the rotating lights sequence. I preferred the puzzle-oriented mini-games instead.   What's missing? The driving game is outta here. And I know that some players of the original game will be pleased to celebrate its exile.   One of my favorite things about Agent Down is the carry over of game structure -- every few minutes translates into an hour of 24-time. You can play as little or as much as you like without having to clear a schedule. And because each ~hour~ inches the story along, there is constant reward for coming back to the game. That's just smart mobile design. You can also practice the mini-games as much as you like outside the main campaign, which should help dearly in a second play through.   On a purely technical standpoint, Agent Down is superior to the first game. The visuals are better, the mini-games are stronger, and the action scenes are smoother with good controls and clever enemies. I personally regret the choice to cast the player as Jack, but again, I understand the logic behind the decision perfectly. So, why does it score less than the first game? Because Agent Down is a refinement of the original game, not the brilliant innovator. I don't hesitate to recommend it in the least, though, and I cannot imagine a single fan of the television series being disappointed with this download.", "date": "Jan 5, 2007"}
