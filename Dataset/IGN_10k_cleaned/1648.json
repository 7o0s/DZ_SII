Ironically, the argument could also be made that last year LucasArts returned the favor when it released the officially licensed Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine for PC -- a game that so closely resembled the look and feel of Tomb Raider that it was undeniable. Unfortunately for PC players, while the product delivered a strong storyline and cleverly designed puzzle-filled worlds worthy of Dr. Jones' name, it also suffered considerably from the same shortcomings of Croft's; in particular, a terribly disorganized control system and a good amount of bug-ridden code to boot.  Zoom to the present. LucasArts has teamed with developer Factor 5 to bring The Infernal Machine to Nintendo 64 owners -- only this time without the inherent flaws of the PC version. To its credit, the company has largely succeeded. Indy 64 sacrifices nothing from the PC version, except for many of its frustrations. It looks just as good, if not better, and thanks to a totally redesigned control scheme, it feels as it should have to begin with -- more intuitive, tighter, speedier, and all around more balanced. All of the puzzles and superior level design of the PC title, meanwhile, remain perfectly intact. It is not a perfect game, mind you, but it's the best version of Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine ever created -- and it blows the top off any of today's Tomb Raider offerings too.  Before we continue with the review, a special note: Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine can not be bought in retail stores. You can, however, purchase the game through an online offer at Blockbuster Video's website. If you enjoyed any of the Tomb Raider offerings, consider yourself a fan of the Indiana Jones franchise, or are just looking for a quality action-adventure on your N64, we recommend you make the purchase. It's one of the console's last great selections, and you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you overlooked it simply because it wasn't available through regular retail outlets.

Story According to LucasArts The game begins when the CIA, led by Indiana Jone's old friend Sophia Hapgood brings him alarming evidence that a Soviet physicist Gennadi Volodnikov has been searching the site of the Tower of Babel. The Soviets are looking for evidence of an ancient machine that can open the door to a parallel dimension called the Aetherium. Volodnikov and his Communist henchmen are anxiously trying to reassemble the machine, but need to find several crucial parts to get it working. The missing parts, scattered throughout the far corners of the globe, are the targets of Indy's quest.  Gameplay You have played Tomb Raider. Imagine Lara Croft wasn't so voluptuous. Now imagine she wore a hat and carried a whip. Welcome to Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine. The design behind the game is not original, but it does bring some new elements to the puzzle-filled action-adventure genre and there is enough variety to keep gamers happy for a long time to come.   Indy travels through 17+ different levels solving puzzles, taking out enemies and collecting priceless artifacts. He can use a variety of weapons and gadgets -- everything from a standard gun and machete to a shotgun, lighter and yes, even magic. Along the way our hero will also have to boat down rivers on a raft, drive through deserts in a jeep, jump, climb, swim, crawl, whip, swing, and slide his way to victory. The selection is commendable. In the PC version of the game simple tasks such as using weaponry were a chore as everything was confined to different keys. For the N64 ~port~ LucasArts and Factor 5 have taken notice of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time's C-button item scheme and copied it. There's no shame, really -- it rocked, and it works just as brilliantly in Indy's world. Utilizing it, selecting an item is as simple as hitting one of three C-buttons. For example: C-left pulls out Dr. Jones' whip while C-right unholsters his gun and C-down his lighter. C-up, meanwhile is used for a free-view mode in which players can simply look around at their environment -- helpful when one is stuck.  Another major innovation over the PC version's control scheme is the inclusion of an additional feature made popular with Miyamoto's Zelda title: the z-trigger lock-on. When Indy's weapon is drawn, players can lock onto an enemy with the R button, at which point Dr. Jones can simply strafe around his foe and continue to fire with a fixed camera angle. It works splendidly -- just as it did for Link in his battles. It's a seemingly simple addition that in actuality goes a long way to make the feel of the adventure more intuitive, thus giving the player more confidence in their ability.   Not all is well in Indiana's new adventure, though. Certain shortcomings from the PC version are still evident in the N64 one. The control, while improved greatly, is still awkward. Indy is Lara Croft-like in his movement -- slow. He is not an acrobat capable of jumping from ledge to ledge, sliding down slopes and diving with perfect precision through a window across a chasm. Rather, he must be turned around, carefully positioned, and then given the okay to go for it, but even then there's no guarantee that players will successfully defeat whatever manipulation goal they were hoping to. Like Tomb Raider, a certain degree of patience is required to play with Indy, and if you never liked Lara's moves, you won't like Dr. Jones' either. Also, there are occasional problems with collision detection. Indiana has bounced off a ledge we had intended him to grab onto before, and similarly he has gotten caught on a rock while rafting or stuck in a wall while exploring, leaving us no choice but to reset. These examples are rare but noteworthy.   The layouts of levels are nearly identical to those found in the PC version; huge, themed worlds with massive, stretching puzzles that trigger new puzzles, that in turn unlock new puzzles. Indy must battle tigers, run over hyenas with his jeep, avoid raft-popping rocks in the rapids, jump over boiling lava, break through walls with magic, shoot dead Russian soldiers, ride mine carts and avoid being poisoned by disgusting reptiles and insects. He must travel from snowy mountaintops to dusty deserts, through underground pyramids, into forests and down dark, underwater chasms that seem to keep going and going. Players will absolutely not get bored with the complexity or variety the game dishes up, and that goes a long way to enhancing replay value. Another, perhaps more important replay booster comes in the form of the treasure Indy collects. Priceless artifacts are hidden through every level in the game and as Dr. J collects them his IQ goes up. Once he attains a certain IQ, a very, very impressive secret is unlocked. It's definitely something for the master gamer to shoot for and the good news is players can go back into already-beaten levels at any time to seek out and save treasures.  Graphics Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine is one of the prettiest titles to ever grace a Nintendo 64 cartridge. LucasArts and Factor 5 have actually improved the visuals in many ways over the PC original. Think gigantic, intricately detailed worlds with magnificently ambient, crisp texture work that will have you wondering if it's actually an N64 product and lighting effects that are just as impressive. Add in an energetic particle effects system -- something the PC game lacked -- that enables rocks that fall from textures as Indy climbs, or flames that shoot out sparks as they bend with the wind. Couple everything with huge 3D architecture and an amazing amount of variation from level to level. Now for the kicker -- everything runs in 640x480 high-resolution mode given players own a 4MB Expansion Pak. For the unlucky that don't, Indy defaults to low-resolution mode, but the quality of the textures and the way in which they are laid out still gives the title a visible edge over just about any other N64 game out there.   In fact, the only real downfalls to the graphics are the animation system and, occasionally, the framerate. Indy walks, crawls and climbs as if he's got something incredibly painful camped out in his rear-end -- just as he did in the PC version. It is the only aspect of the 64-bit effort that we wished had been addressed. The framerate, meanwhile, can drop in large outdoor environments with several enemies on-screen at once, but because the adventure is often confined to indoor areas and is not setup in a way that calls for dozens of foes at once, it's rare that the fluidity dips to a noticeable degree.  Sound The Factor 5 crew has unleashed its MusyX tools to make the N64 version of Indiana Jones a much better listening experience than the PC one -- and that despite the fact that it's on cartridge. Everything in the game booms out in full stereo surround sound from the large selection of moody music (triggered at key events) to the lengthy speech delivered in cut-scenes, and to the in-game gunshots, explosions, grunts, growls, hisses, boils, screeches, and more. Additionally, the voice acting is usually of top quality too, which is hard to come by in any console game. You will not be disappointed. Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine is the Tomb Raider that Nintendo 64 owners never got. It's a complex, sometimes downright difficult puzzle-filled action-adventure with beautiful visuals and a fun storyline. Thankfully, the title is also much improved over its PC predecessor. LucasArts and Factor 5 have reworked the control scheme greatly so that it's much more intuitive and fitted toward console gaming. In addition, visuals have similarly been enhanced to allow for better lighting and particle effects, not to mention a spectacular degree of texture detail for a 64-bit cart. But not everything is happy and swell. The control scheme, while definitely fixed in many ways, still bears some resemblance to its PC forefather and because of that is still on the clunky side -- slow and very familiar to those who have controlled Lara Croft in her countless adventures. This is a shortcoming that's easily dealt with, though, and in fact it's one that some gamers have even grown to enjoy if sales of Tomb Raider are any indication.The bottom line is that if you've ever found yourself even remotely interested in Tomb Raider, Indiana Jones, or puzzle-solving action-adventure games, this is the best one Nintendo 64 will ever get, and it's a fine one to have in any library.
