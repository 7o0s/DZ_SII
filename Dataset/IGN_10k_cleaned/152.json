Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/04/10/sam-max-season-two-episode-5-whats-new-beelzebub-review", "text": "Following on the heels of Chariot of the Dogs, it's safe to say that this last season of Sam and Max is really going out strong. Not only are the jokes and puzzles funnier and hipper overall, but the actual content of these last two episodes finally fully embraced the skewed reality that was merely hinted at in previous episodes. Best of all, the last two episodes, to paraphrase Jeff Lebowski, really tied the season together. Sam and Max 205: What's New, Beelzebub? is the perfect end to a strong season and, Tom Jones' absence notwithstanding, really delivered the goods.  Now, we don't want to offer any spoilers here for anyone who hasn't played the previous episode, so let's just say that this episode starts with Sam and Max in a subway tunnel right on the banks of the River Styx, and desperately looking for a token to take the soul train to Hell. (This is Sam and Max so let's not worry too much about how a train runs on a river.) They're hoping to recover the soul of one of their dear, departed friends who was unfortunately sent to Hell in the previous episode. Now Sam and Max have sent plenty of people to hell, intentionally or otherwise, but they seem really concerned to get this particular soul back above ground.   Hell itself is wonderfully realized as a rather dull business office where it is eternally 4:59 on a Monday. Villains from previous episodes are now relegated to pushing paper in cubicles, which is a nice touch, but it would have been great to see a bit more humor centered on the drudgery of the office. I mean, the seven deadly sins motivational posters and sexual harassment gag is great, but most of the skewering of the soulless corporate culture is just a backdrop for the setting.  Still, almost all of the old characters are here, either in a new spectral form or as still-living witnesses as Sam and Max's unfortunate influences in Hell spill out into the rest of the world. A few of the old characters have new jobs in Hell while others are less than enthusiastic about their stay here. In fact, there's an entire wing dedicated to those poor folks who Sam and Max have sent here personally and you'll have a chance to visit them in their own private, diorama-sized hells. In order to move things along in the story, you'll even have to pop into those tiny rooms and find a way to ease your victims' torment. Since each room is dedicated to a character you've already met, it's a nice tie-in to previous episodes.  The only really new character is Satan himself, brilliantly realized as a rather composed and collected manager with a James Mason accent. His ability to walk into a scene, hooves, horns and all, and deliver verbal warnings about workplace inefficiency is definitely one of the highlights of the episode. The voice acting and visual styling are fantastic. We particularly like the squiggly chest hair and the receding hairline.   Without giving too much away, this episode also brings back the Soda Poppers, who I have hated pretty much since day one. Normally the appearance of the [censored] Poppers would be an invitation for criticism but we have to say that their inclusion here not only validates their frequent appearances in the previous episodes but also actually puts it in a context that makes us glad that they're around to be hated. If that sounds confusing, we're simply trying to avoid giving away too much of the story. Suffice it to say that their presence in Hell will vindicate your hatred of them. If nothing else, it's worth it for the scene where Peepers tries to seduce Sybil.      There's lots going on up on the street level too, from the COPS running a triage (complete with a laughing-gas-affected Bluster Blaster who now sounds like Tommy Chong) to the absolute worst bachelor party you will ever see.  The puzzles are getting better all the time, and this latest batch is no exception. The individual elements are consistent with the lunatic nature of the Sam and Max world but also have a sort of logical inevitability that encourages thinking rather than guessing. It's true that there are more pieces and sequences to some of the puzzles here but if you're paying attention and at least a little persistent, you won't find yourself stumped all that often. Getting Santa out of his Hell diorama or finding a way to thwart the demon in Stinky's Diner requires you to collect and connect a number of seemingly unrelated items. On the other hand, finding a way for Max to beat Sam's new partner, or for the COPS to win a fiddle contest are as easy as using Obvious Item A on Obvious Location B.   Our only real complaint is that this episode sees a return of the pointless traveling between locations. The artists have every right to proud of their design of the Styx subway but there's really only two puzzle elements worth exploring here, one of which is solved before the title screen ever appears. This location (and the completely pointless reception room that follows it) really just slow things down, particularly when you stop to consider how often you have to run back and forth through them to get from Sam and Max's neighborhood to Hell's main offices.  What's New, Beelzebub includes the obligatory driving game but this time around, there's nothing at stake except the acquisition of a few incidental decals. It's worth playing just for the setup and Max's reaction to the mission, but you don't need to complete it in order to progress through the game. There is one other sequence in which players will have to drive the car but it's not a skill or time-based encounter. Outside of that, this particular episode didn't have any mini-games at all.  We almost feel that it's redundant at this point to praise the graphics and audio in a manner that might just as well but a cut-and-paste from the reviews of the previous 10 episodes. The artists and audio designers know their craft and this world well by now and the work is up to their usual high standards. Of the new elements, we can say that we were quite pleased to see a little more variety in some of the old locations and were more than satisfied with the invention and atmosphere that were incorporated into the new elements. To be fair, the office in Hell is supposed to be boring, but the artists nevertheless found a way to add in enough humor and personality that you actually want to explore the space. Speaking of personality, the slouch that Sam adopts when he's separated from Max actually, for the first time, elevated this entire series to an entirely new level that wasn't just about ridiculous jokes.   If you're worried about too much pathos creeping into the game, you can rest secure in the knowledge that just prior to that poignant diversion, Sam and Max actually kill two characters and trick Death into taking the rather virtuous one of them to Hell. So, we're all good here.  The musical score and voice acting are as good as always here, and go a long way towards making the world feel a bit more solid and believable. There's no musical number this time around but there is a giant robot that channels Gloria Gaynor, which is almost as good. Also, there's a memory problem that prevents music from playing during the final celebration scene if you've played the game straight through in one sitting. It's not a problem if you quit that game at some point and resumed it later but the team is hoping to patch it for those of us who like devour and entire episode all at once.What's New, Beelzebub? is definitely a great ending for a great season. While it has taken the writers and designers a while to find their comfort level with this version of Sam and Max, the last two episodes show that they've really firing on all cylinders. The overall corporate atmosphere of Hell and the characterization of Satan are hilarious and, better still, the actual content of the episode ties up the first two seasons very nicely. The puzzles aren't quite as challenging or rewarding as they were in Chariot of the Dogs but that's a minor criticism, because they're still very good overall. We did like the small hints at further episodes to come but, honestly, after a season that went from Santa's Workshop to a zombie rave to outer space to Hell, the designers are really going to have a hard time topping themselves.", "date": "Apr 10, 2008"}
