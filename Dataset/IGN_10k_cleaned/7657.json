As mentioned in our review of Uno 52, it's a little absurd that these games weren't combined into one package, especially considering some of the massive handheld collections coming out lately (like Clubhouse Games for the DS). Still, there's no denying that these games are incredibly polished efforts based on two of the most enjoyable card games out there.    For those unfamiliar with Uno, it involves distributing a deck made up of cards that each have a number and a color. A card is placed in the middle of the table, and players take turns covering the top card with one of their own, matching either the color or the number. The idea is to get rid of all one's cards before the other players. Anytime a card can't be placed, more must be drawn and there are loads of special cards that speed up the process or punish the other players. When players get down to just one card, they must shout ~Uno!~ or else take two additional cards for their silence.    This collection includes the classic form of Uno, as well as the popular Skip-Bo, which doesn't really have anything to do with Uno other than it also involves getting rid of cards. Skip-Bo could best be described as chess to solitaire's checkers. The game is played with cards numbered 1 to 12. All cards are distributed among the players, and 4 cards are set in the middle of the deck. Players use each turn to unload as many of their cards on these piles as possible; a card can be placed on top of a card with a value directly below it, so a 9 can be placed on top of an 8. Players can also build up their own 4 piles of cards, which can be pulled from at any time. The object is to be the first player with no cards left.    Compared to the frantic and immediate nature of Uno, Skip-Bo is a more thoughtful, slow-paced game and nicely balances out this collection. It also doesn't force the bizarre wild cards on players that Uno features, allowing for more reliance on strategy than luck; unique cards can be turned on or off, although the default setting is to play the game without them. Unfortunately, like the other DSI Uno releases, what hurts this collection is a lack of additional modes. There are plenty of options in both games, and the menus and interface are easy to follow. But affecting gameplay is pretty superficial, relegated to adjusting how long rounds go on, how difficult AI-controlled opponents are and whether games are played for points or not. Playing in teams is available, although this affects scoring more than the actual gameplay.    Minor options and tweaks in these games however are robust and just about anything a player would ever want to change is adjustable here. Players can change the number of players, number of AI opponents, song, background, name, avatars, AI difficulty, what ends a game, point values, house rules, alternate cards, infinite draw, penalty for forgetting to say ~Uno~, individual wild cards and about ten other options I won't go into. All of these default to the classic rules, so they're available to adjust for Uno aficionados without overwhelming novice players who want to just jump into a game.       Graphically, the game holds up as well as Uno 52 did. Cards are legible and animated. Backgrounds feature large looping animations and add some spice without distracting. The layout of the board in each game is well-composed. Menus and tutorials are very polished and really show the developer's desire to make these games appeal to all audiences. Sound effects are perfect and kept minimal. Songs work well with each game, although there are only 4 songs used in this game (apparently, across all DSI Uno games). This is slightly disappointing, since Uno and Skip-Bo each feature their own unique boards and backgrounds, but not songs.    There's very little to complain about in this collection, other than the fact that DSI has split up their Uno games across 3 almost-identical Game Boy Advance releases. It would have been nice to be able to skip through shuffling animations or AI-controlled turns, since there is the occasional bit of waiting. But both games move at an acceptable pace. Each game features a multiplayer mode that allows up to 4 players to play together, although this mode is single system only. This means that players take their turn, then pass the GBA to the next player. It works a lot better than it sounds, although it kills the challenge of having to shout ~Uno~ since players can hold onto the system as long as they want before passing it on. Uno Skip-Bo is a solid pairing of two enjoyable games on the Game Boy Advance. It's a little ridiculous that DSI chose to spread its four portable Uno games across three different releases, instead of combining them into one must-buy package. But each game plays great and exhibits a level of polish not often seen on Nintendo's handheld. Of the three DSI Uno releases on GBA, this is the one to pick up.", "date": "Nov 22, 2006"}
