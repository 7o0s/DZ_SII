It never sold well and, despite its bold sense of style and hip female power, it took about three hours max to beat. The Dreamcast needed a whole lot more than short, pretty dance games to stay alive, and clearly, Space Channel 5 wasn't the answer.   But sales don't mean jack. For those who love music games, every new title in the ultra nichy genre presents a fresh opportunity to use their consoles to get down. Despite the heavy wrangling and political difficulties it took on Agetec's part to get Space Channel 5 Special Edition to the US, the final result couldn't be better. The ~Special~ part of this edition is that this is a double pack of the original Space Channel 5 and Space Channel 5, Part 2 . It's two dance games in one for the stunningly cheap price of $14.99 - Yes! It's a steal. If you have any mind for music games, you need Space Channel 5 Special Edition.    Disc 1: Space Channel 5  This is the original game Dreamcast game ported by UGA to PS2. Nothing has been changed to the content, so it's exactly the same game, though technically, the visuals have suffered a bit in the port process. Still, despite the aliasing, shimmering, and simplistic textures, the flamboyant panache of Space Channel 5 carries with it enough outrageously silly flash to make up for the lack of real substance.    Following a short period in the career of a TV space journalist in the 25th century, players step into the go-go boots of Ulala, a hip, dance-happy chick who follows several leads on victims made to dance against their will. Players spend the entire two-to-four hour game freeing trapped innocents from the deadly clutches of the funky alien race known as the Morolians.   Capturing the gogo-dance frenzy of mid-'60s England, UGA fuses a Jetson's space age design to set the tone. Space ships are round and primitive, artistic and un-aerodynamic. Mini-skirts are metallic in texture and mimic lamp-shades in form. Even Ulala's gun, holstered with a single leg strap on her thigh, looks like it's borrowed from Buck Rogers.     One of the game's most appealing factors is how Ulala and her growing posse of dancers react to players' performances. ~Freed~ citizens move in step with Ulala, as they form a dance triangle behind her. If she mimics the enemy perfectly, the dance steps are nimbly performed and energetic. If she goofs a session, Ulala and crowd lower their heads and slump along, like sad Valley Girls in a B movie. The visual aesthetic is unique among games in that UGA has modeled the scenes from well-respected musical cinema, so each scene looks and feels like an interactive chorus line. The corralling of hilarious characters including Keyboard Grrrl, Space Michael (an official appearance by Michael Jackson, including his snap-strut and trademark ~Hooo~) and Channel 42 reporter Pudding helps to make the game especially good campy fun.   How she frees the helplessly dancing citizens, of course, is the best part. Using only four directions on the Dpad and either X for shoot (pronounced ~choo~) or Square to free trapped citizens, players follow a standard setup of simple Simon-says levels, followed by increasingly difficult dances steps, then a boss, and then the whole thing over again. What's interesting here is that, unlike many visual games before it (such as Dance Dance Revolution or Parappa the Rapper), there is no visual cue for gamers to determine if they've got the beat right; everything is based on their ability to listen and feel the beat. Players know if they've done well because a realtime score on the bottom right side of the screen indicates how high their TV ~Ratings~ are and, at level's end, a ~Minimum ratings~ score and an ~Expected~ score help place that particular performance. The game moves quickly once you get into it, but you'll need a room with no extra chatter (or a good set of earphones) to hear things perfectly.     The downside to Space Channel 5 is that if you lose a level, you'll have to start all the way at the beginning, and it happens more often than you'd expect. The game isn't presented as clearly as it could have been, especially given one of its strengths, the lack of any major visual confirmation of a dance step. A visual stickler of another sort is that the animations are often slower than the beats, so that if you were paying attention to Ulala's movements, you might be thrown off because they seemingly merged with the next move. Although subtle, it took me a while to realize I could hit the next button despite the lagging animation.    In the end, the first disc -- Space Channel 5 -- is more of a collector's item at this point. It's a quick jaunt into dancing madness, and then, just as quickly, it's over. The portal process sucked dry any of the visual oomph from the game, which didn't age well either (the disc streaming process looks fuzzy and dull). But then again, for $15, it's all good.    Disc 2: Space Channel 5, Pt. 2  Previous to the release of this Agetec double pack, the sequel to the original never made it to US shores. Is that a downright shame, or a fortunate break? The way we look at it, it's the latter, because the result is the bundling of Space Channel 5 Special Edition for $15. Fifteen bucks! Good God almighty!   A traditional sequel, UGA's Space Channel 5, Pt. 2 fixes everything about the first and thankfully adds new aspects to enhance the dance madness. Visually, several things have been straightened out: The shimmering and aliasing have all but vanished. The longish blacked out load times have been animated and made nearly seamless. And then there is all of the choreography, background design, the addition of new outfits, items and the huge laundry list of new characters. Plus, players can soft save from midway through a level.    The level design on a visual scale is classic in its extension of the absurd. If the settings seemed unrealistic and bizarre before, the lunatic designs of space stations, rivers, schools and arboretums is maniacal in Space Channel 5, Pt. 2. They're more colorful, offer more polygons and are more interactive. And they're filled with cheap but likeable puns and jokes. At one point, a giant plant boss who's captured the Space President: Peace uses its slimy tentacles to grab Ulala, who coos, ~Oooooohhh, not there!~ (Naturally, she frees herself unprodded.) Also, UGA has done an excellent job of using visual cues to indicate when to hit the buttons with moving items on screen (in some cases) to create a better overall presentation.    With regard to the game itself, the tweaks and additions make Space Channel 5, Pt. 2 a far superior game to the first. Ulala's animations are quicker, so quick in fact that they never overlap -- or feel like they're overlapping -- with the upcoming beat command. The quickening of her moves is entirely necessary too because she has to perform a far greater set of moves, thanks to a greater variety of musical styles.      The musical styles range from rock, mod, '30s jazz, disco, techno, even waltzes and more. If you played the first, then you'd know that the music rarely differed, so this expansion is a relief and a joy. For those who loved the original theme song, you'll be glad to know it's still in here under the veneer of several audio guises. The new range of songs is a Trojan horse of sorts. Along with these new beats are a tempest of tempos and rhythms that players must get adjust to and practice to get right.    Like it or not (I love it (Umjammer lives!!!)), Ulala also extends her musical repertoire to include playing guitar, which commences with a battle against Channel 42 competitor, Pudding. In another interesting touch, players perform timed button taps in karaoke style singalongs, which, at the very least, adds to the broadened gameplay.   With this sequel, UGA has broadened the game's scope by enabling players to enter into different gameplau modes, including single and two-player challenge modes (1p or 2p Ulala's Dance), as well as Two-player Story mode (you tap the directions while your buddy taps the right buttons). This latter is far more theoretical fun than real fun. The scoring system is a little less rigid, since players no longer have a minimum or expected score system, but the game has been upped in difficultly level and in length, so players can enjoy it for more like five to 15 hours (to collect everything).   Lastly, players can collect an amazing assortment of goodies in Space Channel 5, Pt. 2, which has become a kind of rhythmic-RPG of sorts. With nearly 100 new non-player characters that Ulala saves from the new enemies (a.k.a. Rhymes Rogues Group Leader Shadow), players collect items (fans, etc.) and outfits (about 40), in which to dress Ulala. This twist on the traditional music-rhythm game isn't new (Parappa had his hats and guitar-playing Unjammer unlocked a singing Parappa), but it creates a new set of goals for the fan, who will want to collect all of Ulala's outfits and compare these with a friend's.    Why is there no progressive scan or support for Dolby Pro Logic II? You got me. It seems perfect, at the very least, for DPLII.Both games are short and easy to breeze through (though, believe it or not some sections are a little tricky), but it must be said UGA performed an excellent job of making the sequel far better in every regard. Buying this really depends on your tastes in games. Do you like rhythm-music games? Do you like this specialized kind of rhythm-music game? If the answer to both is yes, then go to the retail store now and free yourself of $15. Good God fool, it's two games for one -- at $15! Set your fingers a-tapping!", "date": "Dec 2, 2003"}
