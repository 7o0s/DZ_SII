Is it overly presumptuous to assume a game with the word Marble in the title is automatically ripping off Marble Madness? Well, it's not exactly like marble genre is one of the largest on the planet, though it could be said that Super Monkey Ball is included. For what it's worth, Marble Blast Ultra has a few distinct characteristics. First, there are no monkeys. Second, you can fight other people online. Yes that's right, you can engage in marble battles over Xbox Live. Sound confusingly enticing? You bet.   What's missing from Marble Blast Ultra is a sense of personality. Through the game's 60 single player levels of varying difficulty you'll be challenged to overcome obstacles in a variety of bleak stages. I'm not saying the stages are easy, since some are extremely difficult. The level of challenge is not an issue in the game, as there is plenty of it. The problem is rather that the game lacks any sort of endearing character, which is almost a requirement of a game that will task you with deftly controlling a rolling ball for its entirety.   Levels break down into beginner, which are extremely easy, intermediate and advanced, some of which are difficult to a controller-shattering degree. The strange thing is, all the levels are available to play as soon from the beginning. In other words, there's no need to play through the levels sequentially, they're just open. Of course, you'll need to go through them all if you want to grab achievement awards, but still, it's strange to see an entire game accessible from the start.   Raver marbles. Populating each level are tons of gadgets to make your marble rolling a pain in the ass. For instance, you'll run across powerful fans, moving platforms, ice surfaces, gravity manipulators, and pinball bumpers. To help you out you'll get speed boosts, a ~blast~ ability that adds extra height to your jumps and knocks around opponents in the multiplayer, as well as super jumps and gyrocopters, among others. All the pitfalls and power-ups combined amount to a challenging experience as a whole, but the game still seems lacking.   You'll find the option to play over Xbox Live with up to 8 players, which can be fun for a while. Online matches have you snagging gems for points as you activate powerups and slamming around your opponents with nova blasts. If you choose to play online, be prepared to be disoriented and fall of each stage quite a bit. The puzzles in the single player are more interesting, however, especially speed focused levels like Black Diamond. You'll generally have more fun in levels where you don't need to use the camera very much, since it tends to get in the way and alter your direction if you need to manipulate it rapidly.   While Marble Blast Ultra is an entertaining distraction, it's not much more than that. There are plenty of unique physics to how the ball performs on different surfaces and flies through the air, lots of different textures you can apply to the marble with distinctive, appealing effects, and a few cool sound effects, but the game will get old faster than you'd like. You'll wind up getting bored with the constant techno music and turn on your own ripped tracks. As with other XBLA games you can check leaderboards for your fast times and compare yourself to your friends and the rest of the community.", "date": "Dec 22, 2005"}
