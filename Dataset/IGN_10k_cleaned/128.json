Friends Forever invites you to engage in an impossible activity  riding horses. It's right there in the title and it's obvious what the point of the design is supposed to be, and yet you're not allowed to do it. You can't ride horses in Let's Ride. Not for a while, anyway.   The game ultimately does allow you to hit the trail atop a trusty steed, but that part of the gameplay doesn't come into play until several days' worth of in-game time has been completed. That's because, before you're allowed to ride, you first have to raise your horse. Earning its trust, keeping it clean, feeding it well. It's an accurate and appropriate simulation of what it's like to prepare a young colt from birth. And it's remarkably boring. It's boring, unengaging and horribly repetitive, the worst sorts of complaints that can be leveled against a virtual pet game design.    Let's Ride! Friends Forever starts you off a young man or woman blessed with the responsibility of taking care of a newborn pony. You name yourself, you name your horse, and then you go to the stable  where you'll be spending a long, long amount of time. A menu on the touch screen offers you choices of activities, but if you select ~Ride~ you're given an error message that says your horse is not old enough to do that. You're stuck doing other things instead, like feeding the animal, washing it, mucking out its stall and the like.   There's the stable on the left, and the shop menu on the right. Have fun looking at them, because you sure aren't going to actually ride the horse.  All of those things are standard elements in horse-focused virtual pet designs, but all of them seem all the more inane and pointless when the game design is based solely on them for the first full hour of play. What's worse, all of them are terribly limited in execution  there are no sound effects applied to any of the activities, and completing each task almost always amounts to simply dragging the stylus around over the horse's body. Want to pet the pony? Drag your stylus. Want to wash your pony? Drag the stylus. Want to feed your pony? Go to the store menu to buy an apple, then return to the stable and drag the stylus.   If you manage to not just power down your DS and walk away after almost two weeks' worth of in-game ~days,~ you'll finally get to the point where the game will allow you to ride your horse. But, of course, this is just a further letdown. The developers might have made the decision to keep the riding aspect locked down so long because it's really just nothing more than recycled bits of older THQ DS games. The horse riding takes place with the same zoomed-out, birds-eye viewpoint and lazy stylus control first seen in the horse-focused portions of Paws & Claws: Pet Vet and Paws & Claws: Pet Resort.   And it wasn't fun in those games, either. This is really the least substantive and approachable take on horseback riding you can find on Nintendo's dual-screened portable, and is especially offensive in that it's a riding design that's pretty much been lifted directly from an old Game Boy Advance project. The DS is home to games that get horseback riding right, like last Fall's Horse Life from D3 Publisher. But this is just wrong. Boring and wrong.   It would take an epic level of patience to continue much further into Let's Ride! Friends Forever far beyond the two week mark of in-game time, but even gamers who would choose to endure the torture that long wouldn't find much else to look forward to after that. The title follows the predictable path of competition appearances and earning trophies in monotonous equestrian championship events and then trickles down into even further tedium. Really, there's no reason at all to even begin to attempt to get into this one. Move along quickly.It's time for this design to die. This same, shallow horseback riding design has appeared as a mini-game piece of several recent THQ-published titles and has never been compelling. And it's at its worst here, where the entire game design builds up to its reveal by locking down even the possibility of riding until you've invested a ridiculous amount of tedious caretaking time. Ugh. It's exasperating. Don't go anywhere near this game. Let's Ride? Let's not.", "date": "Apr 3, 2008"}
