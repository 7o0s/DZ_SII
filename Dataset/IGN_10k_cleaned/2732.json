But then, I'm guessing that Lilo & Stitch won't be your ordinary Disney license. The design based upon the upcoming animated film is Metal Slug, Out of this World, and Gyruss all wrapped up in a package with a cute little (vicious) six-legged critter on the front. It's a huge departure from the Disney norm...and that's a good thing, folks. Features Eight levels  Three different gameplay types Collect movie clips and still screens Password save Only for Game Boy Advance  Writing a plot summary for a game based upon a film that hasn't hit theaters yet is a Very Bad Thing, especially since we could potentially hit upon a few spoilers. But we'll try our best not to ruin any surprises in our attempt. In this GBA game, the game opens up with Lilo, a little Hawaiian girl suddenly captured by a bunch of alien creatures and taken to outer space. Our blue, furry creature leaps to action with a gun in each hand to chase after those bad guys.   The opening sequence is right out of SNK's popular action shooter Metal Slug, with Stitch taking the role of the overaggressive soldier with the endless supply of firepower. Stitch can run, duck, jump, and lift and throw gigantic crates and pineapple grenades, all the while blasting away at a seemingly endless wave of enemy space otters and other baddies. Later in the game he can hop aboard a bunch of different vehicles (just like Metal Slug's tanks) for added blasting force. These levels are super challenging since you'll have to avoid getting shot by enemy fire or other hazards. The one annoyance during these challenges is that Stitch cannot fire while crouching or crawling...it's a super awkward and obvious limitation that sticks out like a sore paw.  Between these action levels, the game will cut to Lilo where players must get her through a series of puzzle-like challenges, designed very much like the classic games Prince of Persia or Flashback. But like those games, Lilo's levels are also trial and error...you'll probably perish a few times just to get a good lay of the land. Lilo can run, jump, crawl, climb ledges and activate switches, as well as whack bad guys with her stuffed toy. She can also camouflage herself with a few leaves so that wandering aliens won't spot her trying to escape.   The third type of level features a space shooter design that looks like it's ripped right out of Konami's classic Gyruss arcade game. These couple of levels are admittedly the lamest out of the bunch, but since the first two types of levels are really enjoyable, one dud out of the load isn't so bad...especially since it doesn't last very long.  The gameplay of the shooter and puzzle adventure games are excellent in their own right, but what really gives them their charm is the very Disney-esque animation. Lilo, Stitch, and enemy characters all feature tons of frames of animations to their moves, making this one of the most detailed Disney games released on the GBA. Explosions are equally impressive...blowing stuff up is extremely satisfying in this game simply because the artists poured so much attention to the blast sprites. What isn't so hot, though, is the sound quality. The music is very tinny and highly compressed, with awkward ~pops~ during intense portions of the game. Digitized sound seem like they were sampled at the lowest possible setting.   The development team increases the replay value of Lilo & Stitch by giving players the ability to collect stills and full-motion video clips lifted from the film. The password system records which items you've found...but a cartridge save would have been so much better since it could have also saved players' high scores during the game. After years of  playing Disney games that use the generic platform theme, it's refreshing to experience a game like Lilo & Stitch that breaks away from that ol' license formula. Digital Eclipse, the game's developer, went back to classic ideas for this game's structure, and built a quality action title with outstanding artwork and animation. I really wish the game had cartridge save, because the seven-character password is just a drag to jot down after each level. But the good definitely outweighs the not-so-good, and this game is one cool old-school romp.", "date": "Jun 13, 2002"}
