Deus Ex was attempting to create a true first person shooter RPG, with complex branching story lines, character development and dozens of NPCs to talk with. Ion Storm, the developer, had such ambitious plans for the game that it could easily have turned out to be awful, but I am here to tell you that Deus Ex is one of the best games I have ever played.   Basic game play is straight forward first person fare with a lot of added twists and features. No other game like this has ever been ported to the Mac, but on the PC side, games like Thief and System Shock 2 are similar.   The art of moving silently and unseen  Movement is based on the standard first person system, forward, back, strafe left and right and look around with the mouse. Additionally, you can lean to the left and right so you can look around corners. Traditional first person shooters emphasize running in and shooting, but depending on how you want to play the game, Deus Ex actually encourages stealth and sneaking about and that is where the leaning comes in. Peaking around corners can both save your skin and your ammo. If there is a human guard around the corner, switching to a pistol or sniper rifle and shooting the guard in the head will take him down with one shot. On the other hand, if it is a bot around the corner, no amount of pistol or rifle fire will do you any good.   Just like in real life, your character makes noise as he moves. When he runs, he makes more noise than when he walks. Both guards and bots can hear you moving around, especially if you're running across a resonant surface like metal plating. Walking will make less noise, but you still might be over heard. Grass, however, makes no noise what so ever so you can run across that surface to your heart's content.   In addition to being able to hear you, characters also have line of sight awareness. Walk in front of guard and he will see you. Walk next to a guard and he may see you in his peripheral vision. Where the fun comes in is shadows. Deus Ex is a very dark game with lots of corners to hide in. You can actually sit directly within the line of site of a guard, but if it is dark around you, he won't see you.   Know your foe  One of the best things about this game is the variety of enemies and great enemy AI. You'll be facing everything from riot police and gang thugs to nano-technology enhanced Men In Black and Robocop ED-209 style robots. Human enemies can be stunned, knocked out, or killed. The MIBs and bots are harder to take down, but are susceptible to electro-magnet attacks and weapons of mass destruction like grenades and anti-tank weaponry.   Deus Ex is based on the Unreal Tournament game engine, which had great AI, but Ion Storm took that AI and improved upon it dramatically. If you've spent any time with UT, you've seen enemies running set avoidance patterns. Different characters run different patterns, and some of the patterns are more complex than others, but they are patterns none the less. In Deus Ex, characters do move in patterns, but it makes sense withing the game. For example, police and guards walk beats. Figure out the beat they are walking and you can sneak around them, or sneak up behind them and take them out.   The story so far  Unlike most first person shooters Deus Ex has an incredibly complex, and entertaining, story. The world has moved to a one world government with global peace force called UNATCO. You and your brother are nano-machine enhanced agents for UNATCO tasked with taking out a terrorist organization known as the NSF.   A plague has swept the globe and UNATCO controls the flow of Ambrosia, the only substance that controls the disease.   As the story unfolds, you uncover a global conspiracy to destabilize the remaining world governments, the true nature of Men In Black, and that aliens among us. Your friends will turn against you, enemies will become allies and alliances will change. The plot is easily worthy of an entire X Files season.   The story unfolds through action, non-player character interaction and in-game cut scenes. For example, the first time you run into a MIB, pieces of the story you've discovered through dialog will make sense for the first time.   Like any good RPG, every person in the game has something to say to you. It may be nothing more than, ~hey, how you doing~ but it may also be a more involved conversation that can result in sub-missions, or key information that helps you achieve primary mission goals.   Build up your character  Deus Ex is fundamentally a role playing game. Before you can fire your first shot you actually have to create a character. You start off with a set amount of experience. You can use that experience to increase your skills, which includes abilities like swimming, healing, lock picking, computers, pistols, and rifles. Skills start off Untrained, which gives you a low base line to start off the game with. You can use experience to get better at doing things, going to Trained, Advanced, and Master. In the case of a skill like Lockpicking, you can use lockpicks more efficiently. With the rifle skill, you increase accuracy and rate of reload.   You build experience by achieving goals and exploring new areas. As you move through the game you receive goals you need to achieve in order to progress. Depending on the complexity of the goal, you might get anywhere from 100 to 500 experience points for completing a task. The game also rewards you for seeking out and exploring the game environment. Exploration experience is low, but there are usually additional rewards like finding weapons caches or upgrade canisters.   Your character can also receive technological improvements. As you play through the game you will find augmentation canisters that can be installed into your body, giving you new abilities like silent running, regeneration, and invisibility. Like most computer equipment, you aren't infinitely expandable. You have a limited number of augmentation slots so making choices about what to install is important. For example you can only install one augmentation into your heart slot but the heart augmentation canister gives you two install options. Once you choose, the installation is permanent. Like skills, your augmentations can also be upgraded with upgrade canisters to improve overall performance or reduce the amount of energy the augmentation consumes.   Looks so good  Using a stock ATI Rage 128 on a G3 400, you can expect 22 to 28 frame per second performance in 32 bit color at 640 x 480 resolution. I have to say that in 32 bit color this game is awesome.   Deus Ex uses lots of shadows. In 16 bit color this tends to lead to dithering. In 32 bit, however, shadows are impressive gradients that are extremely atmospheric. Unfortunately, the Rage 128 is already an aging video card and during high action periods, frame rates can drop to the teens.   The same day we got our Deus Ex review copy, we also got our preview Voodoo 5 card. Although the card is capable of 32 bit color, I was never able to get 32 bit color rendering to work. The Mac V5 was a preview card so that could be the problem, but I should also point out that the 32 bit problem also exists in the PC version of the game. Despite running in 16 bit color, thanks to the Voodoo 5's incredible hardware anti-aliasing and 64 megs of RAM, Deus Ex looked brilliant. Shadows were soft, textures looked crisp with well blended edges and frame rates were rock steady at 30 fps plus no matter how much action was going on.   Deus Ex' environments are pretty varied, from wide open landscapes to clausterphobic tunnel crawling. The visuals change as dramatically as the environments, including dull ~dirt~ in tunnels and neon and bright colors in a Hong Kong market.   All this eye candy comes at a price however, high system requirements. First off, forget the minimum suggested system requirements. If you don't have at least a Rage 128, G3 350, and 128 Megs of physical RAM, don't buy this game. I would even go so far as to say for a good play experience you should have a G4 system. If you can play Unreal Tournament on your system, then reduce the performance by about 10% and that's approximately how Deus Ex will play on your Mac.   Shoot me!  We're almost to the end of the review so I better talk about the weapons in this game. Just let me say that your choice in methods of taking out an opponent is impressive.   Weapons come in different classes. There are low tech weapons like swords, knives, batons, and an electric prod. The baton can be used to cudgel an opponent unconscious, while the prod will stun an opponent temporarily. A second shock will put a human out of service. Swords and knives obviously kill an opponent. The fact that you have a choice is important because you are theoretically a good guy. If given a choice to kill or knock out a policeman who is just doing a job, shouldn't you knock him out? While you should try to preserve life, it rarely has an impact on the story and it is usually much easier to kill than to stun.   The next weapon class is essentially small arms that include a pistol, a silenced pistol, and a crossbow. Moving up the food chain are rifles, from which you can choose a sniper rifle with a scope, sawed off or assault shotguns, or an assault rifle. If heavy metal is your bag, Deus Ex features one use light anti tank weapons, a rocket launcher, and a plasma rifle, all guaranteed to inflict major harm.   Your choices don't stop there though. There are also a variety of grenade type items to choose from, including the multi-purpose LAW, an explosive that functions as a grenade when thrown or as a proximity device when attached to a wall. There are also gas grenades that stun an opponent that work the same way. To help you deal with security and bots, there are electromagnetic pulse grenades that temporarily disable electronic circuitry and scramble grenades that confuse robots into attacking each other.   Like your skills, your weapons can be upgraded as well. Mods like sniper scope and silencer can be added to the assault rifle to make it the weapon of choice for the discerning agent.   But wait there's more!  Anyone who has played this game will tell you I have barely scratched the surface of all the features that make Deus Ex so phenomenal. You can hack computer systems and security systems to learn secrets or turn of cameras. You can sneak past guards and steal valuable items or information. You can interact with hundreds of NPCs. You even control the story by making choices about what to carry, who to kill and who to save.   When it comes down to it, Deus Ex is about choice. You choose your skills. You choose your weapons. You choose the course of the story. Other games have offered this before, but on the Mac none have come close to doing it as well as Deus Ex has.    The Bottom Line  Great visuals, great sound, great game play and a great story add up to a perfect 10. The only thing it is missing is a multiplayer game! If your system can live up to our recommended requirements, buy this game today!", "date": "Jun 7, 2002"}
