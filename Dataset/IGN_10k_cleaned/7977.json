But even with its almost poor timing (EA Sports really beat the game to the punch to get out in time for die-hard roundball fans to pick up), Konami's offering is a very complete, very tight game of basketball. Gameplay For those of you spilling over from the IGN64, we'll start this off very simply: the PlayStation game is better. The game looks better, moves better, feels better  it just is better. In design, it's a tweaked version of In the Zone '98 (just like In the Zone '98 was a tweaked version of In the Zone). What this means is you'll find features such as single button spin moves and quick crossover dribbling. You can also choose to use standard point-in-the-player's-direction passing, cursor-setup passing (using a separate button to put an icon under the player you want to pass to), or icon passing (hold down the L1 button and use the triangle, square, O, X, and R1 button to pass to a specific player).   The controls are much tighter around, thanks to better motion-capturing and a much better focus on controller functions. There are a few animation quirks that plague fast breaks  nudging into a defender sends you stumbling backwards for an awkwardly lengthy amount of time, for example. But AI has been bumped up a bit. Sure, there are occasional intelligence problems when covering two-on-one, and odd point coverage do tend to happen during a game. Problems? Heck, sometimes a player may be completely open under the basket and will pass back to a covered teammate). However, called plays are drawn out rather accurately, and the defenders cover who they're supposed to. It'll take a few games to discover the gap in the AI that's in almost every sports game since time began.  In the Zone '99 has two great additions: Three Point Shootout and Slam Dunk Challenge. In the Three Point Shootout, you take command of a specific NBA All Star (did I mention that this game is licensed with both teams and players? Now I did) and spend 60 seconds chucking five orange and one ~money~ ball from five different positions outside the three-point arch. You're presented with a powerbar that's constantly on the move, and you'll have to time it to get the marker to hit into one of three positions of the bar to make the ball go ~Swish.~ And in the Slam Dunk Challenge, you choose how difficult a dunk you want to perform. Once you've selected a difficulty, you're presented a button combination to memorize. To start the dunk, you'll have to punch in the combination exactly as you remember it  the closer to the combo you are, the more points you'll get. Graphics While not as pretty as NBA Live '99 from EA Sports, In the Zone '99 is very clean, and smooth. It uses the standard PlayStation resolution, so the graphics have a tendency to look a bit on the rough side. But players really do look like the players, with varying heights, weights, and the proper face texture. The big deal, however, is the excellent motion capturing. Some of the passes and dunks are incredible  the one thing Konami does right is motion-capturing, and In the Zone '99 is no exception. Sound  Most sports games are moving to a very TV-like coverage, especially in the audio department where developers employ the use of real play-by-play announcers for commentary. In Konami's case, the development team went a more simplistic route  you'll still here some play-by-play, but it's in the form of the stadium PA announcer. The game is obviously taking the approach of being on the floor of the game, instead of being a television viewer. And in this case, it works, since many times play-by-play voice overs call too much attention to themselves, and when there's a flaw, you really notice it. In the Zone's PA announcements are subtle, but they add the appropriate amount of atmosphere. As I said, NBA Live 99 is the more complete basketball game, but  Konami's latest offering is a great game of its own. And it's great to get envious looks from the IGN64 guys  the PlayStation game is always the better version. This year's game is, again, a baby-step in improvements, so if you're comfortable with the ITZ gameplay, you're going to find yourself as comfortable with In the Zone '99. Personally, I'd rather slip in Live, but this is a good alternative.", "date": "Apr 30, 1999"}
