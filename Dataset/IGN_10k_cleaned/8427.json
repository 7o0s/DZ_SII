Instead of using your handset's on-board camera to take real-world photographs -- could that be next, DChoc? -- you control an in-game photographer that slips beneath the waves to snap tropical fish. Success is measured on your ability to capture desirable shots during the game's eighteen missions.   There are 27 different species of fish just waiting for their Norma Desmond moment in the big blue. As you explore the reefs and undersea gardens, you will come into contact with colorful exotics and some unsavory specimens, such as sharks. Many of the fishies swim together, giving you ample opportunity to set up group shots and earn bonus points. But not every denizen of the deep is a willing subject. Some fish must be surprised, as they can hear your camera or sense extreme movements. If you are too clumsy, all you'll turn over to your boss is a photo of a fleeing dorsal fin. Blowing shots is a good way to end a mission early, too. You have a limited supply of oxygen, so keep snapping great pictures to earn tanks refills.   When you surface, your best shots are cataloged and points are officially awarded. You can view your all-time best shots in a gallery, which is constantly refreshed if you manage to take a better picture of a species. The pics look great, as does the rest of this colorful and casual aquatic adventure.  Digital Chocolate's FotoQuest Fishing has actually been out for several months, but it's a strong testament to its staying power that it endears in the face of the still-rapidly evolving mobile gamescape. Of course, this is also coming from a guy who really liked Pokemon Snap on the Nintendo 64, so use that as a reference point. Hopefully, Digital Chocolate will update this wholly successful idea in the near future -- but why wait when there's a solid bit of fun just a few clicks away?", "date": "May 2, 2007"}
