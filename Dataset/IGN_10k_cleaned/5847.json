In a summer full of movie games and licensed fare, Kid Warlock is indeed something of a breath of fresh air. This side-scrolling action-platformer is a completely original effort from MMJ games, allowing gamers to slip into the pointy hat of a youngling warlock en route to a final battle with a wicked magician named Morthos. However, before that climactic showdown, you must turn back hundreds of zombies, trolls, and bugaboos while jumping across ledges.   Wait a sec. Replace Morthos with Dracula and didn't we just describe Castlevania?    MMJ Games' effort is decidedly influenced by the Konami classic, and that's no slight. If you're going to emulate, emulate the best. However, there are some control issues that hold the game back from greatness, such as jumping that isn't exactly easy to time. Even worse, when you do botch a jump -- and trust us, you will -- you are harshly punished for it. You'll often tumble several screens back, which is grossly frustrating. Even wore, is that sometimes it will look like your feet are indeed on the ledge, but you'll fall right through. These are the kind of moments that make you want to squeeze your phone until the screen cracks.   Working much better than the jumping bit is combat. Kid Warlock is full of neatly imagined enemies with all sorts of attack patterns and good animations. And there's often more than one way to skin an undead cat. For example, trolls will hop across ledges, and you have the choice of either running under them while they are at the height of their leap, or wait until they land and use your wand on them.    Your apprentice can also seek out additional weapons than the basic wand attack. Ice spells freeze enemies in position, making them easy to attack or avoid. Lightning attacks zap enemies. Fire spells really unleash hell on the bad guys.   Kid Warlock isn't the most colorful game we've seen. The palettes are limited, but they work for the concept of ~spooky castle.~ The kid warlock is decently drawn with a few frames of animation, but it really does seem like enemies got the glory treatment instead. Even better is the music, which is exceptional. Kid Warlock's tunes are some of the best we've heard recently.  Kid Warlock is partially undone by its sloppy controls. The game relies on jumping to get places, but the jumping mechanic just isn't reliable. That's unfortunate, because it will keep gamers from digging into the game and seeing some of more clever enemies or listing to its great music. I really like that MMJ Games was able to get an original game on the decks, but I just wish it was a little tighter.", "date": "Jun 27, 2005"}
