Revolutionary by 1993 standards, it practically ushered a new era for fighting titles and blasted the genre into a new direction.   Since then, dozens of titles have come and gone. Yet, the Virtue Fighter property remains as strong and influential as ever. With every subsequent title, the series has added truly nifty additions to the classic VF formula, culminating in the deep, ultra-playable Virtua Fighter 4.    Over the years, the VF series spun off in rather peculiar directions, such as the Sega Saturn titles Virtua Fighter Kids and Fighters MegaMix. Of course, the coolest of these tangents was supposed to take the series deep into another genre altogether, that of character development, narrative complexity and stat building.    The realm of the role playing game, in other words. And while initial announcements of a VF RPG first surfaced back during the Dreamcast days, fans dealt with an agonizing wait as the project halted and eventually transformed into another Sega RPG, Shenmue. And in a way, fans still need to wait.    Even with the immanent release of Virtua Quest, an action/ RPG hybrid featuring fighters from the VF universe, gamers will be left craving that years-old promise of a true RPG experience featuring Akira, Jacky, Sarah and others. Not to say the game is an utter waste of the franchise (and the time and effort into the actual making of the game) but it fails in the two key areas essential to its success. Specifically, it fails to deliver a solid action or RPG experience.    For those who don't know the setup, here it is: You play a vivacious kid named Sei who fancies himself a Treasure Hunter. Only he doesn't hunt treasure in the traditional sense. Since Virtua Quest takes place in the future, where ~reality~ splits between the virtual world and the physical world, Sei seeks out ~Data Chips~ which he can redeem for cash. The virtual world, known as the Nexus, shares striking similarities to the real world, in that it splits between populated ~good~ areas and neglected ~bad~ areas. Sei trolls the neglected parts of the Nexus in search of Data Chips.   The game starts with Sei's friend Hayami introducing him to the Nexus and treasure hunting. And here's where the game really begins. Sei enters a virtual lobby (akin to the one seen in the Phantasy Star series) and needs to earn a ~Hunter's License~ so he can start his career as a neo Treasure Hunter. In order to get a license, players need to take a series of tests (read: sneaky tutorial.) Once Sei claims a license, he then movies into the Nexus in search of fame and glory. The lobby serves as a springboard to different areas of the Nexus. It also serves as a virtual shopping mall, where Sei can purchase move upgrades and tool upgrades. All of Sei's information, including upgrades and general statistics and abilities, can be accessed in the control panel by pressing the start button on the controller.     While not as deep as a traditional RPG, VQ lets you build Sei's offensive (ATK) and Defensive (DEF) capabilities, as well as his health (HP) and special (SP) attributes. Of special note is the Upgrade Tools section, where Sei can assign upgrades he purchases at shops. Instead of equipping everything you buy, or having a limited number of slots in which to equip tools, each tool takes up a specific amount of space on a virtual grid. The more expensive and cool the attribute, the more space it will take to equip. The system works well and adds a little depth and strategy. You'll find yourself making sacrifices and hard decisions over what to use and what to neglect. Should you increase your attack power or increase your overall health?   This is also, where all the problems start. Sei uncovers a conspiracy within the Nexus that threatens both the real world and virtual world. In order to save the world(s), Sei needs to seek out ~Virtua Souls~ hidden within the Nexus. Virtua Souls are legendary data clusters holding the fighting abilities of the famed Virtua Fighters.    Turns out the original Virtua Fighter tournaments were held only to gather valuable data from each of the fighters by the Judgment Six organization. The data would then be used to build a powerful weapon to help Judgment Six in conquering the world. Now, where finding Virtua Souls is never too difficult, actually earning them can be a real bitch.    Every time you find a Virtua Soul, you will need to fight against one of the legendary Virtua Fighters. Taking them down is not easy. You may walk out of the first three fights with slight bruising, but every subsequent encounter will test your patience. It doesn't help that Sei suffers from rigid and slightly unresponsive controls.   It's very easy to perform the wrong move at a very inopportune time, letting an enemy take a few free hits. Many of the moves, especially the light punch and throw skill, are way too easy to inadvertently mix up in the heat of battle. And make no mistake, you'll be doing a lot of fighting. The main game divides between nine distinct levels, each with a varying graphical theme and set of obstacles.    Progression through each of the levels plays like a cross between a classic brawler and a platform game, in that you'll fight tons of enemies and need to clear environmental obstacles to clear a given area. To help you in your quest are a bunch of combat moves (discussed in detail below) and an assortment of neutral platform skills.    Among these are ledge hanging, running, jumping, wall running (think Prince of Persia) and, finally, swinging with an electric wire. Sei uses a pink, electronic lasso to swing around the environment by latching onto glowing orbs. Different colored orbs allow Sei to perform different actions. Some orbs will simply carry Sei to a predefined location, while others will toss him into the air after spinning Sei around in mid-air. Now, while Sei has a lot of moves at his disposal, and most work ok, they each feel a little sloppy. None feels very precise and refinined, making manuevering the gameworld a much more difficult task than it should be.   Sei needs to find the Virtua Souls hidden within each level, destroy waves of enemies and boss characters, and eventually save the world. Unfortunately, many of the elements don't gel together. One of the most important elements in a game of this type, namely fighting, feels awkward due to funky control. Throughout the game, you'll need to fight back dozens upon dozens of insipid enemies. They're just not very smart. They'll just stand there as you beat them, totally ignoring your presence or merely jab at you occasionally. Their attacks feel somewhat arbitrary and never pose a significant threat until late in the game.   Virtua Quest features different enemy types, but not nearly enough. You'll find yourself pummeling the same types of baddies far too often. And when they are different, it ultimately winds up being an aesthetic thing and nothing that fundamentally changes the way an enemy will attack. The enemy bosses start wildly simple to beat, and progress in difficulty throughout the course of the game. These guys actually take a little effort to beat, if only because a posse of regular henchmen swamps them. They boast somewhat cool attacks, each of which deals quite a bit of damage, requiring skill to dodge.     Luckily, Sei is more than up to the task. The spunky teenager boasts a wide array of attacks, many of which have been ripped straight from VF characters. By the end of the game, Sei will have some 45 plus VF moves at his disposal. Using the control panel, players can assign the dozens of VF moves to one of six main skills, including: Charge, Throw, Floater, Strike, Dash and Jump. Classic throw moves such as the Tenchi Touraku and Splash Mountain end up in the Throw skill, where powerhouse hits such as the Tornado Punch and Soukoshou wind up in the Strike skill, and so on.    While the moves list is impressive, the execution is less so. You'll need the different skills (each of which comes with a unique star rating) to get past certain obstacles, but their use in combat would benefit from better implementation. Each move, while boasting snazzy special effects, winds up feeling like every other move in a specific category. Many of the throws feel the same, as do the uppercuts and charge attacks. The option to build a customized fighter is undeniably bad ass, but it would have been far cooler to have the customization weigh in during combat a little more.       One of the best and most valuable combat skills in Sei's possession is the electric wire he uses to swing about the environment. After tossing an enemy into the air (through a variety of different attacks), Sei can latch onto them and perform combo attacks mid-air. This is by far the easiest and most effective tool at Sei's disposable. It's possible to rack up 99 successive hits using the wire, which is (quite obviously) more than enough to devastate most enemies.   Virtua Quest offers an interesting blend of RPG elements and action. Plus, it makes decent use of the Virtua Figher name, including dozens of memorable characters and special moves. Unfortunately, the separate elements never quite come together, and each suffers from a lack of attention. The action is mediocre at best, and the platform elements feel sloppy and unrefined. The graphics and sound are equally forgetful. The only glaring problem comes by way of the silly camera. It really gets in your way and detracts from the overall experience. Still, theres a lot to like for diehard fans and those looking for a simple romp in cyberspace. The depth of the character customization, coupled with the Virtua Fighter mythos and special moves, make it a definite rental for the curious.", "date": "Jan 6, 2005"}
