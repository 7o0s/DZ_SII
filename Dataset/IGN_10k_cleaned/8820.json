{"name": "WWF WrestleMania", "name_review": "WWF Wrestlemania", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/27/wwf-wrestlemania", "text": "Recipe for success: take a popular professional ~sport~ (in this case wrestling), make it into a game, and throw in some Mortal Kombat-style digitized action. You can't fail, and neither did Acclaim.  Sure, professional wrestling is cheap, juvenile fun. I mean, what kid never put a ski mask over his head and pretended to be a wrestler? WWF Wrestlemania captures that brand of childish fun and makes it work. This is because they've taken real wrestlers, and added that element of fantasy that makes professional wrestling so fun. Except now they really can milk those goofy characters for all they're worth. Real moves exist right alongside magical, character specific ones, and make for great gameplay. If you're a fan of wrestling, or just love wacky fighters, then definitely check this one out.
