{"name": "Sentient", "name_review": "Sentient", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/05/02/sentient", "text": "The graphic adventure, long a staple genre on the PC, has never really caught on for the PlayStation. It's only when games blend adventure elements with action, like Resident Evil or King's Field, that the genre begins to make sense on the PlayStation. Unfortunately Sentient, the new adventure from Psygnosis, doesn't incorporate enough action and subsequently collapses under its own weight.  Sentient concerns a medical technician, Garrit, sent to the Space Station Icarus to handle a sudden plague of radiation sickness. The station is orbiting dangerously close to the sun Xexor, which threatens to destroy the outpost with menacing solar flares. It's your job to cure the sickness, and take on any other jobs you may be needed for.  Sentient should be given credit for trying out some new ideas in this somewhat stagnant genre. There are six plot-lines to become entangled in, each unraveling independently of the next. Decisions you make and the people you talk to determine which one you will follow.   Perhaps the most interesting element of the game is the actual method of conversation. Not content to allow conversations to just passively unfold, Psygnosis has provided an immense menu of possible topics. How you express something is just as important as what is being said, as there are four different personality types on the ship. You won't want to act meek and friendly with a dominant type, as he won't be impressed.  Unfortunately, Sentient is irreparably marred by a tedious pace, worsened by the fact that all the corridors begin to look the same after awhile. The background graphics are passable, but the faces of the people you talk to are just grotesque. It's extremely off-putting when you don't even want to look at the people you're supposed to talk to.  While Psygnosis did have some great ideas, namely the extensive conversation menu, the execution is flawed by a tedious pace and unnerving graphics.", "date": "May 2, 1997"}
