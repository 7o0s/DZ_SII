The truth is, however, that this game makes no freakin' sense whatsoever. It's so maddening in its incoherence, it'll make you grab your temples in pain and moan like a llama with a hangover. It's adventure gaming at its worst and it'll suck the brain cells out of your head quicker than you can say ~Doh!~Cryo Interactive  our neighbor from across the pond  have sent us a ridiculous piece of interactive fiction: Seven Games of the Soul (Or what I now affectionately call, Sucking Games of the Dull). Originally released as Faust in Europe, Seven has all the marks of a poorly adapted foreign feature  bad dubbing, a story full of loopholes, silly characters, and humor that falls flat on its face.Where Cryo's other misguided adventure game Ring was loosely based around Richard Wagner's opera ~The Ring of the Nibelungen~, Seven is loosely based on the classic story of Faust. From the literary works of Goethe and Marlowe to etchings by Rembrandt and a legendary film by F.W. Murnau, the fable surrounding the confrontation between Faust and Mephistopheles is timeless. It eludes me why someone would want to try and bastardize this story to the extent that Cryo and Arxel Tribe have done. Yet, Seven strays as far away from the original tale as you can get while still retaining the same main character names. Get this: you play the role of Marcellus Faust, a wise old black man from Mississippi who's dropped into the middle of an amusement park called Dreamland (located God knows where) with no memory as to why or how you arrived.  You're promptly visited by Mephisto himself and told that you are to be the arbitrator for a few souls  seven to be exact  that have to be judged by God as to whether they should be sent to Heaven or Hell.  Through the course of the game you'll roam around the now abandoned park picking up evidence, as well as figuring out how these freak-show characters fell from grace and eventually decided to sell their souls to Mephisto.  Anyone who has played games like Myst or Zork Nemesis will know what to expect here. The game offers a 360 panoramic view of various interactive ~slides~. You'll travel through Dreamland pointing and clicking all manner of asinine objects and illogical puzzles. You'll make alcohol in an oven in a basement and then get it from a bathroom sink on the floor above.  You'll have to click a blank space on a bathroom wall to open a drawer on a cabinet three feet away because the bathroom mirror is ~throwing off illusions.~ And one of my favorites, you'll have to attach a teddy bear to an intricate pulley system to lift a refrigerator and expose a hidden passage. I need some Advil just thinking about it... You would think being in the middle of an interactive theme park would be cool. Rides, games, fun houses... the possibilities are endless. Yet, in Seven there's only one ride you can interact with and one carnival game you can play: ~Shoot 'Em Up Cardboard Rabbits,~ an annoying shooting gallery you'll play over and over again to get hints from your effeminate genie, side-kick Homunculus. Yep, your genie of questionable sexuality. Are we having fun yet?The wallpaper that comes with Windows is prettier than the graphics in Seven. The game boasts a new graphics engine that runs in 24 bits. All this means is that it's going to be a little clearer than running the game in 16 bit mode, but both versions are visibly pixilated and blurry. And since you're investigating the park's employees, you're going to be spending a lot of time behind the scenes in their cabins and trailers. There are very few inspired environments to explore in this game.To Seven's benefit, the FMV scenes are fun to watch, though often times bizarre. The 3D rendered characters hold their arms and limbs in weird positions while sometimes moving in an unrealistic fashion which leads me to question the skill of the artists and modelers.Like everything else in this game, the music is thematically confusing. Marcellus is traveling in modern day, but investigating characters from the early 1900's. So I'm assuming the old school jazz, the Billie Holiday, and the Franz Liszt is supposed to be from this era. But then, there's some Marvin Gaye, European uber-rock, and Hazy Osterwald Sextet thrown in as well, which completely juxtaposes any musical style the game was attempting to go for. It's as if the programmers sat brainstorming one night and tried to figure out the most random musical choices to throw into this game.With the exception of a wonderfully acted Mephisto, the voice acting is laughable. Marcellus sounds more like Santa Claus than a wise old black man from Mississippi. The strong man/lion tamer  Hannibal  has a terrible cockney accent any 12-year old could pull-off by watching a few episodes of Monty Python's Flying Circus. The rest of the freak show characters are less than memorable.Minus a couple of satisfying puzzles and cool FMV sequences, this game has no redeeming values. Seven contains its share of low budget bugs and is not even worth its reduced price of twenty bucks. You can get through the whole game in a couple of hours if you figure out everything on the first try, which means the majority of your time is going to be spent wandering around frustrated, clicking every pixel and using all your inventory in every ludicrous combination possible. If you're looking for some good old-fashion slide-show adventuring pick-up Riven. It's a few years old, but even with it's faults it's one hundred times better than Seven Games of the Soul. I won't give away the confounding ending of the game, but one of the last lines spoken is the  clich ~But that's a different story...~ which leads me to believe there's more Faustian madness to come. If Cryo's thinking of making a sequel to this mistake, I'd be willing to sell my soul to keep it off the shelves.
