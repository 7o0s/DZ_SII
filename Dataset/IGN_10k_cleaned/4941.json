Historical battles were fought with dozens of characters and Dynasty Warriors 4 upped the ante even more to 42 playables. Taking all that historical stuff and then mixing up the gameplay into a new beast now leads us to Dynasty Warriors 4: Empires. With a game that mixes in the battles we know and love with some RISK-style strategy the result is a game that is even more about the hack and slash than ever.   There may be a legion of different heroes to choose from, but the goal is always the same: kick everyone's ass and take control. The map here is divided up into 24 regions and after choosing a leading officer and a starting region, it's time to take control of everything. Each of the several different groups can attack or defend each turn and by taking over all of the regions it's game over, light up the BBQ and relax.   In another nod to the board game of RISK, getting more regions also brings in more gold for each turn. This money can be used to advance weaponry, develop some new items for use, gain more soldiers, or even to talk to the citizens and improve one's popularity. Another crucial use for money is to hire on warriors that have been beaten in combat. By besting a foe in combat and then offering him a hefty salary, he will fight for the cause as if he was born into it. In fact, they can even be controlled by the player.   Instead of using one warrior for the entire game, players can choose a fighter from the list of generals in one's employ for each different battle. This gives an incentive to find the best opponents and take them down so that their skills can be put to use the next time around. Even if they're not directly used, they can help out as a general. In addition to the extra cash, gaining more regions allows for more generals and lieutenants to be used in battle. This may all be a bit much to think about and for that reason the battles themselves have been simplified.    Each individual battle within the game is a matter of getting control of the enemy base. There are no sub-goals or crisscrossing of the map that has happened in previous games and this makes the gameplay even more about waging war as fast as possible. Even so, the game is not a solo effort and rewards some careful use of all of the other generals and lieutenants and making sure that while inroads are being made into the main base, an enemy group isn't taking advantage and destroying the home base.   The only difference is the addition of the stronghold system that enables players to take control of a territory in the map. By clearing out all of the opposition, an area will become ~owned~ and switch color. Power-ups such as health bonuses will start to appear in the food bins in each area and soldiers fighting there who have the same color will be stronger.     Overall, the fighting here is a big excuse to go as nuts as possible and just demolish the opposing forces. In that sense, DW4:E provides a satisfying experience like the previous games and the combo system allows for multiple targets to be hit to make sure that the party doesn't stop. There really is nothing like taking out over 500 opponents in the time it takes to watch an episode of ~Friends.~   Of course, nothing is without a cost and here that takes the shape of a fog of war that only allows other characters to appear when they get within 50 feet of the hero. There is also some crazy shimmering and shifting in the ground textures that can earn themselves an epileptic warning all their own. For the most part the framerate holds up except for a few problematic areas where the action can drop down to half speed. Just as long as one avoids epic battles in a high location everything should be kosher, though.   With the large amount of battles that need to be won the action here can get a little tedious for each attempt to conquer China. There are some extra features that make the action more strategic, but this is definitely a game that's for the hardcore fans who want the huge, huge battles. A little bit of the depth has been sacrificed to keep the action interesting, but if you're already thinking to yourself in the back of your head, ~Who the hell cares?~ then keep on going with the bad-ass nature of the game and work the strategy.   Fitting right in with the brutal single-player are the new two-player modes. These are the Vs. Challenges and they have a split-screen, but instead of fighting together or against each other on the large battlefield these put two players in the same environment with four different types of challenge. These include challenges to steal items or kill the most enemies, but the bet one is easily the Melee mode where both players are on a platform and can only score points by knocking off the enemies who keep appearing or each other. This mode mixes up the action by making all the points more tactical and giving that extra bonus of knocking a friend into oblivion. Mmm... oblivion.    The RISK-style gameplay lends an interesting twist to the same action, but there is still something missing without the storylines and the lack of multiple goals. The gameplay itself is still over the top and ridiculously fun in a guilty pleasure sort of way, but the fact that the more interesting action happens between the matches is an indication that the strategy should have taken on an even greater role and the battles themselves could have been smaller. It's definitely got the funk, but without enough of a compelling motivation to take over the country, this is more of an exercise than an adventure that the previous entries were.", "date": "Sep 1, 2004"}
