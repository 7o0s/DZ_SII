But with the absolutely gargantuan success of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater on multiple platforms, it seems as though you can't even turn around lately without running into some kind of punkified concoction rife with metal music, gravity defying stunts, and bruises that last for weeks. And while it's true that none of the ~me too~ followers have managed to live up to the excellence that Tony Hawk has had so far, Acclaim has finally managed to bring us a real contender with Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX.  Loosely based on the engine provided by the PlayStation street boarder, Thrasher: Skate and Destroy, Mirra BMX manages to successfully remove all the buggy kinks associated with that year old title, while keeping the better aspects of the engine fully intact. Gone are the glitches in your character model while attempting to pull off the more complicated stunts, and even further gone is the insane difficulty level to be found in Thrasher as well. More user friendly than before and faster overall because of the focus shift to bicycles, Mirra BMX is off to a good start before it even gets out of the gate.  Once the game has started, you'll find all sorts of cool things to see and do. With more modes than you can shake a stick at, and a soundtrack straight from the music files at MTV you'll quickly find yourself immediately immersed into this little hardcore world. With the option to start a career mode in ~Proquest~, play with a buddy in ~2-Player~, or just skate around the track of your choice with ~Free Ride~, Tony Hawk veterans should feel right at home.  As is the norm with many sports games of today (even those of the extreme kind), Mirra BMX is jam-packed with real life riding stars. Including (but not limited to) such big names as Kenan Harkin, Shaun Butler, Chad Kagy, Ryan Nyquist, and even the big guy himself, Dave Mirra. While this is a hot little touch to throw in for fans of the sport, every rider no matter who they are possess the exact same set of stunts and moves to perform (with the exception of two special moves unique to that particular bad ass). Although it's pretty neat to be able to play as your favorite bi-rider, I would have liked to see bigger discrepancies amongst the character choices than this. Strength levels, stamina levels, and similar differences would have been a nice little touch, and made the incentive for playing as certain people a sweeter proposition.  Luckily for us the stages to be ridden are so entertaining and the stunts so spectacular, that overlooking the disappointment in character stats was easier to do than I thought. Whether you're jumping over an oncoming train in Mirra's own backyard or zooming around a level entirely made out of empty swimming pools, trying to beat your own personal score can take anywhere from a few minutes to all damn day. Just as addicting as mister Hawk's little adventure was, Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX can quickly eat up the time faster than Ultimecia did in Final Fantasy VIII.  Especially when it comes time to start unlocking those secrets! Be it hidden characters, extra stages, or even new bicycles and clothing from your sponsors, Easter Egg hunters are sure to find plenty of well-earned booty. You can even unleash brand new modes that boast invisible riders, night vision courses, and Quack-like first-person perspectives. Obviously built with the fans in mind, this big list of abundant extras earns the programmers a hug in your quest to unlock everything!  And it's almost as though the industrial strength soundtrack is egging you on! As it pounds your ears with popular hits from groups like Sublime, Cypress Hill, Pennywise, Rancid, The Deftones, Social Distortion, and more. Audibly one of the premiere titles on any platform for licensed music, Dave Mirra BMX will most certainly help to get your ~Christmas Hardcore~ on. Especially after a few choice sessions of my main men Cypress Hill, they rock!  Graphically, things don't fare quite as well. Still a noticeable improvement when compared to the PlayStation version released a few months ago, the animation problems of the past have thankfully been fixed. But the biggest visual bother from the 32-bit version still remains and indeed creates a level of disappointment. Yes friends, the backgrounds and obstacles are still somewhat plain and uneventful.  Not the end of the world by any means, as the better than good gameplay more than makes up for any eyeball-induced shortcoming. But with the Dreamcast more than a year into its stride, and displays of graphical excellence increasing more and more with every passing day, our spoiled, high resolution oculars demand a little more.  Overall however, Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX is another big step for extreme sports enthusiasts. Not quite the giant that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is when it comes to features, graphics, and ease of control, the hardworking team of Z-Axis and Acclaim still deserves a comforting pat on the back. A terrific way to pass the time in between those epic sessions of Skies of Arcadia and Shenmue, Mirra BMX is worth every penny.  -- Jeremy Dunham, IGNDC", "date": "Dec 5, 2000"}
