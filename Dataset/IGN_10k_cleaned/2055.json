While games like MechWarrior may have taken the first step (however slow it was) into the genre, leave it to the Japanese to make a game like Armored Core, one that really explores the whole mecha myth. Developer From Software has even hired Shoji Kawamori,   the mechanical designer for Macross and   Macross Plus, to do the mechs!  In the game, you take the role of a Raven mercenary, someone who pilots an Armored Core mech for profit. Each mission you successfully complete earns you money to buy new parts for your Core, although the more damage you take during a mission, the more repairs you'll need. And these, of course, cost money. Working for multi-national corporations does have its advantages, though. There's always another job lined-up for you, and the pay is great.  The missions themselves are pretty straightforward, usually involving the mech taking out some undesirables. The action, however, is far from boring. The mech is humanoid in shape, and holds a gun. It also has rocket launchers, as well as a nasty laser sword that works exceptionally well, albeit at close range. The ability to fly adds versatility to the Core, and the control is spot on. My only complaint here is its a little slow to turn around, but you can get around this by flying sideways until out of harm's way.  The real meat of the game, however, is the two-player game. Yes, Armored Core supports the link cable, but it can be played with a vertical split screen as well. The terrains provided for the battles range from open deserts to empty cities, and unlike most two-player terrains, they're huge. Sometimes almost too big. However, using your missile lock as a radar works like a charm, plus it lets you get a little satisfaction out of hammering your opponent from the safety of a roof top!   With solid graphics and control, and an almost obsessive attention to detail as far as customizing the mechs go, it's hard not to love Armored Core. Fans of anime will love barreling around in the Shoji Kawamori-designed mechs, while action lovers will enjoy the short, but hard-hitting, missions. Either way, you can't lose.
