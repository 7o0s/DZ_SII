What dashing videogame star will be to the 'box what Mario is to Nintendo's stable of gaming machines? While there will be many candidates and potential answers to that question introduced to us in coming months and years, Azurik, the star of Azurik: Rise of Perathia is not one of them. The first title from Adrenium Games plays and controls very much like your standard platformer and it's only because Azurik's fantastic land of Perathia is full of magical beasts and good fighting evil, that you would even consider him to be in the running for Xbox icon.   In spite of all the things that work well in Azurik (level of detail, plot, saving mechanism) there are too many things (enemy animation, level design) about the game that fall short of what we should expect from an action adventure game on the Xbox. On the other hand, Azurik serves as a pretty good preview of what we can expect if the members of the Blue Man Group split up and take their individual acts solo.  The Story You're cast in the role of Azurik, a young warrior pledged to protect the elemental powers of the land of Perathia. Of course, there's a rival warrior, Balthazar, who decides all of the goodie-two-shoes defense of the poor and innocent just ain't worth it when compared to the awesome power offered by the Guardian of Death.   To make a long story short, Balthazar in his quest for power breaks the four Elemental Discs --the Perathian's sacred power objects-- into pieces and they go flying off in every direction around the Perathia. You actually see them flying away. Your powers are gone now, so you have to set out to find the pieces, put the discs back together, kill the bad guys and save the world. The elemental powers of Fire, Water, Earth and Wind will be at your control once you go out and find icons for each of them. When you acquire and master all four, you're a bold blue butt kicking badass and Balthazar won't stand a chance.  Gameplay You're equipped with a type of double ended halberd that works as a conventional stabbing and slicing weapon but it can also be infused with elemental powers. This weapon mechanism is a central element of the game. The first elemental power you will acquire for example is water. When you activate the water ability using the Left Trigger and X button (the powers are cleverly color coded to the Xbox controller so that water = blue, red = f ire, etc.), you'll see water bubbling from the blades of your weapon. Now when you attack, using either the A button for stabbing or B button for a more sophisticated swinging attack, your water powers will come into play against enemies. Early on, the enemies are pretty weak so it won't matter how you chop 'em up. But the crazy looking ice people you come across are pretty much invulnerable to your puny water abilities. Fire is the way to beat them, obviously, but that means you have to find the fire ability somewhere.  The more interesting application of the elemental powers is that you will need the powers to access different areas throughout the game. There will be plenty of backtracking through Perathia's handful of element based worlds opening up new areas that were previously inaccessible. So using the water ability as an example, you will have no problem dousing those pesky walls of fire when you have your weapon coated with water. Nice and easy right? But wait it gets more complicated as you progress through the game. You can't melt an ice wall with a basic fire ability. When you first get it, you have to combine your water and fire abilities on your weapon at the same time to get steam, which will then take down that ice wall. Your elemental powers can be combined and enhanced (by collecting color coded diamonds, ruby, sapphires and emeralds) to make Azurik more dangerous and protect him with armor.  That's the good and interesting part of Azurik's gameplay. The combination of control and level design combine to really mess things up for Azurik adventurers. The intention is for you to fight your way to a series of objectives that eventually lead to some great prize like one of your first elemental powers. What you'll end up doing is running around aimlessly wondering what to do, stumbling across and audio clue and realizing how easy it could've been to achieve an objective if things had only been more intuitive. Too many activities and pathways that seem to make little sense end up being the key to many sections of the game. The beauty of Nintendo's Legend of Zelda series is that objectives and how to achieve them were obvious without being too simple so that all you had to do was accomplish the task with pure gaming skill. Azurik never gets you into a comfortable state of mind where you know how the game thinks and what's expected of you so you can just get on with the business at hand. Too much second guessing about which pathway or door to take leads to a lot of wasted time running back and forth around huge levels that are huge for no good reason. There's nothing wrong with being free to explore at will, but there has to be some logical motivation to do so.   The floatiness of Azurik's control makes falling off ledges and bridges more dangerous than battling the poorly animated enemies. Early on you can run through and around packs of enemies like you were OJ Simpson running through an airport so Azurik makes it so there's always a narrow bridge or path coming up to slow your cheating ass down. You control the position of the camera with the right thumb stick, zoom in and out with the D-pad and you can snap it behind Azurik with the right trigger. That's an awful lot of camera control to worry about and the scary part is you have to be good on the camera if you want to know what's going on around you. Enemies, powerups and other icons always seem to be right in your blind spots when you enter new areas or rooms and the camera has a bad habit of getting stuck around corners. The snap back function is handy but it's awfully far away from Azurik, too far to appreciate the level of detail in the characters anyway.  Graphics There's more good and bad in the graphics department of Azurik as well. Azurik's skimpy armor on his shoulder and chest for example is ornate and shiny, you can see the dark blue tattoos on his light blue skin clearly and his halberd blades are shiny with sharpness.  His canteen and clothing flap about when he runs full speed. That's all good stuff. But why is there such weird draw in in some areas? There are times when you can literally catch the Xbox taking its time drawing elements of the level if you quickly hit the camera snap trigger.  It's sort of the same way a toddler would try to quickly put the lid on the cookie jar and make everything look nice, neat and normal if you catch him by surprise.  The textures on the hills, bushes, trees and rocks leave a lot to be desired. Maybe we're spoiled by Halo where the crags and crannies of the rocks stay nice and detailed when you're right up against them. At a glance, the paved walkways, doors and other structures look detailed enough but the subterfuge doesn't last upon closer inspection.   Azurik's animation is decent. He's got a number of attacking, jumping, swimming and idle moves that get the job done, but are no better than what we've seen in other adventure games on older systems. The animation on the enemies is downright hokey. They don't look vicious or intimidating and their moves hardly seem aggressive. The massive warlords are the only ones that will make you crap on yourself and that's mainly because they're gigantic. But it's the other, little guys I have a problem with. They flip and flop around and mosey about in some vaguely threatening manner. When you attack some of them it's almost like whacking some rare exotic animal from a Discovery Channel special. It seems even Perathians have a penchant for destroying what they do not understand.   Sound The sound effects are decent and the music is actually above average. The tunes peak nice and dramatically when you've done something well or accomplished a goal. It's nothing you'd want to buy on a CD and bump in your ride, but it does add to the sense of adventure that Azurik is supposed to have.   Azurik's grunts and heaves while fighting get pretty aggravating a few minutes into the game. Like all of the other sound effects for the creatures and mechanisms, his sounds seem to be there only because they have to. I can't imagine anybody worked to hard researching and brainstorming what kind of sound a little purple pygmy enemy from Perathia would sound like, so the placeholder effect was left in the game. And that purple pygmy sound was one of the more enjoyable enemy sound effects. But overall the sounds seem barely adequate and in the case of the enemies not very relevant to that enemy's personality.   The ambient sound and audio channel separation is good enough to keep you immersed even though the effects themselves are weak. Waterfalls and even some of the weird penguin/snail looking flying enemies splash and caw in relation to where you have the camera positioned, not where Azurik is standing.  I dig games based on elemental powers like the upcoming Nightcaster, but Azurik just couldn't bring all of the action adventure elements together that it needed to. The story is good enough, the gameplay mechanic of utilizing the right combo of elemental powers is definitely good enough but the camera control isn't tight enough and the levels aren't solid enough to compel any but the most dedicated Azurik fan to stay involved in this game. It's okay for Microsoft to put out niche titles that aren't everybody's cup of tea, but there can't be too many more first party games that have basic gameplay flaws like an uncooperative camera or illogical level design. Sega, Nintendo and Sony have always made sure that their games for their systems were well executed, even if the concept was way off. With Azurik, the concept may not be very original but it's certainly strong enough to warrant a game but it should've been a game that looks and works because its on the Xbox.", "date": "Dec 8, 2001"}
