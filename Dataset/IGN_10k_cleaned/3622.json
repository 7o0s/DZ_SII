{"name": "N2O", "name_review": "N2O: Nitrous Oxide", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/06/18/n2o-nitrous-oxide", "text": "With nods to Tempest, Stun Runner, and Nanotek Warrior, N2O brings contemporary music (The Crystal Method) and a fast, fluid, hallucinogenic graphics display to the basic shooter formula, and succeeds wildly. Fox Interactive begun plugging the PlayStation's gaming holes a while back, starting with the above-average Croc, a slew of sports games, and now finally, the awesome N20: Nitrous Oxide.  Essentially, the SoundScope and Tempest merged into one, and frankly, nothing could be better for a few hours of unintelligent, finger-pumping goodness. The game goes like this: You're in a tunnel, you shoot your enemies. You encounter bugs, mushrooms, cocoons, coins, and all sorts of other cool things. The environments are smooth, seamless surfaces and curves, but the tracks, thankfully, aren't limited to curved walls. Later in the game, flat and angular walls, rippling and warping in realtime will come at you like some crazy '60s dance party. Even further in the game, several courses will unroll or split.  N2O's graphic engine features the most amazing lighting you're ever going to see in a PlayStation game. And despite what anyone tells you, it's not drug influenced. (Cough, cough, like no way, dude, it's just not). The gratuitous spotlights reel and flash through the length of the tunnel, and weapons and projectiles cast their own light along the wall. Some track sections will shed their own light, including some surreal underwater-esque sections.  The best thing is that N20 is big and filled with more than 100 levels, just like Player 1's brilliant (and highly ignored) remake of Robotron 64.   It's a fun, fast, pure psychadelic shooter that you won't find on Nintendo 64 ever. Get it.  Douglass Perry", "date": "Jun 18, 1998"}
