Driving simulations are big because you can modify your car, try different models, and tinker a lot with the gameplay. It tends to have a lot of depth because there are many things you can try to win.  On the other hand, the arcade racer has the tendency to be easier for beginners, since there are only three or four car models to play with, and you can do things that would never be possible in real life without (i.e., slam through brick walls and logs) a heavily armored Ferrari. Control is usually tight, and the action fast, but there's not much depth. THQ's Ray Tracers is probably the quintessential arcade racing game.  The gameplay in Ray Tracers is classic Chase HQ. You're seated in an indestructible high-performance race car, and it's your job to race through exotic courses destroying everything in your path. At the end of each level, you have up to a minute to destroy an anime-style boss vehicle by slamming into it.  It sounds simplistic, and your assumption is correct. That's pretty much all you do in the game. Sure, there are lots of different cars and bosses, but it's all about bumping things and destroying them. However, that's surprisingly fun.  Technically, Ray Tracers is well-polished. The control is tight, almost too tight at times, and the framerate is excellent. You really get a good sense of speed when you drive, and the course design is fun. There's nothing like doing a San Francisco Rush three story jump onto a stretch broken freeway and into a sewer. There aren't really enemies except for the bosses, but lots of obstacles that blow up real good.  Graphically, there's nothing to gripe about. In fact, Taito programmers were pretty thorough, including fake reflections on the car. Draw-in is minimal, and enemies are competently done. It looks fine, and you won't notice most of it because you're speeding by at 300km/h.  The only gripe I would have would be that there just isn't that much to play with. The object is always the same, and although the scenery changes, enemy AI doesn't get any smarter. It's still a fun game, but not one that'll keep you glued to your set late at night.  Ray Tracers is great for casual gaming, and one that you'll keep picking up every now and then.", "date": "Mar 11, 1998"}
