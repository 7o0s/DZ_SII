But what Conspiracy Entertainment and Data Design Initiative are doing with their line of budget Wii games is incredibly disappointing. These cookie-cutter games are designed strictly to dupe a few suckers at the register while caught up in Wii mania this holiday. And when games like Rock 'n Roll Adventure are unwrapped, there will be a (hopefully) small collection of gamers that wonder if this is the best the console can do. Rest assured, the Wii is much better than this -- but it's a shame it takes a game like this the underline the point.   Rock 'n Roll Adventure is a bad action game cut from the same fabric of the first generation of 3D platformers following the polygonal revolution. Those games suffered from lack of direction and the prayer that just having a handful of 3D effects would somehow obscure the laundry list of shortcomings. Rock 'n Roll Adventure uses the Wii's motion controls as just such a ploy, but those are so misused in this bland platformer that they add to the game's problems instead of distracting attention away from them.   Gamers play as tiny Elviz, a caricature of the King complete with the rhinestone-studded jumpsuit and pompadour hair. Elviz must rush through a handful of music-themed stages, bashing away enemies like living cymbals and AM-FM radios with his guitar. To complete each stage, Elviz much collect notes and find a series of platinum discs while you somehow make sense of a control scheme that is both strange and strangely unresponsive.   First of all, jumping is a real nuisance in Rock 'n Roll Adventures. Instead of jump mapping it to a button, you have to quickly flick the nunchuk attachment. To enact a double-jump and clear some particularly tough gaps, you must flick the nunchuk up again while Elviz is in midair. Since Elvis cannot actually run up stairs, this means you get the pleasure of bouncing the nunchuk up and down repeatedly to climb steps. The jumps are sometimes unresponsive, a problem compounded by the little hero's running skills and the camera's inability to adequate follow him around. Rock n' Roll asks for some precision jumps from time to time and these controls make sure you are frustrated and fall about every other time. (To be fair, you can press down on the d-pad on the Wii Remote to snap the camera back to Elviz. Get used to doing that, because you must mind the camera like a child in a candy store.)   Rock 'n Roll doesnt look nearly this good on-screen.   Attacking the snares and radios that want to eliminate Elviz is also a pain. To hit with the guitar, an attack that doesn't always connect even if you watch the guitar pass right through an enemy, you swipe the Wii Remote left and right. Now, combine these two actions in your head to get an idea of what you'll be doing with your hands if you ever have the misfortune to play this game. Left hand is bouncing the nunchuk up and down to jump while the control stick is moving Elviz. Right hand swipes side to side with the Wii Remote to swing a guitar. Your mouth? Spouting a stream of vulgarities.   Elviz also has a projectile attack that lets you aim the guitar with the Wii Remote. There is a lock-on that snaps the reticle to a target. Elviz then strums the guitar and sends out a little attack that looks surprisingly similar to Billy the Wizard's projectile attack. Hmm. These games share a decent amount of DNA, and neither is better for it.   The game doesn't look much better than the old PlayStation platformer Johnny Bazookatone, mixed with a little of the completely forgettable Tempo for the Sega Genesis 32X. The areas are bright and colorful, but the musical theme isn't terribly inventive. You'll see a lot of the same textures and enemies over and over in the game. The music is only decent, occasionally punctuated by little guitar effects. Elviz will also break into small voice samples, quipping ~thank you very much~ when a goal is reached.  Rock 'n Roll Adventures is completely out of tune. The game is a total relic from an era that has been long put to bed and then made even worse by poorly implementing the Wii's controls. Moving Elviz around is a chore, even when the controls are responsive and the camera keeps its end of the bargain. When so many good games for the Wii flank it on the shelves, there is just no need to even give this game a second look. Avoid it and apply your gaming dollars to a far worthier game. You deserve simply better.", "date": "Dec 18, 2007"}
