Sort of the whole Hegelian dialectic thing in game form. See, you've got the thesis and the antithesis and they combine to form the synthesis. It's as clear as it can be. But I digress. CCIV takes the strategic elements of CCII and the tactical elements of CCIII and fashions one of the most engaging and effective real-time depictions of combined arms, platoon level warfare. The result is a game that will be completely familiar to fans of the series, except it's better. In the area of mechanics and graphics, CCIV improves on the earlier versions.  But first, a little history. By the end of 1944, WWII seemed to be a foregone conclusion...at least in Europe. The Germans were fighting a forced retreat back to their own borders. In December of that year, 75,000 American troops settled down for a long winter's nap in the Ardennes Forest. Unbeknownst to our heroes, the Germans were planning a massive counterattack. The attack came on the morning of December 16 as 250,000 German troops poured into the Ardennes. The attack resulted in a huge bulge in the Allied line. Now you know why it's called the Battle of the Bulge. Use this knowledge wisely. The Allies fought as they withdrew and blunted the German attack long enough for Allied reinforcements to arrive and turn the tide of the battle. Within less than four weeks, the German offensive had been halted. Then we won the war.  Now that the history lesson is over, let's talk about the game. You are placed in the role of strategic and tactical commander of various American and German battle groups in the Ardennes. On the strategic level, you order the various battle groups around a realistic map of the Ardennes. Keep in mind the placement of roads and supply depots as they will make or break your long-term battle strategy. They'll even have quite an effect on the smaller actions that you fight from day to day. The road system is especially well implemented. The large map of the Ardennes is divided into several smaller zones. A network of roads connects each of these zones. Whoever controls these roads has a definite strategic advantage in terms of mobility and supply.  Once the strategic movements for each day have been executed, you switch to the tactical interface. This is the real meat of the game. Each battle group is composed of a primary platoon, a secondary platoon and a reserve platoon of five units each. You place these units within your area of the tactical map, while your opponent does the same for his side. During this initial placement phase, you may also assign orders to each of your units. This really helps alleviate that awkward initial phase in each battle where your guys wait around before seeking cover.  The great thing about the game is something you will never be able to see -- namely the mechanics. CCIV takes into account true line-of-sight and line-of-fire physics. There's none of that sissy fog-of-war stuff here. You know what the terrain looks like; you just don't know where the enemies are. Although the line-of-fire rules can be maddeningly frustrating when you're trying to set up your Panzerschrecks for an attack, the frustrations are entirely realistic.  Another brilliant dimension to the game is the concept of soldier states. There are 15 levels of ability for each soldier between healthy and dead. Your soldiers can get tired and they can get scared. At some point, they may even stop obeying your orders. If their situation worsens, they may decide to flee the battlefield all together. Each individual soldier in each unit is further rated in five performance areas -- strength, morale, experience, intelligence and leadership. While morale and experience are the two most obviously significant, the other areas should not be discounted. For those of you who prefer the George Patton approach, you can shut off your soldiers' sense of self-preservation and ignore unit states entirely.  You will find yourself in command of regular infantry and armor but you'll also get access to more specialized units. Snipers, scouts and AT infantry are offer you a unique set of tactical options. Machine guns and flame-throwers make great anti-personnel weapons while artillery and mortars help clear out those pesky tanks. The game manual and tutorial contain some nice sections on tactics so you can get a head start on your enemy.  The number of orders that you can issue to the units is fairly limited, but it's more than adequate. You can order three types of movement from sneaking to running. You can also set up ambushes and defensive positions. Most units also carry smoke grenades that can be used to screen your movements from the eyes of the enemy. What else? Oh right, you can fire too. You can also set waypoints for movements with a pretty basic interface. CCIV also adds the option to call in air strikes and artillery barrages at certain points. These are only available several minutes into each scenario but can effectively turn the tide for either player. Plus they look neat.  Winning the battles is more than a matter of killing the other player's troops. There are several outcomes for each fight. First, you could kill the other player's troops. But you probably expected that one. The battles may also end at a certain predetermined time or when the morale of one side gets too low. Victory is a function of location control in this game. Whoever controls more victory locations at the end of the fight wins. Victory locations include crossroads, buildings and connections to other tactical maps. By far the most intriguing option is declaring a truce. If, and that's a big if, the other player agrees to the truce, both sides are allowed to recover their wounded. Units will either repair or disband based on their current status. But hostilities will break out anew soon enough.  And all this action will play out over some great looking maps. While some will criticize the maps for looking the same, that's a factor of geography. Talk to the Earth if you've got problems. Here's one of my main problems with this game. It's nearly impossible to spot your units while they're lying prone on the snow. But what the maps lack in visual variety, they make up for in tactical breadth. There are enough differences between the maps that you'll find fresh challenges with each new fight.  And the AI makes it plenty challenging. Apart from the numerical disparity in some of the battles, the AI offers a worthy challenge to most players. It places units with an eye towards larger, tactical goals. It uses defensive units to fix your attacks while the attacking units come in from the flanks. Overall, it's an amazing adversary that should stimulate you to refine and rethink your tactics. In terms of strategy, it's not as good, but still formidable.  The fact that the game ships with three small campaigns as well as a giant campaign that recreates the entire Wacht am Rhein struggle (that's the German name for the Battle of the Bulge), gives this title ridiculous replayability. There are also some smaller operational level actions that you can get involved in as well as over 40 individual battles. The battles are wonderfully self-contained and offer a quick fix for those of you with social responsibilities (family, religious beliefs, jobs, etc.). Long after I knew enough to write the review I kept coming back to the game. And I'm planning on playing some more once I'm done writing so let's wrap it up. You like wargames? Get this one.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Dec 9, 1999"}
