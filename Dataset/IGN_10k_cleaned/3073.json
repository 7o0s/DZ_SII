I wasn't very nice. In fact, I was downright mean on some accounts and I still feel that my feelings of anger at having to play that game are pretty justifiable. So you can imagine my excitement level when handed the stand-alone sequel/expansion called Real War: Rogue States.  I have to say, they had nowhere to go but up on this one, so a little improvement was expected. And a little improvement was received. While it still isn't perfect and it's still not the best RTS you'll find out on the shelves, you'll find this one much better than the first. Many of my main complaints about gameplay issues have at least been improved if not fixed, although some annoying hang-ons are still there to get my goat up.   Real War: Rogue States starts where the last one left off. The US ~peacekeeping~ force threw a whole lot of peace right in the Independent Liberation Army's (ILA) face, punching and kicking a little bit along the way just for fun. But as we're quickly learning in the real world, terrorist organizations just don't really go away no matter how many limbs you cut off. So the ILA is back and this time they've managed to steal and deal for some of the latest weapon technology in the world. So once again, the United States is going to have to pony up the manpower and tech to try and take these guys out.   Which once again is one of the strange things about this game. The ILA is gigantic. If it can compete with the US in terms of military might, why doesn't it just claim some countries as its own? Keeping armies this size (along with planes and ships and tanks and this and that) would be terribly difficult. It seems as though these guys just have gigantic war factory bases all over the world with no one the wiser until some intelligence gets brought in and you're sent to deal with it. Oh well, whatever, in the overall picture, the story really isn't going to real you in anyway, it's just a device to help progress the missions a little bit.   During the course of the game, you'll be able to play on both sides of the coin. Terrorist or US. Each pretty much has the same weapons available to them in different forms except for a couple of units like the Stealth Bomber and the Scud Missile, which are side specific. For the most part, the units are actually balanced fairly well as you might hope for with the one exception I still take with the artillery, which still seems to be near useless. Attacking buildings with them just brings the pain from tanks and they die really fast, and they have no hope of hitting anything that's moving. This is one of those units that should be able to lay down a barrage as a special attack or something. As they are, they mostly serve as fodder for my armies.   The great thing is, with the mess Real War was in, it was hard to tell anything about the balancing at all since your troops were so busy running in circles bonking their heads together and giggling like schoolgirls. This is all thanks to the much-improved AI. Finally, there's actually some pathfinding code in place. It still isn't perfect, but your units get where they were sent without wandering to every corner of the map. There are still some problems with infantry movement (you'll see them run backwards when you tell them to move sometimes) and with the landing boats, which have a hard time loading up troops sometimes, but this area is much, much better.   While some portions of the AI were indeed better, some suffer from the same problems as the first. For whatever reason, some units have a hard time picking targets, especially the anti-aircraft vehicles. These damn guys will literally just sit there while attack helicopters pick all of your units off. In all fairness, I guess they find their own targets about half the time as far as I can tell. It's seriously frustrating when you don't have the option to place stationary anti-aircraft weapons down on certain maps.   I've also found that ground units still have a hard time intelligently picking targets. I found that sometimes tanks would choose to pick off enemy infantry (the kind that can't damage your tanks) before taking on enemy tanks. Each unit type should have a priority list of units types to attack first barring direct orders.   The interface for giving orders still has its good and bad points as well. I want my double click! Give me my double click to pick all units of that type on the field! It's a pain in the ass having to separate them all. The graphical interface in the bottom middle of the screen is actually pretty useful as it was before for certain things, but doesn't go as far as it should have to be a really successful tool. In this portion of the GUI, you'll see tabs for all of your units and buildings. You can select by air, sea, land, special, and buildings for easy access to unit types. It's a great idea, but you should be able to select multiple units of the type. If you're all the way across the map and need immediate air support while trying to direct your ground troops in an efficient manner, you don't want to have to keep going back and forth to select multiple and different types of units. Normal people will find it pretty hard to split concentration during the often-chaotic fights.    On the defense side of things, defensive buildings should be accessible as units as well. When playing against the US, you'll often encounter stealth units that can evade radar. In order to shoot down one of these bombers before it can deal a whole lot of damage, you'll need to select all of your anti-air units and tell them to attack the offending craft. Otherwise, they'll just sit there and won't see the unit. The problem is, you can't tell your stationary anti-air guns to attack at once. The click and drag method of selecting units only selects your units, not the buildings. Which is normally good, except in the case of your defensive buildings that need to be working for you immediately.   One last issue surrounds the sea going vessels. It seems as though carriers would be able to scramble their air to air vehicles (or subhunter copters) when under attack, but there's no option for that. There were times that I would come back and find my carrier destroyed without me even knowing it was under attack. Defend yourself damnit, you have the weapons...   One other feature that would have helped to knock down the micro-management and let players play the game is the inclusion of an optional way to auto-repair buildings and units. Just a simple switch to for each to turn auto-repair on and off would have been nice. Having to go back to base and check each individual building to see if it's damaged is a pain. And having a ~send unit to repair~ option on vehicles would have been nice. A quick click that sends them back for repairs and returns them to where they started would have been awesome, especially since keeping units alive means they get more powerful. As it is, directly managing repairing of units is pretty time consuming and eventually not worth the effort.   So the game didn't fix or add everything that I wanted, but it did add a couple of nice features that I liked quite a bit. The first of these was the direct from building unit orders. Pretty much, you can select a unit being built at your base before it's finished and give it orders to follow upon completion, such as attacking locations, or going to patrol and area or the like. Once again, the problem with this is that you have to set the orders for every unit in the queue separately. Having a multiple selection process would have made this feature perfect. As it is, you'll certainly want to use it, it's very handy.    What did you think of Real War: Rogue States? The biggest addition to the game in general that can be seen is the new and improved skirmish and multiplayer functionality. You have a lot more options at your fingertips before joining a game with pre-determined rules for each map if you choose to use them. The supply modes are the best you'll find to compete against friends and computer opponents as they provide a better path for frenzied play. In these modes, there will be supply dumps scattered around the map for players to get more resources. One of the modes even features these dumps as the only way to get resources at all by taking away the option to built depots.   Multiplayer has been given a bit of an overhaul as well with a new mode called component commander that lets players partner up and take control of portions of the fighting force. One takes the land and special forces while the other takes the air and sea. The two players do not share resources and must ask their partner for attacks and help. It forces player interaction, but can be a bit tricky to manage if you and your game partner have different ideas for strategy. Let the power struggle ensue... However, if you are working in harmony with one another, it can be a pretty fun experience.With all of the new units and features that Rogue States provides as well as the much-improved AI engine, you have to give them a good score for effort. The graphics received minor attention again with some new building animations and more detail, but the game still looks pretty old. Its menu overhaul and sound improvement are also noted, but still leave a bit to be desired.If you're looking for a real-time strategy title that takes a look at modern day warfare in a realistic fashion, this is probably about as good as you're going to get. I'm not going to totally warn people away from this one like I did to the first one, but if the era and weapon set isn't a necessary part of your strategic enjoyment, there are still better titles out there with more polish and fun then you'll find in Real War: Rogue States.", "date": "Oct 17, 2002"}
