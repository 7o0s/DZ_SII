This review is going to be a tad biased simply because I've been a big GTA fan for quite sometime. Granted, Grand Theft Auto has always been knocked for it's grainy look, but its concept is what's most appealing to me -- steal cars, shoot up cops, steal more cars, deliver some drugs, steal more cars, beat some dude's ass and steal more cars. Doing it in London is just a bonus for me.  Let's jump right in with the basics. GTA London 1969 allows gamers to assume the role of one of eight criminals (Rodney Morash is my personal fav). Once you've picked a hoodlum, you'll start your criminal career by doing odd favors for a wannabe of a gangster, Harold Cartwright. As you progress, you can move up the food chain of mobsters by taking out key guys, doing deliveries, and stealing selected automobiles. Eventually, you'll bump off all the competetion to become the big man on the streets of London.  So what does this mission pack have to offer that the original version can't give you? First off, it's staged in London. The city maps feature a few of London's most famous landmarks such as Big Ben, the Tower of London, and Buckingham Palace. It also has London-like audio. Meaning, everyone speaks with a British accent -- I'm not sure if that's a selling point or not. Finally, you'll get a great big dose of late 60's British music. The soundtrack creates an amazing London vibe. It's so Austin Power-ish that it will make you all moist inside, yeah baby, yeah!  When you try and look past the cosmetic changes, you'll notice that GTA London, 1969 boasts 36 new missions, 30 new vehicles and most importantly, ~unlimited criminal opportunity.~ Unfortunately, most of the new missions require the same basic activities of the original GTA (stealing cars, shooting up cops and delivering drugs)and the new cars look cool, but with the possible exception of the scooter, they're all pretty much equivalent to autos you had access to the first time around. As for the unlimited criminal opportunity, while it is nice to be able to buzz around the city at your leisure stealing cars and capping fools, the open ended gameplay doesn't really have you doing anything different.   In a nutshell, this game is GTA with a facelift and it's definitely worth the 20 bucks if you loved the original GTA. But in all fairness, for those who didn't get a huge thrill out of the original version of GTA will probably be  disappointed with this add-on and  may find the gameplay to be more of the same. Although it has a fresh look and story, as far as play mechanics are concerned, nothing really new has been added and is essentially the same old game -- steal cars, shoot up cops, steal more cars, deliver some drugs, steal more cars, beat some dude's ass and steal more cars. Fortunately, that's more than enough to keep me entertained.   -- Jay Boor", "date": "Jun 4, 1999"}
