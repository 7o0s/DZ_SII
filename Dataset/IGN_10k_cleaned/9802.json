Bomberman, decked out in his signature sneaks and flashy white helmet, has lit the fuse on the iPod, further bolstering the image of Apple's media players as legit gaming rigs. Based on Bomberman's old-school, two-dimensional romp, this iPod action game offers throwback fun to older gamers that appreciate the simple pleasure of blowing up enemies with googly eyes.   As a gamer that grew up with Bomberman and once imported a multi-tap controller hub (shaped like Bomberman's head) so I could jam on the Saturn version with nine other friends, I admittedly dug into this iPod port with glee. The game offers a veteran player four or so hours of fun, zooming through twenty levels of classic maze-running fun. Everything I loved about the original Bomberman adventures is front-and-center -- clean objectives, snappy controls, and a great look. Very cool: The iPod edition of Bomberman features an exclusive final boss, which is a massive brute that has to be bombed multiple times and is something of a challenge.   But even a complete newcomer to Bomberman will find quite a bit to like here. The pace of the game is smart -- the first few mazes are slow enough to get the basics of Bomberman down. You run through the brick-filled maze, dropping bombs to open up paths and hopefully uncover some power-ups, such as extra bombs, speed boosts, and blast radius boosts. In order to clear a stage, you must eliminate all of the monsters roaming the maze with your bombs and then uncover the exit. After the first five mazes, though, Bomberman becomes a solid challenge -- this is no cakewalk. The enemies get faster and more aggressive -- you need to gather up as many power-ups as possible to keep the advantage.   Between each batch of five stages, Bomberman enjoys a little mini-game that offers a chance to win extra lives. There is a simple bowling game, a whack-a-mole game, and a running game where you jump over big bombs. None of these minis standout enough to deserve significant spotlight, but they are welcome breaks in the action. Plus, after each mini is encountered, it can be replayed for fun in the game's Challenge Mode. (You can replay any previously played level here, too.)   Now, with any action game on the iPod, control is a potential minefield. Control woes muted by initial enthusiasm for Sonic the Hedgehog, even thought he game looked like a million bucks on a crisp iPod nano display. Bomberman fares much better. The game requires some twitch reflexes, especially in higher levels, but just using a light touch on the click-wheel to move Bomberman was never an issue. You drop bombs with the center button and since the enemies are never so out-of-control, I never died from futzing with dropping a bomb while moving.  Bomberman is a fun fit for the iPod. Not only do the old-school visuals look good on the iPod screen, but the measured pace of the game works well with the game's perfectly acceptable click-wheel controls. A Bomberman fan like me will download this in a heartbeat ($5 is a steal even if the game is a tad short), but even total newcomers or casual fans will still get a kick out of Hudson's hero.
