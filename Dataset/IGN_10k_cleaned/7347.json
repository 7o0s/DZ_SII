The game wasn't perfect, but it was a nice homage to more classic titles and for a kids game it was better than expected. Now the teenager turned super powered ghost is making his way to the Nintendo DS in an all new title, Danny Phantom: Urban Jungle. And while the game is a fairly fun shooter game, it doesn't live up to the potential it could have on the DS.   Danny Fenton faces the same kind of problems all kids his age do. He has to save the world from the horrible doom he unwittingly unleashed upon it when he was playing in his father's lab and accidentally opened a portal to a dimension of ghosts. Ah, to be young again! Because of his romp in ghost world, Danny can now also turn into a ghost, but he gets super powers. Sure this all sounds cool now, but when he gets older and tries to pick up chicks without a corporeal body it'll all come back to bite him in his wispy ghost butt. For now Danny saves the world as Danny Phantom and tries to get all the ghosts back in their own dimension.   Unlike the previous Danny Phantom title, this game focuses solely on the flying shooter aspect. Players control Danny with the D-pad and shoot at any and every ghost he encounters with the A button. Danny can equip himself with three special abilities that can be used to help in his fight. Abilities like invisibility or shooting ice help make the job easier. Using the special abilities takes up energy though, so they have to be used carefully. Danny has four different types of firepower, normal, pulse, homing, and laser. By collecting power cells, the attacks can be upgraded, giving players an advantage over their ghostly adversaries.   Everything in the game looks great, if it was a GBA title. The cutscenes are actually pretty well done, with the look and feel of the show remaining intact. Each cutscene is accompanied by a 3D rendering of one of the locales seen in the show, so fans of the series are sure to get a kick out of how well that's done. The gameplay graphics leave something to be desired. While the many different types of energy blasts certainly look cool, Danny himself is small and not very detailed. Everything is brightly colored and keeps the style of the show. The backgrounds are somewhat plain, but there is so much going on in the screen that most people won't even be looking at them. Music in the game is just okay. The songs aren't annoying, but they sound mostly the same, so it just fades away from consciousness after a few minutes. Some nice things are that all of the weapons make different zappy noises, and the large variety of ghouls are all easily distinguishable. No recolored generic bad guys here. Still the game just looks like a nicely polished GBA game for the most part.    The DS engine comes into play during the ghost dimension levels where Danny is piloting a ship through the space. The game becomes a 3D shooter, offering up a whole new batch of enemies and a completely different feel. However the mode is not near as functional as it should be. The ship blocks a lot of the player's view and the level doesn't seem nearly as fastpaced or exciting as the rest of the game. It's an awkward, kind of drab middle section for the title.   The touch screen acts as a chamber to hold various powerups. Instead of just regaining health or energy when Danny flies into the powerups, they move into special compartments on the touch screen. Here they can be used whenever players want during that level. The touch screen also functions as a means to switch between weapons and special moves. Everything on the touch screen can be accessed with the buttons, except the powerups. In a fast paced game like this, the ability to get a health boost with a press of a button would have been a lot more helpful than having to try and tap the right compartment while shooting and dodging bad guys. Really the compartments are unnecessary. Creating a stockpile of health boosts to use as players see fit is nice if the game was harder, but it just isn't that difficult of a title. If Danny just got the effect of the powerup when he flew over it then he would still be getting plenty of health boosts while maintaining a challenge.   There are three difficulty levels for Danny Phantom, though they are not readily apparent. Players have to select the difficulty from a separate screen before starting the game, so chances are that when someone loads the game up they'll just start playing the easy mode. And when we say easy, it's an understatement. Their easy mode practically guides the player by the hand. The game is practically on autopilot. We found it nearly impossible to die most of the time, even without all the powerups, and the ability to actually absorb many of the enemy attacks. If players can manage to off themselves, Danny will just reappear to keep fighting. This is a mode someone would switch to when their five year old brother wants to play the game, it shouldn't be the default difficulty.  Danny Phantom: Urban Jungle is a GBA game that wants to be a DS game when it grows up. The shooting is fun for the most part, but we would have preferred more challenging gameplay. There isn't much gameplay to be had, so the game is somewhat limited to fans of shooters or Danny Phantom. Still, we could see the series shaping up to be a solid license game in the future.", "date": "Oct 10, 2006"}
