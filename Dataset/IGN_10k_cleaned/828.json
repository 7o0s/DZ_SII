Ever since Gran Turismo 2 stepped up with a rally mode, every two-bit development team with a laid-off staff of snowboard programmers has tumbled and scrapped like wild dogs trying to get their own rally challenge to market. Surprisingly, many have been quite good.  Mobil 1 Rally Championship, however, isn't even close. Why EA picked this one up from Europe is a great big mystery: their own V-Rally 2 game is so superior to this, and even Mobil fans -- whoever those people are, the gas loving freaks -- may go Chevron after this no-octane racer.  Gameplay This game isn't a good rally racer, but it would have made a swell slot car Tyco Electric Racing Set game. The steering is terribly slippery. Even gradual turns start spinning the back end to the side, like there is a feud going on with the bumpers over who should lead. When playing with an analog Dual Shock, oversteering is as simple as twitching your thumb.  True, rally racing is all about sliding and controlling your slide for your advantage. But in Ridge Racer, in Sega Rally, and in Rally Cross -- games that put the power into power sliding -- these slides were thick, burly, horse-powered slides. They had momentum. Sliding was a trick, and when a gamer learned to harness the slide, he became king of the road like Roger Miller never knew. Not so in Mobil 1 Rally Championship. Here, sliding just means you are out of control, and since any marginal degree of steering kicks your ass end into a slide, that means you are ALWAYS out of control.  Count also that slides kill your momentum (they literally stop the car dead in a well-taken turn), and you have a very bad control design. Actualize and HotGen Studios (the company behind -- or almost behind -- the Game Boy Color version of Resident Evil) have built a racer that follows no logic. Cars skid just as easily on paved streets as they do in slippery gravel, and car modifications don't help the depth either -- why bother changing to spiked tires when slicks work brilliantly in the snow?   Graphics  Set deep in the British Isles, Mobil 1 Rally already has a strike against it -- unless you are a real rally fan, the locales of Wales, Scotland, and England just aren't as fascinating and exotic as the international tours of V-Rally 2 and Colin McRae Rally. They could have been. England is a beautiful place at times, and the races there are famous and popular for a reason.  But racing in Mobil 1 Rally Championship isn't a lovely trek through scenic Vauxhall. It's a long, arduous, lengthy, prolonged, drawn-out, dragged-out, tedious, boring, heavy-laden, overlong trek through scene after scene of repeating landscape. Passing by a log pile once is interesting, in a folksy kind of way; passing by the same log pile 10 times in a race -- a race which, incidentally, only breaks from its bland forest terrain when a log pile is placed somewhere on a track -- is dull like the dickens.  Tracks in Mobil 1 Rally Championship are tight to avoid pop-in, which was a futile effort. In the process, HotGen has made tracks almost impossible to negotiate (particularly with the sad steering), and passing cars in the special arcade mode is near impossible. It's not that their AI is smart. The tracks are just too damn slim for two cars!  If the game designers meant to keep the framerate up with these narrow courses, they failed there, too. Astoundingly, the game's designers have nailed the near-trademarked EA framerate, which is a half-smooth, half-choppy, never fully smooth but not bad enough to ruin the gameplay yet enough to bug a player, kind of framerate. It's almost as the design team said, ~Well, we're doing an EA game. Let's lock it down under 30 and program a few hiccups just to keep things consistent.~  Sound We have a problem here. As an experiment, I turned the volume down completely on the sound effects (which are terribly rendered faux engine noises with only a handful of environmental effects to sweeten the mix) and music (which doesn't play in gameplay) and just isolated the co-pilot voice. And, even then, I still couldn't understand a single word that guy said!   The accent I can bear, because it makes sense in the type of game this is to have a cockney navigator (even though I would have much preferred a re-recorded accented voice for America). It's the sound quality that really wrecks everything. It's like the navigator actor phoned in his lines on cross-country phone lines, and then that was phoned in Pan-Atlantic to another studio, who phoned that sample Pan-Pacific to somebody else, who the phoned that in cross-country to the sound team in the next room over from the voice over talent. And they recorded it on a handheld recorder. It's maddening to realize that this voice is supposed to be helping you drive when all you can think is, ~WHAT ARE YOU SAYING!~       This wasn't a very shrewd pick-up for EA. As a regional-based game, it has only novelty appeal here. As a rally racing game, nothing hasn't been done here that hasn't been done much better in V-Rally 2 and Colin McRae Rally. And as a game, it sucks diesel. With good steering, it might have been a fun niche game. Might being the key word. But you don't drive this game. It drives you, right into cul-de-sacs and trees. Keep your lead foot off this game. It's true scrap.", "date": "Mar 31, 2000"}
