Each game has a different feature set. Hopes were indeed high that the PS2 version would not only score big in the graphics and sound, but that EA would somehow manage to capture some of the realism of F1 racing that has eluded console F1 games...well...forever!   Having reviewed the PlayStation versions of F1 2000 and F1 Championship series 2000, as well as the PC version of F1 CS 2000, I could see how the PlayStation 2 could be caught in the middle. The PlayStation One title is very arcade-ish, while the PC version is an outstanding simulation with realistic physics and lap times (and hefty hardware requirements!). To figure out what EA was actually aiming at for this version, I turned to the EA Sports web site where F1 2000 PS2 producer Pete Smith is interviewed. I find the answers to his questions revealing because they give us an idea of what THEY think they have produced, and I can then tell you what they actually DID produce!   Gameplay The first thing I want to make clear is that this is NOT a particularly accurate F1 simulation. By this I don't mean that the cars don't feel nice to drive or that the speed and look of F1 is not there, but simply that this is not an accurate simulation of F1 vehicle dynamics. Not even close. The problems with the game are immediately apparent when you go into advanced mode, work like crazy to qualify at 1:11 at Spain (the real lap record is 1:24 so that tells you something), and then the AI proceeds to qualify at 1:06. So the fact that the AI is running 18 seconds faster than the lap record, and you are expected to get up to this level as well, tells you how forgiving the game is, as well as how much excessive grip is in the game. The question in my mind was whether EA thinks this is a virtue or a flaw? After all, F1 2000 on the PSX features similarly ridiculous times (making it pretty clear where the PS2 team got its ideas). For instance, in the EA Sports page interview, Pete was asked: ~Do you think that the new 128 bits machines will allow true simulations to appear on the consoles ? Would you look favourably on this ?~ The answer is telling: ~personally, I don't think the future of console racing is in simulations. It is easy to fall into the trap of thinking complex modelling of dynamics leads to great gameplay but to do this even on a PC would be a huge mistake. At the end of the day great gameplay comes from a flexible dynamics system and a huge amount of time listening to feedback and balancing the code.~   The translation here is: ~screw realism, we want gameplay~. Unfortunately, the two are not necessarily opposites. For example, what would we think of a football title from EA where to beat the AI you had to score 85 points on the highest difficulty level? Or a FIFA game where 20 point games were common? And yet, we're essentially being told to overlook realistic physics engines and lap times, and in which even a half decent gamer can shatter the real life track record using the out-of-the-box car setups! And to add insult to injury, Pete tells us: ~PC Sim fan or PlayStation 1 arcade player, our PS2 title has something for everyone.~ Well, Pete, no, it doesn't. If you've driven the PC simulation and enjoy its realism and expect a similar quality title on the PS2, wait until next year (maybe).   Now that we know that PC F1 sim-oriented fans are not going to be overly impressed by the realism in the title, let's turn our attention to PlayStation and PlayStation 2 gamers.   First of all, the game is remarkably simple in terms of modes of play. Unlike the other versions of EA's F1 titles, there is no school mode, no scenario mode, no ability to save and load setups, no telemetry and no end-of-race replays. The PS2 title is about as bare bones as it gets. The game modes for a single player are a single race, a championship season, and a custom season (pick the track order yourself).  There are options to set the number of laps, three levels of difficulty, whether or not you burn fuel and use up tires, what level of damage you can suffer (none, forgiving, and realistic), whether or not you get driving assists, and what kind of transmission you want.   There is also a ~Quick Race~ mode which lets you just drop into last place on a track and try to get as far up the field as you can in four laps. The game will give you points based upon the F1 point system, and remember how well you did. You can work your way through the set of tracks and it's a fun way to learn tracks.  If you drive with aids on you'll find that the game will assist you by auto-braking for you, giving you some traction control, and giving you icons of what kind of turn is coming up. An optional map overlay is also available. Once you're really driving the car, you find it rather satisfying to rip around the course. Sometimes you can get the car a little sideways and catch it, but most of the time you spin it because you have put a wheel off the track and spun out trying to accelerate and turn off of it. If too much of the car gets off the road you start to slow down, although the effect isn't that severe for just putting a wheel off so you don't need to have an unholy fear of trying to use up all the track.  Although you can do some limited reconfiguring of the controls (you have all of three presets), the X and Square buttons behave digitally. I was rather surprised these were not pressure sensitive. If they are, it's not documented and I sure couldn't tell while driving that there was anything other than an on of off state of the button. You can also race Gran Turismo style using the right stick up and down for gas and braking. Don't worry about locking up the brakes, though...I haven't been able to do it. Brake as hard as you like, then turn.  Semi-automatic shifting is provided, but the tach lights are on the top left of the screen, rather than on the steering wheel, which is rather a bummer. You have to learn to shift by sound rather than by the lights. A 'bug' in the game happens when shifting manually, as if you choose to start a flying lap or you leave the pits after service, the game leaves you in the gear you were last in. In the case of a flying lap where you are let loose headed at full throttle towards the start/finish line, you often are stuck in first gear. Not noticing this and shifting really fast will put you into a wall in a hurry!  This brings me to another aspect of the game that is good. You can choose to leave the pits, and go around the track once to start your timed lap, or just start at speed coming down the front straight. This saves on the tedium once you adjust to the above-mentioned bug of being stuck in a terribly inappropriate gear!  And now we come to gameplay. Assuming that high realism levels are not a strict requirement for you and you just want to race, the game can be fun, but again, not in a terribly realistic way. The biggest problem is that the AI does not drive around the track at the right speeds around each corner. This means you're either watching as cars run away from you through a twisty bit unrealistically, or you are passing three or four corners stacked up waiting to make a slow turn. If you don't anticipate the latter event you can create quite an accident. If your damage is off, you can take out a bunch of cars this way, if that's you're definition of fun. A good example is Spain. The first turn at the end of a 190mph straight is a right-left curve going up a hill. It cannot be straightlined without going over sand or grass. You have to drop a few gears and then negotiate it. Any AI cars in front of you, however, will zip right through the compex with no apparent slow down. But after you round the next carousel, the same cars are crawling along waiting to get into the slow left hander. That's where you pass them if you made up the time coming around the fast bend leading up to that point. This is just one example.   The cars are also pretty unpredictable. They'll pop out in front of you unexpectedly, dive bomb inside or outside of you to try to make a pass, and sometimes punt you into the weeds. My definition of AI is AI that races around the track with the same limitations you do, allowing you to follow them closely, set them up for passes, and then do so. The PS2 version of F1 is not such a game.  Because of the unpredictability of the AI cars, I set the damage model to 'forgiving'. This lets me race with some consciousness of damage, but not be easily taken out by poor AI (which frustrates me to no end). I did some laps, particularly in the wet, with the damage on full, and even the slightest bang into the wall will either kick your front wing off, or bend your wheel so badly that it wobbles drunkenly as you try to get going again. I haven't induced any flips or anything else particularly wild, but I'm sure I will if the AI keeps at it! Another note is that the cars can get scraped up if they rub up against other cars. What looks like black rubber is laid across the side of your car if you've interlocked wheels with another car, and it stays there.  Now, I'm sure the AI is beatable in the advanced level, but the fact is that I'm a little handicapped. Years of F1 simulation practice and TV race viewing have made me a little set in my ways. I cannot help but drive 'correctly' around the racing line of the course at the proper speed and gear. Clearly, to win, you have to setup your car appropriately, and then drive like a complete lunatic with complete disregard for whether or not what you're doing is possible in real life. Whether I can 'let it go' and win an advanced championship is an open question. Right now, I'm praying for the ~realism~ Easter Egg code from EA that will put F1 PS2 closer to the PC version in terms of grip and AI, but given Pete Smith's comments, I'm not terribly optimistic.  There is a multiplayer option for either splitscreen action or competitive time trials. The latter is a bit different because you take turns doing hot laps with any number of players participating. Sector times are shown and the times are all compared to who has laid down the fastest lap. There is no 'end' of the game. You just exit and the game lets you know who the winner was, and what his splits and final time was.   Graphics  All of the tracks, cars and drivers of F1 are faithfully reproduced, minus cigarette and alcohol livery of course. There are also 22 cars on the track representing the 11 teams in F1, so this isn't a situation where the developer cut down the number of cars for the sake of frame rate or to save on licensing fees.  The graphics engine of the game is quite decent, but not jaw dropping. The cars have some dynamic lighting on them which looks right, the drivers tilt their heads as they turn hard into a corner, and the wheels of the car turn as well. Sparks and smoke fly out from behind the car based upon wheelspin. From a rear view of the car, you can do a doughnut and watch the smoke from the burnout actually rotating in the direction of the spin. The tracks are well created (and updated to reflect the 2000 season) and appear to be borrowed from Image Space, the makers of the PC version. (I noticed in the credits of the game that Image Space was thanked and that lends some credibility to my guess!). The frame rate is generally high and only the barest hint of slowdown is available from time to time (far less often and less severely than SSX, the graphical highwater mark for the PS2 in the eyes of many). A few special effects are added, such as heat haze over the starting grid, and clouds of smoke in front of you if the car  ahead does a burnout.  Camera views include an over-the-nose camera which doesn't have a wide enough view to show you the outsides of the front wheels, an over-the-helmet view which shows the helmet of your driver beneath you, moving around under the lateral G forces, and a turning wheel (the BMW Williams even has the BMW logo on the middle of the wheel!). Working mirrors are only provided in this view, and they more or less just give a glance at what's behind you. A better view would have been a real in-car view but this was not provided, so you have to decide whether you want to sit on the nose, go with no bodywork at all in front of you, or sit about a foot about the driver's helmet (which looks much like an in-car TV camera used in races). You can also switch to external behind-car views if you prefer the more arcade-style of driving.  Weather is modeled, and you can choose rain, dry or random. The only problem is there seems to be no dynamic weather. If it's raining, it will do so for the entire race weekend, eliminating the whole strategy of changing from wet weather tires to the grooved slicks for dry weather. The rain is uninspiring. There is a bit of a plume behind the cars, and the handling of the car is a little more challenging, but the rain is no more interesting to see than it is on a PlayStation One, and there is no reflectivity on the track as I would have hoped. It's just dark and wet.  Replays are only available by pressing the Triangle button during the race. The last 15-20 seconds of your race is shown from TV angles and it looks pretty good, although I think that they are a bit low. There is no option to save replays, and there is no end of race replay, not even highlights!  Sound  The sound effects are very nice indeed. Although the engines are decent but not perfectly accurate, what IS nice is the wonderful sound of the cars braking down for a corner and the engine backfiring in a fast staccato. Hitting curbs also sounds great, rocks your dual shock controller, and rumbles your subwoofer (you do have one, right?).  A British ITV announcer talks about the tracks and the grid, but doesn't have anything to say during the race. An aggressive soundtrack is also provided, but is incredibly distracting and is probably more suited to NASCAR oval racing than the more focused F1 title, where audio cues are so much more important. In the end, EA has made a decent and somewhat playable PS2 F1 game, but not one I would recommend to people who take their racing games very seriously, especially given the very limited feature set of the first release, the overly arcade-style physics model, and the poorly modeled AI. If you think the game might be fun even with these limitations, the game is worth a rental. It looks and sounds nice, but doesn't have the lasting challenge and realistic gameplay I would have hoped to find, especially considering the high quality job done on their PC title. It's fair to say that this game represents a stripped down version of its Playstation cousin, but with better graphics, sound, and perhaps vehicle dynamics. Until EA holds its motorsports simulations up to the same high standards as its sports simulations (Madden springs to mind), we are going to continue to get arcade games with F1 tracks and cars slapped onto them, while being told that realism just doesn't matter on a console because it just doesn't make for good gameplay. Let's pray they wake up soon, as they did at some point when users were tired of putting up triple digit games in Madden because of bad AI and realism.", "date": "Dec 21, 2000"}
