That was before Nival and Ubisoft resurrected the franchise with last year's Heroes of Might & Magic V. Now, as if to prove the viability of the franchise, they've come back with a brand new expansion that includes an entirely new faction, a new campaign and a handful of additional features that were missing from the original game.  The new faction, called the Fortress (herein referred to by the less ambiguous label ~Dwarves~) are a welcome and overdue addition to the series. Though the rank and file soldier of the Dwarven army is a bearded shortie armed with an axe or hammer, some of the Dwarven units are surprisingly inventive. The bear riders for instance, can actually knock their opponents into adjacent tiles, making them almost as safe as the blood furies in terms of avoiding counter-attacks. The blade-wielding, kilt-wearing Berserkers can also avoid counter-attacks when using their blood frenzy power.   By far our favorite of the Dwarven units are the Warlords. These massive warriors carry powerful axes in their left hands and can use their flaming right hands to launch all manner of lightning attacks at their enemies. Even better, they can teleport around the battlefield, giving them a mobility that seems at odds with their size. Throw in resistance to lightning attacks just for good measure and you've got a unit that's worth their weight in gold.  In all the Dwarves seem to fit the overall pattern of most other factions. They're a little tougher overall, a little slower and not quite as versatile in ranged combat but, as with the armies of the other factions, you can downplay their weaknesses by adjusting the proportion of troops in a given army.  Dwarves have their own magic system based on runes. Rather than spending mana points to cast their spells, dwarves will spend resources to grant bonuses to their own units. As with the other factions' magic system, a wide range of skill upgrades give your hero the chance to increase the effectiveness or decrease the cost of these runes. Unfortunately, there's really nothing new for any of the other factions. Sure, there are some new items and heroes but there are no new abilities or units for any of the other groups to make use of.   Sadly, the campaign for Hammers of Fate is a bit dull. To begin with, the campaign is divided into three chapters of five missions each. The first entire chapter doesn't even let you get your hands dirty with the game's new faction. No, instead you spend another six hours trudging away with the same Haven units you were playing with in the last game. What's the point of making an expansion and not even giving players access to the new content right away? We could understand having a few Haven missions to provide some narrative continuity here but including five long missions that feel just like they were tacked on to the end of the original game is just stupid.  Not surprisingly, most of the missions are long and not very interesting. Rather than requiring the players to find inventive ways to accomplish their goals, most missions in Hammers of Fate simply force players to scour the entire map and eliminate every last army they encounter. This makes the campaign more a test of persistence than strategy.      The same can be said of the game's sometimes-spotty AI. Your enemies seem overly passive, even on the harder settings. It's not uncommon to encounter an enemy stronghold guarded by a single peasant or to watch an enemy hero completely ignore opportunities to seize areas you've left unguarded. The real reversals and upsets in the campaign are all so tightly scripted that they often seem more like the game is being unfair than challenging.  The same is true for the ridiculous number of barricades and gates found on the maps. To keep you from advancing into areas you're not supposed to explore, the designers thought it best to simply drop a few thousand enemy units in the nearest chokepoint. Being the pig-headed sorts that we are, we fought our way through a few of those groups and discovered that the only thing they were protecting was the designers' inability to come up with compelling a reason to place them there in the first place.   The caravans make a welcome appearance in the expansion. In Heroes V, players were required to send heroes from outpost to outpost recruiting small bands of units and then rallying them together in one spot. Managing all this by hand wasn't particularly difficult but it was definitely time consuming and, let's face it, a real pain in butt. Now players can actually use the hire screen in their settlements to recruit units from distant outposts and even other castles. Once hired the units will automatically travel to the town that ordered them and become part of the garrison there. Players can see the wagons on the adventure map itself and check their arrival time on the town's hire screen.  The only real problem with the caravan system is that the low-level outpost units won't be able to find room in friendly towns that are churning out the maximum numbers of upgraded troops. If you're building every kind of unit possible, you just won't be able to fit in any basic troops unless you have a hero on hand to switch the units in and out of the garrison so they can be upgraded. It would be even better if you could dispatch caravans to meet up with heroes in the field but the basic function of the caravan is such a great time-saver that we're not going to complain too loudly about the things that it doesn't do.  Hammers of Fate also allows for ~simultaneous~ online play. The game still plays out in discrete turns but players will move together. Once two player's heroes come into conflict with each other or are both within striking distance of the same resource, the game reverts back to the traditional ~I go, you go~ format. While it definitely speeds up the first few turns of the game, it doesn't do anything to streamline gameplay or ease boredom in the off-turns (despite the inclusion of ~ghost mode~).   Hammers of Fate comes with a custom map generator for players who would like a nice supplement to all the user-created content out there. The map generator definitely comes up with some interesting layouts but there's a serious lack of options for players who'd like to set up specific battles without resorting to using the editor. Beyond selecting the size, monster level and underground presence, everything is pretty much out of your hands. At the very least, it would nice to see an option to select specific factions or terrain types for a map. This is particularly aggravating since the Dwarven faction seems completely absent from the scenario maps that come with the expansion.  Hammers of Fate offers no real surprises in the areas of graphics or sound. The visuals are still fairly sharp and the new Dwarf designs and animations fit nicely with the overall art style of the game. We particularly like the upgraded Berserker armor and the freaky flaming fists of the Warlords. The Dwarven city is similarly well executed with plenty of style and impact. Unfortunately, the game still relies on poorly staged, unremarkable cutscenes run through the engine.Serious fans of Heroes of Might & Magic aren't likely to be discouraged by the lack of new content or the thirty-dollar price tag. With only one new faction and a smattering of new gameplay options, Hammers of Fate feels more like a small-scale mission pack than a full-fledged expansion. You'll get a good fifteen to twenty hours out of the campaign but it's not any better than the user-created content that's already available for free.", "date": "Dec 19, 2006"}
