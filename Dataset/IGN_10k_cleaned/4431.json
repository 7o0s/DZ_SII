From Rallisport to Project Gotham, just about every racing angle is covered. Well, except for Corvettes. I guess that makes Corvette, a budget-priced online racer, another good addition to the Xbox's stable of racing game, right? Well, not exactly. While not the worst racer on the console, the alternatives make Corvette appealing only to a small niche of people. Are you one of them?  Gameplay As its name betrays it purpose, Covette is all about, yup, Corvettes. No, it's not about collecting Corvettes, or even making model ones - it's about racing them. Corvette offers up the standard options found in almost every other racer on the planet. There's arcade, career, and special modes, as well as some split-screen/system link/Xbox Live multiplayer. The career mode is obviously the meat of the game and is structured like so: starting with a 1958 Corvette Convertible, you'll race match after match before earning yourself the right to move up to the next class of races, and cars.   The Special modes are the ones that break up the monotony of the game the most. With Hot Lap and Custom 'Vette challenges, Mother Road and Circuit endurances, and a Route 66 checkpoint mode, there's enough here to add to the game's longevity. It's a shame that you have to unlock these modes though, as many folks may not make it that far in the game. Rather than extending the game's longevity, having the modes locked may in fact shorten the game's already niche appeal.  Not every race is as simple as coming in first place. Some of them also have cops inCorvettes! All of the sudden the game turns into Need for Speed, with a cop who tries to run you off the road and bust you. Unfortunately, the AI is either too aggressive or too simple-minded to feel realistic. The same can be said for the other racers, too, as the game is at times way, way too easy or too demanding.    Corvettes physics don't help the situation. The cars don't feel as grounded as they should, and sometimes events will occur that are downright laughable. In one race, I hit a part of the dirt as I was trying to cut a corner and my car began doing 360s. Then, as I tried to straighten out, my car continued to do 360s in place. Only by taking my precious time to slowly reverse and straighten was I able to accomplish my goal. The problem is that by then, the race is over. And guess who's in last place?   The game's upgrading system is far from deep. As you win races in the Career mode, you'll earn points with which to buy car upgrades. After you win a race and earn point, though, your car is automatically upgraded with everything you can afford. Not exactly the tweaking I expected, but at least it's something.   Because this is a Corvette game, that's the only car you'll see in the game. There is a wide selection of them from over the last five decades, including a few special models like the Corvette ZR1. But unless you're a Corvette aficionado, a lot of them can look the same. There are a few touches that are cool, like how the speedometer will change to correspond to the Corvette's year, but overall, if you don't love Corvettes, this game won't change anything.  For a budget title, I was surprised to find not only multiplayer and system link options, but also full Xbox Live functionality. The game supports up to six players online and in system link, and two players in split-screen mode. There is no planned content for download later on.    Graphics There's nothing really wrong with Corvette's graphics. The models are decent, as is the faux soft lighting, and everything moves a brisk framerate. Other requisite standards (lens flares, reflections, etc) make an appearance, and the texture quality isn't bad. The big problem I have is that everything is soboring. In short, there's really nothing that makes Corvette look anything more than a generic racer with some strictly average technology.  Sure, there are a number of licensed companies (GM, Verizon, and so on) featured in the game - assumingly to give the game a more authentic feel - but honestly, the simple roadside objects and lack of any real pizzazz or flair make even starkly contrasting levels feel the same. At least the driver is animated - always a plus in my book.  Sound Following in line with the game's lackluster graphics is the music. Obviously a title without the budget for licensed music, Corvette features a host of clip art-like sounds and songs. From ho-hum techno to twelve-bar blues ripped straight from a Mel Bay book, if you're looking to hear something new, original, or simply good, look elsewhere. Custom soundtracks are also not supported.   The rest of the sounds do their job, but little else. Each Corvette model has its own engine sound, but there's definitely not the oomph there should be coming from a several hundred horsepower, two-ton machine. In its favor, not many racing do have incredible soundtracks, but less-budget titles do exude more authenticity.  For a budget title, Corvette offers some decent thrills and enough Corvette love to last you through the winter. The inclusion of online play is also a plus. What Corvette has working against it, though, are solid, if boring aesthetics, and iffy physics. With games like Project Gotham Racing, Sega GT Online, and Rallisport Challenge also available for the same low price of $20, it's hard to recommend Corvette unless you're a huge fan of the said car.", "date": "Feb 6, 2004"}
