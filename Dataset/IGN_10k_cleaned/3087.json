ToeJam and Earl: Mission to Earth is the third game in the ToeJam and Earl series, originally brought to life on the Genesis.  There was a sort of side game (Ready, Aim, Tomatoes) using the characters, but it was never really considered an official sequel.  Will the third iteration of the series lives up to its cult following, or will the game deflate into nothing more than a cheap cash-in on a (hopefully) bankable franchise?    GameplayThe basic premise of the game is that you (ToeJam, Earl, and Latisha) must find the stolen 12 Sacred Albums of Funk, and return them to their rightful owner, the Funkopotamous, otherwise known as Lamont.  Inevitably, you will take on the Anti-Funk, and save the world from all that is unfunky.    ToeJam and Earl: Mission to Earth is set up into several hub worlds that have multiple missions within them.  These missions typically consist of unlocking presents, delivering a present, and finding the exit elevator.  Stopping you will be everything from psycho cheerleaders to ninja rabbits.  Bizarre indeed.To access the different missions, you will need to find a specific number of keys as noted by the sign of the door you are trying to enter.  These keys are found in all the levels and hubs, and as you collect enough to open a door, the game will let you know you can now enter that door.  This keeps you from having to wander door to door, wondering if you have enough keys yet.  There are also searchlights that will help you locate these doors.Not every door will lead to a mission though.  There are different mini-games that you will run into every once in a while.  A couple of these mini-games include knocking a group of bunnies off of a cliff, and leaping buildings in a single bound using spring shoes.  These are typically timed events that will help you earn money, and sometimes karaoke microphones.  These microphones are used to open up battle stages, and also to open gates that lead to other hub worlds.  ToeJam and Earl: Mission to Earth makes the logical progression and adds a third playable character: Latisha.  All three character play relatively the same set of moves, with differences in the speed, jumping, etc...  The characters can jump using A, use funk-fu with X, shoot music with Y, and call up presents using the B button.  Funk-fu and shooting notes are not your only means of defense.  In some level you'll find a group of sparkling music notes.  Touching them will activate a simplified version of today's music games.  The game will play a short bar of music, and you must match the beat with the X and Y buttons.  Most of these are pretty standard beats but some are quite difficult because instead of playing a couple loops of the beat so you can learn it, the game will play it only once, not to mention the beat is irregular.  Add to that the fact that the actual music does not do a good job at emphasizing the beat, and you are left in a tough situation.  When you do pull it off though, all enemies in the surrounding area will take damage and become funkified.  Later on, you will find presents you can use to call up this attack manually rather than finding them strewn about a level.   Chris Carle checking himself out The camera system in ToeJam and Earl is definitely better than most games.  You can rotate and zoom the camera using the right analog stick.  Pressing the left trigger will switch to a first-person view, and the right trigger will swing the camera behind the camera.  If there is an object obstructing the view of the camera, the object will become transparent.  This is especially handy since some of the levels are densely populated, and are full of irregular shapes.  I think the first game to use this was Die Hard on the PS1, and I still wonder why more games don?t use a similar approach.  Luckily this game does.  A bad camera in this game would have really made things unplayable.   While we're on the subject of camera tricks, ToeJam and Earl takes a unique approach to multi-player mode.  Taken from its previous incarnations, both characters appear onscreen together while within range, but when the screen can no longer accommodate the distance between the two characters, the screen splits in two.  While a little disorienting at first, you learn to adjust quickly.  Playing with a friend is always more fun than playing alone, so call up your old Genesis buddies and take a trip down memory lane.    Also brought over from the original games is the idea of presents.  Throughout the levels you'll find present boxes containing a large assortment of items you can use at will.  You will need to first unlock a type of present before using it, but rarely do you find a present before it's unlocked.  The wide variety of presents is impressive.  Fly with Icarus wings, plant a balloon dummy of yourself to distract enemies, or throw on some spring shoes to hop from island to island.  Some presents also work against you, like the evil skates, and some presents are unidentified, and must be used hoping they are what you need.  If you're not willing to take the risk, they can be identified with an identify present, or by taking them to the wise man in the carrot suit.This wise man in the carrot suit is not there just to tell you what's in your box though.  As you funkify enemies and complete missions, you will receive points that work similar to experience points in an RPG.  After receiving a set number of points, talking to the wise man in the carrot suit will result in a higher funk-fu belt.  This will let you deal more damage, defeat enemies with higher funk-fu belts, and increase your health.  A simple system that is a little frustrating early on because many of the enemies you face will almost always have a higher funk-fu belt than you.  With your funk-fu being useless, the only way to funkify them to have the right present or by shooting them with music notes.  Again, this is frustrating because you often will not have enough music notes, nor the right presents.Another frustrating factor of the game is the number of cheap hits taken in the game.  Trying to escape/defeat all the enemies in the later levels can become a real chore unless you are fully stocked with just the right presents.  That is until the baby in the rolling chair comes and randomizes and unidentifies all your presents.  Then it's back to square one...    Like the previous Genesis game, the levels in ToeJam and Earl: Mission to Earth are randomly generated.  In theory, this sounds like a great idea.  You'll never have the same experience twice, always keeping the game new and fresh.  This approach does come with its own set of complications though.  First off, many of the levels feel like exactly that.  Random.  One of the limiting factors of having random levels is that you cannot plan the route the player will take, which in turn can result in a de-emphasis on solid level design.  You will find yourself just running around the level collecting the randomly placed items and heading for the exit.  Where is the skill?  The levels do become more difficult, but only because there are more enemies that take cheap hits.Another problem that may occur from the random placement of objects, is that the said object may be out of reach or in the way.  There were times when a character would be placed over an object and there was no way to access it, excluding starting your game over.  While not extremely common, this sort of thing should never happen.     GraphicsThe Good:  Super-sharp textures, colorful graphics, and the main characters look and animate amazingly well.  The game also moves at a solid framerate and pulls off some pleasing effects, including gratifying lighting effects, excellent reflections, and a great looking sky.  The Bad:  The most apparent flaw here is the limited draw distance.  You can definitely see what's immediately around you, but try looking over to another island and you'll see nothing but sky.  Because just about every level is has this island-based design, you can imagine the problems here.  There is a map screen you can use, but only the areas you can see are the places you've already been to.  It doesn't make the game unplayable by any means, it's just one more egg to throw in an already full basket.  The Ugly:  This game's visual style is a lot like eating liver.  You'll either love it or hate it.  I hate liver.  Unfortunately, ToeJam and Earl: Misson to Earth also fails to float my boat.  This game feels like it's trying to hard to come off as a hip, modern game.  What is does do, and well, is create visions of a nightmare freak circus gone haywire in my dreams at night.  The main culprit here is the character design, and it's repetition.  The models are entirely simplistic and the design dismal.  The enemy models have a very uninspired, patched together look that is almost an insult to the game's visual strengths.  The Anti-Funk, the one responsible for all that is unfunky in the world, looks like a cartoon drawn by a two year old.  Am I really supposed to feel threatened by a floating green skull with googly eyes?  The Verdict:Something about the quirkiness of the original game's visuals did not make the transition.  At times being to wacky, not crazy enough, excellent, or just plain bad, the scale never knows which way to tip.    Creed in the hizzouse! SoundFor a game that's all about the funk, there sure is a lot of hip-hop and gospel.  Either ToeJam, Earl, and Latisha are having an identity crisis or they are absolutely clueless when it comes to funk.  Whenever the characters speak, they rap.  When you start a mission, three gospel singers sing a quick intro to the level.  Am I missing something here?  The background music is about as funky as the sound gets.  The repetitive, accentuated bass lines hold a decent groove, but they still can't hold a candle to the likes of James Brown, Sly Stone, or Parliament.  This is one game that could've used licensed music in a new and exciting way, but instead we must endure the awful fusion of clashing musical genres.  The sound effects in the game get old, fast.  Whenever you are in close proximity of another character, friend or foe, they always spurt out a quick one-liner that can become very aggravating.  The fact that many of the enemies are repeated throughout a level only make matters worse.  Imagine hearing, ~My teddy bear says he can kick your ass!~ in an annoying child's voice, over and over again.  None of the lines are clever or even remotely funny.  Even hearing your own character talk (rap) will make you wish this game was based off a little game known as the quiet game, rather than putting an emphasis on the aural experience.  Actually, hearing ToeJam, Earl, and Latisha may be the worst part of it all.  Every instance of them rapping is a moment wasted.  What was intended to ~cool~ or ~hip~ has quickly transformed into something forgettable and nauseating.  Also, this game makes use of stereotypes to the point of obnoxiousness.  I can only imagine the ideas embedded in the next generation of minds as they play through this game.              OnlineDownloadable content is scheduled to be available at launch time of Xbox Live.  We know that there will be extra levels, presents, and possibly characters at the very least.  What would really be cool is to be able to download the original Genesis games.  I can't imagine that it would hard to do, and it would give first-time TJ&E players a chance to see the origins of the game.  Downloadable content will be available for at least the first couple of months, possibly longer if the feature proves popular.  Here's hoping for a new soundtrack.  This game can be best described as soporific.  There is too much repetition and not enough excitement.  The redundancy not only comes from the menial fetching and delivering tasks, but also from the repeated FMVs that are used as load screens, and constant repeated chatter of the characters.The worst part of ToeJam and Earl is that the whole game just feels wide and shallow, not long and deep.  There is little feeling of real progression, let alone climax, and the overall repetitive nature of the game becomes tedious and tiresome.      Fans of the original games may enjoy the feeling of nostalgia when playing Mission to Earth, but that feeling is sure to fade as you become desensitized to the classic appeal of the game, and realize your current state.", "date": "Oct 22, 2002"}
