This trend definitely continues with Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin, the follow-up to last year's incredibly fun and impressive Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow on the platform. Though the game loses a bit of impact for playing it a bit safer than what the team did with Dawn of Sorrow, Portrait of Ruin is right on the same quality level with 2005's DS release. This new design streamlines some concepts from Dawn of Sorrow while adding a few elements of its own, and while it plays it safe and sticks with last year's gameplay formula for much of the experience, Portrait of Ruin is easily up there with the best of the Castlevania best. And that's a really excellent place to be.   So as this story goes, Dracula's castle has appeared. Again. And it's up to one of the Belmont bloodline to enter the castle and take out the evil force. Again. That guy just can't seem to stay down, no matter how much effort it took in previous adventures. Portrait of Ruin's story helmer is Jonathon Morris, who has found himself with the Belmont whip but without the skills to truly put it to use. He has a tag-along friend, Charlotte, who has the taste for the magics, and it's through the dialogue of the two, as well as the inhabitants of the castle, how the plotline of a new evil force is utilizing the power of Dracula's abode for his own motives. This new being has brought life to paintings scattered throughout the castle, and these portraits send the Castlevania design way outside the confines of the huge fortress.   Even though designers took creative license for locales within Dracula's castle in past Castlevania games, Portrait of Ruin's ~painting~ levels gives the designers a far looser leash in which to create their spooky atmosphere. The levels range from a psycho circus to a haunted pyramid in the Sahara, with each location being as beefy as a castle sector within Dawn of Sorrow. And when you recognize that these four wildly creepy locations are tied together by a fifth map -- Dracula's castle -- you'll realize that the game's significantly larger in size and length than any past 2D Castlevania to date.   The Jonathon/Charlotte buddy system is essentially Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin's other hook. Players have the ability to swap control between Jonathon and Charlotte and utilize each others' strengths as they quest through the castle, and they can even have the unused person fight along side the controlled character for added strength. Jonathon's more the brute force weapon user while Charlotte flexes more magical muscle to get the job done. Both characters essentially control the same, so when you do earn abilities like a sliding attack to fit through gaps or a double jump to reach the higher ledges, the ability's applied to both characters, and neither really out does the other when it comes to standard exploration skills -- it's mostly about the combat.   The dual character mechanic also comes into play in Castlevania's puzzle designs, but honestly it's hard to argue that these puzzles are incredibly underused in Portrait of Ruin's production. There are the occasional ~one character stand here while the other does something else~ challenges: pressure switches that need both standing on it to trigger, or pillars that need to be shoved by one while the other stands on the higher ground. The amount of times the two characters will need to partner together can be counted on two hands, and for a game with maps as huge as Portrait of Ruin it's hard not to be let down by the lack of them. It's very much like when in Dawn of Sorrow the only good touch screen gameplay element -- the shatter ice bricks to make platforms puzzle -- was only used once in the entire castle. There's so much room for level design potential in Portrait of Ruin and its two-character game mechanic, and it never really reaches where it really should be.      In fact, most of the game can be played without the need for the character swapping. There are the occasional points where having a second character assisting with the usual enemy slaughtering is helpful, even if the computer controlled partner sort of strays away from the game's more familiar ~lone hero against Dracula~ concept. Jonathon is the one with the whip and can wield some of the kick-ass weaponry found in the game. On the flipside, Charlotte can pull off the cool, awesome special attacks. Essentially what one character could do in the previous game has been spread out to two playable, swappable characters.     Portrait of Ruin's strongest addition in the single player experience is its sub-quest design. Players will encounter a lost spirit by the name of Wind, who will dish out tasks that players can choose or refuse to partake. Most tasks are pretty straightforward, like performing a move three times, or showing up wearing specific items. But some are actually demanding and require a little thought -- one requires you to punch butcher meat somewhere in the game, or find a hidden item in a pile of rubble elsewhere. Some aren't spelled out as well as they could, and require far too much of the player: in one, you have to ~collect five cards.~ Only one character in the game drops a card if they're killed, and it happens at random intervals based on your character's attributes. Unfortunately, the game requires five different cards, not of the same suit, so it's a lot harder of a task than what's spelled out.   Because Portrait of Ruin builds off of the established Dawn of Sorrow engine for its design, the sequel looks and sounds at least as good as the original DS product. In many cases it looks even better, as the developers push a bit more supplemental 3D and more detailed 2D animations for the backgrounds and character sprites. There is some enemy recycling going on, so you'll recognize some creatures or items from last year's game show up in this adventure. Even with some Dawn of Sorrow familiarity the game has plenty of surprises in the form of some whacked out enemy designs and boss creature creations that you'd never expect to see. And the soundtrack, while not as memorable as some Castlevania classic compositions, definitely gets the necessary focus with upbeat and creepy tunes accompanying the action. There's even a significant amount of voice work, though it's relegated to simple sound bites from specific characters -- the story's still told through text cutscenes. Maybe with the next game we'll get full spoken dialogue.      This sequel does have a focus on multiplayer just as Dawn of Sorrow did, though the potential is sort of watered down. Here we have a game that's an adventure focusing on two characters working together towards a single goal, and yet the designers didn't stick in the ability to have the secondary character controlled by another player on another DS during this adventure. It's a definite missed opportunity, but what is here is pretty solid and fun, even if it's just supplementary to the main quest. The two player cooperative mode that did make it in is essentially the Boss Rush design that was in Dawn of Sorrow. But, more significantly, this mode takes the Castlevania series online for the first time in, like, ever, and players from either US or Japan territories can play each other using the random match-ups or Friend Code system established by Nintendo. It works like a champ.Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin both streamlines and segments the Dawn of Sorrow production. The sequel's look and feel is pretty much straight-on what was in last year's game, just with a new story and direction. The silly, gimmicky touch screen elements are out, but the awesome ~always on~ map on the upper screen is still in the game. A lot of the gameplay mechanics remain, though they've been spread across two characters instead of one solitary hero. This two-character idea is a neat new way of presenting the Castlevania experience, but it's not explored as deeply as it should, only teasing mechanics once or twice before forgetting about them completely.Even though the sequel's doesn't offer as strong an original design as the initial DS game, it's still immensely fun with a lot of legs thanks to multiple endings, additional unlockable characters, and a focus on multiplayer that, while not as awesome as it could have been, is a really solid secondary mode. Overall, Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin doesn't hit the system with the same impact as Dawn of Sorrow, but it's still one of the great Castlevania experiences.", "date": "Dec 6, 2006"}
