Gameplay  When Acclaim locked down the South Park license and started brainstorming concepts, the dimmest light bulb to ever to hover above a man's head struck with a cartoon flicker, sputter, hum, and dull spark: Let's make a mascot kart title! Genius!  Oh, it doesn't play well? What do you mean? Why, there are 30 characters! And over six tracks! (That's right, seven tracks.) Just look at the massive weapon arsenal -- there's exploding diarrhea, barf, talking poo, anal probes, horny pupies, roadkill rodents, underwear burglars, irritating dictators, pinkeye, STD-raging whores, and farting canooks! DUDE! THIS GAME GOT'S EVERYTHING!!!  No. South Park Rally has ~got's~ nothing at all. Acclaim's latest South Park licensed game sucks, just like the last one, and the one before that, and probably the ones still to come too. Acclaim has even taken all of the fun out of the game for me, a reviewer, as they've given me very little to single out as pathetic -- there's nothing especially laughable about the game, it's just so mediocre on all levels that nothing ever comes together.   Developer Tantalus (who aren't even credited on the box -- that's harsh!) did try to implement some different, if not original or intelligent, ideas. In a lackadaisical effort to reinvent the wheel, the tracks are open courses rather than single-direction courses with shortcuts. That did three things for the game: one, it made the design more open, as the checkpoints can be randomly moved; second, it made the courses more practical for a budget game company on an unattainable schedule, so Tantalus was able to use the same tracks for different event contests rather than just racing (and it also bailed them out of having to design separate battle tracks); and third, it made the game impossible to play. Tracks are so huge, so pointlessly arraigned, and so utterly confusing that you'll have to practice a track several times while following the computer opponent just to know what the hell to do (and the game doesn't encourage practice, as AI cars can't be turned off, and you can't finish your race once one opponent has captured the win). Of course, there is an inset map to try to help you find your way, but multi-layered courses defeat its purpose, and even if you do rely upon it, gamers are still bound to feel lost in the haphazardly designed courses. The first course -- a race set in a town with streets that lead nowhere and a ludicrous architecture that always leads you in the wrong direction with every turn -- is the single worst track I have ever seen in a racer. Later tracks get better, but none have any sense of logic or reason to the design.  Also innovative and yet thoroughly botched in this game is the addition of objectives in the place of standard flag-to-flag racing. While some of the events (capture the flag-type games, frag tag-type events, seek and deliver races) are good ideas, the execution is messed up by lack of insight on the designer's part. There is no strategy. When you need to hide from opponents with the flag, the size of the tracks makes you a hot dog in a hallway; when you're hunting opponents, same problem. The vicious, mechanical computer AI is always set to kill, so in frag tag (called Valentine's Day) you can't get far enough away to pick them off. Even if you try to play camper in a capture the flag event and snipe the leader just before he crosses the finish line, the pack will be always right behind him to snag the prize. Imagine a football game where the focus isn't on passing or running but rather on coming up with fumbled balls on the line of scrimmage.   The only smart element of the design is in the weaponry, which is made up of numerous popular tokens and cameos from the TV show. Nothing's new here -- Barf makes you slip like a Oil in Diddy Kong Racing, Mr. Hankey makes you invincible just like the Tiki God in Crash Team Racing, Water Balloons detonate like Mortars in Twisted Metal, Terrance & Phillip makes you fart turbo like the Dash in Chocobo Racer (did I just say that?), and Pinkeye works like Lightening in Mario Kart. Also included are two view-obscuring items, one with Sadam Hussein taking over your screen, the other a slut hooker who leaves her herpes all over your windshield if you hit her. Yet even if you credit the game for its massive arsenal, it's not hard to realize that the vast majority of the weapons are similar (missile, boost, or bomb) with only a graphic and audio difference.  That slight bit of ingenuity is contrasted against terrible tracks, 1980's AI, and baffling gameplay. The strategy of the entire game is exactly like playing a game of Pac-Man -- learn the simple AI path routines, run the courses exactly according to those lines (always a step ahead of your foe or you're dead), and snack on a couple foes once you've become invincible. Certainly you can't rely on the power of the car or driver you've chosen to lead you to victory, since all the cars and vehicles are essentially the same (some drive a little floatier or heavier, or so I am led to believe, but nothing about your choice ever matters -- just choose the one who curses the most). And if you don't find enough to fault in the flawed design, race the game a little bit and you'll find all kinds of poor track features that trap you for a while, and even an assortment of bugs -- twice I ran into a flat wall and found myself (and the game) completely locked up.  Graphics Boxy, chunky, blocky, simple, flat. All words to describe the show and the game South Park. We'll give the developer's a break here in that South Park doesn't exactly lend itself too well to gorgeous graphics. It's a simple show with simple effects and cheesy design. True, the special effects here are just sad (especially Big Gay Al's Disco Room, with a two-step moving texture), but they are true to the show. Every character ever on the show (except Craig and perhaps one or two other third-season additions) is in the game. From Scuzzlebutt to Jesus Christ to the hot-flashing hoe Ms. Cartman, the gang's all here. Many characters even have secondary outfits (Cartman as a cop on a big wheel, Chef as the Braveheart turkey hunter). To be fair even, environments are fairly complex, and the draw-in isn't noticeable often.   My only question is why all this simplicity can't run at a good frame rate. The game is choppy, and while it doesn't bog down in two player (no four player?!?), it never looks very clean. Also, the game just isn't attractive to the eye. While the design team has emulated the show fairly well, nothing is very appealing (except maybe on the final track on the edge of hell, which finally has some color). Colors are, like Chef's Love Shack, gaudy and grating sometimes, dreary and sparse other times. While the graphics are faithful to the show in theory, there is none of that spirit or simplistic joy that you get from watching South Park.  Sound If there was any one category to focus in on for a design team on a South Park game, it would be this one.  Lots of sounds are traveling all over the place, and they're fairly funny samples. Ones that made me chuckle were the whore (who solicits as she seeks), the underpants gnomes (who sing their song as they travel), and the anal probe (which turns opponents into Broadway singers with cupie-doll faces). Quite a feat to get all of those samples, as well as the voices of all the characters on the course, into the PlayStation's memory. However, sound samples are so miserably recorded that one can easily see how they shoehorned these samples in. These tracks are so low quality that often you can't understand characters' voices.  And one last gripe, one that shows just how completely, inexplicably, and even bedazzlingly bad and rushed the programming on this game is: you can hardly hear any of it. The game has no volume. The TV must be turned way up to get any volume out of the soundtrack. Sure, there's a music and SFX volume adjustment, but even maxed out the sounds hardly raise above the noise level of the hissing of the peaked speakers. Turn the channel after giving up on the game, and you'll likely get blasted out of the room. It's a strange phenomenon in gaming, a failure I can't remember seeing in quite a while. That's what you get with rushed programming on a carelessly designed and conceived project.It's selling like hotcakes, folks, and there's nothing you or I or any amount of word of mouth or act of god can do about it. Sure, we can tell a friend that we've heard its bad, but that will just get them thinking, ~How bad?~, and inevitably they'll rent it. It's not nearly as terrible as Chef's Love Shack, but it's boring beyond belief. I even wanted to be nice to this game, to give Acclaim credit for taking the game out of the busy Christmas season and letting the product fend for itself in a less frenzied market. And yet even that was ridiculous. It's mind-boggling to me to even think that this game was delayed, presumably for quality assurance -- I picture that decision coming after an executive at Acclaim came to their QA office just before leaving on his Christmas break, noticed the current burn of the game, and asked, ~Say Dick, why aren't you turning at all?~ Oh, the steering function hasn't been added yet. And so he calls Tantalus and says that they're slipping the project two weeks so that they can implement that feature... ~Oh, and add some more barf sounds while you've got all that extra time.~I'm dead serious. Everything about the actual gameplay seems an afterthought. Tantalus spent way too much time capturing every little nuance of South Park (and, admittedly, that was time well spent), but that left them with no time to actually make a game. The ideas, characters, and details are all there, but so many corners were cut that what they've ended up with is a donut, a big fat zero in every respect.", "date": "Jan 7, 2000"}
