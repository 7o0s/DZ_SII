I can remember just a few short years ago when finding an abundance of wrestling games on the system of your choice was as likely as finding muscle in Tony Schiavone's abdomen. However, in this age of the ever-expanding popularity of professional wrestling, it's damn near impossible to look on the shelves of your local retailer and NOT find the corresponding software. WCW, WWF, and even the hardcore boys from ECW all have their own brand of digital mat justice. While the quality and entertainment value of those products range anywhere from stellar to downright awful, there's definitely enough room left for another contender to lace up their boots and join the party. That contender of course, is Giant Gram.  The sequel to the excellent Sega Saturn grappler All Japan Pro Wrestling, Giant Gram was actually the first game of it's kind available for the Dreamcast. Released in the early part of 1999, Giant Gram superceded the current wave of glitz-over-substance wrestlers. While it may not have the big names or elaborate production values associated with domestic offerings, it has enough of the right touches in the right spots to make it one of the best of its kind from the last decade. WWF and WCW marks beware.  ~Blasphemy!~ They shout from the rafters! ~There is no way in hell some game I never heard of can compare to Vince and Uncle Eric's silicon masterpieces! I mean come on, what's a Giant Gram supposed to be anyway?~ Well ladies and gentlemen, I hate to be the one to disappoint you, but not only does Giant Gram compare to most of your favorite games quite easily, it also kicks most of their asses... and then some.  Featuring 12 of All-Japan's finest ring kings, 3 Virtua Fighter characters and 4 hidden gladiators, Giant Gram's wrestler selection is more than healthy. While some may denounce that number as too small when compared to the mini-crowd of 50+ fighters found in stateside releases, I didn't find GG's collection puny in the least. With a range of such legends as the late Shohei ~Giant~ Baba and Hiroshi Hase to traveling tough guys Vader and Stan ~The Lariat~ Hansen, finding a wrestler just for you shouldn't be too much of a problem. The only real quarrel I had with Giant Gram's rogues gallery would have to be in the area of character balance. While it doesn't matter much in multi-player games, the bigger and more powerful wrestlers all but dominate a match in CPU battle. Not as major an issue as you'd think however, as the intelligent AI brain will probably hand you your leg tops anyway.  That's right, even on the easiest of settings surviving a match is an accomplishment in and of itself. Every wrestler sports a bevy of suplexes, slams, and submission maneuvers that pummel your body into hamburger. Using a play style similar to Virtua Fighter (this is from the same development team after all) the fighting system is both overly simplistic yet surprisingly deep. Using only three buttons and the base commands of Strike, Throw, and Grapple, your position and timing of the attack you choose can all lead to a different form of punishment. Tests of strength, diving assaults, and apron hits can be pulled off with ease once you know your stuff. Eventually, counter attacks and reversals will overcome your matches and the ring will turn into the stage for a series of spectacular ballets of war. Bottom line: if you've seen a move on those Pro Wrestling Illustrated import tapes, chances are you'll see it here too.  Now as fans of any sporting event can tell you, the audience can pump an athlete up and give them that little something extra to overcome adversity. That said, it's good to know that the momentum system is handled the way should be: with the crowd. Every time you kick out of a pin, put on a display of dazzling combinations, or taunt your opponent like a school girl the fans get more and more behind you. Booming simultaneous cheering, loud harmonious chanting, and fits of uproarious applause slowly builds your wrestlers spirit meter. Catching fire as it grows, your health bar eventually becomes a red-hot inferno unlocking some of the more obscure and devastating moves, and of course your bone crunching finisher. After every match, the screen informs you of how many admirers you have gathered both in the bout and overall. Serving as a score of sorts, the higher the number of followers you have, the more likely the chance of facing a secret character is. Beat him in the ring and you have yourself a new combatant added to the arsenal.  Finding something to do with that new wrestler of yours is easy.  Giant Gram provides a nice dose of play modes and options to choose from. Arcade, Tournament, Versus, Training, and Watch modes are all yours for the taking. Even better is one of the most extensive Edit Wrestler options this side of The Peoples Eyebrow (more on that soon). Keep in mind however, that if you enjoy the hardcore aspects of American wrestling you had better look elsewhere. The more traditionalized mat grappling is what is appreciated in All-Japan (where matches are usually about honor and victory, not cheating and chair shots), so finding cage matches and weapons bouts are out of the question.  That's not to say that what Giant Gram offers isn't entertaining. Arcade and Versus modes are a great way of passing the time away. If you're like me though, you'll spend most of your time in the Tournament. Beating your opponents senseless and trying to unlock those hidden characters is what shines through here. As you run the gauntlet of 15 consecutive opponents, this mode is where you'll find the most action, variety, and most importantly, replay value.  Which then brings us to that Edit mode I mentioned earlier. In an approach rarely seen in games of the genre, your wrestler must ~pay his dues~. Yes, once you have chosen your warriors name, appearance, and fighting style it's off to the gym to train. Going head to head against the legends of the sport is the only way for your creation to learn the moves he needs to win. Getting thrown from pillar to post is actually more helpful than mauling your foe for a fast victory. How else do you expect to learn something new if it isn't performed on you? Definitely one of my favorite features.  Any review of Giant Gram cannot be complete without mention of the excellent graphics, especially the face mapping. True-to-life representations of each wrestler is far and above the flat, dice-faced look of games such as WWF Attitude. Body frames, skin types, and wardrobe all mirror their real-world counterparts perfectly and give off one of the most realistic impressions of a wrestling game that you'll find. Even the stadium looks to be lifted straight from the architects blue prints, complete with individual spot lights and guard rails. The only flaw here would be the cardboard people that like to hang out in the crowds and outside the ring. Apparently lifted from Um Jammer Lammy's more serious side, the non-wrestlers in the game are uninspired.  Also of mention is the beautiful audio. Audience noise, ringing bells, mat thuds, you name it... the sounds are replicated perfectly. The announcers and commentators are what really take the cake however. Basically a Japanese Michael Buffer, the mic-man introduces each wrestler as though he was the king of the world. The commentators key in at all the right times, and thankfully have plenty to say (keeping them from suffering from the repetition found in just about every sports game ever made). Even the music (while on the slim side) is an accurate synthesis of the characters real-life theme song. Good stuff.  There's more that could be said about the excellence that is Giant Gram. From the vast intricacies found in the reversal system to the unadulterated fun that can be found in the exclusive VMU mini-games, it's all here. Few graphical glitches aside, this is a superb way to spend your import dollar. I'd take this over WWF Attitude or WCW Mayhem any day of the week, and so should you.  -- Jeremy Dunham, IGNDC", "date": "Aug 11, 2000"}
