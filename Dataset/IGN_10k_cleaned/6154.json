{"name": "Frank Thomas: Big Hurt Baseball", "name_review": "Frank Thomas", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/26/frank-thomas", "text": "There's no denying Frank Thomas ~Big Hurt~ Baseball is a good game, even if the title is really long. It's just not great. There are a few flaws that, although seemingly minor, conspire to keep ~Big Hurt~ from being truly amazing.  The first major flaw is in the batter's timing. It takes a fraction of a second for the batter to actually swing after you've pushed the button. This means you have to swing as the pitcher is throwing the ball, or else you'll keep striking out. And if you're playing against a human who actually changes up his pitches, forget it. The other major problem with the title is its slow pace. Copious load times and lengthy announcements bring ~Big Hurt~ practically to a stand still at times.  The statistical interface is something of a bitch to work with. Even though the game has all the stats, a full player's license, all the stadiums, an announcer, and a season mode, it just isn't as easy to work with as, say, Triple Play. Also, there are only two kinds of batters, which limits the excitement.  The graphics, on the other hand, are great. The batters are possibly the best of all the baseball games available. Great graphics aren't enough to save ~Big Hurt~ Baseball though. In the end it just doesn't have that winning combination.   Jason Boor", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
