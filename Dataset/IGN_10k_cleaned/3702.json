Not only did the initial screens look brilliant, but the ideas driving the creation of the game were solid and hinted at the bright future for online experiences. Years later, after many changes both to the gameplay and graphics, PlanetSide was released to store shelves offering one of the first pure first-person shooter experiences in a persistent world setting. Unfortunately, the game just doesn't live up to its potential due to the lack of solid victory conditions or interesting goals, the absolute need for a good squad to really have fun, an overly large gameplay world devoid of any real personality, and some performance issues. It's really too bad because there are still a lot of good ideas here and when you do manage to find a good and organized squad, PlanetSide can be a pretty interesting and enjoyable experience; it just doesn't happen too often.   Auraxis at a glance  The background for Sony Online's first MMOFPS has all the makings of an interesting game. After years of exploring space around Earth, humans discovered a worm hole leading to a system somewhere in space. No one can really pinpoint where it is, but the discovery of a habitable world on the other side was an opportunity that the Terran Empire was not willing to pass up. Unfortunately for the sorry saps that were living on this new planet Auraxis, the wormhole collapsed, leaving them stranded with no way to get home or even any real way to find out where home really is. But as humans will do, they adapted, creating a new life on Auraxis.   Upon the planet, alien technology was also found, leading many to believe that research and implementation the knowledge was the true new path for humanity. After the Terran Empire decided that this technology was best left alone, these scientists and some like-minded people from the Terran Empire military splintered off to form their own ~political~ society. They called themselves the Vanu Sovereignty after the Vanu alien technology. On another part of the planet, those unhappy with the Terran Empire and their militaristic ways were breaking off into a new faction known as the New Conglomerate. Having lived for centuries as the rulers of all by way of a heavy iron fist, the Terran Empire was not happy with these two groups deciding to take their destinies in their own hands. So of course, war erupted between all three sides and now they vie for control of planet Auraxis.   Players of the game are called upon to pick one of the sides of the struggle and go into battle for the planet.   The problems with Auraxis  But as far as I can tell, there really isn't much to fight over here. Across seven continents there are no cities. Across the seven huge continents, there are actually no signs of any Vanu archeological finds. In fact, I can't say there are really any landmarks at all across the planet. No Grand Canyons, no Pyramids, no Eifel Towers, no Victoria Falls... nothing to keep players interested or grounded into the fact that this is an interesting planet where people live. The only thing I saw that even vaguely resembled a landmark was some weird rock outcropping that I actually did think was a crashed space ship of some sort at first... oh well.    This isn't to say that the continents are all the same. But the differences from one continent to the next seems to be terrain, weather, and fauna... which in the grand scheme of things can only hold your interest for so long. You'll find all the typical environments here. Snow bound areas, expanses of desert, rolling green hills and thick forests, mountains both small and tall all dot the landscape, although mostly each of these environments are confined to one continent a piece. Keeping things a little more interesting is the weather system, which can make it rain, kick up a blizzard, or even throw a sandstorm in your face.   But when it comes back to it, the lack of personality in the landscape makes me sad. I feel no real compulsion to fight over this boring planet. And I really feel no need to run across the damn thing. The continents on Auraxis are huge. The large ones will take you a long, long time to run across with nothing in between your starting point and your destination but the same terrain and the sound of your footsteps. There is no life on Auraxis outside of the foliage. There's no fauna anywhere to be found. No indigenous life to deal with or AI controlled mobs making this seem like an actual planet. The result is a static environment that I became bored with rather quickly.    The continents on the planet are also gigantic. Unless you have a vehicle certification from the get-go, which is possible at the beginning (as long as you're willing to forgo any real armor or weapons), you're going to be stuck running around, and that can take a long damn time as foot speed is rather slow. There are alternate means of transportation, but even these have their drawbacks. The HART shuttle, which takes off into space, will allow you to drop down anywhere on the planet. The only problem is you sometimes have to wait a full 10 minutes for the thing and then add the loading time on top for switching continents. There's also Galaxy class transport ships, which most squads tend to use, but you still have to use the network of warp gates in-between continents so your destination could take a long time anyway even if it's faster than walking. Finally, you have the instant action option, which in theory is a great idea as long as you're willing to play by yourself (more on that in a sec), but when I used it, half the time I transported to an area far away from any combat involving my faction. And if you don't have a hacking certification to steal a vehicle from one of these bases, you're in for a long walk again, or will have to try the instant action again until the game gets it right. If you have a slower machine, the load times will not make this something you want to do.   Growing through combat  PlanetSide's RPG system is definitely not as complex as something you'd see in EverQuest or most other RPGs. And the weird thing is that not only does it add some interest for some players, it also is going to detract from the fun for other gamers that are used to pure action titles.   Players gain experience through field duty. Any time a player makes a kill, experience will be the reward. The big goal is to get experience for base captures, because that's where the big hauls come in. Once players gain a certain amount of experience, their level will go up, which grants them certification points. These certification points are what are used to gain new skills such as proficiency with a new class of weapons or vehicles, or the ability to hack or repair armor, and the ability to wear different types of armor. These certifications can be unlearned and new ones learned, but it will take a full 24 hours real time before this can happen again.   What this system does is force players to focus on getting better at certain skills. So experienced medics, MAX armor, engineer, hackers, and whatever else will be running around. Unfortunately, it also tends to pigeonhole players into doing one type of thing until they get into higher levels so that they can afford different certifications.   Thankfully for the early players, there is ample opportunity to try out the different pieces of equipment available to each side. The training facility provides both a shooting range and a vehicle testing area so the right decision can be made. What it doesn't provide is the actual experience of using the gear out in open combat, which can be an eye opener. Those that though their MAX armor was good because it was so big and strong are quickly taught that the maneuverability is so low that you can die nearly as easily as everyone else. And those wearing infiltration suits suddenly realize that having no armor rating in favor of the cloaking really does make a difference.   Three factions, one planet  Each of the three sides to this battle have their different ideals and specialty of combat. Terrans like to shoot as many bullets as possible at enemies as quickly as possible. The New Conglomerate prefers to go the way of power with weapons that outstrap the competition on pure punch. And the Vanu take their cue from the alien technology with quicker movement and energy weapons as well as hovercraft for their ground vehicles.   But surprisingly, these sides aren't really much different from each other. They all have the same classes of armor, they all serve the same purpose, but aside from that, they're pretty close to the same. Most of the weapons each side uses are still the same. Just capabilities of the MAX armor and a couple of other weapons really make the difference. I've found that it doesn't really matter what I'm going up against because they'll still bring the same basic equipment.    Even the bases that you fight over in the game look the same everywhere you go. It seems to me that these three factions would have some sort of different design aesthetic at least. What about those buildings we saw in earlier screenshots? Where did those go?    There is no I in teamwork  Combat by itself can be a pretty crazy thing. Battles can be small and fairly manageable, or can be incredibly large and almost completely chaotic. The only thing preventing the game from being a complete mess of gun fire and screaming bodies is the organization of squads, which is PlanetSide's version of grouping. As with most other MMOs, when you group with other players, you'll be able to see their vitals and name in the top portion of the screen. You'll also see their corresponding number on the mini-map if they're in the direct area or the big map if they're anywhere on the world of Auraxis.   This makes managing your team easier, but it doesn't mean they'll listen to you. I prefer not to be in charge because I like the experience of being just another grunt. But when you have leaders that are unwilling to actually give orders or make decisions and just want you to sit around waiting for a base capture (more on that in a minute) so he or she can get command experience points (they open up new command options) or you get a group that just doesn't listen, the game bogs down into some serious frustration. PlanetSide is not a game that is meant to be played by yourself even though you can solo.    Teamwork is key to survival and success. Having a well balanced team of grunts, engineers, medics, hackers, and pilots is a major point in the game. But these teammates also have to cover your back and cooperate or they become largely useless. Half the time you'll be sitting around waiting for your team to get together for transportation to a new front of the battle with a couple of guys refusing to come back because there's ~only 7 more minutes left on the base hack~. Who wants to wait for that. I play action games for the action. Not the waiting.   But when you do manage to find a squad that kicks ass, the game can be really fun for a while. When your Galaxy transport ship pilot flys over a base, your commander yells go, and you see all of your squad dropping from the ship onto the base together, form up, and then infiltrate quickly... well now that's exciting. And in that way, PlanetSide provides the kind of first-person shooter experience that you just aren't going to find anywhere else. It can be exciting, organized, and fun as hell for that 10 minutes that the squad is fighting towards the control center in the base. It's just sad that these teams seem hard to come by.   There is no future  While the game has some really great teamwork and combat elements to it, there is a major problem here that I just can't get around. There is no point to this game. Most action titles have some sort of victory condition. That's what makes the action fun and immediate. If you don't do this and perform skillfully, you are going to lose. In PlanetSide, if a base is lost, whatever, you can just get it back later. There are no overall victory conditions. It's a war without purpose or need.   Combat centers around bases scattered throughout the seven continents of Auraxis. Inside each of these bases is a control terminal that players with a hacking certification have to hack into. Once the base has been hacked, 15 minutes have to pass before the base will actually convert to the faction that has hacked it. The fun is getting inside and completing that mission. But once that's done with, players tend to move on, leaving the base largely undefended. Each of these bases has some sort of bonus attached to it. Some give players the ability to buy Galaxy ships for transport inside the continent, while others will make base spheres of influence larger and give shields to wall turrets. These are hardly noticeable though. And even if they were so that players wanted to go after a certain type of base first, there's a certain order that things must be followed.   This is all due to the fact that these bases are linked on a web. You can only capture a base that is in the next link of the web to one that you already own. Any strategy of trying to take a base that will shut down the shield on those turrets is moot if you don't have a base of your own next to it in the first place. So most players will pretty much mindlessly go after the next closest base in the chain, simply because they don't want to travel very far, or don't care about the small helping effects each give.   If there had been some type of conditions where the bases you capture really meant something big, then chances are people would care more. The fact that there are just so many bases on each continent doesn't help either. If you lose one, who cares, you still have more, and can start getting the ones you lost back later.   There's no real context for the story once you get beyond the manual either. The Vanu don't have any alien artifacts to fight to control just as the New Conglomerate and Terran Republic don't have any artifact to try and take or destroy. If the New Conglomerate had some cities that they needed to defend that would be cool as well. I would have loved to see city battles that raged like a game of Battlefield where after all of the points had been captured, the city changes sides and a force field goes up. Anybody that wants to take it would have to knock down the field and then take the city back themselves. Add in some serious bonuses and you've got your fun. And while I understand that Sony would like to keep the game from being unbalanced and persistent, I really, really wish there was some kind of victory condition where the game would be won and then start over.     After playing quite a few hours, I'm just uninterested about what happens next. I leave the game when my side has three continents almost locked up and then come back two hours later to see that all three are gone and one of them is someone else's completely. It's a frustrating, hopeless, and altogether meaningless struggle. Your faction's ideals and goals for the future are forgotten.   The only times your really feel like you've accomplished anything is when you manage to take a base with a small amount of people. Otherwise, it's just a mass of attackers, hacking into a base and then sitting around for 15 minutes waiting for the base to convert. And then everybody promptly moves on to the next base for more experience.   To their credit, the PlanetSide team is still dedicated to updating the game with new content and fun things. Like their first big content update which includes a new bomber and anti-aircraft vehicle. If they keep adding to each faction and the world, hopefully things will get better.   Twitchy twitch  Perhaps the other biggest problem up until now has been the performance of the game. If you read my first impressions of PlanetSide, you probably noticed that I had been having a lot of problems with the game. Not only was there significant lag to be had pretty much everywhere, my computer was on the verge of self-destructing from the effort of running the game while the game was at its lowest settings.    As it stands, don't play this game if you don't have at least 512 MB of RAM. If you play on a low-end machine like a 1.1Ghz, 256MB RAM, GeForce4, then you're going to have difficulty playing. You'll die while you're chopping. You'll die while you're lagging. And then you'll want to shoot yourself for wasting your money on the game. After moving it to a similar machine with more memory (1.4Ghz, 512MB RAM, GeForce3) it ran much better and I was able to push the graphics up to medium quality. Of course, playing on the 3.0Ghz with a gig of RAM and a GeForceFX 5900, it ran pretty much flawlessly on high detail, except for the lag, which is not the machine's problem. But even now, the team has dealt with a lot of the lag issues and I've experienced much less lag than I had originally. If they keep that up, players should continue to see a much smoother game over the next few weeks.   If you do have that high-end machine, the visuals are pretty decent for an online memory hog, but don't think that it'll look like those original ~screens~ Sony Online sent out, because it doesn't even at its best.I had a lot of hope for PlanetSide. When I saw it down in San Diego a few months back, I even had hope because it hadn't even entered beta. But sadly the final product just couldn't hold in and conquer all of the great ideas that are the foundation of the product.What can be a really exciting team game experience is marred by having to play with uncooperative idiots, monotonous landscapes, long wait times to get into the action, and some serious lack of definitive purpose. Not having a greater goal to strive towards means hollow victories and eventual lack of interest. I know Sony is used to implementing changes slowly over the course of a game like EverQuest, but in an immediate and frenetic game like PlanetSide, losing a twitch gamer's attention for even a second is one of the worst mistakes you can make.I can't imagine that I'll be loading it up anymore now that I'm done with the review as I do with Battlefield 1942 or even Wolfenstein.", "date": "Jun 6, 2003"}
