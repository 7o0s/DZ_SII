Well, other than her devilish ability to control an assortment of traps that you'll use to decapitate, de-limb and generally demolish your foes.   After the mysterious death of her father, King Olaf, Princess Allura is accused of his murder and runs off to a nearby mansion with her handmaiden Rachel. Countless guards, knights, magicians, archers, farmers and all sorts of other random peons wonder into the mansion where Princess Allura is basically forced to kill them. Oh, and something called the Fiend has marked her and given her the ability to control various traps in the mansion along with an assortment of her own traps in order to do away with the unknowing idiots.    The game mostly revolves around bits of strategy and timing. You'll need to set up your own traps and try and lure your enemies into said traps in order to kill them as you have no direct-attack weapons of your own. You're allowed to essentially pause the game and place one of each trap type - floor, ceiling and wall - at a time. The strategy in this is how you set up your traps according to the room's layout. The timing element has to do with waiting for exactly the right moment to spring the traps, which can be somewhat frustrating later in the game, which we'll get to in a bit.   The traps are obviously the focus and coolest parts of the game. The traps that you have at your disposal are mostly made up of moving walls (with or without spikes), catapulting floor pieces, arrow slits for walls, giant iron or steel balls you can drop on foes (with or without fire) and more. As you progress through the game and purchase more of these traps, you'll have access to some more brutal stuff, like giant saw blades and such.   Your personal traps are cool, but they get a bit repetitive after a bit. Most of the traps are variations of the basic starting ideas, so while you'll start out with a giant ball, you can later buy a giant ball with flames. Not the most inventive or interesting stuff here, but it gets the job done. You can chain these traps together, but this is mostly reliant on simply setting up the traps so that they trigger in succession, rather than some complicated Mouse Trap-esque contraption.   We'd certainly liked to have seen more variation in your personal traps, or especially the ability to chain these traps together in a more complicated manner, but what's there works.   The best traps in the game are those that are environment-centric. Each area of the mansion, and then other locations later in the game, feature a slew of items and such that you can trigger, knock enemies into or what have you that both causes a lot more damage than your own traps and look a hell of a lot cooler as well.   For example, one room features a cannon sitting next to a staircase. If you set it up correctly and then manage to knock an enemy in there, it'll shoot him or her into the roof before they slink off like a pancake and fall two or three stories through a pane-glass window to their final demise. Move the cannon into another spot and it'll launch enemies into a furnace where they'll be nicely toasted.    Making proper use of the environmental traps is the most rewarding part of the game partly because they look the coolest, but also because they're something of a puzzle that you need to figure out. Some traps require that you trigger them before they can be set off, some require that you get an enemy into just the right spot (which a Bear Trap will help with) and others are simply cool if you manage to string them together and completely decimate someone.   With the game relying on this concept quite a bit, it turns out to be good fun overall. Beating the crap out of people is always rewarding in some way, and Trapt provides you with multiple options to do so.   The game would be more fun were it more complicated, though. As mentioned, most of the traps are pretty basic and the AI generally just runs straight at you. Sure, they'll avoid traps and some of them with stop to fire arrows and such at you, but for the most part they just follow an A to B path.    One problem that makes Trapt somewhat frustrating and repetitive towards the end is that many of the enemies near the end of the game seem to always be aware of where your traps are. Sure, most every enemy learns where they are and will avoid them after you first spring them, requiring you to move them around on them, but some of the enemies at the end will avoid them outright. So in order to spring them on the enemy, you either need to outright force them into a trap or get a bit lucky.   Forcing them sometimes requires that you continuously run laps around the level until you happen to catch them at just the right moment, which can obviously get repetitive. At other times, you need to force them to walk down a narrow section of the room to spring the traps, which means that if you miss you'll likely just run out, wait for them to follow you, and then run back into your trap again.Trapt is something of a guilty pleasure. It's not the greatest looking game ever, nor is it the most complicated game you'll ever play. The basic pain and death mechanics are good fun for a while though. The traps do begin to get repetitive a bit and the AI could have been a little smarter, but again, death and destruction is always good fun. If that's all your expecting from Trapt, you'll likely have a good time with it.", "date": "Oct 12, 2005"}
