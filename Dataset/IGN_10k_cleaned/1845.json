Tack another nice addition to the property in the form of Army Men Air Combat for the Game Boy Color -- this one, too, is a good handheld action game, though it seriously lacks in the originality department.   Features 16 missions Six locations Four different weapons Only for Game Boy Color   Why is it unoriginal? It's simple -- the designers simply cloned one of Electronic Arts' cool action titles from the Genesis days. Remember Desert Strike? This Army Men game is so close to mirroring the gameplay of that title, it's scary. The game's angled, overhead perspective and strategy involved in selecting the proper gunmen are two dead giveaways in where Fluid Studios got the inspiration for Air Combat on the Game Boy Color.  Not that it's a bad thing -- the team chose the right game to mimic. Instead of taking the game against Saddam Hussein , the developers went to the Army Men world -- these guys, after all, are only a couple inches tall, and plastic. So the battle between green and tan has been taken to the backyard, the picnic grounds, the playground, and the beach...as well as more sizable areas like desert canyons so these guys don't feel too itty bitty. The challenge is to follow the mission plan by flying your helicopter all over the battlegrounds -- some missions rely on cargo delivering, while others are of the search and destroy variety. Complete the mission and it's off to the next one -- the day's never done for an Army Man.  But believe me when I say this game is hard -- your helicopter seems like it's got a huge bullseye painted on it, as it's nothing  but a target for the dozens of enemy tan soldiers, tanks, turrets, cannons, and jeeps out on the battlefield. You'll have to play it conservatively as there's no way to advance through the game by simply blasting your way through enemy territory. Sure, you've got a nice variety of weaponry at your disposal, but the good stuff is limited -- you can fly around and pick up crates to your heart's content, but keep in mind that you'll most likely take damage during your search patrol...is it really worth it?  So, the game's difficulty level is one of the biggest issues I have against Army Men Air Combat  -- early missions should be a training ground, not a slaughterfest. I also have an issue against its lack of overall variety...but the password system comes through to give yourself a break after struggling through some of the tough missions in the game.  The game's engine does a good job keeping the action going -- despite all the destructible items, enemy soldiers and vehicles, and your huge helicopter on-screen, the game only flickers and slows down a little bit. It's barely a distraction. The graphics do have an odd look to them due to the use of harsh black outlines on every sprite -- but that's a minor criticism.  If you're looking for a challenge that'll last you a long time, this game's a decent choice. Just keep in mind that the frustration level can get really high in mission hotspots. The game could have used a bit more variety to ease that ~Geez, I have to do it again??!~ feeling you get when playing Air Combat -- but it's a good game to play in sections. Play a mission, turn it off. Come back. Play another mission. Just don't forget to write down the four digit password.", "date": "Mar 15, 2001"}
