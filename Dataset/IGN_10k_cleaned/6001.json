However, I quick check of the grosses proves that I am in the majority, so chances are anybody who downloads Sony Pictures Digital's mobile edition of Stealth will have no idea if the game is correctly following the storyline. Not that it matters. There's no Jaime Foxx, no Josh Lucas, and not Jessica Biel poking their pretty faces in any cutscenes -- so, really, who cares? All that matters in a top-down shooter like this is if the action is appropriate fast, furious, and fun.   And much to my surprise, after a rocky first level, I grew to like Stealth. It's probably as deep as the source material, but there is a degree of frantic action I enjoyed and there are some power-ups and special bonuses that prove somebody actually cared when they made this licensed game.   Now, as I mentioned, the first level sucks. It's kinda dull, and way too easy, especially after your wingman shows up. But it serves to acquaint you with the controls, and the less-than-populated screen gives you the opportunity to try out homing missiles, stealth functionality, and practice docking with a resupply plane. Those last three features, coupled with the wingman, elevate Stealth above expectations.   However, by the second level, the skies start filling up with enemy craft controlled by EDI (~Eddie~), the crazy computer plane that wreaks so much havoc in the movie. Battleships, tanks, helicopters, rockets -- you name it, EDI directs it your way. Your upgradable cannons, which include lasers and spread shots of varying strength, are often enough to take these enemies down, but sometimes you must call on screen-clearing bombs and homing missiles, which lock on to a nearby target, which is highlighted by a red reticule.   Shooting down enemy planes releases power-ups, such a weapon boosts, but you can also earn the services of a wingman. Another stealth jet flanks you, firing like lasers were somehow going out of style. I managed to keep the wingman for the entirety of the first level and it actually made it too easy -- especially at the end boss. However, during the second-level sea run, I lost the wingman to enemy fire and found it was decidedly tougher going without it.   You also have access to a temporary stealth mode, which renders you invisible to other ships on-screen. Using stealth, you can pretty much eliminate enemies wholesale without retribution. However, once the stealth meter runs out, you have to let it refill before using it again.   Stealth starts presenting its challenge in the second level and beyond, and it's not due to the control, either. You can use the thumbpad to move it four directions, or use the number kets to move in eight directions. However, with bombs and stealth assigned to ~*~ and ~#,~ things can get a little too crowded down there. I ended up playing the majority of the game with the thumdpab instead. I didn't necessarily lament the loss of the diagonals, although I think I could have avoided a few more shots if I was using them.   The game is not exactly a visual powerhouse, but it does have some nice touches. The night-vision scene casts the screen is the kinds of blacks and greens that Splinter Cell fans are used to seeing. The jet and enemy models are small, but they are decently detailed. The backgrounds scroll smoothly beneath the action. The audio is actually pretty good, too. The first level jingle had me considering the ~mute~ option, but the later tunes were much better. I'm not saying Koji Kondo should be worried, but this is pretty decent stuff for mobile.  Stealth surprised me. I think shooter fans will get a kick out of it once they blaze through the boring first level and get to the challenge. I liked that all of the extras, such as homing missiles and stealth, were actually integral to the game play -- they didn't feel tacked on or under-used. While Stealth isn't exactly a deep game, it's certainly a little stronger than several mobile shooters I've tested in the last few months. While ~Stealth~ may have crashed at the box office, I think this mobile game might actually have some wings.", "date": "Sep 9, 2005"}
