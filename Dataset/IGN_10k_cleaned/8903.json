Nintendo popularized this technique with its much touted ~Mode 7~ that games such as F-Zero, Pilotwings, and countless other Super NES games utilized. One of the early games to exploit rotation as a core game mechanic was a Taito arcade game, Cameltry, which was ported to the Super NES as On the Ball. Cameltry made the move to the Nintendo DS in its first year in Japan, and UFO Interactive snagged the rights but gave it an incredibly generic moniker: Labyrinth. This game should have stayed in Japan. There's a tiny bit of fun in its concept but the DS game is sloppily programmed with very little challenge, and can be conquered in almost no time at all.   Picture a game design that's all about perpetually falling, and you've got an idea what Labyrinth is all about. Instead of controlling a marble, you're instead rotating the entire maze around it as it falls. Picture the bonus round in the original Sonic the Hedgehog on the Genesis and you've got a good idea of how this game operates. As the ball falls, you've got to rotate the maze clockwise or counterclockwise to guide it from the start of the maze to the finish before the clock runs out. Thrown into the mix are hazards that'll stop your ball in its tracks or take time off the clock, as well as blocks that hide bonuses or penalties depending on how devious that level's designers were. So, at the very least, the concept is pretty solid. The rest of the game, however, is not.   The original Cameltry arcade game (we still can't get over how confusing that title is) featured a spinner dial for its control so that players could rotate the level as fast or as slow as they'd like. On the Super NES, the game used the shoulder buttons: R for clockwise, L for counterclockwise. That scheme is still in place on the Nintendo DS for those that just want the basic function, but let's be real - you need full analog control to rotate the level at quick or subtle increments, and the digital L and R buttons aren't going to offer it. The developers created two touch-screen controls: one that requires players to ~spin~ circles to rotate the maze, but this requires precise position: you have to keep your stylus within the confines of the lower screen's ~circle,~ and since you're watching the upper screen your pen will tend to drift out of the sensitivity zone and the game will stop responding to inputs. The secondary controls require simpler left and right movements as if you were playing a game of Breakout. Again, you'll drift out of the sensitivity zone, but not as frequently as the spinning motion. The preferable way is the secondary control, at least for me.      The problem is that the game is unbelievably easy. Too easy, in fact. Labyrinths are short and incredibly abrupt, many of which only require about 30 seconds of maze spinning. Ball physics are incredibly rigid compared to the arcade original, so it's simple to keep control over the ball as it knocks into the sides of the maze and keep it away from the hazards that'll remove seconds from the game clock. The collision detection is the pits, though, and it's really the only thing that makes the game unfairly difficult - trying to fit your ball through a tiny gap is very frustrating at times simply because the game has a hard time shoving your ball through it. Perhaps that's why the designers gave the player a new ability to ~power up~ the ball to get it through the trickier parts of the levels.   What could have saved Labyrinth is its four player multiplayer, since the game's all about racing and the developer incorporated single cartridge support so that all four people can run off a single cartridge. But the support is shoddily developed and clearly wasn't bug tested: in multiplayer systems will continually get out of sync and lose track of the other player's position, which ultimately makes this mode useless since many times all players will either win or lose at the same timeand quite a few times the race would end after a single second simply because the network was confused. Labyrinth is a bad port of a mediocre arcade game. There's potential for fun, but that potential is never met - the single player campaign is over stunningly quick, and the multiplayer is almost unplayably buggy. The bargain price makes it less of an investment to see if the game's really not good like I make it out to be, but trust me: keep that twenty bucks in your wallet and move on.", "date": "Aug 15, 2007"}
