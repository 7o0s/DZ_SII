Well, they are. Trust me. And now that you know I can speak about Wild Wild West with some authority, perhaps we can get to the matter at hand. Some time ago Barry Sonnenfeld decided he needed some more money. So he gets Will Smith, who he knows can use the work, to star in a movie version of an old spy show that had come up with the clever gimmick of using cowboys instead of spies. Got it? Well I used to watch that show with my Grampa after church and I loved it. That's why I was so hot to see the movie.  This is a game review and not a film review so I'll spare you my opinion of the movie (at least the fifteen minutes of it I could bear to watch) and just say that I had higher expectations of the PC game when I previewed it earlier this spring. Here it seemed that someone was taking the Alone in the Dark style of gameplay and marrying it to a cool old west license. Or at least a license that I thought was cool. The two characters of Jim West and Artemus Gordon would try to foil a plot to assassinate President Grant. Each characters' sequences would play differently -- Jim's would involve action, Artie's would involve disguises and gadgets.  The exposition of the game is enough to get you interested in how things turn out. A night watchman is electrocuted when he shakes hands with an 18~ tall mechanical doll fashioned in the likeness of President Grant. How could you stop playing at this point? The game proper starts as West and Gordon are asked to investigate a threat made against the real President Grant. Although President 18 is the only true historical personage in the game, West and Artie will stumble onto evidence that seems to indicate John Wilkes Booth was part of a larger conspiracy. This shifts the focus to the Civil War and firmly fixes the game world in the proper historical context. Far too many games shift the focus on creating environments spatially without any regard to giving them a proper time backdrop.  Along the way to foiling the plot (which you realize by now is what the game is asking of you, right?) there'll be shootouts in ghost towns, a sword duel and a little love interest thrown in for the ladies...or even some of the men, I don't care. The point is that the gang that dreamt up this one has hit the right chord in terms of style. The story seems a little more like a Wild Wild West episode than I expected. The only problem is that it's not called Night of the Steel Assassin. The story's got some real depth to it and it even has some harsh deaths thrown in for effect. Like when Artie drowns a guy but does in a real sanitized, distant, gimmicky, pseudo-science project way. I mean, that makes it even worse.  Jim decides to track down any information regarding John Wilkes Booth's last night. West goes to the tavern where Booth was spotted the night Lincoln was assassinated. Once there, you'll be asked to solve crossword puzzles, fix up some contraption with items you find laying around and solve a syllogistic logic problem just to get a little information. And that's all before you even draw your gun. But once the bullets start flying, you'll still have to think things through. Otherwise you die. I know this sounds ridiculous but I wish the Jim West parts hadn't been so cerebral. In fact, the game fails to deliver on the action side of the equation. Most of the fights Jim gets into can be won through some ruse or device -- such as dropping a crate of nails on someone's head, that kind of thing.  I think that may have to do with the action interface. When you draw your gun as Jim West (Artie doesn't carry a gun, despite the advice of his doctor and the rest of the IGNPC staff), you get a little aiming reticle. Under normal circumstances (i.e. not shooting at anyone) the reticle is big and gray. Once you position the reticle over something that can be shot, the reticle turns red and begins to shrink. The smaller it gets, the more accurate your shot is. Once the reticle is small enough, you pull the trigger. Easy? Well, it ought to be.  The trick is that this makes it almost impossible to hit a moving target and it keeps you from moving at all while aiming or firing. Now it says right in the NRA handbook that Trent keeps in plain view -- just to irritate the British and German people around the office -- that you shouldn't run with a loaded gun. While I certainly endorse this policy in spirit, I feel when the life of the 18th President of the United States is at stake, that we can bend those rules just a bit. Luckily the action is on a slider with two settings. You can also set puzzle difficulty to one of three levels. I was happy to see that the levels could be adjusted in the middle of a game if you really needed a clue.  And while the Jim West sequences had some genuinely tense moments, it certainly lacked some liveliness. It seemed that most of the story was going on in Artie's half of the adventure. As far as I'm concerned, Artie's the one who figured this out. He's the real hero and if he'd been able to fit into that Spanish-cut suit, maybe he would've had his own show. But the Artie moments lack the threat of danger that moves the Jim sequences along. I mean Jim's trying to escape from a burning barn that's surrounded by gunmen while Artie's trying to think of ways to ditch a girl who has the hots for him.  Artie decides to impersonate the lead actor for the reopening of Ford's Theatre. Everyone fears that the assassins will strike here. Before he begins rehearsals he checks out the scene of the night watchman's death for clues. But let's not give any more away than we have to. Let's just say that from here the game plays out in a slightly linear fashion, with the solution to one puzzle leading pretty inevitably into the next. Although you are free to roam around at your discretion in some of the sequences, overall shape of the story is set in stone. I think I only came across a few instances where more than one path was open to a particular objective (and one of the paths wasn't 'kill everything').  The game looks pretty good. The character models can be quite natural but suffer horribly from that awful club-hand look -- give 'em a cane or an umbrella to hold at least. The textures and skins for each character are pretty remarkable and worth closer inspection. The figures in motion possess some life-like effects but still move very stiffly. The animations for the cutscenes (which look like the same engine as the game engine) are much more convincing. The 2D backgrounds are well conceived and definitely give the impression of that missing third dimension. And the way the shadows interact with the background is equally believable.  In the sound department, WWW scores big...well, sort of. The actors retained to voice for Jim and Artie are obviously trying to impersonate Will Smith and Kevin Kline. They do a fine job but it certainly is a little labored. Most of the other voice work in the game is quality. There are even several key points of the game where you'll hear things whispered just out of range. I nearly jumped out of my seat when I leaned out of a window in the game and heard a rough voice shout 'Rush him!~ Scared the hell out of me.  The music also is ~the most complex implementation of MS DirectMusic technology.~ It's meant to give you the full range and depth of an orchestra. While I don't know about that, the music has a very cinematic quality, not just in terms of style but also in terms of production.  Southpeak really had me intrigued by this half-action, half-adventure split. I like more than one type of game and I think thoughtful combinations like this would be more welcome. The action parts here are considerably more puzzle like than I like 'em and the puzzle elements relies too much on the Rube Goldberg/McGuyver effect where you assemble dozens of household objects in order to repair a broken steam shovel. And it's never that simple anyway. So there's a lot to recommend this game, but it's my belief that action gamers will grow weary of the puzzles and the action interface in general. Fans of puzzle games can come get an action fix here without feeling like they're totally abandoning the genre.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Dec 22, 1999"}
