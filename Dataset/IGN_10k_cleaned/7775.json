It's an altogether different kind of game, a simulation game, the first of its kind. SimCity was created by Will Wright, a man who in the early '80s was programming Raid on Bungeling Bay. Raid was a helicopter combat title, an action game. Will was proud of how it turned out, but he found that he didn't like playing it so much as he liked creating it  he had more fun in the planning process, in laying out the design of each game level.   Will decided that his second game project would be based on that concept of planning and design. He worked to develop the gameplay for years, ultimately co-founding a company called Maxis to publish the title. In 1989, it was ready  SimCity was released for home computers.   SimCity revolutionized PC gaming, ushering in a new golden age of sim, strategy and god games. Sequels to the game included SimCity 2000 and 3000, with spin-offs like SimEarth, SimAnt and SimCopter all arriving in the following years courtesy of Will's continued vision. Today the individual-focused The Sims franchise has become the most popular PC gaming series of all time, and anticipation is high for Wright's next project, the ~SimEverything~ title Spore.          Compared to the complexities that came in its follow-ups, SimCity is pretty simple. You play as the mayor of growing town, building and expanding the settlement and managing the local government. Three basic zones form the foundation of any town  residential, commercial and industrial. A healthy burg will need to be built with the right balance of each, supplied with electricity from a power plant, and supported with a transportation structure of roads and railways.    As the population in your community grows, you're met with both rewards and trials. The rewards are unique structures like city zoos that become activated for placement on the map. The trials take the form of natural disasters. Floods, tornadoes, earthquakes and more will assault your SimCitizens as the years press on, each doing damage to that must be contained and then recovered from.   This version of SimCity is an SNES release, and was actually one of the launch titles for that system when it arrived in August of 1991. The 16-bit machine brought more colorful graphical effects to the game's presentation, and a splash from Nintendo's palette of characters painted cameo appearances from Mario and Bowser into play. An enhancement over the computer versions is the introduction of Dr. Wright, a wild-haired helper who hosts game announcements and serves as a tutorial guide for new players.   The one disadvantage to the PC game hitting a console was the compromise in control  the SNES had no mouse at the time of SimCity's release, so it's all D-Pad here. You can't fault a retro release like this for its control scheme, programmed over a decade and a half ago, but playing this version of SimCity on the Wii definitely drives home that there's a lot of potential for a combination of the sim genre and the Wiimote's pointer abilities. Modern developers would be wise to take notice.   SimCity stands as the sole representative of the simulation genre in the Wii's playable catalog, at least for a while. Fans of a more laid-back and casual play experience, as well as gamers who might have discovered The Sims but never its predecessors, should consider giving Will Wright's first blockbuster a try.", "date": "Dec 8, 2006"}
