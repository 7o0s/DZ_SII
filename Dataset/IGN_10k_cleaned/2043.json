Some sim-like games have made the transition from PC to console, most notably Warcraft. However, Agile Warrior, a Warhawk-like game from Virgin, never quite hits the target.  First of all, the plane handles so badly as to question using the word ~agile~ in the game's name. Secondly, the title only includes a half dozen or so missions, most of which are much more difficult than need be, usually because the plane handles so badly. Numerous other details also hinder the game, such as the decision to place the mission directly over most of the screen, thus making more difficult than it already is.  To its credit, Agile Warrior does have a nice graphic engine, and loves to show it off. Those huge explosions are pretty cool, especially when you use one to take out an enemy plane. This a small portion of the game, however. Generally, Agile Warrior serves more to frustrate and bewilder than entertain.", "date": "Nov 22, 1996"}
