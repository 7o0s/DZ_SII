First came cross-platform compatibility poster boy 4x4 Evolution, followed by smash success Insane, and Off-road Redneck Racing isn't far off.  However, with so many titles vying for your attention, late arrivals are afforded less breathing room than idiots who let themselves get trapped in an elevator with Dom DeLuise.  But although it won't be drawing a huge crowd, the lesser hyped Cabela's 4x4 Off-road Adventure stands out as much as any competitor for ten extremely important reasons.  Reason one: the title is from Head Games (aka Activision Value) and yet doesn't border on cruel and inhuman punishment.  As for reasons two through ten - see numero uno.  Actually, this product proves unique from another important standpoint as well.  Nowhere else will gamers find an arcade style driving sim with such a preoccupation for real world scenarios.  Unlike your typical automotive diversion, the challenge isn't merely about reaching the finish line first, but rather reaching it, period.  Dumped in dry riverbeds, barren deserts, treacherous mountains and myriad additional forms of inhospitable terrain, drivers must see their wannabe big rigs safely through while avoiding busted axles, radiator leaks or any other problem guaranteed to arise shortly after American made cars pass the 50 mile mark.  Speed freaks need not apply, because technique and finesse pave the trail to glory, in lieu of ridiculously accelerated frame rate counts.  At a mere twenty shekels, you'll be getting a solid return on investment.  Play modes are found in abundance, including Skill, Navigation, Explore, and Discovery scenarios. While most differ only by virtue of minor conceptual differences, such as the availability of maps and compasses or navigation buoys, each game variant encompasses so many novel situations that the selection passes muster.  Furthermore, previously unavailable level groupings like Endurance and Freedom can be unlocked once the default stages are completed.  Despite a strong solo mode though, 4x4 Off-Road Adventure would have benefited from at least rudimentary multiplayer support, which concerned players will find curiously absent.  Worthwhile incentives for repeat play won't be a problem, nonetheless.  Affluent, outdoorsy types will be positively randy over the robust selection of vehicles on offer.  For once, instead of just being run into medians by them, you can sit behind the wheel of a luxury SUV or bad-ass pickup truck.  These sweet rides can be custom painted or fine-tuned by grease monkeys so that everything from tire pressure to gear ratios and braking is 100% personalized.  Emerge victorious from a demanding jaunt and you'll also find that new, equipable parts are added into your inventory as a reward.  Honestly though, one should be extremely selective when devoting time towards upgrade efforts.  Wreck a roadster and it's scrapped permanently, thereby wasting your work investment.  None of this is mentioned in the printed manual, of course.  Hell, with only two pages of information included in said insert, it's a miracle that players ever get up and running.  Granted, outdoor activities are fairly self-explanatory, but some detailed vehicle descriptions and a summary of what play entails should have been provided beyond what an online help function reveals.  Thus any discernable learning curve relies solely on individual experimentation.  Put in perspective, that means you'll need the patience of a saint or a good pair of reading glasses to get any mileage out of the game.  But perseverance is rewarded.  Having entered Mother Nature's kingdom, you'll soon see why the semi-authentic driving model makes a difference.  Frost, snow, dirt, gravel, mud, water and more dismal forms of terrain impose quantifiable constraints on your mean machine.  Learning the intricacies of handling slippery patches of ice as opposed to tire-shredding rock is a worthy challenge for any gearhead.  Slow and steady is a driver's preferred method of travel, as most scripted scenarios throw several curve balls your way.  Imagine barreling forward at top speed, only to find the path ahead totally obstructed or covered with a sudden expanse of swampland where none was before.  By assuming this quirky stance on the traditional auto racing formula, 4x4 Off-road Adventure destroys its mass-market appeal, though niche players should have no problem gettin' down and dirty.  Fair audio-visual resources aid in the aforementioned regard.  At a distance, geographical layouts and environmental objects could be mistaken for medium res treats.  Mind you, what looks like smooth terrain from afar grows significantly more pixilated when observed from a close up.  Thankfully pleasant weather effects, damage-conscious vehicle models, and highly convincing splash effects add much needed eye candy.  Rollicking rock tunes accompany the performance, though most airtime is occupied by convincingly real noises of huge man-made constructs crunching and bumping through thick vegetation.  Granted, the C-grade decor doesn't hold a candle to the surreal vistas most competitors tout, but it's a giant leap forward for Activision Value's art department.  As with most products from yon publisher, Cabela's 4x4 Off-road Adventure is a game casual enthusiasts could live without.  Excessive emphasis on realism, average graphical performance, tiresome play mechanics, and a deficient tutorial method put it well out of the reach of the average motor sport buff.  But don't judge a truck by its hubcaps.  Delve deeper into this product's payload and you'll find a truly creative stab at authentic outdoor thrills in sub-par conditions.  Never mind that the title offers a whole heck of a lot more value for your money than any comparably priced automotive package.  Come sequel season, with a little bit more time in the shop, this could well be a first class cruiser.  -- Scott Steinberg Want to share your opinions with the world?
