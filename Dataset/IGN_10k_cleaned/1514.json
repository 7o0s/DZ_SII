{"name": "Spider-Man", "name_review": "Spider-Man", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/22/spider-man-14", "text": "Back before we had daily cartoons to entertain the masses, comic books were the national craze, allowing both kids and adults to live out their wildest fantasies as the forces of good battled the hordes of evil. There have been many such comic book heroes over time, but one of the most popular to date is the web-crawler himself: Spider-Man. Peter Parker is his name, and after having been bit by a spider late one night and receiving superhuman abilities, he decides to construct a homemade wrist device for slinging a sticky web of goo anywhere he pleases. And so, being the good boy his mother raised him to be, Parker decides to put his talents to use keeping New York City safe from hoodlums and villains.  Now it is the year 2000, and famed videogame publisher Activision has picked up the license to this timeless superhero and has now brought Spider-Man to the N64 courtesy of developer Edge of Reality. Activision had released a PlayStation version of the title a few months earlier under the work of developer Neversoft Entertainment, and like its previous smash-hit Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, the task of bringing this highly anticipated game to the Nintendo cart-based console has been turned over to the Edge of Reality crew. After witnessing their skateboarding efforts in action, Spider-Man fans have no doubt been licking their chops for this action packed title. IGN64 recently spent quite some time hanging out with our arachnid friend and is ready to fill you in on exactly how the 64-bit version has finally shaped up.  The Facts  For one player 256-megabit (32MBs) cartridge Over 30 levels of story based action Four possible standard controller configurations, and one ~kid-mode~ simplified setting Four training modes: time attack, survival mode, speed training, and item collection -- each having multiple scenarios Lots of classic Spider-Man extras to earn: 32 original comic covers and descriptions, character profiles, and classic Spider-Man costumes to wear during gameplay Built-in cheat menu for unlocking secrets Other options include level select, view credits, slide show for viewing story cutscenes, and viewable training records Save game data via Controller Pak Support for the Expansion Pak -- optional, providing enhanced performance Rumble Pak support  Gameplay Ever since the early days of action games, players have been scrolling from left to right across their screens punching, kicking, hacking, and slashing their way to the final boss encounter. This formula has been done a hundred times, but fortunately it works just as well the 101st time in Spider-Man. Although this game features fully 3D players and environments and is peppered with a few non-linear elements, for the most part players will take control of Spidey and run, punch, kick, crawl, and swing through roughly 34 levels of fun based in New York City, much like the action days of old. You'll chase villains across rooftops and run from pursuing helicopters as you swing from building to building. You'll crawl on ceilings and up into ventilation shafts as you attempt to rescue hostages.  And yes, you will kick some serious tail with plenty of web attacks and superhero brute strength.  The story unfolds as Peter Parker witnesses an imposter Spider-Man steal a new piece of technology at a press conference, and thus Spidey is on the run from the law and in pursuit of the culprit. But that's just the start, as you'll find many twists and turns, including the eventual kidnapping of your wife, Mary Jane Parker. Unlike the PlayStation version of the title, there are no FMVs between levels due to size-restricting nature of the cartridge format. But credit must be given to the Edge of Reality team for their creative solution to help drive the story. The N64 version presents you with frames from the PSX videos delivered with text dialog and sound effects that lend a very comic book feel to the presentation. In fact, these static cutscenes make the game feel less like a Hollywood blockbuster (i.e.: the PSX version) and more like an old-school comic book. It works brilliantly and keeps you interested through the whole title.  Once you have control of Spidey, you'll find that the guy is quick, nimble, and will cling to just about any surface he touches. You name it: walls, ceilings, the side of buildings -- if you can touch it, Spider-Man will grip it and crawl all over it. Then you can leap from it, swing to another location, or pounce on an unsuspecting enemy below. This makes for some very rewarding and creative gameplay since you are not limited to simply running around on foot like the average action title. The play mechanics in this game will have you hooked the first time you realize how effortlessly you can cover every inch of the play environment. For whatever reason, swinging around in Spider-Man never ceases to be fun, and it's this kind of basic gameplay design that will keep you coming back for more.  The control layout does take some getting used to since your two primary fighting buttons (punch and kick) are located on the smaller C-left and C-down buttons by default. The A button jumps, and the rest are divided into various web-related tasks. The B button will shoot a web directly up to the ceiling, zipping you to safety and a nice vantage point for attacks. The R button will shoot a web far off-screen for swinging long distances Tarzan-style. The rest of your web abilities are all used for smacking around the various thugs you'll encounter during gameplay. Pressing the C-up button in combination with a direction on the analog stick or control pad shoots your different web based attacks: impact web (launches a web ball straight ahead), yank web (wraps up the victim and slams them into the wall), web fists (gives your punches some extra pow), and web dome (Spider-Man crouches and covers himself with a web barrier, which then explodes in all directions). While its nice to be able to fire any of these four moves with a single button, they're actually disappointingly difficult to pull off. It does help to use the control pad instead of the analog stick, but you'll still accidentally release the wrong attack about half of the time. This can get really frustrating when you're outnumbered and frantically fighting the mob for your life or when you're trying to nail a boss across the screen with an impact web but instead just waste away your precious web resources.  Another helpful technique is the use of the Z or L button, which serves a couple of functions. The biggest is to help center the camera directly behind Spidey by tapping the button quickly, very similar to the Zelda games. The camera system can sometimes be a bit of a bother while roaming your turf, and especially during the boss fights that are typically enclosed in small areas. For some reason, the camera system seems to wander or drag behind a bit too slowly at times, so you'll probably find yourself using this centering function quite often.  If you keep the Z trigger down longer, the game will bring up a targeting system much like the aiming feature in Perfect Dark or GoldenEye. The controls are a bit rough for aiming, and it's much too cumbersome to actually use in combat. But when the camera system has you frustrated and you want to take a peek around in a pseudo first-person view, then this mode will provide some temporary relief. It also comes in handy for planning your next swing of the web, since you can pinpoint a ledge and swing safely away from your pursers.  The enemies in Spider-Man aren't exactly beaming with AI either. Early in the game, they have been made intentionally easy targets with their backs toward you, allowing the player to get a feel for how to pound them real good. And later they do become more aware of your crawling around, but most simply run up to you and start shooting away. There's no hiding behind obstacles or intelligent teamwork displayed on their part. But regardless, the action is still fun and rewarding, and gamers will be more than happy to use their Spidey skills to beat them into submission for their criminal misbehaviors.  Graphics Originally, the N64 version of Spider-Man was set to launch simultaneously with the PSX version back in August, but developer Edge of Reality has taken the time to make sure that Nintendo fans receive a version that looks just as good, if not better. Indeed they have managed to pack this monster cart with all the same lush cityscapes, interiors, and effects, with even a few such visuals bumped it up a notch or two. The game has a very crisp, smooth look, and Spidey himself looks exceptionally detailed as a lean, mean, web-slinging machine.  At first glance, the rooftop swinging levels will seem a bit overly foggy in a way that puts the Turok series to shame. But considering the limitations of the gaming system itself, it's just not even fathomable to ask the N64 to render an entire city for you to monkey around in. So bearing that in mind, the fog isn't such a bad thing -- it's not even remotely distracting and fortunately it provides a very nice framerate to accompany your superhero outings. The game is rarely slowed down at all, and much credit must be given to the EOR development team for not only keeping this game beautiful, but for adding a few extra bits of eye-candy and keeping the framerate silky smooth.  Sound Another area to receive special consideration for Spider-Man's translation to the N64 is the audio department. A very good portion of the cartridge space was reserved to guarantee that we didn't miss a drop of the wonderful sound clips featured in the PSX version. And let us just say that this game would not be half as cool as it already is without them. All effects and music have been sampled in great clarity and quality -- punches sound like they hurt, and every possible action in the game has a unique sound effect tagged with it.  This title also features some of the best in-game dialog on the N64. Activision has recruited some great voice talents to speak the lines of all main characters throughout the game, and it truly brings the game to life. In fact, comic master and series creator Stan Lee is even heard introducing parts of the game and bringing players up to speed on the story -- if that doesn't get you in the mood to hop in the red and blue tights, nothing will.  The music is also done very nicely, adding dynamic elements similar to the Banjo-Kazooie titles. Whenever you enter certain areas, or begin fighting groups of baddies, you be treated to an extra hard guitar channel on top of the current tunes, which really helps intensify the action and let you know when the heat is on. Overall, the sounds in this game are very impressive and compete very favorably with the previously released PSX game.When gamers first laid eyes on Spider-Man for the PSX, expectations were running very high for the N64 version, and I'm extremely glad to say that it has been worth every day of this 11 week wait. It doesn't matter if you're male or female, young or old, fan or newcomer -- if you own an N64 and enjoy a good action/adventure game every now and then, then Spider-Man will certainly wrap you up in his web. The gameplay is just as simple as any punch and kick action title, but Spidey's unique abilities such as clinging to walls and swinging like a monkey have been produced perfectly and are so fundamentally addicting themselves that you will play the game for a long time to come.Don't allow yourself to be disappointed by the lack of FMV cutscenes in this version -- the newly created comic book storyboards are equally effective and actually manage to increase the overall presentation of the game as just another paperback adventure for our spider-loving superhero. If you're looking for a spectacular single player adventure with great play mechanics and fast action, then do not hesitate to pick this game up.", "date": "Nov 22, 2000"}
