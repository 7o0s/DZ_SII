{"name": "Contra [Mobile, 2006]", "name_review": "Contra", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/07/19/contra", "text": "Konami's classic arcade blaster Contra -- sporting a well-earned reputation for being one of the toughest games of the 8-bit generation -- is now numbing thumbs all over again, thanks to a remarkable pixel-perfect mobile port that looks much better than the NES original. But looks are only a fraction of the battle when resurrecting favorites from years gone by -- developers have to faithfully recreate the game play mechanics that made vidders fall in love in the first place.   Contra's stumbling block? Controls. Let's face it -- the number pad or thumb pad are no substitute for the original NES pads or a good arcade joystick. The learning curve to Contra's mobile form is significant, as you fumble and bumble when getting into tough spots. The disconnect isn't unsurpassable, but it's certainly tough and I suspect that more than few classic fans may close their phones in quiet frustrations after they blow a few perilous jumps or get ventilated by some alien turrets that never posed a problem in the past.   Contra recreates both the side-scrolling missions, where you push through jungles and cityscapes, and pseudo-3D missions that go ~into~ the screen. All of the classic weapons, enemies, and vehicles book return engagements for this mobile port, which is pleasing to see -- especially for a fan of the original.   I tested the game out on a Sony Ericsson 710a which offers a nice, bright screen -- but Contra only took up a small portion of it. Game space isn't necessarily sacrificed, but the port opts to just shrink down the visuals rather than make sure of the provided real estate. Even in its smallish form, the sprites are still colorful and mildly detailed, just like the original.  Contra is certainly a solid port -- so much of the original game successfully made the jump to the smallest screen. The game mechanics are in place, the visuals offer a reasonable facsimile... the only failing is that the controls aren't as accurate as required for a twitchy actioner like Contra. And that's not necessarily Konami's fault -- no handset has yet to introduce a control input as good as a regular console controller, even stretching as far back as the NES. If you're willing to log the time to get used to the controls or don't mind some unfortunate deaths due to fumbling a jump, this nostalgic run isn't a bad way to blow a few bucks.", "date": "Jul 19, 2006"}
