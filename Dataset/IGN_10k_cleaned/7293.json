Dinosaurs fighting each other with people riding their backs throwing spears and shooting arrows is cooler still. Add in a dash of science and some steampunk and there's a recipe for fun. That coolness of concept is what developer SEK is hoping will sell their new RTS title ParaWorld.  But while dino fans get a kick out of the units thanks to some nice art, RTS fans will find a very traditional type of play that can feel old at times, despite some clever interface innovations.   The story behind ParaWorld is an interesting, if inconsistent and abrupt. The idea is that three scientists come to wealthy mathematician Jarvis Babbit with a discovery of the existence of parallel worlds. Little do they know that Babbit and his secret society SEAS discovered the world years ago and had been working rubbing their hands together greedily ever since. The three are trapped when Babbit tricks and strands them on the parallel world. From that point it's a fight for survival and the search for a way back to Earth. Along the way they fight and make friends with three different factions on the world, each with conveniently different styles.    The story is presented well with pre-rendered cutscenes that use the in-game engine for artistic consistency. The voice acting is cheesy, but acceptable in most cases but the dialogue can be pretty bad, especially for the ~tough guy~ character named Anthony Cole. Apparently he's a frat boy, bro, and itching to fight. The main problem with the story isn't necessarily the dialogue, but the holes that pop up where travels or happenings aren't exactly explained.   Upon entering the first mission you'll be asking yourself ~Where the hell did the geologist guy get two swords and the hot scientist chick get a chain whip?~ It's just bizarre that these geeks from our world have not only decided to use these primitive weapons when gunpowder seems to work just fine in ParaWorld but somehow have expert training in them. It's not game breaking or incredibly important to the enjoyment of the game, it's just the first of several puzzling moves made by the writers.   Outside of the story, the game is presented with a great pulp adventure/steampunk style. Dinosaurs and other units are modeled well and environments have some lovely effects. The main female characters have ridiculous costumes, which isn't entirely surprising, but other than that, the game takes wonderful screenshots. In motion, it's not as smooth. Animations tend to be a bit clunky, especially for humans which becomes especially clear in some of the real-time rendered cutscenes in the game. None of the animations are bad enough to put a damper on the fun of the visual style, but they definitely could have been better.    Once past the story and presentation, players will find that ParaWorld is a very traditional real-time strategy game. Most of the campaigns follow the ~Build a base and then find the other guy's base and destroy it~ routine that we've all played through plenty of times. Even if the main goal is simply to find items, they're usually in the middle of an enemy base, which will have to be destroyed first. In the end, nearly all of the missions ended up providing basically the same challenges which could all be solved using roughly the same units. Aside from a couple of ~defend this~, ~sneak around this~, and corridor crawling missions, there are very few surprises in any of the campaign designs to make them stand out from the crowd.   ParaWorld uses a resource model familiar to most RTS players. Food, stone, and wood must be harvested to train units and construct buildings. Resources are limited so players need to get out and capture new resource nodes. Along the way, players will have to upgrade their resource capacity and can also upgrade how quickly their workers harvest the resources.   On top of the traditional resources, players also have to collect skulls in order to advance their units and buy upgrades. In the case of the Dustrider faction, skulls are also used to advance Epochs in order to open up new technologies. The addition of skull collecting might have been a good impetus to move out and fight the enemy if it wasn't for the large number of neutral animals running around the landscape that also provide skulls. All of the random animals are generated from nests in the area and can be harvested from time to time. This can really slow the game down to a crawl in any games against AI since players can build strong defenses and basically wait for the AI to bash its brains in against your walls and towers. Playing against human opponents is obviously a bit trickier, but games can drag out as resources run down while defenses become very powerful.    However, there are new tricks to learn with each of the three factions. Each has a slightly different play style though all factions are well rounded for both offense and defense. The Norse have strong walls and hardy units while the Dustriders lean more towards straight offensive play even though with the right hero upgrades, they receive an incredibly powerful defensive tower, which seems to unbalance them a bit. The Dragon Clan meanwhile prefers subterfuge in their defenses with different types of traps that can do damage or completely disable enemies.   While most of the title is standard RTS fare, SEK did put some effort into trying to make the interface a little easier. The biggest and most successful of these features is the Army Controller which sits on the left side of the screen and shows small portraits of all units in your force. Units can all be selected via the portraits either by clicking or using a rubber band to select several. A double click on any of the portraits can take you directly to that units which is especially useful when a fight is taking place. All of the unit portraits can show what the units are doing at the moment, whether it's fighting or harvesting wood, so it's easy to navigate the battlefield and find exactly the unit you're looking for.    Units are also divided by five tiers. New tiers are opened up when a new Epoch has been researched. While many of the units have base tier requirements, meaning a tier three unit can't fit in the tier two section, even the lower units on the rung can be promoted to become a tier higher giving them increased stats and some visual improvements. The trick is that there is less room towards the higher tiers than the lower ones. For instance, the first tier has 25 unit slots while the highest only has one. This means that in order to promote a unit, there has to be a space open in the tier above. Promoting a unit fills their life bar completely, which is a huge bonus in the middle of battle, so it's important to remember to keep a slot open above important units and heroes.   This Army Controller is pretty successful at many levels, but it also brings some necessary restrictions, the biggest of which is the 52 unit cap, which seems pretty small for the scale of some of the maps. Take into account the 15 or so workers needed to efficiently run resources and you're down to 33 combat units. Not a huge number, especially for naval maps where only some of the units can even be on land.    ParaWorld is a well presented game with a terrific opening cutscene to get players ready to go and a story that could have been terrific were it not for some holes and inconsistencies. Obviously the chance to control both small and epic dinosaurs (and other prehistoric creatures) is pretty enticing for those like us that find the beasts fantastic.The game itself is decent enough but sticks almost entirely to the old RTS formula. The slow pace of the campaign can be hard to stick with at times though multiplayer and skirmish offer up other modes which push the action a little bit more. Still, for those that enjoy very traditional RTS titles that aren't as frantic as some of the newer RTSs, ParaWorld is certainly worth a look.", "date": "Sep 28, 2006"}
