{"name": "Air Raid: This is Not a Drill", "name_review": "Air Raid Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/07/01/air-raid-review", "text": "How is it possible a destroyer can have six manned AA guns and only one of them (me) is ever actually shooting at the enemy? Who the hell let these other scrubs in the navy, let alone on the boat? Seriously, how is it that I am the only competent soldier in the entire United States naval force? Come on guys, I know war is hell and I know you may have reservations about killing millions upon millions of Japanese pilots through some 99 levels of mind numbing mediocrity livened up only by the promise of more redundancy and a kind of action that's nearly impossible to enjoy, but for the love of God, shoot something, anything! Hell, shoot yourselves.  I place blame squarely on the mellow period music playing over the phonograph that's sadly mandatory on every naval warship. It seems we're always preparing for imminent attack by listening to the soft stylings of someone long dead and forgotten. Each of this on-rails shooter's 99 levels begins with a little tune to get you in the killing mood. Since being in the navy apparently involves sitting at the helm of an AA gun capable of dispensing a sorely limited amount of flak, missiles and depth charges, some kind of music is appropriate, but this is too much. Undoubtedly, it only tires my comrades to comatose levels. How it bolsters morale is a mystery left for Poseidon himself to unravel, assuming he can ever manage to breach the gelatinous slime that is the sea and surface long enough to figure out where that god awful sound is coming from.   You know why my fellow throngs of idle seamen are so sterile? Maybe they're revolting. Yeah, maybe they can't stand the horrid quality of each and every piece of music and every single sound effect and are now refusing to take up arms against their Asian adversaries. I sure as hell wanted to quit the first time the scratchy music stuttered, skipped, paused and ultimately repeated at the successful end or disastrous failure of a round. It angers the blood. But I pressed on! I kept shooting and shooting and shooting some more even when the annoying beep of death was loudly alerting me to the imminent ~depletion of my shield,~ which apparently means my damned battleship sunk. Why keep fighting? Because I enlisted and was forced to (by Stephen ~I Hate Ivan~ Butts, who takes extreme delight in seeing his subordinates suffer so).   Should you also enlist and pledge yourself to quelling the Axis threat in this budget, limited, on-rails WWII shooter? Hell no. If you do accidentally purchase this game at the store while searching about for something good, promptly go AWOL.  Air Raid: This is Not a Drill should be wiped clean from the face of the earth. If Moses were still around he'd totally be praying for a right smiting. It's almost unbelievable. How does anyone look at this and think to themselves, ~Oh hell yes, here's a game someone will like.~  No... No!!! Just stop. Sure, I can get the fascination with shooting down planes, but no. The answer is still no. I don't care what you ask or how you justify this product's existence, it's just no. Why so negative? First of all, if I'm supposed to be on the ocean, why does it seem my immobile warship is firmly affixed to a thick layer of pulsating goo? On-rails shooters have learned since the dawn of time that if you're not going to let your player move, you'd better make the screen move. Games are also figuring out that water should probably look like water and not what some level designer rejected for Quake 1 because it looked too awful. Furthermore, if I am on a battleship and indeed can clearly see other people manning other guns exactly like mine, why aren't they shooting at anything? You know what, why is anything happening?  Perhaps to make it more interesting and invigorating, Air Raid could have begun with the riddle, ~How do I exit the Twilight Zone?~ After the successful completion of all 99 of the pointless and progressively more and more infuriating levels the answer of ~Turn the computer off~ could have been presented. Oh yeah, it can get pretty tough. It's hard to beat and even harder to figure out why exactly you're trying to beat this. Dying, or having your shield depleted, eventually becomes an issue, but most of the game is focused more on making the player conserve ammunition and be a keen devastator of the Japanese fleet. See, planes will fly at you in a variety of patterns, and even though they swoop and dive and turn, the dynamic AI this game boasts isn't really showing through, unless dynamic suddenly became synonymous with ~scripted so heavily it's engraved in stone and then encased in a thick layer of amber.~ Boats, bombers, torpedo divers... It's all the same.  At least we get some consistency! I'm so sick and tired of all of these games with their crazy variation. Just give me the same stupid ass boat, the same stupid ass pool of gelatinous slime, some static backdrops (ooh, I'm in a dock or a harbor or in the middle of the sea or in the rain or amidst some wreckage), and the same stupid ass co-gunners who will only do something in multiplayer (now there's a quick way to end a party) and I'm happy. Or is that very, very sad? I just can't remember. No, wait, it's sad. Yup, definitely sad.  But who cares? The great fun of Air Raid is throwing it at someone else. We have a game here in the IGN offices that we (mainly me) play regularly. It's called, ~Try to hit Dan in the face with a CD when he least expects it.~ For this, Air Raid is supremely useful. Perhaps it's the way the game was based off of planes and stuff. I mean, the graphics are good enough to make planes look like planes, so the CD should fly like a plane, right? Even if this is scalable for the low-end market and geared toward those looking to pick the title up with a box of Cheetos and a copy of Marked for Death at Costco, I don't have to like it, and I sure as heck don't have to lie to you about it. Fugly is an understatement. Virtua Cop is about one hundred billion times prettier than this, but then I never was good with the math.  How does one more paragraph before the numbers sound? Being so enraged I plum forgot to mention how it plays. Take this! Mouse turns gun. Mouse wheel zooms gun. Left click fires flak. Right click fires missiles. Spacebar lobs depth charges at incoming torpedoes. Power outage ends misery. Presto, instant crap. This is the game that doesn't end. Yes it goes on and on my friend. Some people started playing it not knowing what it was, and they'll continue playing it forever just because this is the game that doesn't end. Yes it goes on and on my friend. Some people started playing it not knowing what it was, and they'll continue playing it forever just because this is the game that doesn't end...Stare at a wall and scream that out at the top of your lungs 99 times in a row. Unless your arm is being torn out of your socket by a pissed off antelope, I guarantee you're having more fun than you would playing this. Air Raid is such a totally pointless, antiquated, poor excuse for an on-rails shooter it should be obliterated from the annals of history by a magical force. In fact, I expect such a thing will happen soon if I can only figure out how to get this bleeding spell book to work. I'd pay $20 for someone to come over and punch me in the penis before I'd willfully dish out my not so hard earned cash to a retail clerk for this, the game that should be tossed into a volcano.", "date": "Jul 1, 2003"}
