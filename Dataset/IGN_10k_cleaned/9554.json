First off, it's unbelievably addictive and I continued to spend hours playing and replaying missions (not to mention jumping into multiplayer competitions) long after I really should have been writing the review. Second off, how you will look at the game depends in a large part on whether or not you spent a lot of time playing the first title. While Dungeon Keeper 2 certainly looks and feels better than its predecessor, it doesn't fall very far from the tree when it comes to gameplay. Fortunately, since the original was such an amazing game, that's not necessarily all that bad of a thing.  For those of you who never got a chance to play the first title, Dungeon Keeper (and Dungeon Keeper 2) is a 3D isometric strategy game in which you play an master of evil looking to spread his (or her, the game is actually pretty good about staying gender neutral) baleful influence over a happy and peaceful world. In each mission, you must construct a dungeon, with different special rooms in order to attract different monsters. Once you've got a well trained fighting force, your goal is to try and eliminate the goodie-two-shoes heroes who are wandering around. The change from the standard ~you are the good hero trying to kill the evil necromancer~ is unbelievably refreshing. As the box says, ~it's good to be bad.~  Where the original Dungeon Keeper primarily revolved around defensive mission  you build a dungeon and try to eliminate the heroic invaders, Dungeon Keeper 2 has a decidedly offensive feel to it. You start each mission by selecting a sickeningly good land to corrupt and then watch a quick briefing on the lord of that particular land. As actual play starts you be notified of any new buildings or traps that you have access to and shown where any important events are taking place. Once you've got control, your goal is pretty simple  wipe out the lord of the land and steal his level gem (apparently all lords carry level gems  who knew?). The first few missions are designed to get you used to the interface and are pretty easy, but about midway through the game things start to get pretty tough. In addition to the fact that you find yourself up against smarter lords with tougher armies, you'll also begin to run into other keepers who are also trying to make this new land their own. Since you're evil, there's no diplomacy option  if there's a keeper on your turf, you only real recourse is to beat them until they understand who the real master is. This usually occurs right after death.  With the exception of your dungeon heart (which is the center of your power) and the gate (which enables monsters to enter your domain) almost every room you have available to you will not only help your existing monsters, but will also attract new monsters to your lair. A basic Lair will give your creatures a place to sleep and will also attract goblins. Hatcheries create chickens (which act as food for your critters) and help to attract several types of monsters (in combination with other rooms). Other rooms available to you early on in the game include the Library (allows the research of new spells  attracts Warlocks), the workshop (lets you build traps and doors  attracts Trolls), the Guard Room (acts a station for your creatures attracts Dark Elves), the Torture Chamber (extracts information or conversions from prisoners  attracts Dark Mistresses) and the Prison (lets you hold captured enemies for torture or death  creatures that die in the Prison come back as Skeletons under your control). Later in the game you'll get access to more advanced rooms that will also give you access to more advanced creatures. Examples include the Casino (either makes your creatures happier or earns you cash  attracts Rogues), the Graveyard (which attracts and feeds vampires) and the Combat Pit (helps your creatures gain experience  attracts Black Knights). Some creatures like the Salamander are attracted by the existence of special terrain types on the map (in this case lava), other creatures, like the Bile Demon, just show up after you've played for a while.  As with any good RTS, everything you build costs resources. In Dungeon Keeper there are only two resources that you have to keep your eye on, gold and mana. Gold has to be mined from special ore squares on the map. After your imps have mined an ore vein, they'll gather up the gold and take it to the nearest treasury. If you don't have a treasure, then you won't be able to get any credit for the gold that you've mined, so it's really important to take notice when your existing treasuries are getting full. Every now and then you'll be fortunate enough to find an gem square. These areas can be mined continually for gold and never disappear. If you find one, make damn sure that you protect it from anyone else who might be hanging about. Mana is a great deal simpler to keep up with  it just generates as time goes by. Each spell you cast will use up a certain amount though, so it's important to save up if you feel like you're about to lay down some serious hoodoo.  Most of the game is spent building, but when combat situations arise, you'll have to make sure that your creatures are in the right place to deal with them. To do this, all you have to do is use your hand icon to click on the critter in question and pick them up. When you've located the area that you want them to be (it must be on territory that you've already claimed) right click and they'll fall to the ground stunned. Once they get up, they'll fight with whatever creature is nearest to them. Some tasks will require a little bit more subtlety and this is where the possession spell comes into play. When you cast this simple spell, you'll be transported into the body of whichever monster you click on and you'll see the world around you through their eyes. In this mode, you can click on other creatures to get them to follow you and launch major assaults on your enemy in a more intelligent fashion than the basic ~run at foes screaming with bloodlust~ that occurs when you drop your creatures near a battle. It's also really cool to be able to see the dungeon you've spent the last few hours creating from a participant's view.  The first person view is particularly entertaining because the dungeons are looking really good this time around. Dungeon Keeper 2's graphics are truly amazing, with even mundane objects like walls and floors looking so good that you'll spend minutes looking at them. Everything in the game moves as you'd imagine it would, with traps emitting beautiful (but deadly) clouds of gas and eerie spirits of fear, monsters and cannons firing beautiful bursts of flame, and imps blurring by you as they cast haste spells to increase their efficiency. Although the third person view is where you'll do most of you gaming, it must be said that the first person view contains the most impressive visuals in the game. Each monster has its own view, based on its height, weapon type, and the type of eyes they have.  Dungeon Keeper 2's multiplayer is surprisingly playable and really brings out the personality of the people playing the game. Since there are so many different ways to go about your conquest (different monsters to lean on, different tactics to use in battle) each game you play will have its own special flavor. A further bonus comes in the ability to torture and imprison your buddy's favorite characters. I could hear Tal screaming at me from across the office.  The only real problem I had with Dungeon Keeper 2 was its lack of any new direction. While there's no doubt that Dungeon Keeper was a great game, I really expected a great deal more from the sequel than just a couple of new structures and monsters and a graphics update. Still, it must be said that the final product is one of the best games I've played in a long time. Maybe the next game will be the one to uncover new ground. If you like strategy games, or if you're an RPG fan looking for something a little bit different, I highly recommend this amazing game as your next purchase. Its well-crafted missions, balanced gameplay and addictive structure make it a real high-point in this year's release schedule.  -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Jul 10, 1999"}
