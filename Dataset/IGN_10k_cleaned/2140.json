The original Kessen was already a massive leap forward for the strategy masters at Koei -- after years of variations on the Nobunaga's Ambition and Romance of the Three Kingdoms theme, it was a sudden jump into an entirely new generation of 3D graphics and active, cinematic gameplay.  It's surprising, then, to see the sequel pushing even further away from the company's strategic roots, incorporating more cinematic elements, more real-time gameplay, and even a dose of hands-on action into the historical strategy framework.  It's a bit jarring, but then it's also good to see that Koei doesn't intend for the series to stand still.  It's interesting to wonder where it will go in the promised next installment, though.  Now that Kessen II has covered the Romance of the Three Kingdoms milieu (the fantastic version of third-century China portrayed in the famous historical novel and many Koei strategy games past), Koei will presumably go beyond its traditional stomping grounds in search of a new setting.  For now, though, it's the Three Kingdoms world that makes the game -- the new emphasis on powerful magic and the use of heroic characters is perfectly in keeping with the theme of the story.  It's an unusual synergy between presentation and gameplay, and it works to enhance what is already a solid strategy game.  Gameplay  Kessen, as you know if you played the first game (released here via EA), is Koei strategy for people who hate Koei strategy.  For fifteen years or more, the company's bread and butter has been complex historical strategy sims, heavy on the political and logistic elements to complement the business of actual conquest.  The Nobunaga's Ambition and Romance of the Three Kingdoms games were always excellent efforts, but their appeal gradually grew limited to a small audience of die-hard fans.  Old-school Koei strategy demands a serious commitment just to contemplate success -- winning those games is an effort requiring dozens of hours.  The Kessen series takes the historical setting of the classic games, pumps it up with a strong infusion of the fantastic, and strips down the gameplay into something a little more user-friendly.  Kessen II's character design is strongly reminiscent of Dynasty Warriors' glorious excess, and like the Kessen before it, all but the most rudimentary issues of logistics, politics, and government are long gone.  The spaces between battles are occupied with cinematic interludes and very simple options for army and officer development, while combat itself occurs in real time (albeit still on a massive scale -- no skirmishes here), and heavily emphasizes the involvement of individual personalities.  For example, you can now take direct control of an officer, running about Dynasty Warriors-style and whacking the enemy troops.  Certain special attacks (such as Raid) also now involve just a touch of twitchy control.  This isn't a major factor -- use of an officer in this way appears to only affect enemy morale, not their actual troop numbers -- but it's definitely a step in a more action-oriented direction.  The same goes for the introduction of magical attacks into the game, as befits the presence of characters like Zhuge Liang in the story.  More on that in a little bit.  The long and the short of it, meanwhile, is that this is another excellent effort at bringing the strategy genre kicking and screaming into the next generation.  Like Konami's Ring of Red (also a fine piece of work), Kessen integrates realtime elements into its combat without completely embracing the skirmishy Blizzard/Westwood style, and it manages to move far faster and more smoothly the RoR ever did.  The 3D terrain and individual troop representation do an excellent job of letting the player intuitively grasp terrain and positioning issues.  Of course, those who actually liked all the logistics and political skullduggery that got thrown out with the bathwater have our condolences, but there are plenty of games on the PC catering to more conservative tastes.  Graphics  Viewed up close, Kessen II looks substantially similar to its predecessor.  Just to get the issue out of the way quickly, the pre-rendered cutscenes are still flat-out gorgeous, Koei having somehow managed to build a first-rate team of 3D artists at the drop of a hat.  The realtime character models of troops and officers are comparable in terms of polygon and texture detail, and there hasn't been a substantial increase in background detail (which was one of the visual failings of the first game).  There are perhaps more troop types, and the new barbarian elephant cavalry look amazing (Whee!  Elephants!), but again, the details haven't improved considerably.  To see where Kessen II builds on the first game, you have to pull back and take the long view.  The number of troops shown at any given time has increased roughly five-fold, which is even more impressive considering the amount of direct control you have over units and officers at any given time (like officers, you can grab a single army or unit and move it around the battlefield with the analog stick, in case you don't feel like letting the AI take the shortest route between two points).  The framerate takes a hit now and again when the battlefield gets extremely chaotic, particularly in the aftermath of a magical attack, but by and large things move quite smoothly.  And as eye-candy goes, those magic strikes are worth the price.  They occur infrequently enough that they don't unbalance the battle unduly (particularly since battles may consist of three, four, or more separate engagements, while each side usually only has one magician), and they're certainly entertaining.  Along with the tornadoes and lightning strikes you may have already seen, there are meteor showers, ice storms, and a brilliant ~Fissure~ spell, which opens a giant crack in the earth to engulf the enemy.  Magic requires a certain amount of strategy to use, too, with varying area effects and friendly-fire considerations to ponder.  Sound  Kessen II retains the fine orchestral score of its predecessor.  When battles become genuinely fierce, with the troops on screen pushing the engine to its limits, the music grants the scene even more of that epic, Kurosawa feel -- the character design may tread a fine line between the fantastic and the genuinely silly (are the closeups on Mei Sanniang's cleavage entirely necessary?), but the soundtrack brings the game back into a more familiar concept.  It sounds Epic (yes, Epic with a capital ~E~), and so it feels Epic.  A crude way of expressing the feeling, but if you've seen something like Ran or Throne of Blood to compare the sensation to, perhaps you understand what I mean.  Again, however, the voice acting (which permeates the game, in both battles and cinematics) is a bit of a sticking point.  Kessen II's voice not quite so silly as the dubbing of English into the original Kessen's medieval Japanese setting, but it still inspires a few misgivings.  I don't necessarily regret the English dialogue out of typical fannish petulance (~Japanese is always better...war is peace...freedom is slavery...~), but because there were actors in the Japanese version that I'm genuinely fond of, and that I very much miss..  Makio Inoue, the voice of Captain Harlock.  CAPTAIN HARLOCK WAS IN THIS GAME, DAMMIT.  Not to mention Tooru Furuya, famous for the role of Amuro Rei (among many others), and Sumi Shimamoto, the title role of Miyazaki's Nausicaa.  In comparison, the English voice cast can't help but fall just a little bit flat, although those with even a mild tolerance for most US voice acting shouldn't mind the game at all.  Of course, maybe this is merely another form of typical fannish petulance, and I'm just moderately successful at fooling myself.  Eh, stick it.After all, even if you violently detest American voice acting, that should only be a minor obstacle to the enjoyment of a fine console strategy game.  Kessen II builds on its predecessor by bringing the player even closer to the action, and it also manages to do something about Kessen's minor difficulties in the replay value department -- there are now more options between missions, more total playtime, and as before you can fight through a second campaign once the first is complete.Chalk up another success for Koei's big next-generation gamble, then, and let the betting begin on what theme Kessen III will embrace.  More Nobunaga's Ambition, or something entirely new?  We'll see soon enough.", "date": "Oct 2, 2001"}
