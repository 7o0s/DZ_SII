The team at High Voltage put together a solid basketball engine that's simple enough for casual fans to appreciate and intricate enough for more serious hoopheads to enjoy for hours on end.   When it comes to creating an NBA game, developers are better off taking the same approach college basketball teams emphasize in their quest for success: basic fundamentals. Fundamentals in videogame terms means a nice mix where the pacing of the game, the animation and the basketball physics all come together for a clean consistent feeling. Inside Drive has a few issues but only a few of them are related to the gameplay and control.  The Features:   All the players, teams, and stadiums of the NBA  Real-time coaching changes stradegy on the fly  Draft fantasy teams, trade and sign players as the GM  Assemble your own playbook from over two dozen plays  Rasheed Wallace looks cool in this game  Gameplay You can't turbo to the rim whenever you want and throw down a dunk in Inside Drive and this is a good thing. If you're not a basketball coach and can't get into the nuances of the triangle offense, you can still play an easy, but believable game of NBA basketball. Teammates cut and call for the ball even if you don't know what you're doing. All the novice player has to do is know where the pass button is and he or she will get some open shots. Leaving all of the coaching options on Auto will free your mind so you can get creative taking Vince Carter to the hole. But if you like to get your Phil Jackson on, ID's got the goods for you.  Play calling on the fly using the D-pad is nice but nothing really new. What is new is that you can also control your team's defensive pressure and offensive philosophy on the fly using the D-pad. That is, you can call for your team to play tighter man to man defense with two presses on the D-pad. All of the coaching options can be accessed from the pause menu and allow you to set up everything from the tempo of the game to how you want your players to guard individual opponents. You can have your point guard always force his man to his weaker dribbling hand or have your center always take away the baseline when defending the low post. The real magic is that you will notice all of your coaching moves during the run of the game. If you have your team playing full court man-to-man the entire game, they'll be dog tired within minutes and they'll start giving up all kinds of dunks and layups. This is the kind of stuff NBA coaches have to consider in their games and Inside Drive does a fine job of making you feel like a young Pat Riley.   But it's what happens when you're running the team on the floor that'll make you want to lace up the sneakers. The animation and speed of the game create a certain kind of flow to Inside Drive that you will instantly feel. The controls instantly become second nature with X used as your shoot/jump button, A as your pass/switch player button and B as your hand check/ball fake/spin move button. The white button is your call-for-screen button, the right trigger is your turbo and left trigger is your guard/protect the ball button. The trick is knowing what each button is going to do in different situations. When you hit pass, the guy with the ball is going to fire a chest pass, a lob or take step and bounce pass it to his teammate. You have to know that he's going to throw a chest pass in traffic so you better make sure you time it correctly, otherwise it's a sure turnover. When calling for a screen you have to know that it's not just going to bring the closest player, but the guy who has the best chance of running the play with you.   The shoot button takes momentum into account, but it's not on the same level of precision as Sega's NBA 2K series. Many times I thought I was going fast enough with enough clear space to have my guy go up for a dunk but instead he'll pull up for a leaning jumper. Thankfully the shot percentage on these leaning jumpers is legitimate. You've still beaten your man and have a clear look at the basket, so it should be a high percentage shot. But for the most part Inside Drive is very fair with the whole dunk/jumper balance because it does factor in the player's momentum and individual ratings. You'll get used to how the game thinks within two or three games.  Passing has to be done with precision. The system is intuitive up to a certain point, but there are still too many instances when you'll miss a wide open player for no good reason. No hoop game has mastered this and Inside Drive is no different. You can use icon passing but toggling it off and on all the time is just an extra step you don't need in your offense. The passing game will frustrate you the most when you're trying to hit a cutting teammate, especially if you're trying to manually work a pick and roll. You'll see your guy slashing down the lane, calling for the ball and you hit the stick in his direction and press pass only to see the ball go flying towards another teammate in the corner behind him. The solution is to make sure you're pressing the analog stick in a direction so that there's no mistaking who you're passing the ball too. You end up leading your guy which is better anyway. Otherwise, the pass to the teammate in the corner stands a good chance of being picked off.  Inside Drive will intercept your passes with ease too. Too many careless, low angled chest passes by sloppy post players will be ripped out of the air and taken the other way. This is part of the game's stellar A.I. They sag into passing lanes and try to limit what you want to do on while on offense. They have a strategy and they stick to it until you beat it. They'll double team hot shooters and pressure crappy ball handlers. The A.I. keeps it up on the offensive end as well. The CPU will keep feeding the ball to a hot shooter until his arm falls off or you do something about it. In one game against a bunch of All-Stars, the CPU shut down my low post game with Tim Duncan and kept feeding a red hot Glen Rice during a ferocious third quarter comeback that saw Glen Score 25 of his game high 36 points. It should be noted that all of these opinions are based on the Veteran and All Pro difficulty settings. The easy setting is so basic it pretty much doesn't count.  The biggest omission in Inside Drive 2002 is the depth of features. You get an exhibition mode, a playoff mode and a season mode. That's it, end of story. No dynasty building, create-a-player or fantasy teams of any kind. You can trade and sign players during season mode, but there's no compulsion to be smart about it because you're not building a team to last and there's no salary cap or anything. You're only limited by roster space. The list of free agent players is quite impressive with all kinds of former All-Stars represented. Putting Chris Mullin back on the Warriors or Loy Vaught back on the Clippers is good for some nostalgia. The game is good enough so that you end up missing those added features that would've given you more lasting appeal.  Graphics The players in Inside Drive are the NBA equivalent of the players in NFL Fever 2002. Marvelously detailed right down to the tattoos, headbands and shoes. Players look like themselves so that Sam Cassell has that giant alien-egg shape to his head and Rasheed Wallace has a perpetual scowl on his mug. They're all recognizable with a little facial animation thrown in here and there. The uniforms are spot on just like everything else.  The default camera settings are far enough way to show you all of the action but this makes it hard to appreciate the level of detail on the players and uniforms. You can move the cameras and control the presentation of the game so that you get more replays and cutaways to player reactions. This is highly recommended so you can appreciate the player models.  The animation is outstanding. Players carry themselves realistically so that they seem to have weight but they're only a step away from leaping in the air for a dunk. On bounce passes you can see guys take a step to create space and then fire the ball to a waiting teammate. Creative players will have all kinds of elaborate moves to the basket that you'll recognize from ESPN highlight reels. Coverboy Vince Carter has a full arsenal of unbelievable moves that'll leave you with your jaw on the floor. One of the most impressive moves I saw was from Tyronn Lue when he had a breakaway layup and he double clutched the ball in the air so that he could scoop his layup around the rim and protect it from the defender. That's playground stuff you just have to know how to do. It can't be coached.  Sound The commentary does a great job of making you think it's real, but there are some parts where it all comes to a crashing halt because the guys come to a proper name and there are just too many variables. It's sort of like one of those form letters where your name is a bigger and different font size than the rest of the letter. ~What an outstanding game by......NICK VAN exEL....he was on fire tonight, Marques!~  The pause between ~by~ and ~nick~ is a good half second, just enough to remind you that it's not real. Kevin Colabro and Marques Johnson do a decent job interacting with each other even stepping on each other's lines sometimes. But their lines get stale very quickly and Marques Johnson just says some very silly things.   The sound effects are fairly subtle but they're all well done. Clanking rims and bouncing balls all sound appropriate as does the public address announcer. The crowd is the real story when it comes to background sound effects. They're very educated and know when to cheer and when to keep quiet. They'll keep a good roar going for the home team if they're mounting a sustained comeback but they'll also fade into a medium but consistent cheer if the home team is up and has been leading the entire game. They explode with enthusiasm with great timing.   The menu music features original hip hop songs in the same vein as the tunes heard in EA's NBA Live series.   Inside Drive instantly impressed me with it's visuals but this only made me want to get into the gameplay that much deeper to see if this game was all beauty and no brains. I was pleasantly surprised at how well Inside Drive played basketball and the authenticity of the coaching options and implementation was very impressive. It's easily better than NBA Live 2002 for the Xbox and it should be very competitive with NBA 2K2. That's not bad for a first generation Xbox game going up against a port of the established standard for basketball videogames. The biggest knock against Inside Drive is its lack of additional features and game modes. I understand wanting to quickly deliver a solid game that's also easily accessible. High Voltage has done just that. But the fact that Inside Drive is fun only made me want more ways to enjoy the", "date": "Jan 25, 2002"}
