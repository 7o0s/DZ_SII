While that fine establishment's selection was mostly of the driving and shooting variety, she managed to find the fighters section and moseyed on over to a machine I hadn't seen before. Yes I know, I must have been caught under a rock somewhere, because up until that point, I had never laid eyes on Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes before. I sat there mesmerized, not only by the hotness playing the coin-up, but the insane action taking place onscreen.   Anxious to try my hand (and impress the girl with my profound fighting skills), I popped my two quarters into the cabinet and took my stance. This WAS a Street Fighter clone after all! A game that I had spent years and years mastering with friends, relatives, and any Tom, Dick, and Ken I could find at the local arcade. The only difference here, I thought, is that I pick two characters to tag-team instead of one, right? So, it was just as I prepared to show my future sweetie what I was made of, that she handed me the beating of my life, and effectively kicked my ass in less than 15 seconds.   Hulk lets Dunham Smash! What happened? I was the Street Fighter sensei damn it! My Ryu and Chun Li (in her appropriate blue togs) couldn't possibly have fallen to Morrigan and a sissy-pink Chun Li counterpart... could they? As I sat back and watched her systematically destroy the CPU opponents, I began to understand why I had been scrubbed like the bathroom floor. Capcom fighting engine or not, this was NOT Street Fighter. While a lot of the game's moves and two-in-one executions were similar, the method of attack, and possible combinations you could pull off were distinctly different. The more I became familiar with MvC, the more I began to appreciate it for what it is, and the more I was interested.   Flash forward to almost two years later. With the release of both the Japanese and American Dreamcast versions of Marvel vs. Capcom a done deal, my chance to play my woman in an attempt for redemption has finally arrived! And to my merry delight, I can have my chance in the most arcade-perfect rendition of a Capcom game there has ever been (Or at least, as perfect as it can be until Street Fighter Alpha 3 hits the states).   That's right. I can throw together as many Dragon Renders, Surge Fists, and Flower Bundle Bombs as I want in full coin-op glory! And I can do it all with no slow down or missing frames of animation faster than you can say ~Shinkuu Tatsumaki Senpuu Kyakuu~. Everything from the music to the selection screen to the control layout is identical to the stand-up version. If you loved it before, get ready to fall in love all over again.   Before I go any further though, let me provide a warning: Under no circumstances should you play this game with anything but an arcade stick. Use the AgeTec or Interact Alloy sticks if you can, but please don't try it with the default controller. As comfortable as SEGA's official pad is, it is a definite no-no for fighters. Especially for Marvel vs. Capcom. Some of the more spectacular moves are damn nigh impossible to pull off without the proper equipment. Invest in a stick now (or at least one of those Quantum Fighter Pads) and you'll thank your local shopkeeper a million times over. Now that I have done my duty and given you fair warning, I can tell you all about the 2D goodness found within.   First to be mentioned has to be MvC's animation. There are buckets of it. Everything from the way Venom moves his tongue to Gambit's trench coat blowing in the wind is done with such precision, that feasting your eyes upon it is more like experiencing a Saturday morning cartoon than a videogame. At even the most frantic moments of combo-madness, the backgrounds and characters move just as fluidly as they did before the insanity began. In fact, it's so visually orgasmic that I couldn't help but smile and smile big whenever something cool happened. 32-Bit systems can't do this stuff folks.   Next on the honorary list is the helper system. While quite a few critics out there aren't very fond of this feature, I am. In a unique twist on the traditional team fighting mold, you are allowed a random (or not so random, if you know what you're doing) helper to pop in to give you a hand in hairy situations. While they have only one move each, these helpers can be a surprise for your opponent if you under-use them. Just wait a bit and throw one at your foe in the middle of a match for some great ~ARGH!~ reactions. While it's true that some of them are close to useless (Devilot, Toon-Pooh), others are quite effective (Colossus, Juggernaut) and can mean the difference between getting your butt handed to you or grabbing a distinct advantage. Plus, it's a clever way to incorporate characters from the world of Capcom and Marvel that didn't make the cut for playable status.   Speaking of playable characters, the ones used in MvC are very effective. Running the gamut of both the Marvel and the Capcom universes, major stars from each such as Mega Man and Captain America make up the award-winning roster. And, unlike another Dreamcast games that shall remain nameless (hint: it rhymes with Portal Wombat Mold), each character is for the most part very different. While some share similar motions and special moves, each fighter has a different level of effectiveness depending on where you are on the screen, who you are using, and which action button you press. Although the control is floatier than most Capcom offerings (meaning, slight directional button presses will send you leaping far into the air to fall into somewhat of a hover on the way down), it is for the most part very familiar and easy to use. Beginners and Veterans alike should be able to jump right into the game, and find a character just for them. Whether it be the accepted cheese-balls Strider and Wolverine, to the overgrown oafs that are Zangief and Hulk.   Key to the ~vs.~ series, and this game in particular, are the flashy combos. Typically, winning the game isn't the goal; it's winning it in style that truly counts. While anyone can sit back and block most of the match and tip-tap away at their opponent, it's the ability to use the famous combinations to your advantage that makes you a good player. 30-40 hit combos are entirely possible and can be achieved with basic fireball and dragon punch movements. In fact, some of these maneuvers have such spectacular imagery that they need to be seen to be believed. From Wolverine's Weapon X super finish, to the Maximum Spider from everyone's favorite Web-head, there should be enough ~ooh~ and ~ahh~ fuel to keep you playing for hours. Additionally, you can even pull off Crossover moves which are even more amazing than the regular ending maneuvers too. In a Crossover attack, both tag partners jump onscreen and proceed to beat the hell out of whatever gets in their way. Although this uses up your 3-level combo bar pretty quickly, it's super effective and super cool. Try these for maximum flash effect.   With all this great action, Capcom could have rested on its laurels and done an exact port, calling it a successful day. But wait, there's more! Besides the basic Arcade option, you can also choose a few other modes as well. Practice mode lets you do just that; Practice. Play all day long if you want, and never die. Keep working on those 40-hit combinations and maybe you'll have what it takes to whip a master player. My only complaint for this mode, though, is that there isn't any kind of onscreen guide to teach you how to do anything, and it leaves true beginners out in Newbie Flats. Unfortunately, most people don't read their manuals and with every other fighting game out there offering helpful interactive move lists, it baffles me as to why this wasn't included.   Also thrown in there for the hell of it is Survival Mode. Just like Street Fighter Alpha 3's mode of the same name, your mission is to whip a slew of opponents one after the other, with the same power bar until you have taken out everyone. It's nothing spectacular but it is a good way to pass the time if you get tired of the other options. Oh, and of course, there is a Versus Mode to take a pal to school with, which is always a must in today's fighting market.   The most exciting inclusion by way of options, however, has to be the Cross Fever mode. With this interesting feature, you and three friends and can team up and go two-on-two against each other. That way, when you tag in a member of your team, they have complete control for a true tag-team action. Too bad there wasn't a free-for-all selection though. It would have been nice to have a four-person melee with only one winner. It could have been intense. What you get is still cool though.Taking everything into consideration, Marvel vs. Capcom is an excellent post-launch purchase. With the mini-glut of fighting titles available for the system by the end of October, this is definitely one of your better choices, if not the best. It's certainly the best 2D title on the system until Street Fighter Alpha 3 rolls into town, so don't pass this one up.", "date": "Oct 8, 1999"}
