In Madden NFL 2001, NHL 2001 and SSX, it put out three of the best games that were available at the system's launch and the company followed this by releasing one of the best soccer games ever with FIFA 2001 Major League Soccer. Unfortunately, NBA Live 2001 isn't quite on the same level of those aforementioned titles.   While Live 2001 is far from a horrible game, as it's a solid first effort by EA Sports in the basketball genre on PS2, Live 2001 just doesn't quite reach the same quality level that has been achieved in other sports genres like football, hockey and soccer. Likewise, Live 2001 is missing some elements that were prominently featured in the previously released PlayStation version of the game, such as the NBA Challenges.   Gameplay The most notable thing missing from NBA Live 2001, which wasn't in the PlayStation version either, is the all-important franchise mode. For sports gamers, a deep franchise mode can make a game's replay value almost unlimited and not having one in Live 2001 on PS2 is a major disappointment. And if that's not enough, Live 2001 is also completely devoid of some other features that have become the norm in EA Sports' other games, such as the aforementioned challenges and the adjustable sliders for customizing things like the speed of the game or the intelligence of the computer-controlled athletes.    Additionally, the game is plagued by some small AI and gameplay problems that aren't necessarily significant when taken singularly but can drastically hinder the overall charm of the game when you add them all up. For one, the player control seems to be less in the hands of the user than what is generally preferred. While the game does make excellent use of the pressure sensitive buttons and analog sticks of the Dual Shock 2 controller and player control is generally tight and responsive, there are way too many moments in the game where the user is nothing but a spectator.   This happens most often in cases where something like a drop step or spin move is performed, but also occurs in other instances where the animation routine is overly long and locks you into a movement. The problem with this is that it can sometimes take you out of bounds unwillingly and it makes it impossible to do something things that should be possible like doing a quick drop step to get around a defender followed by a quick jump shot. And while it's understandable that you shouldn't allow the player to do some moves in the middle of a spin or crossover, you're often stuck in the animation for one or two steps after the particular move has been performed.   Live 2001 also suffers from a variety of little issues that have seemingly plagued just about every hoops videogame since the dawn of time. Computer-controlled teammates do a horrible job of boxing out, so there's an obnoxiously high number of offensive rebounds for the CPU, and regardless of the difficulty setting, you can't rely on teammates to help out with covering guys taking it to the hoop. All players also have the standard force field around them, so it's possible to stop penetration or draw a charge by simply having a hand in the way of the ball handler.   Player movement without the ball is generally nice, but they'll sometimes get stuck in an animation and will just keep repeating the same movement, which is especially entertaining when he happens to be the guy with the ball and sits there spinning in a circle while the shot clock expires.   Another problem that some people might have with the game is that the camera angles could use a little tweaking. The default settings are much too close to the action and are pretty much unplayable and even when you zoom the camera out, you're never really given a completely satisfying look at the court.   Despite these problems, NBA Live 2001 is still a solid basketball videogame and is one of the best that'll you'll likely find on any console. Most of the AI issues in the game are evident in just about every other basketball game released in over the past few years. And the frequency of things like blocked shots and steals, while still high, are a little closer to reality than what you get in games put out by the competition this year. Live 2001 also features some of the most advanced ball physics yet implemented in a basketball videogame, so the variety of missed shots that one will encounter through the course of a game will be more diverse than what you're typically given. And this is one of the few basketball titles where more rebounds are actually taken in the air and not off of the ground.    Plus, for those looking for a change of pace, the game's 1-on-1 play mode is quite entertaining when playing either solo or against a friend. In fact, there'll be a lot of players that will find that they have a lot more fun playing this mode over the regular 5-on-5 game.   Graphics The ~hit or miss~ trend that we saw in the gameplay department is also apparent when looking at the game's visuals. In some areas, this appears to be the most graphically impressive basketball game ever created, while in others it seems to be a step or two behind Sega's NBA 2K1 for Dreamcast.   For instance, the player models are much more detailed and accurately modeled than we've ever seen before in a basketball videogame. Unlike Sega's NBA 2K1, which featured players that looked like what you'd get if all the players in the NBA started using steroids and began bodybuilding, the general player models in Live 2001 are a bit more authentic in body shape, size and look.   The problem here is that the faithfulness of the models are tarnished by horrible face and head textures that sometimes look nothing like the intended NBA basketball player. Shaq appears to have some sort of skin disease by on his head, Larry Bird looks nothing like he does in real life, and while some of the hair styles look good, such as Allen Iverson's cornrows, most just look ridiculous.   This peculiar mixture of both good and bad can also be seen in the game's player animations. In some cases, you'll be hard-pressed to find another basketball game around that moves this realistically. The animation for jump shots, fadeaways, leaners, drop steps, lay-ups, and dunks can almost pass for the real thing. There are also plenty of nice little animation touches that can be seen when players reach out for errant passes and get realistically bumped backwards by a bigger player posting him up. And there's realistic net and rim movement.    On the other hand, the general movement of the players on court isn't in the same league. General player movement is a bit rigid in appearance, there's a lot of issues to be worked out with transitional animations, and there seems to be a lot of little glitches in the animation routines as players will often be seen shaking uncontrollably as if they've gone into some kind of minor seizure. And unlike NBA2K1 and 989 Sports' two basketball efforts, Live 2001 lacks polygonal referees and coaches. It's a pretty package overall, but has a lot of little problems.    Sound Of all the areas of the game, the sound is the only one that is consistently good all the way through. Bob Elliott's in-depth play-analysis is backed up by Don Poier's outstanding play-by-play of the game. While there are times that the announcers will get somewhat repetitive and will be late with their descriptions of what just happened on screen, the general commentary is very deep and varied and typically in tune with the on court action.   As for the game's music, EA Sports has done a splendid job of putting together a very befitting hip-hop soundtrack and the game's opening by Montell Jordan is tremendously catchy and entertaining. The sound effects used in the game are also good, as the sounds of the ball hitting the rim, backboard or bouncing off the court are realistic and the crowd noises really fit well with what's going on in the game. I've been a sports fan and sports gamer for more than 20 years and have watched just about every single Super Bowl, NBA finals, and World Series since 1980, with the only notable exception being Super Bowl XVII, which saw the Washington Redskins beat my Miami Dolphins 27-17 while I was in the hospital having my appendix removed. My gaming history goes back almost as far with my first memory of sports gaming being on the Atari 2600 and various primitive handheld devices. Partly because of this background, I'm sometimes more cynical about sports videogames than I am with other genres that also hold close to my heart. Keeping this in mind, in my very humble and cynical opinion, there wasn't a single basketball or baseball game released on the PlayStation that truly captured the essence of either sport. And having played final copies NCAA Final Four 2001 and this game, NBA Live 2001, plus a preview build of NBA ShootOut 2001, I can openly declare that in my humble and cynical opinion that there's not yet a PlayStation 2 basketball game that truly captures the essence of the real sport. With that out of the way, I do realize that the NBA Live series has developed a strong following of supporters who have been enamored by its gameplay and attention to detail. And for those people, they'll likely enjoy NBA Live 2001 as the best basketball videogame on PlayStation 2 and one of the best that the series has ever seen. Because of the game's lack of NBA Challenges and stuff like a 3-point shootout, it's conceivable that one could find more enjoyment and get more play value out of the PlayStation version. However, I'm sure that most players will find that the improved framerate and monumental step up in the area of visuals to be reason enough to play this Live over any other version.", "date": "Jan 24, 2001"}
