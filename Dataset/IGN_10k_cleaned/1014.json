French crazes, however, range from the dizzy heights of the international success story that is Asterix, to the depths of certain culinary dishes best left to the imagination. TV licenses are also famed for being, well, unoriginal at best.  On the other hand, a rule nowadays just doesn't seem to be rule without its exceptions. Is this destined to be one of them? Read on...  Features: Twenty-one levels UBI Key compatible - other Ubi Soft games can be used to unlock a secret level, via the IR link. Two playable characters, each with slightly different adventures Password save. Only for Game Boy Color   They say that first impressions are everything. Fortunately this is not the case, or my annoyance-meter would never have lasted past the typing error on the intro sequence. Surely Ubi Soft can afford proofreaders?  You'll soon realise that such mistakes are atypical, the presentation generally flawless. The plot deviates slightly from standard platform fare, concerning an Egyptian curse that must be broken by Papyrus, a simple fisherman, to free the Pharaohs and bring order to the land, conveyed via colourful cut-scenes. The themes and settings are fresh, immediately making the game more interesting than the majority of the competition.  During the adventure, you'll visit such Egyptian landmarks as the Nile, the desert and the ancient temples.  The structure is more similar to old-fashion platformers than to most of the recent releases - the aim is simply to get from the entrance of the level to the exit. Each stage is large, with plenty of room for exploration; but on the whole, there are no side-quests to get lost in or items to search for. This keeps the gameplay simple but highly enjoyable, the stages littered with classic platform obstacles that sometimes genuinely challenge. Your character can jump, attack, climb and hang from vines and crevices - most of the time, the game plays like a scrolling Prince of Persia. It never attempts to evolve the genre in the way that the Wario Land games have, but it refuses to let this be a problem: within this confine, it works quite magnificently.  The sense of fun is heightened by the incredible graphics. Each level has its own look, the backgrounds wonderfully sharp and the many textures some of the most vivid I've seen, making Egypt come alive in style. There's no repetition or dullness present, here. The sprites are clear and excellently animated, full of little details, such as the way the characters' hair blows behind them as they run, and how they hold their weapons between their teeth when climbing. Variety is also the dominant theme musically, a different melody for each stage, all of them tremendously atmosphere and Egyptian. When combined with fluid, responsive controls, the game becomes a sheer joy to play in a way that few modern platformers are.   Whilst the game isn't exactly difficult, there are twenty-one levels and seven boss battles, which together provide quite a challenge. The lifespan is prolonged further by the introduction of a second playable character, a Princess called Theti whom you rescue at the end of the third level: rather than simply being a different sprite, she actually has a personality of her own, with several slight variations in her adventure. Whether it makes the game worth playing again, however, depends solely on your enjoyment the first time through. There's also the now-standard Ubi Key feature, granting access to a secret level, which I'll be able to review as soon as Craig sends me the vital second GBC [ed. note: Thought you could sneak that in, eh, Tim? -- Craig]  Basically, Papyrus is a very good game - yet... yet... something is definitely missing. Certainly, there are no features that make this game unique - you're bound to have many like it in your collection already, and apart from the presentation, there's simply nothing new. It's pretty much the definition of 'generic' - and it's about time the console is taken in new directions, I feel: Nintendo themselves advance the genre considerably in Wario Land III. If, however, you bought your GBC for the endless supply of traditional platformers, add a point or two to my rating, for I urge you to give this one a go. It is, after all, incredibly stylish, and a far better prospect that most of the alternatives.     It's a shame to deduct marks for lack of originality, as what this game does include is executed extremely well. Unfortunately, though, you cannot get away from the fact that removing the pretty graphics leaves what is basically just another platformer, treading the same old ground and doing little new. It does, however, stick rigidly to the well-established formula - unlike other, lesser titles, which attempt to add innovation and fail miserably - producing a game that is great fun. That it easily achieves its own low goals is perhaps the kindest thing I can say.Note: Papyrus is only available in Europe. There are no current plans to bring the game to the US.
