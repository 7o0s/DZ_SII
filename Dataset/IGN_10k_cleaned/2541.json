The gameplay model is simple, time-tested, and has more than enough fans to make for a successful game, after all -- just mix that with some cute character designs, stir in plenty of unlockable odds and ends, top with the requisite multiplayer options, and you have a product that will sell and sell well.  And there is nothing wrong with that, as far as it goes.  The question with Hot Shots at this point is whether it's going all that far.  Most years, this question would not come up at all, given that video golf gameplay has remained roughly constant for around two decades.  Hot Shots 3 happens to be following the excellent Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2002 this year, though, which continues to establish its analog swing system as a superior innovation in golf gameplay.  In comparison, the tap-tap-tap system employed in Hot Shots can't help but feel a little bit tired.  It works, but there are far more possibilities to the PS2 control interface that could be make golf gameplay fresher, more intuitive, and more fun.  Which are you going to get?  It's also worth noting that SCEA has done a job on the Hot Shots character designs for a second game running.  Whether this is good or bad is entirely up to your personal tastes, but be advised that the big-eyed cuties of the Japanese version have been replaced (to pull out a few examples) by hairy, pot-bellied veterans, at least one hulking Afro-packing housewife, and a surprising likeness of former MTV veejay Kennedy.  If that floats your boat, well, set sail.  Otherwise, prepare to be rubbed the wrong way a bit.  Of course, this probably all sounds like quibbling to most.  Hot Shots delivers the gameplay that made its predecessors a success with more than enough options to come back to and a great new 3D engine to power it all.  In truth, it does everything a golf game needs to do to be worth your money.  It could do more, but...eh, heck with it.  Gameplay  In Japan, this game is called ~Minna no Golf~ -- Everybody's Golf.  The idea is to create a simple, accessible golf game with an engaging personality, and developer Clap Hanz (who took over from series originator Camelot after Hot Shots 1) has that formula down.  The swing is controlled with the familiar three-tap accuracy bar, a challenge of simple button timing to peg the appropriate swing strength and aim.  Poor timing is punished with bad distance and the occasional nasty slice, while those who perfect their grasp of the system can learn to precisely drop a ball where they want to.  Adding spin is accomplished by tapping D-pad motions during the automatic backswing, and while it's not necessary for success, it's a useful advanced skill.  Putting employs the same system, assisted by the traditional grid indicating the slope of the greens.  The putting game is where the tried and true steals a march on the new Tiger Woods system -- EA's game has the very accurate caddy readings to aid putting, but it doesn't offer as much information for reading the greens on your own as Hot Shots does.  It takes more time to get the hang of how much distance is needed to correct for a slope, but the sense of accomplishment is greater after landing a long, difficult putt.  Hot Shots also wins with its abundance of extra modes and unlockable features.  The excellent 3D interface gradually opens up to reveal seven tiers of competition, with equipment, caddies, golfers, courses, and bonus items to dig up throughout.  Characters are unlocked through one-on-one versus competition, which has been updated with a handy mercy rule -- get four holes up on your opponent and you win without having to bother with the rest of the round.  It takes a while to rack up enough points to start going nuts in the pro shop (where items like interface wallpapers can be bought along with genuinely useful gameplay upgrades are available), but the number of features for sale eventually becomes considerable.  If it comes down to a choice between this and Tiger Woods, though, it's still very close.  Tiger's career mode is still extremely deep, it throws in the Speed Golf extra mode for multiplayer, and its swing system is a breath of fresh air on the fairways.  Perhaps it will come down to a choice between which presentation you prefer -- the realistic, licensed look, or Hot Shots' cartoon style.  Either of them are put together very well, though.     Graphics  The cartoonish, slightly superdeformed Hot Shots characters work perfectly in 3D, especially on top of the sharply drawn backgrounds.  Hot Shots 3 doesn't feature anything very intense as far as texture or model detail goes, but it has a clean, consistent style carried off by bright colors and distinct variety in the course design.  There are plenty of different types of trees, grass, background architecture, and the like -- watch for the occasional giant Buddha statue -- all with a matching level of detail.  The camera direction shows off the environments with an understated flair.  Every so often, you get one of those keen closeups of the ball in flight, or a neat rainbow trail accent, but Hot Shots doesn't overuse flashy touches like that.  They're not necessary, after all, and they feel more special when they don't appear so often.  When the programmers feel like showing off, they do have their opportunities, especially when it comes to water effects, and how time of day and weather give rise to subtle changes in the lighting of environments.  Sunny days light the courses brightly and throw the usual lens flare effect into high arcing shots, while evenings and cloud cover darken the scenery a bit.  It's possible to pick on the details of Hot Shots' visuals, but the complete package is an excellent piece of work.  Well, speaking of something to pick on...okay, I'll up and say it.    I AM BIASED  I hate these characters.  Mel was bad in Hot Shots 2, but the hairy redneck dude with his gut hanging over his belt who constantly scratches himself when he appears in the menu interface needs to go, yesterday.  Ditto the dopey alterna-rock chick in the fishnets, and God save me from the buck-toothed stuttering physics nerd who proclaims each drive ~an excellent vector.~  They took away Nanako for this?  They tossed the cute caddy with the pigtails for this?  Why?  Why?  The animation is just fine, bringing out the personalities of the characters perfectly well (and watching the caddies run like crazy for a ball is hilarious), but why do the designs have to be so cursed ugly sometimes?  END BIAS ZONE  Meanwhile, if you don't mind the character designs, go forth and sin no more.  Sound  On a note related to the character design issue, the voice clips are about an evenly mixed bag -- some of them are funny, some of them grate.  Eventually you'll have heard them enough that you ignore them either way, since likable or not they're all thoroughly innocuous.  That describes the philosophy behind Hot Shots' entire audio component.  It's like easy-listening music, the sort of thing that's intended to be there without anyone noticing it.  Unless you happen to be astute enough to peg the curious kinship between the menu soundtrack and what you hear during the same sections of Pilotwings 64, very little of the Hot Shots soundtrack should raise any reaction at all.Bias in the comments, or no bias?  Decisions...No bias.  The point is probably made, anyway.Unless you have a fetish for the Japanese character designs, there's very little to complain about in Hot Shots Golf 3.  This is a well-designed, slickly-produced golf game for the masses, with a reliable game system and visuals that deliver the goods.  Clap Hanz and SCEA can hardly be faulted for sticking to a formula when it happens to be a formula that works so well.Even so, it couldn't hurt to update this game system when time comes for a fourth Everyone's Golf.  With the series successfully brought into the world of 3D, the developers should have enough time in the off-season to experiment with some new ideas.  And SCEA could maybe contemplate whether the fat redneck dude was such a good idea...sorry, couldn't help myself.", "date": "Mar 8, 2002"}
