The finale of the series, MGS4 promises to tie up the loose ends that span the twenty year franchise. But what if you are brand new to the franchise, or need something to tide you over until summertime comes around?  Fortunately, you're in luck, as Konami has just released Metal Gear Solid: The Essential Collection.  While it's a great compilation of the series over the past decade, some decisions made on the part of the original Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid 3 hamper just how incredible this set actually is.   The original Metal Gear Solid (original review) was released in a dual CD case in 1998 on the trademark PSOne ~black discs.~  In The Essential Collection, this title has been transferred to a standard PS2 DVD case that holds both discs of the game.  However, Konami instead of transferring the game to the PS2 DVD format, the company managed to re-release the title in its original PSOne format.  That's pretty cool, especially since those discs haven't been made for quite some time.  The original Metal Gear Solid includes a briefing mode that introduces the action before Snake's mission on Shadow Moses starts, previous operations info that sums up the events of Metal Gear 1 and 2, and VR Training missions.    The three adventures of Snake in one sweet collection. There is, however, one significant downside to this re-released setup, which relates to the save mechanic.  The title only recognizes original PSOne Memory Cards to save your progress; no changes have been made to recognize the PS2 Memory cards in any way, so unless you can track down one of those old cards for a PS2, or you create a memory card on your PS3, you won't be able to save at all.  Were this collection held on a single Blu-ray, this would make sense, but since everything is essentially aimed for a PS2 audience, this seems flawed.      Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (original review) was released on the PS2 in 2001, and was the first title in the series on the console.  Instead of including the original game, The Essential Collection adds MGS2: Substance (original review), which was released in 2003 and hosted a lot of additional features.  These include the more than 200 VR missions that were scattered through four different gameplay modes, as well as alternate missions.  Apart from these additional exercises, players can check out the Snake Tales, which provide five additional stories for Snake to explore, as well as unlockable characters and Skateboarding. That adds a ton of replayability to a great game, and getting access to the ~Director's Cut~ of MGS2 is an excellent addition for The Essential Collection.   Unfortunately, Subsistence doesn't really show off how great it is. Unfortunately, the same can't be said about the final disc in the set.  Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater (original review) was released in 2004, and was set earlier than the previous games in the series.  Relying more on natural camouflage to help Snake in his missions, Snake Eater shifted the sneaking mechanics for the franchise.  The re-release in 2006, Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence (original review), added a much improved 3rd person camera, as well as a lot of additional features on a second disc.  While The Essential Collection includes MGS3: Subsistence, it only includes Disc 1 of the remake.  That means that while players will receive the new camera viewpoint, all of the extras on the second disc have been lost.  That means that items such as the multiplayer mode, Duel Mode, Demo Theater, and original Metal Gear games have been excluded from this collection, which is unfortunate. There were hours of additional content thrown into the second disc of Subsistence, which would be great for fans.  While it makes sense to remove some features, such as the multiplayer since the service is no longer supported, the other items could've been republished for relatively little cost.If you haven't checked out any of the Metal Gear Solid titles before, and are slightly curious about the franchise before the final chapter is released on June 12th, The Essential Collection is a great way to quickly catch up on what you've missed.  For thirty dollars, you're receiving three classic action titles, which is a great value. However, if you have played or own the previous titles (especially the two remakes on the PS2), you might be hard pressed to justify why you need to run out and collect this set.", "date": "Mar 19, 2008"}
