Britney's whole appeal  it's very, very, very v it'sual, very v it'sceral, usually colored by flashes of red, some wild, fleshy curves, and a quick flip of the hair. She's young, hot, and sexy, all right. There are no two ways about that. But like I was saying, it doesn't make for too much long-term substance.But hey, that's just my humble opinion. Apparently, the rest of the world  it's in love (or in lust) with her, so I must pick my words w it'sely. Britney's Dance Beat  it's kind of the same way -- big on flash, low on substance. THQ w it'sely snagged the videogame rights for Britney Spears and has employed the experienced hands at Metro Graphics to bring that good 'ol Bust-a-Groove magic into play again with Britney's music. The game  it's sweet but short and, well, if you don't like Britney Spears, you better stay far away from th it's absolutely over-idolized, obsessively focused Britney Spears love-fest. (All of you folks by the name of Dave Z., please step forward.)GameplayThe game  it's good as far as it goes. It's got five of Britney Spears' most popular songs, a solid musical scheme on which to play, and it's remarkably challenging and I'll even go so far as to say, addicting, as a two-player game. Given that it's priced as a $39.99 game, that's a pretty good value. The five blockbuster songs include ~?Baby One More Time~, ~Oops!?I did it again~, ~Stronger~, ~Overprotected~, and ~I'm a Slave 4 U.~ For most Britney fans that's more than enough, even though those songs are already out. Or  it's it? For everyone else interested in playing a good dance game, well, that's pretty slim pickings. The prem it'se  it's that you're a potential dancer in Britney's dance troupe. If you can pass the auditions, then you can join the tour. Lucky you! You can pick from six generic dancers, all of whom look overly hip (cool, bad, slick, wicked, whatever you want to call them), each from a diverse ethnic group. There's the cute Japanese El it'sa, happenin' African-American Rob, long tall (perhaps H it'spanic?) Leana, white-as-they-come Dan, the lovely Latino Enrique, and booty-powered Nubian princess, Carla. It's a star-studded cast, to be sure, and hey! We are talking about being able to dance in Britney's rip-roaring dance troupe here! Right?! Oh my God! Get serious!  Back to the subject, then?Players enter into one-on-one competitions with another dancer, and if they win, they move onto the next competition. Easy, right? The first five auditions play the short version of the songs, and the second set of songs (the same songs, of course) are the full length versions, which seem like they're about five minutes. The last four to five auditions are progressively more difficult then the first five, and the game throws you some relatively serious competition. The setup  it's interesting. A transparent dial with a single hand moves clockw it'se in a cons it'stent motion and one of the four face buttons from the Dual Shock (triangle, square, circle, or X) appears to the beat of the song. You must tap the right button at the right time to connect and players can get a M it'ss, Good, or Perfect rating, depending on their timing. The object  it's to build as many combos (uninterrupted connections) as possible. By doing so, players move a red meter along a horizontal bar to the left or right, depending on how they perform. To win, you must have the red meter on your side of the bar. What's neat  it's that, much like in Bust-A-Groove before it, Britney's Dance Beat enables players to attack each other. By stringing together high combos, you send over a little evil star that messes with the face buttons, or the placement of the face buttons, on the opponent's dial. One must be fast and dexterous to do th it's in the later levels. In the two-player mode, th it's setup provides a phenomenal amount of challenge and some great competitive moments.Once you've performed well, you earn backstage passes. Backstage, you'll watch virtual tours of Britney's warm-ups before her concerts, or watch video collages of her behind backstage doing silly things. Oh, such fun! Also, you should be aware that the game  it's compatible with most dance pads, so you're not restrained to solely using the Dual Shock. In fact, you can connect two dance pads for dance competitions if you're um, game enough...    As a full and complete videogame, compared to other games in the genre, Britney's Dance Beat falls short. Quite short. In fact, everything about it  it's short. The song l it'st  it's very slim, and the dancer selection  it's lacking, too. I mean, why aren't there 10 Britney songs in there? Five doesn't even fill up an entire album. Any other dance game has at least 10 entirely different songs, each from different art it'sts. And that brings us to the real double-edged sword for Britney: It's all about Britney. You get her, but you don?t get anyone else. For some folks that's just fine, for others...Well, l it'stening to the same five songs over and over again  it's just weak. Th it's game lacks quantity, variety, and most of all, depth.You get three modes of play, Audition, Practice, and two-player. Then there's Video Vault, Preview, and Options. Audition, which  it's the meat of the game, delivers a whopping five to seven hours of gameplay maximum for a single player. David Smith, who's a pro at these games, beat the entire game in less than one hour. I beat it in less then three (it?s not entirely my forte), so the remainder of the game's replay value lies in the two-player mode. The game  it's priced at a pretty sensible MSRP $39.99, but at least a few stores we called are selling it for $44.99. It's probably worth $39.99 (if you have the Britney love), but it's not worth $49.99. GraphicsMetro Graphics always delivered excellent motion-capture work in the Bust-A-Groove series, and along with House of Moves, Britney's Dance Beat doesn't sway in quality one iota. The dancers all move nearly human-like (hey, they're not perfect), but they dance fluidly and smoothly, and the rhythms are unbroken and mostly natural.With reference to the backgrounds and other v it'suals, Britney's Dance Beat  it's decent looking. The dancer models look good and show off nice textures. There's some good-looking hair, and cool details, such as swinging bracelets, chains, and other items, catch the eye. The game features tons of collages of Britney dancing in real-live concerts, and once you earn enough combos, you move into a bonus stage wherein a polygonal model of Britney appears and shakes her stuff. It's quite horrifying, actually. The model looks decent but doesn't come close to the real thing. A few other things are worth noting. During auditions, players can see Britney's videos of the same song playing on the wall behind the dancers. It's nice to see them, but they aren't even synched up with the actual song, which seems wrong. Otherw it'se, Britney's Dance Beat  it's really average looking. SoundBritney's Dance Beat sounds great, but strangely there wasn't any special emphas it's on offering high quality sound. The five songs are cr it'sp and clear sounding, and with headphones on, they delivery better than average quality. But technically, the game  it's in plain old stereo and doesn't use any special mixing effects or placement, so you won't be hooking th it's up to your stereo for a full, wild Dolby 5.1 blow out. In short (the key word in this review), Britney's Dance Beat is a novelty item. Strangely, most dance games fit that description, but THQ's dancer is a niche within a niche title. There are five songs, here kiddies, count 'em, five. And there isn't anything but Britney, Britney, Britney here. Naturally, since it's called Britney's Dance Beat, you shouldn't expect anything else, but when you put this up against Parappa the Rapper 2, Gitaroo Man, or even, strangely, Rez, Britney's Dance Beat comes up short. It's short on songs, it's short on musical variety, backgrounds, dancers, and its even a little short on Britney. You don't even get to select her for most of the game. Britney's Dance Beat is good game for what it is, but you'll finish it easily in less than five hours (and that's being generous). I highly recommend renting this, if in fact, you're interested at all. One short note: I have grown to withstand Britney's halting, overproduced songs, and through much repetition, I guilty admit that Stronger has become my favorite. Poor pathetic me, tapping my 30-something foot to Britney Spears. I need a life.", "date": "May 9, 2002"}
