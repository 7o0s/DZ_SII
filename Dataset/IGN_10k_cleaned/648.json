{"name": "Mario Party 2", "name_review": "Mario Party 2 Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/01/25/mario-party-2-2", "text": "Last year developer Hudson Soft capitalized on Nintendo's large selection of popular mascot characters, injected them into four-player oriented board-game environments and Mario Party was born. The title, sporting colorful 2D visuals with a splash of the third dimension and a host of fun mini-games, was predictably well received by Nintendo 64 owners and instantly became somewhat of a cult party favorite, especially among older gamers.  This year Hudson and Nintendo have teamed up once more for the sequel, Mario Party 2, a game that introduces more board games, more mini-games and more bells and whistles in general, but sticks with the same winning formula that made the original a hit to begin with. But while the title is definitely the way to go for those who have never played the original, those who did may find that there really isn't enough new here to warrant another purchase.  Features   Five new Adventure Boards with original themes. 64 mini-games in total, some of which appeared in the original. Play as Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, DK, Wario, and Peach. Mini-Game Stadium and Battle Min-Games including two-player duels. Quest Mode for single-play.  New items and costumes.   Gameplay Ever had a go with Mario Party? The idea behind the title is simple enough. Gamers, playing as a famous Nintendo mascot character of their choice, compete against each other through a handful of different board-game environments in a style very similar to Monopoly. More, there are 56 mini-games, bonuses and the like. But what makes the title is its two-, three- and four-player modes.   Mario Party 2 follows the same basic design, but offers more of it. So, whereas the original served up 56 mini-games, the sequel's got 64 -- many of which are borrowed from the first game and spruced up (just over 40 new mini-games in all). Mecha Marathon is one of the mini-games featured in Mario Party 2. In it, players must wind up a Shy Guy as much as possible so that he will fly further. The Shy Guy that floats the furthest, of course, wins. Another mini-game, Totem Pole Pound, sees players doing exactly that, butt-stomping on totem poles -- whoever can make it to the ground floor first wins. Players can go two-on-two, three-on-one or duel against each other. The mini-games, like last year, are generally fun and addictive in their simplicity, with only a few tedious entries to boot.  This time around we've also got more theme worlds to explore, everything from Space Land and Horror Land to Mystery Land and Western Land. We've got a handy Quest mode for single-play action. New items and costumes are constant depending on the world players find themselves in. Some mini-games even relate to their environments. In Western Land, for example, players can square off against each other in a gunslinger duel for more coins.   At the end of the day, though, all of these additions are just that. Those who own Mario Party already won't find any real innovation here, just more of everything they've already seen.  The single-player Quest Mode is still too boring to be tampered.  More, getting into the game -- actually playing it -- takes much too long for Mario Party 2 to be a title players can turn to for a quick five minute go. With that said, Mario Party 2 is still the more complete of the two games despite its traditional ~Give me more of before~ sequel approach.   Graphics Think Mario Party. Now introduce new themes. Welcome to Mario Party 2. Seriously, that sums up the game's visuals fairly accurately. Characters now wear costumes, there are a host of new board-game adventures with unique environments to stroll though, but the graphics engine is identical and the look is very, ~Oh, a board-game. How nice.~  Sound Very basic. Very happy. Predictable signature calls from characters, cheerful background music. Nothing particularly interesting going on here. On the other hand, it's not repetitive and doesn't turn annoying, and that can be considered a plus for a game of this type. Well, Mario Party 2 is exactly as you'd expect -- more of the same. Whether that's a good or bad thing is up to you. With a whole slew of new mini-games, new theme worlds, bonuses and gameplay modes, this is certainly the Mario Party 2 have if you're new to the series. But if you already own the original, well, are new mini-games and different graphics for boards enough to warrant another $50? As far as we're concerned, only if you consider yourself a Mario Party fanatic.We've given Mario Party 2 the same score as the original game simply because we feel that while its admittedly the better of the two titles, it doesn't offer enough new to warrant a higher score. Still recommended, but only for those who don't own the original.", "date": "Jan 25, 2000"}
