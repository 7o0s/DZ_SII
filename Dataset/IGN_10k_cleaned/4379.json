Unless you've gone out to sit in a stand all day long for the hope of one good shot I'm guessing that the appeal just isn't there. Some games have tried to make the action more extreme by letting payers go after bobcats and tigers and some wilde-yeti things that need to be taken down with Gatling guns. Deer Hunter is very straightforward in that there are plenty of deer to go after. It does make them extraordinarily easy to find and kill, though, so this pain doesn't last too long.   Thanks to the trusty RenderWare graphics engine that has powered great and far-below-great games, Deer Hunter runs smoothly enough with decent graphics. The forests have the trees and the brush and the deer are frolicking about in manic circles. And the hunter? Well, the hunter plods along in either the regular walking mode or the crouched and looking like he seriously needs to pinch a loaf mode. It looks incredibly painful and is reason enough to play the entire game in the first-person view. It's not terrible, but neither is it anything resembling pretty.    And yet do the graphics really matter all that much? Sure, they matter a lot, but in terms of the experience of hunting the animals these are enough in the way that any driving game that has cars with a respectable amount of polygons and an intriguing track will still be fun. Here the environments aren't all that thrilling, but the hunt and the chase work out. Time of day and tricks of the trade such as scents and staying upwind will have an effect on just how close the deer will get to you. It's about skill. An incredibly slow, watch the paint dry, age, and peel off as the Earth spins around the sun type of slow, bit of gameplay in the harder simulation modes, but it's there if you want it.   Trying that out for far too long, I opted to go the beginner route with the less skittish animals and the handy bullet pointer in the top of the screen that guided me to my next kill. With that enabled, the game is a snap and can be completed in less than six hours. Just keep running in that direction and crawling when you think you're close and the game practically plays itself. It's more of an arcade feel, sure, but it gets the job done for those who think that simulation in a hunting videogame is the ultimate in self-torture.   Even with this handy approach, playing through Deer Hunter still doesn't get terribly exciting. It has a steady, if uninteresting, pace and sticks to it the whole way through. Other problems start to pop up as well such as the sound effects. Walk or crawl, your hunter will make the same amount of noise. In a game where stealth is literally what it is all about the sound discrepancies are key issues. All too much time is spent guessing just how loud you are and how much you're giving yourself away. In the easier modes, this doesn't stop you from taking down entire herds, but it's a glaring mistake.Deer Hunter is a fairly simple and straightforward hunting game that helps the time pass and pass and pass. The best option is to give up on the simulation mode and head straight for the pointer-assisted easy modes to rack up the kills and show those deer what for. Go for that and you're in for a few hours of guided stalking and shooting.", "date": "Jan 14, 2004"}
