Originally built as a single player game, Bomberman pit gamers with a plethora of weird and wacky enemy creatures who populated a maze (a la Pac-Man).  Unlike Pac-Man, Bomberman could blast his way to victory. The series has since graduated from the single player mode and went heavily into multi-player mayhem long before multi-player was an industry standard.  The series has graced Game Boy before  with Bomberman GB, but Hudson couldn't resist putting out another Bomberman game to take advantage of Game Boy Color's newer features. Features:  5 worlds  25 levels All new power-ups  Classic Bomberman gameplay Bonus mini-game For Game Boy and Game Boy Color   The first thing a gamer will notice after plugging in Pocket Bomberman into a Game Boy machine is that the game's mediocre graphics.   Playing on Game Boy Color adds the  element of color, but it seems like the Bomberman franchises have froze itself in time.  The graphics in Pocket Bomberman are not any better than that of Bomberman GB.  The sprites in Pocket Bomberman are simplistic, and in Game Boy Color, colorization is too simple. Furthermore, the color combination used range from mediocre to horrendous.   Pocket Bomberman is definitely not the best game to showcase Game Boy Color's potential.    Audio wise, there's really not much to say that hasn't been said.  Game Boy doesn't exactly excel in the sound department so Pocket Bomberman can't exactly blow competing games out of the water.   The music is rather standard fare.  The musical scores fit the theme of the game and help pace it.  In the end, it's a neutral aspect of the game that neither helps not hurt it.   What really counts in a game is gameplay.  The original Bomberman didn't have the glitziest graphics on the NES and it still managed to capture the hearts and minds of gamers and Pocket Bomberman appear to have done the same thing. Hudson focused on bringing Pocket Bomberman up to speed with what is happening to its console cousins.  Instead of merely presenting gamers with a series of puzzles, Pocket Bomberman attempts to wed a storyline and an adventure element into the Bomberman framework.  The story in Pocket Bomberman involves the theft of sunlight from Bomberman country and in an effort to restore light back to the country, Bomberman must venture to the top of a mountain and retake the Sword.  The game is divided up into five worlds, each with five levels. Bomberman purists will be glad to know that Pocket Bomberman is still a puzzle/strategy game that forces gamers to think and make decisions.   The gameplay revolves around using bombs to box in enemies and blowing them to bits.   Gamers must also decide thing like whether or not taking a full blast ~power-up~ that extends the range of Bomberman's bomb explosion is worth the risks (Bomberman can be killed by his own bombs).    After the completion of the five levels in a world, Bomberman will face boss characters, which unfortunately are extremely hard to defeat and feels out of place.  As stated earlier, Pocket Bomberman is still a puzzle game at heart, and having to fight bosses with ambiguous weak spots doesn't exactly fit into Bomberman's job description of strategic entrapment and bombings.  Length-wise, Pocket Bomberman delivers, and offers quite a diversity of worlds.  The five worlds range from Forest world to Cloud World, although the different themes are just for looks, as the game plays the same no matter which world a gamer is in.    Furthermore, a neat addition to the game is the ~Jump Mode~.   Bomberman will constantly jump in this mode and it is up to the gamer to try to help Bomberman steer his way to the top of a tower.  Bomberman will beat bosses and crunch enemies on his way to the top and when he reaches his goal, the gamer's performance would be evaluated.  The ~Jump Mode~ certainly helps the game in the re-playability department and gamers can expect to get hooked if they are the type who likes to play a game over and over again to beat their own high scores.  In conclusion, Pocket Bomberman is a must buy if you're in the Game Boy Color market for exactly that, a Bomberman game (although you might want to check out Bomberman GB as well).  I find Pocket Bomberman to be a move in the right direction for the Bomberman franchise on Game Boy.  Its been long overdue for Hudson to actually put a coherent story into a Game Boy Bomberman game and the differing themes in each of the worlds adds much needed variety to Pocket Bomberman.  With all the classic power-ups plus a few hidden surprises, Pocket Bomberman is a well-rounded title that sticks out as one of the more solid titles in a sea of me-too Game Boy software.", "date": "Oct 26, 1999"}
