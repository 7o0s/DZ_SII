Sure, the title itself is dead, but the engine that bore all that violence and dark, gritty eye candy is still alive and kickin'. Developer Paradox is more than committed to keeping the engine in action (after resurrecting it --albeit heavily modified -- for Wu Tang), and their latest, X-Men: Mutant Academy shows that even when you take out the endless blood-letting and dark graphics, there's still a little substance to the gameplay. It's not overwhelming, but it's good.   Gameplay Anyone who's been fascinated by the now-standard Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat juggles will find a lot to love here. Every character has a move that can launch their opponent into the air, and if corner-trapped and timed right, you can keep that opponent in the air for almost as long as you want. Yes, it's a little cheesy, and if you were playing me in two-player mode, it'd be open grounds for an arse whippin', but here against the computer, it somehow doesn't seem so bad. Juggles aside, Mutant Academy manages to throw some innovation in to the now stagnant mechanics of fighting games.   Each character has the standard set of throws, super moves and special moves, but the special moves are handled in a way I've never seen before. Like any normal super meter, it builds as you deliver or receive damage, but the slick part is that different moves build different branches of the meter, so you can build up whatever super you want by using certain special moves. Of course, the lowest meter builds fastest, so you might want to build that up first. The best part, however, is the fact that you can actually switch power from meter to meter, so once you've built up the first meter, a few controller presses later, you've almost topped off the second meter, which you can then continue to build on -- or add it to the third (and most powerful) super meter.   The supers themselves are also a little different. The first one is usually just a standard super attack (big energy ball, fast slash, etc.), but the second can be powered up as soon as you activate it, since there's about a one-second pause before the move is unleashed. As soon as you activate it, an arrow appears near your character, just press it and your damage will double, then another will appear. Press it and you'll triple the attack's power, and so on. The final super actually isn't available as soon as you fill the meter, you have to first rapidly tap X (how fitting) to bring together the two halves of an ~X~ symbol and open up the option to unleash it.   It should be noted that Paradox didn't create any new move sets for this fighter. Instead, it knowingly swiped the quarter-turns and half turns from Capcom's fighters and mapped them on to X-Men: Mutant Academy, with even more simplicity. So, if you have played those games, the moves will come easy as pie. Are we furious at them for them for the steal? Not really, it's really a compliment to Capcom in the end, and it makes the game a lot easier to get into.   The actual combat isn't perfect, but it is usually fun. It seems like fast, agile characters such as Wolverine or Toad (there are 10 selectable characters: Cyclops, Phoenix, Storm, Beast, Gambit, Wolverine, Toad, Sabretooth, Mystique, and the Master of Magnetism himself, Magneto) will have a much easier time than slower ones. Why? Because a barrage of attacks will almost always keep the opponent on their guard and will never let them launch into combos of their own. This is more than apparent when fighting the computer-controlled Toad, who can only be easily defeated if he's kept at bay the whole time. As soon as he moves in to attack, it's all over. In fact, With nine other opponents to fight, each game is actually really long, and difficult. I can't count the number of enraged four-letter explicatives that escaped my Wolvie-style clenched teeth just because the AI never let me out of a corner.   AI aside, X-Men manages to stash away some slick extras, including the entire second trailer for X-Men The Movie (yeah, the one that's coming out today), behind the scenes footage, a comics image montage (great stuff if you like X-men artists such as Joe Maduera or Adam and Andy Kubert), FMVs for all the characters once you beat the game with them (and a final story movie once you've beat it with all of them), and new costumes for all of them (yeah, just like the ones in the movie). This does add a lot of replay value, but since the game can be insanely difficult at times, this may not prove as accessible as some had hoped.   Graphics Let's just get this out of the way. Mutant Academy looks good. The game's engine keeps the action fast, slowdown free, and manages to make it all look great. It's obvious that Paradox did its homework on the characters and their designs. All of the costumes from the comic have been faithfully reproduced, plus the move costumes (well, except for Beast and Gambit, who aren't in it), and all the characters move with a flow and grace usually associated with 2D hand-drawn animation. The textures are most clean, bright offerings, with the only real problem being the scanned in images that were used for the backgrounds and in some cases the main fighting floor; they're simply a little too low-res to look perfect, but it's a minor gripe.   The best part for fans of the series, will be the level designs. From Wolverine's Canadian wilderness to Gambit's bayou-wrapped dock to Phoenix's moon base, all of the levels have been painstakingly crafted to provide keen eyes and those steeped in the mythos's and pasts of the characters. Even those that aren't based on the comic origins or usual surroundings are awesome. Storm's stage is in a dank, pipe-riddled underground lair, where trains often go screaming overhead or Toad's level, which features a burned out New York, complete with the torched husk of the Daily Bugle and small embers rising for the apocalyptic scene below the battle platform.   This attention to detail will pay off big time in the eyes of fans, especially for those naysayers that said that the Thrill Kill engine was only good for small arenas and excessive violence.   Sound Like so many games, the sound is X-Men's flaw, but only because it doesn't really hold up to the rest of the game. The music is nearly silent (you'll have to crank it up all the way in the options menu to hear anything), and when you do finally hear it, you'll wonder why it was thrown in at all. It's not horrible, but it doesn't really complement the action for some reason.   The voices, on the other hand, were done with great care. I'm not sure if Paradox was able to snag any of the voice actors from the now defunct X-Men cartoon, but Jean Grey/Phoenix and Beast sound just like their television counter parts, as do Sabretooth and Mystique. Professor X is a total miss, but Wolverine, Cyclops and Storm are good matches. Toad and Magneto are good, but rarely speak (although Toad does giggle and squeal a lot).Many people will see the X-Men license and balk. I can't recall a decent lone X-Men game ever hitting the consoles (with the exception of Capcom's X-Men Vs Street Fighter). While it's not perfect, the action is almost always fast, visceral, and entertaining, and the graphics show the attention to detail that one would only associate with a group of fanboys. Small touches like Wolverine's poses and the resurrection of Phoenix as a main character show that Paradox actually gave this game some time. If you're not an X-Men fan, this game won't convert you, but if are, and you can handle the rather steep difficulty, you'll have a blast. (Sam Bishop resisted the urge to use ~optic blast~ in that last sentence.)", "date": "Jul 15, 2000"}
