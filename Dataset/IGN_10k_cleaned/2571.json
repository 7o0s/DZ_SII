It's the beer, dim lighting, and cool blue chalk that draws us all so helplessly into the seedy underworld that is the pool hall, but it's the strategy and ability to wager that keeps us there. Potentially great things can happen in the digitization of this activity. I'll save you the trouble of reading and summarize: Real Pool 2 is not, by any metric, a potentially or even remotely great thing.  Control is easy and will immediately be familiar to anyone who has ever enjoyed a pool game before. Even those completely new to the experience will be able to grip and master this game's mechanics in no time. Keyboard commands control various camera views, fine aiming, and the use of English (putting a spin on the ball). All the while, the mouse is used to rotate about the cue ball. Once you're ready to lay one out, just hit the spacebar, pull back on the mouse, and then push it forward until contact. Shot power is determined by both a selectable numeric value that determines how far back you can draw your cue (1 - 9), and by the speed of your motion.  I could only find three legitimate points of contention within the realm of control, and those are: 1) Sometimes when switching camera views and placing the cue ball, mouse control will become disoriented. 2) Often times you'll not be able to fully encircle the cue ball via the mouse look, but will rather have to go the opposite direction and come around from the other side (odd, because you can still navigate well past a full circle -- it just sometimes hangs). 3) None of the controls are configurable. I see that as unacceptable.  Like control, actual play comes very stock and standard. Aside from no ball ever being able to fly free from the amazing gravitational forces of the table, the game plays out with physics and progressively more difficult opponents just like pretty much everything before it did. And that's the problem... There's nothing to differentiate this title from previous efforts, and indeed nothing to stand it out as worthy of purchase or mention. In fact, there's pretty much nothing here at all. Only a scant four tables exist and they can only be played in one of a meager four game types (straight pool, 8-ball, one pocket, and 9-ball). Fuel to the crappy fire: these can only be enjoyed in two modes, championship and single match. 12 computer opponents exist, but all are generic and only differ in calculated and methodical skill levels (the harder opponents will very mathematically choose and make harder shots and more of them).  I bet you'd be surprised to know that in addition to a cool puzzle mode, carom, bowliards, and others, the original Real Pool on the PlayStation 2 also sported some 25 different tables that came not just in sexually enticing rectangles, but also in kinky star and triangle variations. How a sequel can actually offer substantially less than its progenitor is beyond me. It's like ARUSH had to actually work at worsening this game.  ~Hey dude, this is only going to be like twenty bucks. So you'd better go ahead and rip out all of the few redeeming qualities the first one had, just because.~  What...is...up...with...that? The moment you play through all four menus and get stuck on a World Class player in the championship mode is the moment Real Pool 2 moves into the same loathed drawer that harbors other award winning products like Demon World and Varmint Hunter. Like, oh my God! Totally!  What can you say about the graphics of a pool game, you ask? Well, these balls are spherical...And well lit! They even roll, feature a glossily illuminated top, and cast appropriate shadows. Additionally, the static wraparound backgrounds work. I'm never one to prefer an image in place of an articulated model, but because the panoramic backdrops of the game's four venues are so seamlessly blended and of decent to good quality, they simply work at delivering a pleasing and believable environment in which to play.  Other fine details on the table (pocket netting, side panel coloration), and those minute nuances of the cue (mainly in terms of texturing) help further and deliver this aesthetically astute experience. Nevertheless, excluding models of any kind, and leaving in their place only thumbnail sized photographs of your competitors, quickly works to dispel any notion that you're actually playing pool with someone, and instead reaffirms the fact that your opponent is as cold, lifeless, and invisible as any computer can be.  Surprise, surprise! The balls make appropriate crash noises when they impact each other. Not much else can be said about the game's aural component other than that it is accurate and complimented by locale dependent mellow music that comes in keeping with the theme -- mellow music that sometimes perhaps pushes the fine line between background filler and a cure for insomnia.    Please don't convolute and absorb this negative review of a single product as some kind of testament to the demise of the sport's representation in gaming as a whole. If anything, Real Pool 2 is living proof that the whole of computerized pool still has quite a long ways to go before it climaxes. Plenty of ways to enhance and improve the sport yet remain largely unexplored. For starters, including actual players and audiences that walk, gawk, and trash talk is a must. Better yet, also allowing gamers the opportunity to create their own hustlers and sharks, personalized by gender, color, hair, height, weight, etcetera, would be fantastic.  Ideally, we could then take our individuals online and compete in mock tournaments, wagering points and rank statuses against one another. But, this wouldn't just be within the confines of the tripe four game types Real Pool 2 includes, but rather the myriad of different billiards games already abound. Don't stop at merely including just the dozens of widely recognized, standard ones, mind you. More personalized, house rules variations should also make appearances. Hell, why even stop there? Throw in the ability to create your own game types, goals, and rule sets, and play as you like, forcing others to bend to your dominating will.  Of course, next comes the usual advancements in the fields of audio (importing your own tunes), video (better, faster, cooler), and realism (slamming the cue ball down at a 90 degree angle with full force should send the ball careening through the air and possibly even tear the felt).   What did you think of Real Pool 2?  Clearly, pool games have miles and miles to go before they can be considered stale and stagnant. It's unfortunate then that Real Pool 2 takes none of these aforementioned steps forward into the wonderful world of progress, but actually falls back, hard. It's twenty dollars, yes. But as we've seen time and again in this day and age, twenty dollar games do not have to be fluff, especially here where the addition of extra options and playability doesn't seem like it'd be that much of a burden on the developers. Gaming often attempts to emulate real-life, doable activities; however, in such games, the mundane is either accentuated with the fantastic, realism is developed to the fullest possible extent, or what is being depicted is not a readily available activity for most people to partake in. Real Pool 2 doesn't have the luxury of following into any of these categories.Despite being sold for fewer than twenty dollars, this pool title fails because it simply can't compete with the more developed, polished, and well-rounded products that have been available for years. In incorporating no extenuating realism, no abundance of options, modes, and so forth, in order to appeal at all, Real Pool 2 has forced itself to rely on either the fantastic or the fact that most people cannot play the sport itself. But, because the game has nothing of wonder or lasting value, and because most people can either walk down the street or hop in the car for five minutes and be at an actual pool hall, Real Pool 2 finds itself without a niche, with no appeal. Pretty as it can be, Real Pool 2 is bland at what it does, and even manages to not do much. Older efforts are far preferable and come recommended in this title's place.", "date": "Mar 20, 2002"}
