Instead of totally reinvesting their dough into more GTA games, Rockstar is taking a chance and releasing its very own movie--Sunday Driver. Packed in with the Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Special Edition box that shipped recently, the movie is the first of its kind for Rockstar. It plans to release the film as a standalone documentary on UMD later in the month as well.    Since the game has not changed at all since it was originally released, we thought we'd take a gander at the extra DVD that came packed with the set and review it separately, since it is the only significant reason to plunk down more cash. There are three elements to the disc: Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas- The Introduction, the low-rider documentary Sunday Driver, and a trailer for the PSP game Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories. The trailer is essentially an extra, leaving the other two pieces as the main attractions.    For uber-fans of GTA, The Introduction sheds light on some of the back story of the characters in the game. As a piece of video, it has all the charm of the game meaning not much. It plays out like an extended cut scene from San Andreas and uses the in-game models to tell the story. What results is a rather ugly animated feature that plays like an over-extended cinematic, and will only be interesting to those who were drawn deep into the story of San Andreas. The voice work is solid, but the story isn't very compelling. Definitely not worth the purchase of the Special Edition.   Sunday Driver is a different story. An obvious companion to GTA, this well-made documentary tells the tale of Compton's ~Majestics~ low-riding club. Tracking the club's roots up to their current activities, Driver is an all-access look into a very specific sub-culture.    Through a series of themed sections, we are introduced to a colorful array of characters, from the aptly named ~Gangster~ to the detailing guru ~Doc.~ Most of the documentary lets these guys riff off each other and discuss their passion, and there is plenty of footage of the club out low-riding, building their rides, and celebrating the culture.    Those interested in car culture and sociology will want to take a look, as it is an intriguing and humorous glimpse into a lifestyle that many will never come into contact with. For the most part, the film stays on task, keeping with how the lifestyle makes its practitioners feel, and what it means to low-ride.   Where the movie falls down is with its constant insistence that the activity is not illegal and does not promote illegal activity. The truth of the matter is that low-riding is not lawful, and anyone caught with a lowered frame or hydraulics is subject to a fine. Whether low-riders agree with the law or not is not really the point; the argument that police should leave them alone is silly when they are clearly and consciously in violation.   What's more vexing is that for three quarters of the film, the interviewees claim that although low-riding's origins were in gang activity, everyone had since moved on from that. This is completely undercut near the end of the film when the head of the Majestics is arrested for his role in drug trafficking. This wouldn't be a big deal if the film hadn't made such a big deal out of the ~good side~ of low-riding throughout.   Still, although the film is a tad overlong, it is entertaining, especially the segments showcasing the beautiful rides. For those interested in the low-riding elements of the GTA, this is a deeper look at that culture, and a good addition to the SE.    Score: 6 out of 10   The Video  The GTA mini-movie The Introduction is as blocky and glitchy as the in-game graphics, as it uses the same models. Not the prettiest game to begin with, a year after its launch, it has fallen even further behind the pack.   The video for Sunday Driver is equally harsh, mainly due to how it was shoton digital video with tons of grain and contrast. Sure, it looks gritty, and the transfer is okay for what's here, but this is not a beautiful disc by any stretch of the imagination.   Score: 3 out of 10   The Audio  Luckily, the audio makes up for some of the video problems. The Introduction is well-voiced and mixed, and the bass is well-utilized throughout. For Sunday Driver, Rockstar has done as well as can be expected with the source material. Voices come through clear, and the mix between VO and music is spot-on.    Score: 7 out of 10   The Extras  In addition to the trailer for Liberty City Stories, there are several extra clips included with the Sunday Driver stuff. These are simply out-takes and extra footage that was left out of the documentary. The most interesting is ~Switches,~ which explains how the hydraulics in the low-riders work. The rest are good if you're into the film, but essentially, it's just more of the same.   Score: 5 out of 10Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas has a lot of things going for it that make it an excellent gaming experience. The excellent narrative and voice acting make it a story to remember, driving is still a lot of fun, and the selection of missions to perform make it easy to look forward to what's next.But is it a huge improvement over Vice City? Graphically it looks a little better, but not by much. There's certainly less pop-in, and it runs well. The missions are just as creative in some cases but borrow a lot from previous games. The story and narrative, as mentioned, are much more focused and well written. But the AI hasn't been improved, meaning that combat mechanics haven't really improved, which seems like one of the things that always should have been on the list. There are some great new ideas here, like gang wars for territory, but they aren't as perfectly thought out as they could have been.GTA: San Andreas is easy to recommend for a thousand reasons. There's just so much to do and have fun with, but even so there's still room for the guys at Rockstar to improve, and that's a pretty exciting possibility.", "date": "Nov 2, 2005"}
