{"name": "Jeopardy!", "name_review": "Jeopardy!", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/11/24/jeopardy-3", "text": "This popular gameshow features a Canadian host who played one of the mysterious 'Men in Black' on the television show the X-Files.  If you said ~What is Jeopardy?~ then we owe you $200.  Trust me ... the check is in the mail.  OK, I think everyone out there is familiar enough with the concept of Jeopardy.  Alex Trebek reads you the answer, you tell him the question ... simple enough.  Guess what?  The computer adaptation of Jeopardy plays exactly the same way, except the answers are read by announcer Johnny Gilbert who, in my opinion, has a much better voice than Alex anyway.  I guess Alex didn't want to sit around and read answers on his day off ... I don't blame him.  Jeopardy boasts over 3500 answers and includes categories ranging from US Cities to Broadway Songs, from Latin Quotations to Robin Williams Films.  You can play against two computer opponents or challenge up to two of your friends.  But you're not just limited to single Jeopardy rounds.  You can also opt to play a Jeopardy Tournament in which the winner after two rounds goes on to face two advanced computer AI opponents in a Tournament of Champions with more challenging answers and categories. If you wish, you can also play by yourself in a Speed Match consisting of 30 answers for which you must supply the questions.  Although Johnny reads the answers, Alex is always in your corner if you get the correct question, saying cute little phrases like ~that it is~ and ~to be sure.~  However, miss the question and you get chided with ~you're close, but that's not right~ or the extremely dry and simple ~that's wrong.~  Ouch!  Let me tell you now, Alex doesn't pull any punches.  Jeopardy lets you set a variety of options so you can tailor the game to your specifications.  You can change the answer difficulty, response time, spelling tolerance, and the buzz-in time.  You can also opt for adaptive computer AI, which essentially makes the computer answer more questions as you pull further into the lead.  This version of Jeopardy even includes Audio and Video Daily Doubles, something never before done in previous computerized versions of the game.    Overall the computer adaptation of Jeopardy is very satisfying.  I only had a few problems with the game: the lack of network multiplay, the repetition of answers after just a few games, and the fact that the game too often comes down to nothing but an old fashion spelling bee.  For instance, I played against one of my friends and the question to one of the answers was 'Who was Lynyrd Skynyrd.'  He typed Lynard Skynard and Alex popped up and said, ~No, that's incorrect.~  Although they would be pronounced the same, the spelling can get a little quirky at times, even with the spell accuracy option set to easy.  Of course, I was able to sneak in ~Who was Lynyrd Skynyrd?~ after his answer, resulting in a swift punch to the arm.  And who said Jeopardy was a game for intellectuals?   The AI also could have been a bit better at recognizing similar concepts (like accepting 'Hinduism' for 'Hindu' when speaking of the Indian religion or accepting 'muscles' for 'muscle' when the answer was ~The Gluteus Maximus is the largest one of these in the human body.~), but these problems were few and far between and hardly took away from the Jeopardy gameplay experience.   All said and done, the computer version of Jeopardy should keep those of you who like the television show entertained for a while.  Sure, you'll start recognizing some of the questions after a few hours of play, but this just means you'll be able to decimate your friends, who will immediately start calling you 'Brainiac' or 'Egghead.'  By the way, the guy who played the other 'Man in Black' in the X-Files is now the governor of Minnesota ... think about it.    -- Tal Blevins If you ever drop by my apartment on a random day, you'll probably find the Game Show Network turned on my cable box. I love game shows simply for the camp factor, but the one show I just can't watch is Jeopardy. I'm sorry, I don't know the average rainfall in the Amazon forest, the entire fourth act of Hamlet, or the name of Melville's mistress when he was writing Moby Dick. Jeopardy on the PlayStation is an excellent conversion of the TV show, down to the super-smooth 3D virtual studio. There are a ton of questions  but the same reason why I won't watch Jeopardy is the same reason why I won't play this game: I just don't know the answers to half the questions. I'll sit there like an idiot scratching my head for most of the game. However, it's quite the adrenaline rush when you can actually clean out a category.Jeopardy isn't my cup o' tea, but there's a lot of fans of the game show that will appreciate what Hasbro's done for the PlayStation.", "date": "Nov 24, 1998"}
