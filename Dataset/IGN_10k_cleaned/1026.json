The formula is there, and it's only worked once - create a menagerie of cutesy creatures with funny names like Snargelywax and Goopchoo, and the little children will be all over your officially-licensed property like flies on crap. If AKI Corporation was attempting to create their own similar pop-culture phenomenon with the characters in Animaster, they're out of luck - but at least they managed to design a damn fine game.  Actually, Animaster has a lot in common with Tecmo's indescribably wonderful Monster Rancher on the Playstation. Here's the story: you live in a world where everyone is fascinated with breeding and racing freakish creatures, called ~Anima.~ Your father left you his Anima-raising farm when he died, and your sole ambition is to become the greatest Animaster the world has ever seen (hence, the game's title). To become the master of the universe, you must breed Pokemonnish creatures over the course of several years, and make them win races. (Personally, I would train them in the arts of combat and build an army of unstoppable killing machines.)  The game starts off by giving you a single Anima: a blue, dog-like critter named Pamutaro. Your servant, a pudgy little man-slave, walks you through the process of training your Anima to its full racing ability, and you can opt to turn the training over to him if you're feeling lazy. Each in-game ~turn~ is represented by one week, when you choose an activity for your Anima - be it running, jumping, attacking, or resting.   These exercises boost your Anima's rankings, in terms of stamina, speed, and power. Unlike Monster Rancher, there's no way for your Anima to flub up a week's worth of training, so you're always guaranteed some form of level-up. This takes a little bit of the fun out of it, and gives you no reason to watch each week's training cutscene more than once.  Aside from poking around on the farm, you can head into one of four towns (three of them unlock as you play the game), and explore the area via a third-person camera. Here, you can talk to the overbearingly helpful townsfolk, sign up for races, and apply for Anima licenses that allow you to breed the little buggers legally.  Once you've boosted your Anima past the point of not sucking, you'll want to prove their newfound mettle by entering them in a race. The player has a little bit of control when racing - the analog pad manipulates the ~throttle,~ though thundering along at full speed will knock some major steam out of your Anima. You can also steer left and right (in a very broad fashion), and execute attacks to both sides in order to bump opponents out of the running. One particularly annoyance is how the player's control kicks out 20 seconds before the end of each race - the viewpoint switches to a trackside view, and you watch as your prized champion thunders to victory or faces humiliating defeat.  Of course, winning equals big bucks, and your Anima will evolve to ~ultra-level~ if you treat them right. After gaining your first official license, you can start breeding new species, since you've Gotta Catch 'Em All&153;! Oh, no, wait...  One of Animaster's biggest let-downs is the four-player mode, which is a total cop-out. Each player plugs his or her VMU into a controller, everyone chooses a track to race on, and you all sit back and watch. You don't actually do anything - this is so lame, it defies description.  While Animaster doesn't exactly provide the most social of gaming experiences, it offers some of the console's best graphics. The character design is excellent, and each ostrich-dog-salamander hybrid has been modeled impeccably. Skin stretches realistically, and each creature seems to have a distinct bone structure - it's definitely a notch above Nintendo's Pokemon Stadium.  And then you've got the environments. Egads! These are some of the most gorgeous, expansive racetracks I've ever seen - and it all runs at 60fps, with zero fog, no clipping errors, and not a sign of pop-in. The game also takes seasons into account, and alternates weather and time-of-day effects as the game progresses - not to mention the fact that your character wears a short-sleeved shirt in the summer, and a sweater come wintertime.  Overall, Animaster provides a welcome escape from the enormous amount of slop that's been saturating the Japanese Dreamcast market. Though I would have enjoyed a more substantial 4-player mode and some more depth to the gameplay (there's not nearly enough to do), Animaster may warrant an import by the casual Monster Rancher fanatic.", "date": "Jun 19, 2000"}
