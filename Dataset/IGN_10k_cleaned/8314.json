To these folks it's quite normal to sit down for a three hour cruise, spending two hours and fifty minutes creeping into an optimal attack position.    The genre of submarine simulators has a long and mostly positive history. One series of games that has long been simulating these sardine cans of stealthy destruction is Silent Hunter. It's been two years since version three let us experience the war from the bad guy's perspective, sinking those pesky Brits in the European theatre. Silent Hunter 4 sees the series returning to the winning team, but this time it takes place in the Pacific theatre. Instead of the Nazi U-boats of the last game, you're now armed with a wide variety of US submarines, from titchy little tin cans to giant subs capable of carrying enough torpedoes to sink Tasmania.   Your enemy is the Japanese Empire, who is well on its way to capturing every idyllic island in Asia. As an American sailor, still smarting after the attack on Pearl Harbour, it's your job to foil these plans.   There are two ways of doing this in Silent Hunter 4. A handful of historic missions are included; recreations of massive battles which helped turn the tide of WWII. There's plenty of variety in mission types, but one thing they all have in common is a sense of scale. If you're looking for a quick fix, without weeks of looking for targets, these quick missions are a nice, snack-sized treat.   Don't limit yourself to this mode though, as you'll miss the real feast that is the game's dynamic campaign. Before the campaign even begins, you'll need to choose where you'd like to fight from, as well as when. Aussies will appreciate the fact that our ports are represented in the game, including Fremantle. The earlier years are tougher due to the fact your equipment is, well, quite simply rubbish but so is the enemy's. As the war progresses, technological advances will deliver such handy things as torpedoes that actually go boom and subs that can dive further than knee-deep, but the flip-side is that the enemy becomes more savvy to your tactics and equipment. Being dynamic, every time you play a campaign it'll be slightly different to the last, giving the game endless replayability.    It's amazing how much better the screens look than the game in action. Could there be some photoshop trickery going on?  The Pacific makes the last game's setting, the Atlantic, feel as spacious as a submarine bunk. The distance between your port and the enemy is now in the thousands of miles. While sub freaks will love spending several real weeks getting to their target zone, for those of us with lives the inclusion of higher levels of time acceleration, at around 7,000 times the speed of real time, will be welcome. Strangely our epic voyages didn't use any fuel whatsoever - just one of the many bugs we encountered.   Due to the massive expanses of empty sea, we found that locating the enemy was slightly harder this time around. Scratch that - locating them wasn't too hard, but intercepting their course was. We've lost count of the number of contacts that we plotted an intercept for, only to see it disappear at the last minute.     Eventually we started to rack up a few more kills, but intercepting is definitely harder than the last game. Thankfully there are many mission types that show submariners did a whole lot more than just sink ships and read girly mags.    Just when you've gotten sick of sinking helpless transports (actually, this rarely becomes boring), you'll be tasked with a mission to sneak into an enemy harbour to take happy snaps of a prized battleship at rest. Other missions have you dropping off spec-ops troops far behind the front line.   Aircraft were used frequently in the Pacific, and they make a regular appearance in the game. Fighters, bombers and sea-planes from both nations fill the air - perhaps a little too often at times. Sometimes it feels that as soon as you pop your head above the waves, there's a Japanese plane delivering a 500-pound welcoming committee.    Not shown - jaggies, jaggies, and a few more jaggies.  If you're lucky enough to be looking at the right piece of sky at the right time, you'll occasionally see aircraft getting shot down. The pilots even bail out, and if they're friendly you're encouraged to rescue them. Some missions revolve entirely about these search and rescue missions.   On the seas you'll occasionally spot massive sea battles between the Japanese and the Allies. It's a prime example of how the world seems busier in SH4, with more AI units doing their own thing. It's especially notable in harbours, where there's plenty of traffic to avoid or sink. Yet one feature that is strangely absent is AI controlled subs operating alongside you in wolf packs. During the war, subs did the most damage when operating as a group, so it's sad to see this feature is still missing from the game.    A major improvement over the first game is the automated crew management system. The crew in the last game were moronic workaholics, who would continue to work until they collapsed from exhaustion. In SH4, it's a much simpler system, with three rotating crews - one works, another rests, while the third gets ready to work. You can leave it to do its own thing, but a little bit of fine tuning of crew positions will help keep things at top efficiency.   Much ado has been made about the game's new Hollywood visuals, and for good reason. At first glance, everything is much sexier than last game, which was already quite the looker. The water is now transparent - watching a submarine lurk several metres below the water, with its shape refracted by the water, is an awesome sight. Everything has been bump mapped and shaderised up the wazoo, giving boats a very metallic, rusty look.    Torpedoes now do more damage than a simple black texture on the hull - hit your target and you'll see a gaping hole open up. It all looks great, and a million times more atmospheric than the last game until you spot your first jaggy. That should take all of five seconds.   The domain of every sim - dials, buttons and guages.  Ubisoft has done it again. Silent Hunter 4 is yet another Ubisoft game that does not work with anti-aliasing (AA). The designers are apparently stuck in 1997, where working AA was a novel feature that only those in the magical land of Silicon Valley got to experience. Even forcing AA via the driver control panel does not work. Making matters worse is the fact that the game doesn't truly support resolutions over 1024 x 768. The 2D interface scales nicely to increased resolutions, yet the guts of the game, its 3D engine, appears locked at 1024 x 768.   The result is one of the ugliest games we've seen in recent memory. We ran the game on a 22~ widescreen LCD, with a native resolution of 1680 x 1050, and the jaggies made it a very unpleasant experience. They were so bad that visually identifying ships is much harder than it should be, as ships appear as a bunch of shifting pixels at long range. The community is in uproar about this woeful oversight, but there's hope on the horizon - a fix has been mentioned for the upcoming 1.2 patch, but it's not promised. For those of you who don't know what AA is, or run at the measly resolution of 1024 x 768, it's not an issue. For the rest of us, it's almost a show-stopper.   The audio department isn't much better. To our amazement, out of the box the game uses the exact same sound effects as the last game. Lazy. Except this time they were buggy, getting caught in loops. The 1.1 patch fixed the bugs and introduced new sound effects, but the game's audio system still shows just how rushed this game was.    Thankfully there are two redeeming features to the audio. The quaint gramophone makes its welcome return, allowing you to store .wav files in a directory and then play them back via the in-sub gramophone. There are already dozens of audio collections available via the mod-friendly community. We highly recommend you check out Sub-Sim for more of these.   The other cool feature is the sub's radio. Depending on where you are in the virtual world, you'll be able to tune into different radio stations. Sadly we've only found one radio station so far, but once again the modding community is saving the day, spending their own time to build new radio stations. If only they were a little easier to install than the first lot we've seen - again, check out Subsim.com  for more cool radio stations.   Since the game's buggy launch, we've seen the release of the 1.1 patch, with 1.2 in development. Yet even with 1.1, the game is still as buggy as a backpacker's sleeping bag. The best bug of all is found when hitting the ~a~ key - just one tap and you'll crash to the desktop, every time. If these sorts of bugs get through Q&A, it's no surprise that others are being found every day.Theres a lot to like about the latest entry in the Silent Hunter war. The change to the Pacific theatre sees new subs, news targets and most importantly, a lovely range of new mission types. Sadly, its obvious that the game has been rushed. Were used to sims being buggy, but for the fourth in the series wed hoped for more. And the excruciatingly bad visuals are inexcusable in this day and age. Weve absolutely no doubt that the problems will be fixed; if not by the developers, then by the wonderfully devoted community of modders. But until then, the older Silent Hunter 3, installed with the best of the community mods, is a more playable experience than the newest shark in the Silent Hunter waters.", "date": "Apr 2, 2007"}
