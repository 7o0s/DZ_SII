They're easy to present in small portions, offering quick bursts of gameplay. Handy Games is trying to make in-roads in another genre -- the adventure game. Offering a full-fledged adventure game, complete with hours of gameplay, for cellphones is a tricky proposition. But HG thinks they have the problem of small downloads and limited memory licked by dividing their Ancient Ruins opus into six chapters.   Think again.   Features:   Fight monsters, avoid traps  Isometric view  Auto-save  Transfer character experience to later chapters   Ancient Ruins 1: The Crypt of the King is the first of a planned six chapter series. Each episode will feature a different lead character in a new location, but you can transfer previously earned experience across all six titles -- so progress is not lost every half-hour.   Yeah, every half-hour. That's about how long it will take you to run from one side of the crypt to the other, pausing only the beat down skeleton after skeleton after skeleton. There are some spiders thrown in for good measure, but you'll find yourself mostly slashing these animated bags of bones with the super-easy rapid fire.   Ancient Ruins 1 drops you in a maze that is not especially difficult to navigate. You must hunt down the proper switches to open certain doors, or pick up required keys to thrown open portals. Because rooms are so small, it's a breeze to hop from screen to screen.   And that's main problem with Ancient Ruins 1. It's just over too quickly. While we certainly appreciate that the action moves at a decent clip -- as opposed some Dungeon Storm's almost-painful crawl -- there just not enough game for your download dollar.Ancient Ruins actually looks pretty decent on a larger-screen handset. The rooms are decently detailed, as are the warrior and enemies sprites. Too bad the animation doesn't follow suit. I like the approach of trying to deliver a larger scope game over multiple chapters, but the individual episodes cannot be so brief that the gamer feels like it didn't match the price. I'm afraid that too many gamers, after playing fuller adventures like Prince of Persia: Sands of Time and Splinter Cell, will just come away from Ancient Ruins disappointed.", "date": "Sep 28, 2004"}
