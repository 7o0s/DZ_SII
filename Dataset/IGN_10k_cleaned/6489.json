As far as we know, BattleBorne's little overhead action title with a wartime theme was originally under the Interplay umbrella as Airborne: Liberation, but that company suddenly imploded. Shortly thereafter Combat Elite was picked up by Acclaim, which was promptly sued by BattleBorne to halt the release of Combat Elite -- BattleBorne claimed undue payments and won in court while Acclaim was too busy falling apart to fight back. For nearly another year after that victorious injunction passed, Combat Elite sat unattended and totally complete. Now it's finally out courtesy of Southpeak Interactive!    A strange trip indeed.  When I first played WWII Paratroopers so very long ago, I had an extremely positive outlook. At the time, I assumed some presentation and minor gameplay issues such as odd targeting, unpredictable enemy routines and an unfortunate abundance of off-screen damage would be fixed. Unfortunately, none of this happened. The result is a game that haphazardly strings together brief missions with combat that ranges from mildly uninteresting to quite infuriating.  Like Dark Alliance and every other Snowblind powered title out there, Combat Elite is a strictly top-down action game with a fairly impressive graphics engine. It does offer some cluttered, cool urban environments when it wants to, and the sensation of being enveloped by a catastrophic war complete with ruined buildings and whizzing bullets is a good one, but while the constrained viewpoint has allowed BattleBorne to fill each environment with a good amount of detail, there are some limitations.  Eat Bazooka  The first is length. Each level is very short and really only features a bit of aimless wandering and a few minor skirmishes directed by objectives like: find guy, find thing, bring thing, and kill man. The levels and their small amount of accompanying descriptive text do little to thrust players into the drama of World War II. Unlike Dark Alliance-type games that encourage development and a touch of personalization, Combat Elite focuses more on the basic allocation of acquired points to obvious areas of specialty without any real drive or meaning. That is, I improve my rifle ability because I can and I have the points to, but I don't really want to, nor do I exactly know why I'm doing that opposed to focusing more on hand-to-hand combat. There's no real difference there.  The other limitation to Combat Elite is a lot more obvious. In war, it's important to see things. In a game designed to approximate the feeling of war and force players into meticulous stop and shoot encounters behind cover, it's especially important to see things. Unfortunately, Combat Elite doesn't allow much the way of visibility. The camera is locked down tight above the player and there's no leeway offered, which makes it very difficult to pin down from where fire is coming, or to determine the best vantage point to assault an enemy position from. Poor camera work also leads to far too many deaths by mysterious off-screen bullets.   The camera system just doesn't lend itself well to this type of ranged combat. But what's more aggravating is the pressure sensitive targeting and firing system. Characters don't actually shoot where they're facing. Instead, they always shoot up, which means it's very important to constantly rotate the screen so that enemies are up-wise. This gets annoying, especially when it might be necessary to run left to some cover and then an enemy suddenly appears ahead. Instead of snapping to that new foe when the targeting button is depressed, the game will target whatever happens to be in a generally upward direction. Not so good.  In multiplayer, the game uses a totally different system. When two soldiers are gaming on the same screen each player shoots in the direction they are facing. This system is a little unintuitive at first because one player might be toying with the camera a bit too much, but it's preferable to shooting up constantly. We think that something more akin to Robotron, Smash TV, Total Carnage or Geometry Wars would have been much easier to deal with, but then the slow-paced nature of the game would be lost. Either way it'd be tough to balance Combat Elite given its viewpoint, but the available options just don't work too well. It's unfortunate that after so many trials and tribulations BattleBorne couldn't sculpt CE into a better game. With a redesigned targeting system, more advanced controls (duck and shoot should not be the extent of it), a tweaked camera and a campaign with story and character to ferry players from beginning to end, Combat Elite could have been fantastic. But that's just wishful thinking.As is, WWII Paratroopers is a flawed game with serious problems in critical areas. Progress is slow and painful, combat is too tedious and imprecise to be enjoyable, and the campaigns are strung together far too loosely to do any of the primitive character development any justice.", "date": "Dec 7, 2005"}
