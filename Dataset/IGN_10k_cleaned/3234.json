Around the time of the release of Simpsons Wrestling Fox Interactive put a poll on its website consisting of about half a dozen equally unattractive possibilities -- Simpsons Golf, Simpsons Bowling, Simpsons Skateboarding, and others which we have blotted from our minds.  I guess now we know which idea got the most votes.  Simpsons Skateboarding gives off that kind of vibe -- game design by way of the marketing department.  You could probably guess the balance of this review before reading it.  This is a cheap imitation of Tony Hawk with simplistic level designs, unresponsive controls, terrible graphics, and minimal effective use of the license.  What humor it does contain seems to have been injected by the game's developers on the sly as an antidote to their own boredom.  It is of no value to fans of either the Simpsons or of skateboarding, and I pity any gamer who somehow winds up its unwitting owner.  Gameplay Simpson's Skateboarding contains the usual array of skating challenges, grouped into three different areas.  There's a tutorial mode that teaches tricks and provides an easy way to earn cash (which unlocks bonus features), a free-roaming mode through various Springfield locales, and a series of timed competition levels for unlocking new characters.  The goal design has no very significant problems, because it tries almost nothing new -- all of the goals in the central free-skate mode are simple collection or timed scoring tasks.  The game's controls and level design are another matter entirely.  A shorter list would describe what is not wrong.  The levels contain only the most rudimentary of lines, leaving very little opportunity for the player to create interesting combos.  The trick controls do not help in this regard, because the more complex commands are extremely difficult to pull off in the time allotted (the circular rotations may befuddle even Street Fighter enthusiasts, given how sensitive the inputs are), and even the simpler commands don't detect so well.  In theory, there's a manual command, executed just as in Tony Hawk but in practice the game seems to hardly ever pick it up.  Ollie height is very inconsistent.  On pipes, the player's distance from the lip affects how high an ollie takes them, but the movement of the camera makes that hard to judge, and kinks in the lip collision detection make it easy to bail for no reason when coming off a lip.  Ollies on a flat surface also don't seem to have been reconciled properly with the animation times for flip tricks.  Even after juicing up Bart's jump statistic well above the default, he still couldn't pull off a 360 flip on flat ground at full speed without bailing on the landing.      Load times are another significant problem.  For the most part, loads are one of those things we've gotten used to, seeing as how they're endemic to modern videogames, but Simpsons Skateboarding still manages to stand out from the pack.  Start up the game, and there are actually two different loading screens -- does it have a load time for the load time?  Meanwhile, the tutorial mode has a load between every individual task, some of which take less time to complete than the load that precedes them.  What on earth is taking the time?  The levels are big, certainly, but the models and textures are so simple that they can't be taking up that much space.  If this game had any personality at all, perhaps that could make up in some small part for its failings of gameplay.  Unfortunately, its sense of humor is painfully limited.  Quips abound, but the ratio of laughs to silence is definitely not a favorable one, and there's little intrinsic humor in the levels or goals.    Graphics Though the character models are decent 3D approximations of their cartoon counterparts, the world around them looks more cheap than intentionally cartoonish.  The polygonal structures are extremely simple (check out the boxy cars driving around Springfield), and what surfaces aren't flat-shaded bear only very basic textures.  There isn't much lighting to add depth to the environments, either, giving everything an equally flat, bland look.  In some sense, this may be intentional -- the TV show is pretty flat, after all -- but this is a look that just doesn't come off well in such low-rent 3D.  The heavy aliasing runs entirely counter to the smooth, round-edged look of the show, as do the simple, sharp-edged structures throughout the game environment.  The levels are certainly big enough, but I'd rather they were smaller and looked better, because their design certainly doesn't do much with the space alotted.  Sound This game was apparently tracked by someone with a fondness for light, generic ska music.  It's neither offensive nor especially pleasant -- mostly, it just makes you wonder exactly why they picked that style of music for the game.  Every so often, the music works in a few bars of the Danny Elfman opening theme, which is fun now and again, but that also reminds you how this could have sounded a lot better.  The same goes for the game's voice clips, which, as I said, are pretty uniformly poor.  I'm not sure what possessed the writers of the dialogue (or monologue, actually, since there's little interaction between characters) to think phrases like ~my butt hurts~ were funny, especially with no setup or punchline to bookend them, but a sort of comedy postmortem might yield interesting results.  What's more, the lines don't just come from the player character -- there's also a running commentary from several different characters over each level, just as unfunny as all the rest.Not fun, and not funny.  Thus, this game fails on both levels -- Simpsons and skateboarding.", "date": "Nov 19, 2002"}
