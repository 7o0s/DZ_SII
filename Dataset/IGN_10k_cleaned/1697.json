But it is not in your favor today to outwit the brilliant boy genius mind of Dexter and his incredible scientific creations, for he has mastered the ancient arts of sneaking and being quiet while sneaking, and without the insufferable Dee Dee to stand in the way to the solution to the problem Dexter is invincible and nobody can stop him! And now, for the plan to commence.   Features  Classic Elevator Action design  Play as three different Dexters  Multiple levels, guns, and features  Only for Game Boy Color    Dexter's first adventure on the Game Boy Color tests the boy's skills as an undercover operative as he zips up and down elevator shafts and ducks silently into secret doorways. Sound familiar? It should if you're an arcade gamer of any credit, because Dexter's latest creation is a nicely done expansion of the classic Elevator Action -- BAM licensed Taito's sequel to Elevator Action and added the Cartoon Network characters in the operation. It's a good fit -- Dexter is as good a spy as a scientist, and without the meddling Dee Dee to muck up the laboratory, Dexter's Laboratory: Robot Rampage is classic fun.  The roots of Elevator Action are captured right down to the snappy entrances Dexter makes at the beginning of stages. Pop in and out of elevators as they make their rounds, or ride on top of the cars as they cruise down the building. You can even jump across the open elevator shafts -- just watch out for the elevator, or you'll get crushed. Dexter packs a trusty pistol to snipe robot agents who will sneak in and out of doors and chase him down in a run-down of gunfire. You can even still knock out the lights (which go down with a nice lighting effect impressive on the Game Boy Color hardware).  Taito's update of Elevator Action  is mostly for the better. Dexter can sustain a much greater fall that the original master spy, so dropping a level down an elevator shaft isn't an instant kill. Purists may take issue with this change, as well as the addition of a life bar instead of the one-shot-kills that pumped the original's intensity so much, but the improvements really just take some of the frustration out of the game and keep you in the heat of the action. Gamers will be quickly leaping kitty-corner to the next lower ledge instead of waiting for the elevator -- that's something that couldn't be done before, and it's really tough fun.  Dexter's improved skills over the original Elevator Action also allow the designers to expand and enhance the stages to add variety. Now there are ledges that crumble underfoot, and zip-boxes that whisk Dexter to hidden locations of the lab. The puzzles in Dexter's Lab still take a backseat to the action, but add a lot in the meantime. Also added are new enemies -- none of the robot monsters in this game are any smarter than the faceless thugs in Elevator Action, but now there are low-crawling robot dogs to be extra careful of.  It's a good update of Elevator Action, but more could have been done. Even though there are three outfits for Dexter to choose, his extra robot suits don't help him in gameplay -- a real bummer, since one is a hyper-jet pack. How fun would that have been to fly? The same drat goes to the guns -- of all Dexter's amazing creations, all he could come up with here are simple silly guns that are often more trouble than they are worth. The bombs are particularly unwieldy. Since the action of Elevator Action is in diving into doors and elevators, you could only imagine the incredible boss battles that could be done with this game -- kind of like those Scooby Doo cartoons where people pop out of a dozen doors in a hallway. Unfortunately, stages end with a simple shoot-out with a flood of enemies, and even those aren't very fun for what's going on.   Elevator Action was easily my favorite action game -- the opening rope sequence is permanently etched in my mind. Picking up Dexter's Laboratory: Robot Rampage was a great flashback -- I shot out every lamp I came across, simply because I love doing that.It's a good version of Elevator Action, but this is still a dry and simple game. The atmosphere isn't really zippy like the show, since it's the same few robot enemies and general backgrounds throughout. Mandark does his best to liven things up in between stages with his masterful quips, but he should have made a few more appearances instead of trusting his robots to cause the chaos. And while I appreciate the extra lives and ability to continue (and love the added puzzle challenges), Taito didn't take the chance to fix Elevator Action's one big glitch -- getting into doors is still a pain and a half.But once you stealthily crack into one of those red doors and sneak out with a packet of top secret materials under your arm, or dive across the top of a moving elevator (only to be snagged at the last second and smashed in the darkness), the gameplay takes over. It's not a perfectly executed mission, but with a well-balanced challenge (even young Dexter fans can take on the task, and the violence is tamed for a younger audience) and classic gameplay, Dexter's Laboratory: Robot Rampage can be trusted to get the job done.", "date": "Jan 4, 2001"}
