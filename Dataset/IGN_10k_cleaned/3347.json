Adding three continents, three races, six classes and a variety of quests, monsters and items, it is chock full of Camelot goodness.  Furthering the mythos of each of the three realms, the new islands are full of legendary creatures and quests and move away from the mainlands' more realistic approach.  Walter Yarbrough, the Camelot Live Producer, and Roy P. McCormack, a World Developer, took time out of their busy schedules to show me some of the truly incredible content available on the new lands.   Dark Age of Camelot is set right after the death of King Arthur.  There are three realms that players can choose for their home.  Albion is the land of Arthur with Camelot as its capital city.  Midgard is based upon the Nordic myths.  Hibernia is steeped deeply in Irish Celtic lore.  These three realms wage war over relics and keeps on the frontiers between their homelands in massive player versus player battles.  Since the release, many improvements have been made and new content has been added.  Two new crafting abilities, spellcrafting and alchemy, were recently made available, and lower level players can now participate in realm versus realm combat in level restricted dungeons.  Horses also make travel between distant towns less burdensome.   With Shrouded Isles, there are three new landmasses -- one for each realm -- for adventurers to explore.  Along with these islands, one race and two classes have been added.  Each realm gets a spellcasting class that utilizes pets and a warrior class with special abilities.  For example, Albion's Necromancers are a pet class which cannot be harmed so long as their pet is alive but can only cast spells through their pet.  Valewalkers are a new class added to the ranks of Hibernia and are hybrid mage/warrior that wear cloth robes and fight with a large scythe.  Midgard's Bonedancers can reanimate the remains of dead creatures and eventually can have more than one pet at a time.   The graphics engine got a complete overhaul.  Reflective surfaces, water effects and shadows are all enhancements to be found in the expansion. New music and sound effects add to the ambient atmosphere of the game.  Dungeons and cities are even more immense than they are on the mainlands.  On the new Midgard continent of Aegir, the troll city of Trollheim has been overrun with their enemies, the Morvalt.  It is a vast city with a large number of different experiences, such as the tavern where you'll find inebriated Morvalts who stumble and fight like drunks.  One of the most interesting events I experienced, where a fumbling warlock uses magic he shouldn't and ends up opening a rift that unleashes even more dangerous creatures, is also found in Trollheim.    On each island, there are about 10-20 encounters.  Encounters are events that are triggered once an enemies objective has been met.  Players can influence the encounters at any time by interrupting their enemies movements.  For example, in an encounter designed for levels 15-30 on Avalon, the Drakoran assemble and attack a town.  If players don't help fight the these dragon-like creatures, they take over the town.  Players can direct the non player characters (NPCs) in the town to defend a certain area during the attack.  If the Drakoran successfully defeat all the NPCs, players have to then battle these beasts alone to drive them out before the NPCs will return.  Some of these towns are faction towns, in which players have to gain favor with the NPCs in order to do business with them.  One way to gain favor is to assist them in the defense of their homes.  This is just one way that players can affect the world in a very real and exciting way.   An interesting aspect of the game is the AI of monsters.  Many creatures have been given unique behaviors.  On Hibernia, rocky Granidons lose chunks of stone and become smaller as you battle them.  Some creatures, like the mammoths on Midgard, will actually run away from you as you near them.  There are many new boss monsters that drop unique items.  In addition, three new epic dungeons for high level players and three more dragons - the hardest beasts in the game - have been added, one for each realm.  In the epic quests, new armor can be found and once a set for your class is completed, it gains special properties.   Dark Age of Camelot is still lacking in some areas and the expansion does not address those.  The absence of a map is still a glaring omission.  The new player experience is frustrating, as character development during low levels is very slow and there doesn't seem to be enough quests to do.  However, the game gets really interesting about level 15, so perseverance definitely pays off.    Dark Age of Camelot: Shrouded Isles adds a ton of great new content for existing players.  New encounters, epic quests and dragons will definitely make the non realm versus realm (RvR) aspect of the game more enjoyable.  No RvR features have been added with the expansion because they want to make those kinds of elements available to all players.  Mythic's live team is still working on many areas of the game and adding content.  For existing players who want new content and a great new look, this is a must buy.  For new players, the original game must be purchased in addition to the expansion, so it is not the most inexpensive choice out there.  However, if you have patience and want a truly incredible experience with lots of high level content and desire to engage in massive realm battles, you should spend that little extra and invest in the total package, Dark Age of Camelot and its expansion, Shrouded Isles.", "date": "Dec 20, 2002"}
