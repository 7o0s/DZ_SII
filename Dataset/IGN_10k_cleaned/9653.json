Or Bejeweled, or Dr. Mario. Maybe even the recent Puzzle Quest. But you'd never think of Wrecking Crew, one of the 18 NES launch titles from 1985  even though you should. This is a game starring Mario and Luigi, recast as demolition men and wielding sledgehammers in a crumbling construction site. It has all the markings of an action game or a platformer, and was presented as such in its first release. But that categorization is all wrong. Wrecking Crew is a puzzle game.   Wrecking Crew is a puzzle game because of its ultimate focus, which is finding the right path to progress through an increasingly more complicated set of construction site locations. The way you clear a stage in the game is to destroy everything that's destroyable  and though no thoughtful method is needed to achieve that aim in the first handful of levels, you soon find yourself in situations where just smashing out everything in front of you won't work at all. You'll end up defeating yourself, or getting irreversibly stuck.   Because most levels contain pieces of the environment that serve as transportation for your character, but also have their own elimination as part of the win condition  you have to climb certain ladders, for example, to reach far-off walls, blocks and barrels, but then you also have to destroy those same ladders in order to finish the stage. And those mallets must be heavy, because Mario and Luigi can't execute a jump in this game  there's no leaping out of a trap, then, if you fall into one.   You've got a whole lot of wrecking to get done.  It can boggle your mind, as you're left with the task of selectively avoiding hitting certain objects with your hammer until such time as you don't need them anymore, which means prioritizing destruction of each piece of brick and mortar in the stage from beginning to end, and hoping you got the order right. It can get to be difficult to do. It can get to be puzzling.   And it can be a lot of fun. Because added in to all this decision making is a set of enemies actively hunting you down, fireballs that appear to burn your behind if you dawdle in one location too long, and a villainous foreman named Spike who was essentially Nintendo's 8-bit version of Wario. Racing against the baddies and planning your path to avoid coming into contact with them makes the experience more engaging  particularly the rivalry with Spike. He appears in bonus stages to try to steal extra points out from under your nose, and also makes trouble in several of the core stages by showing up in the background and shattering ladders you were planning to use, sometimes even while you're on them.   Wrecking Crew really is one of Nintendo's underappreciated efforts, and it's even got added functionality here in this Virtual Console version  there's a Design Mode included that allows you to create your own custom levels to play, or to challenge friends with, but the old NES cartridge version couldn't save your creations. Without a battery in the game pak, your design would be lost when you turned off the power. But the VC's Save State feature will keep your level stored for weeks, months and years if you want, so if you come up with a design that's particularly praiseworthy there's no worry over losing it anymore.Puzzle fans should take new notice of Wrecking Crew now, even if they've avoided it before by thinking it's more of an action title. And if they did, it's not surprising  this game hasn't been properly presented in the past. But if gamers who loved Tetris, Bejeweled, Dr. Mario and Puzzle Quest jump on board and give this one a fair amount of downloads, we might also be blessed with its sequel. Wrecking Crew '98 was its name, and it was a late-generation 16-bit effort that never made it out of Japan.  It was a more traditional puzzle game, and featured head-to-head two-player action not unlike the Tetrises and Puyo Puyos of the world. And with the Import category now active and previously Japan-only titles like The Lost Levels and Sin & Punishment already available on the service, its arrival is certainly an excellent possibility  so cash in those 500 Wii Points and support the cause.", "date": "Nov 29, 2007"}
