Matrix Games's Crown of Glory is the latest title to cover the era, offering up a comprehensive simulation of empire management and battlefield action during ten of the most tempestuous years in European history. Players take charge of one of the six main nations in the conflict -- nations like France, England, and Russia -- and endeavor to gain more glory than their rivals.  You obtain glory for your empire in a number of ways, mostly through winning battles and meeting the needs of your population. You'll need to keep morale up on the homefront as well as at the forefront of battle. Morale and military ability are the product of a healthy economy and sound diplomacy. In addition to setting base levels for things like taxes, you can also adjust the overall division of labor (including putting POWs to work), setting draft levels and adjusting just about any other aspect of your empire you can imagine. Since each of the factors is tied to the others, a small change will ripple throughout your empire and it may be months before you start to see the effects of your recent policies.  It's important to improve your provinces whenever possible but unlike games like Imperial Glory, the improvements in Crown of Glory are much more abstract. You'll build up your roads for instance to improve your population. Rather than building up opera houses or museums, you'll just need to click on your ~culture~ box in your development window. And while building up your barracks and factories will help you more quickly build better units, the process is a bit generic. You won't, for instance, build separate foundries or stables; you'll just simply improve the infrastructure overall.  The diplomacy system is very involved. To start with, there's a cool, mad-libs style treaties wizard that you can use to set up just about any deal you want. Just select the type of arrangement you want and you can fill in all the values, creating just about any type of treaty you can think of. Interestingly, you'll also have to put together treaties in order to accept an opponent's surrender. When an opponent gives up the fight, you'll be able to use the treaty wizard to set up the terms. There are also more limited forms of surrender that can be negotiated as well.   You'll also have diplomats that can move around the map and influence all sorts of things. Diplomats can penetrate and generate fog of war for the province they're in, as well as adjusting the attitude of neighboring countries. Most interestingly, diplomats can actually stop battles before they start, giving you an extra month to shift the battle in your favor.  Though you'll be missing out on much of the fun of the game, you can opt to have nearly every aspect of your empire managed for you. You can select which areas are automatically managed individually, opting out of controlling just the diplomatic options, or the economic ones. While it's not the way to play if you want to get everything out of the game you can, it's a nice way to ease into the experience and learn the ins and outs of each system one by one.  There are some problems with the whole empire management aspect of the game. To begin with, there need to be many more summary screens that let you see, at a glance, what's going on across your empire. Instead you'll have to piece the big picture together yourself from the small details you pick up in each province. On the subject of provinces, it's just confusing that each province has its own city. Sometimes the game will refer to a location by the city but the name of the city isn't readily apparent on the game map. It might sound trivial but having to remember that Berlin is in Brandenberg makes it hard to stay oriented. Also on the issue of presentation, the lack of any description of the game advances means you'll have to have the manual handy.  You'll have a number of provinces under your control at the start of the game and a number of neighbors who are interested in taking them from you. The nations all start with massive armies so you can start carving out an empire right away. Though the point of the game is to amass huge armies, sustaining them can be a real headache. You'll have to build supply depots in a chain extending from your borders to your armies in the field. Since these depots can be attacked, you'll need to protect your supply lines. Alternatively, you can split your army up and have them live off the land. This has the added benefit of disrupting your enemy's economy but it leaves you forces a little more vulnerable. A really neat twist is that you can actually have your soldiers forage in your own territories. It'll hurt morale, but sometimes it's cheaper than paying to support them by other means.      Though the empire management aspects of the game are engaging, the detailed battlefield combat sequences are more enjoyable. Players will find their forces arrayed on a hex-based battlefield that's generated according to where the battle is taking place (snow in Moscow, desert in Egypt, for instance) and affected by local weather conditions. Battles are played out in 40-minute turns and can last a few days depending on the sizes of forces involved. A simple interface makes it very easy to move units from one area to another or to issue formation and facing changes.  The whole combat system is wonderfully detailed. The maps are composed with loads of terrain features, from forests to rivers to cities. Fog of war and line of sight considerations also come into play as do things like weather and the time of day. All of these factors influence how effective your soldiers' actions are, from charging an infantry square to lobbing cannon balls at troops garrisoned inside a city.  The tactical battles aren't based on completely eliminating your enemy. In fact, actually killing an entire division takes a hell of a long time. The real objective is to break your enemy's spirit and create enough disorder that he retreats. Trying to maintain cohesive formations and boost morale is your main focus here, since confident, unified formations are going to be more effective than those that are shaken or scattered. You'll also have to manage resupply to make sure that your units have the ammunition they need to continue fighting.  There are a few weak points to the battle engine. For one thing, the whole experience is a little clunky. Even on my Alienware, the game still seems to stutter fairly regularly. The lack of a save function is another big pain, especially during longer battles, but the developers have told me that they plan to add this feature in the next patch. The minimap is completely useless as well.  If the idea of running the battle yourself seems a bit daunting, you can always opt for the Quick Combat option. Here each of the forces will line up in one of three columns: charge, attack and defend. Units you place in the charge column get an offensive bonus, while those in the defensive column get a defensive bonus. The game quickly simulates multiple rounds of combat in real time. Units will be forced out the battle through casualties or morale loss. Some disordered units can even rally and rejoin the ranks.   This Quick Combat mode removes a lot of control but it really speeds up battles quite a bit. It's particularly useful when you've got a huge advantage over your enemy and just don't feel like running through the motions of the detailed battle. Though it's not documented in the manual, you can also turn control of your forces over to the AI during detailed battles but the resolution takes quite a bit long than the Quick Combat option. While I like the convenience of the Quick Battle, it's a bit hard to take in the whole picture. A short slider that shows which way the advantage is leaning would definitely help keep you oriented to the progress of the battle.  Graphically, Crown of Glory isn't anything special. The graphics are perfectly functional but they really don't stand out on their own. The strategic map is very dry and flat. The use of stronger colors would definitely help distinguish between the various types of provinces on the map. Though you'll see movement arrows as you're issuing orders, I would have liked to have seen some indicator of where all my units are heading during a given turn.  The detailed battle screens are a little bit better but they still could use some work. There are plenty of terrain features but some of them are too abstract. The towns for instance, are rendered as brown blocks. On the other hand, I really like the range of features here. The designers have included lots of different types of trees and in the winter you can even see bare trees scattered across the map. The hexes transition from one to another very nicely too. If it weren't for the actual hex lines, you'd hardly notice the hexes at all.      It's easy to tell the units apart here and the sprites are nicely detailed. You won't get a lot of animations here and some of the just don't make sense -- charging infantry rear back as if they've been shot, for instance. On the plus side, you'll see some cool fire effects. I like the fact that smoke from volleys lingers on the battlefield and even obscures line of sight. After a particularly big battle, you're likely to see a massive cloud of smoke hanging over the battle.  Soundwise, Crown of Glory gets the job done. A great classical score runs through the whole game. Sometimes it's take on a rousing, military character; other times it's more meditative and subdued. Some of the cues manage to mar this effect however: when nations surrender you'll hear something that sounds like a MIDI train whistle. The battle sounds add a lot to the experience as well. Hearing the tramp of boots, the crack of muskets and the shouts of soldiers definitely puts you in the thick of the battle.  Finally, the game has offered me a few spectacular crashes. Thankfully, the game seems to crash only when I'm trying to exit anyway, but it's still annoying as hell. Crown of Glory will be an enjoyable experience for wargamers. It offers a wide range of experiences, from tinkering with your nation's economy and labor force to actually leading your troops into battle. Both aspects of the experience are solidly designed but the battlefield sequences have a more obvious sort of appeal. As a whole, the game has a pretty steep learning curve, particularly when it comes to the larger issues of empire management (another reason the battlefield bits are initially more interesting).Gamers who prefer a little more excitement in terms of presentation will find Crown of Glory a little dull. The visuals offer little beyond what you'd get in a tabletop game and the strategic sequences are pretty lifeless overall. But just because the packaging lacks a sense of color and style, that doesn't mean that there's not a worthwhile game system lying underneath it all.", "date": "Jul 11, 2005"}
