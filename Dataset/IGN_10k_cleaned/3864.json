As veteran conductors and martial artists will tell you, it's all about follow through, how you take the energy you've gathered and utilize it with a minimum of waste.  Lionheart, alas, is an RPG in which a lot of ideas are mixed together, and the results dissipate through lack of focus.  There are certainly things to admire in the game, and many others to make you grind your teeth in frustration.  I'll be going out in a bit to get a seta of false ones, but first let's take a look at Lionheart so we can gnash in tandem.   Character Creation  This is where you start: building your PC.  Lionheart uses the ~Special~ system, first developed for Fallout.  It's an excellent means of generating far more complex RPG characters than usual, through a series of several simultaneous, numerical tracks.  The first is attributes: Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck.  The second is perks.  These are positive tweaks to your character that you begin choosing at the second level, and continue every third level after that.  Most are carefully tied to a logical background through suitable descriptions, giving them a substantial rather than dry, statistical feel; for example, Superior Senses: You have been given a gift of superior senses owing to the ancient tribal worship of your ancestors.  This perk gives you a +1 bonus to Perception and +15 skill points in Find Traps/Secret Doors.   You can also select traits, which are only available at the beginning of the game.  They're similar to perks, being characteristics that help define an individual, but are double-edged.  Thus, Nasty Disposition decreases your Speech and Barter, while raising your abilities with one- and two-handed weapons.  Choosing a race, in turn, allows you a selection of special racial traits (except for the boring Purebloods, who are human without any interesting alloy of magic in their ancestry).  In Lionheart, as in Arcanum, you'll find that the reactions of some natives are governed by your racial appearance.  A Demonkin with a scaly hide, for example, is likely to be shunned by many people in Barcelona, stronghold of the anti-magical Inquisition.     But the core of the Special system lies in its skills.  In Lionheart, these fit into five general categories: Combat, Thieving, and three magical disciplines: Divine, Thought, and Tribal.  Each of the magical disciplines possesses several subdivisions with their own set of five spells, each.  As you earn experience and make levels, you gain points to distribute among skills, improving them.  You can also tag three skills at game's start.  These are skills whose improvement comes at a much lower point cost.   One final, very nice touch.  You get to select a Spiritkind when you start the game.  This is an elemental, demonic, or bestial spirit, who resides in your body and only comes out from time to time to explain things and advance the plot a bit.  The dialog is flavorful, and different for each choice; so that the demonic spirit is droll and lightly mocking, while the elemental spirit is reasonable and sympathetic.  It's essentially cosmetic, of course, but cost far less to make than any number of boring cut scenes; and it's better integrated with the game's regular screens then all those animated movie bits which have zip to do with the normal look-and-feel of gameplay.  (Dedicated roleplayers may note a similarity between the Spiritkind and the four distinctive familiars of Lands of Lore III.  The latter, though, not only possessed distinctive personalities, but also unique skills, reasonably good AI and combat abilities.)    I strongly enjoy the Special system, and have done so since it was first developed.  I liked its adaptation in Arcanum, although I think it's demonstrable that the game's balance was skewed in favor of non-magical PCs.  (In fact, there's been a very good player mod released that deals with precisely this issue.  If you're interested, you can find it at https://www.terra-arcanum.com/~chris/.)  But the core of the system, the reason why it has worked for so long, lies in how it plays out for a host of original combinations.  You could have a charismatic lockpick without combat skills in Arcanum who still wins, because others would join and fight their battles for them.  It didn't always work as well as it should in theory, since Arcanum relied upon poor follower AI in battle (unlike Fallout Tactics or Jagged Alliance 2, where you directed each member of your team), but in essence you could still remain at the back of your line, protected, firing off spells or ranged weapons, while your people rushed in, screaming and bleeding.  Go, team!    That's not possible in Lionheart.  Nowhere are you told this fact, but if you don't slip plenty of serious points into aggressive melee and/or combat spell skills from an early point in the game, you're royally (no pun intended) screwed.  Lionheart doesn't support NPC parties like so many other RPGs.  You can bring a few quest givers and the very occasional follower into your group, but they merely hang around.  There's no dialog with them, as there is in the Baldur's Gate or the Fallout series, in Arcanum, Planescape: Torment...even in Ultima VI and VII.  In fact, if you click on an NPC in your party, you'll find that they've lost their individuality as soon as they joined you, and each is simply identified as a generic follower.  You can't access their inventory, and they'll never make levels as you will.  Fighting?  Only until they die, which is with great alacrity.  Face it: everything in Lionheart has to be done on your own.  You can certainly create that charismatic locksmith, or a diplomatic merchant, but once you get outside Barcelona, you'll die quickly, endlessly, and curse all the hours you've dropped into such a worthless PC.  The be-anything-you-want-and-win philosophy of the Special system is severely compromised in Lionheart.   The Story, the Quests  Let's keep our recounting of the background, basic.  In the game's historical chronology, Richard the Lionhearted committed a terrible crime back during the Third Crusade.  As a result, magic (including all sorts of demons, dragons, and other diabolical riffraff) invaded our world from other dimensions.  Now, in the tail end of the 16th century, hordes of ravening demons are being fought everywhere.  Western and Central Europe are ruled by the Spanish Inquisition, with the Papacy, under their control, reduced to a figurehead.  Magic is barely tolerated, and war looms with England.  But meanwhile, a Horrible EvilTM lurks beneath it all, seeking to throw wide the dimensional rift that Richard briefly cracked open and closed.  Only you, the Chosen...excuse me, the Bhaalspa...beg pardon, I mean the Descendent of Lionheart, can destroy the Dread Nasty, and stop doom from harrowing forth.  Nothing especially interesting, there, but still, it's workable.   Your initial escape from danger takes you to Barcelona, a huge city and the center of the Inquisition.  While roaming its streets and sewers, you get to perform quests and join one of four major factions, as well as optionally handling some independent tasks and becoming a member of a few other separate organizations.     The quests in themselves aren't bad.  But as in Arcanum and the Fallout series, it seems as though everybody is willing confide in you, a stranger, for the eventual solution to all their major problems.  That never bothered me in Fallout, or, for that matter, the original Wasteland, Fallout's prototype utilizing some of the same design team, which I reviewed in 1988.  But when it's historical figures that act in this fashion, my sense of illusion admittedly shatters.  After all, these are real people.  We expect them to act sensibly.  Problems arise, for me, at least, when they don't.   For example, you'll quickly find Nicolo Machiavelli in a private dwelling of Barcelona's Temple District, within fifteen minutes of starting a new game.  He tells you right away that he wants to achieve high office in Spain, so that he can betray the nation and free the Italian states which are now under its rule.  Thus we have a philosopher/writer renowned for his worldliness and cynicism (though no worse, in reality, than many others of his day, as any good history of one of the Italian Renaissance city states will demonstrate), revealing to a person he's just met his plans to commit treason against his land-of-residence.  And if that's not enough to strain credulity, he offered my PC a job as bodyguard: me, an unknown figure, about whom he literally knows nothing.  Except what he could see; and given that my newbie character at the time had no armor, as well as Strength and Perception scores of 3, I must have looked like a myopic, starving ferret.  (Lionheart should really have taken experience, armor, or at least appearance derived from attributes into account when apportioning quests.)  I laughed in disbelief when all this occurred.    Machiavelli's quest is dealt with in the most primitive way possible.  He suspects someone wants him dead.  (Considering that he just gave away his most intimate secrets to a stranger, I wonder why?)  So you need to check his house and its surroundings for assassins.  Of course, there's nobody in the small dwelling, but as soon as you step outside, there are cries from within.  You return to find five assassins who have popped out of nowhere, just as assassins are supposed to do.    And this is where another problem crops up in Lionheart that repeatedly shows its unpretty face: a lack of careful balance in the progression of quest difficulty.  Fallout 1 and 2 carefully let you test both the combat system and your freshly made character on very simple monsters for the first few quests.  Similarly, Baldur's Gate 2 doesn't give you access to its Underdark caverns full of mind flayers until your team has gotten some nice items and grown a spine.  In both the non-linear Wizardry and Might and Magic series, the easiest monsters are always the nearest, while card-carrying members of the legendary evils club are the most distant.   But Machiavelli is very close to the starting area of your journey through Barcelona.  Nothing is around to tell the brand new character, unbloodied in any combat, that this isn't a challenge worth taking at that point; and it's the easiest thing in the world to accept his offer without understanding what that entails.  Throughout Lionheart, there's a mix of easy and tough challenges in any given area, with no perceivable way to distinguish which are unsuited to your present character configuration until your body gets hacked into tiny little briquettes.   Graphics, Sound and Interface  The game doesn't look that different from most 2D RPGs which have appeared since Fallout and the original Baldur's Gate.  The isometric field of vision is from a somewhat higher perspective than we're used to, which means that characters appear smaller, smudgier, and less distinct.  On the positive side, a lot of effort clearly went into the artwork of Barcelona, and I like the fact that each NPC you speak with has a separate face that appears in the interface bar.  (Of course, some of the portraits are identical.  There are plenty of generic guards and inquisitors who get the same features.)     On the downside, movement is a mess.  Everybody walks at an unnaturally swift pace like the figures in a silent movie shown at the wrong frame rate on a sound projector: you, the guards, the monsters you face in battle, the NPCs you're trying to click on to establish conversation as they scurry away.  I have to wonder whether the sped-up effect wasn't an attempt to cover for the dismal animations.  Far too few frames are used, resulting in figures that, even at their current hyper-caffeinated rate, move in a jerky, stick-figure fashion.  (Your own character looks silly even at rest, with one leg stuck out like a goose step frozen in time.)  Occasionally they glide across the ground, as well, out of sync with the speed they're supposed to possess.  This simply isn't acceptable, especially in a game produced by Black Isle Studios.   For some reason, Reflexive keeps you from clicking ahead of your character more than a few feet to indicate a new destination, even in an area that has been completely explored.  Whether the cause was lack of time to develop decent pathfinding algorithms or not, this really slows down travel.  (So does the absence of any Run command.)  While it's true you can jump to the other side of an area quickly by clicking on the automap, your character can't follow, even if you've explored there, before.  All you can do is look around before moving back to the stationary figure.   And speaking of automaps: why did the developers issue a game whose first major series of areas is a large city, without any kind of auto-labeling or user notes?  There are many dozen important locations scattered throughout Barcelona, above and below ground, and few players really want to return to the days when we took notes in longhand.  I have to wonder whether Reflexive rushed Lionheart out the door to meet deadlines, or simply didn't canvas a large, outside team of beta-testers for the features they felt were absolutely essential for a modern RPG.   The control bar is attractive but unwieldy, and takes up the bottom third of the main screen.  It's where you can access your skills, perks, quick slots, profile, dialog, actions, status, journal, map, sneak, search, picklock, pause, attack, inventorythere's more, but my word processor is running out of breath.  Regardless, all of this tends to get in the way of the field of your vision, especially when you leave Barcelona and find yourself in the middle of dozens of slavering monsters.  Your field of vision is vital, there: imagine playing Diablo with the bottom third of your screen obscured.  You can always use the F2 quick key to toggle the control bar off, but once in direct combat it's automatically toggled back on to take advantage of quick spell and item slots.    By contrast, I like the way dialog is displayed.  The addition of special icons alongside your reply options is a great idea; so that if a remark of yours is only allowable because you have a high Attribute, Speech or Barter skill, an appropriate icon will reveal this.  There's also a small sword icon that keeps you from stumbling in conversation into combat, unless of course that's your desire.  Another icon notes the proper reply to secure a quest.    The music, too, is excellent.  Inon Zur has a gift for establishing just the right mood in the brief musical excerpts that recycle throughout a computer game.  He has developed as recognizable a style for the Interplay brand as did George ~The Fatman~ Alistair Sanger for Origin Systems in its glory days, and Jeff Briggs (now CEO and President of Firaxis; fine positions for someone who knows his Guillaume de Machaut) for Microprose.  His classically inflected score for Lionheart remains resolutely modern, but in its rhythmic figurations and harmonic progressions indirectly recall such Spanish and Italian Renaissance masters as Sanz, Molinaro and Borrono. The voiceover talent, cast and directed by Chris Borders, is first-rate, as well.  The Castillian Spanish accents sound natural, and the acting is quite good.  However, the effect is occasionally cheapened by the endless looping of a given word or phrase during combat.  (And if I never hear Machiavelli crying, ~Help!~ every two seconds for the rest of my life, I shall live it in relative contentment.)   There are some very nice ideas in this game that shouldn't go unnoticed.  For example, clicking on a closed door not only opens it, but places you inside.  Who wouldn't prefer that to the annoying re-click necessary in the Baldur's Gate games, along with the possibility of accidentally re-closing the door when you click a second time?  Then there's opening chests.  Bashing isn't supported, which makes sense; while you can only try a lockpick and fail three times in succession on any given container.  Any further attempts will automatically fail, until you somehow upgrade your skill level.  This gets around the ridiculously endless attempts that may produce one good result out of twenty tries in such games as Baldur's Gate or Knights of the Old Republic.   Pickpocketing and shoplifting, those old standbys of the RPG thief, are missing from Lionheart, but then you wouldn't expect to find them in a heavily policed city ruled by the Spanish Inquisition, would you?  Still, I wish those skills had been replaced with something else equally suitable to the thiefly creed.  Perhaps an extortion skill that enabled you at a sufficient level to hit up merchants for a small percentage of the take?  (There's an extortion quest in Lionheart, but it's so mild and brief it barely qualifies as a misdemeanor, let alone a felony.)  Gambling, too, could have been included; not as a skill, but as a sub-game, like Arcomage in Might and Magic VII and VIII, or Pazaak in Knights of the Old Republic.  After all, historically speaking, gambling was as much of an addictive ~vice~ in Renaissance Spain as drinking was throughout recorded history in Russia.     Combat, or the Dangers of Multiple Personality Disorder  Perhaps the most puzzling part about Lionheart is the fact that it's two very different games at different times, appealing to largely distinct audiences.  While you're in Barcelona, Lionheart is a hardcore RPG, with all that involves: dialog, merchants, quests, fighting, more dialog, seeing the sights...I've mentioned dialog, right?  But once you step outside Barcelona, you'll find only one much smaller town, Montaillou, a few scattered merchants, an abbey, and endless combat in realtime.  This latter section of Lionheart feels like a clone of Diablo, right down to the hordes of monsters meant to overwhelm you.   Divine Divinity attempted a similar mix of roleplaying and action elements.  It accomplished this better than Lionheart by interspersing numerous distinctive cities and battlefields, and by cutting some slack in battle to the player who after all, comes to these games as a roleplaying fan.  So there were always a small number of monsters on screen at any time; and if they started to gather in your area, attracted by the noise, you could always outrun them.  The enormous amount of enemies converging on you in Lionheart are something else entirely.  You can't outpace them, either.  Similarly, you could quickly move the edges of your screen in Divine Divinity using the mouse, and get a sense about what was lurking at the edge of your field of vision.  In Lionheart, the screen moves sluggishly, and with a pronounced lag when you hit its edge with your mouse.  Since nothing else in the game is slow, it's almost as though it were an aesthetic choice.  If so, it was a bad one.    You can pause the game to swap weapons, select spells, and consume potions, but you can't target monsters while paused.  This is problematic because many spells and all ranged weapons are target-based, and your enemies in Lionheart move (like everyone) at an insanely fast pace.  Similarly, you could always teleport away in Divine Divinity after exhausting your magic, healing yourself and replenishing your spell energy in sleep.  There's no rest option in Lionheart.  Both health and mana regeneration take forever on their own.  You can use potion to speed recovery, but these definitely can't handle even a fraction of the combat outdoors.  You can also use the mana power ups of spirit orbs that no one else can see, but some areas lack them entirely.  Even action players might wince at the way Reflexive has stacked the odds against the player in Lionheart's great outdoors.  RPGers would have some reason to wonder why the game genre has so suddenly and relentlessly shifted.  There's a lot to praise, and a lot to criticize, in Lionheart.  The Special character creation system, dialog icons, the atmospheric music and background graphics, the tree display for skills and perks, the ability to control attack frequency, the limit on lockpick retries: these are all positives.  But against these, we have to place the lack of automap labeling and notes, the awkward control bar, quest imbalances, no resting to regain health/mana, abysmal animations, the inability to set a moderate destination for character movement, the absence of party members and dialog, the inability to target while paused in combat, ridiculously quick movement of all characters, the inability to save a game on top of a previous save and the slow, lagging mouse movement of the main screen.  Lionheart feels like a good game got lost somewhere en route, and ended up being pushed out the door with some basic features missing.But the problem of deciding what kind of game it really wants to be, RPG or Diablo clone, is probably the most serious problem its got.  There's certainly much more real gameplay in Lionheart than in, say, Valhalla Chronicles or Gorasul, but I can't help thinking the developers misunderstood what gamers enjoy.  Action addicts who like to hack-and-slash their way through an entire game don't want to be bothered with nonstop dialog choices and non-combat skills, while those players who want roleplaying depth really don't enjoy endless hack-and-slash.  For the roleplayer, combat is part of the necessary mix that makes a new environment so enticing; but it shouldn't consume your character's life in the fashion it does once you leave Barcelona, in Lionheart.  We roleplayers also like our combat furnished in a less sadistic manner which gives non-twitch gamers at least a slight chance of success. (Change the game difficulty, you say?  There isn't any such control in the options panel.)  Failure to do so may brand us all as wimps in Reflexive's eyes, but there will be a lot less adventurers in Inquisitorial Espaa if nothing's done in a patch to rectify the situation.", "date": "Aug 26, 2003"}
