The experience is not nearly the same, though, as pinball is a very hands-on experience -- with the those bells and buzzers that Elton John sings of expertly in his rendition of ~Pinball Wizard.~  Features:  Thrilling pinball action... ...in space!  Space Taxi Pinball is a classic underachieving game.  Too bad it doesn't help that it has two things working against it -- neither especially the fault of publisher Pulse. Cell phone tech just doesn't seem to have the guts to carry off fast-moving action, and there's a certain disconnect that happens when pinball is stripped of it's tangible, third dimension.  With video game pinball, you have to put your trust in the game to accurately recreate real-life ball physics. And, well, as we all know -- it's mighty hard to trust the computer to not screw you in any way possible.  If Conflict: Desert Storm II can't manage sane AI, how can you trust an itty-bitty cell phone game to handle ball physics?  And, let's face it, after a few minutes with Space Taxi Pinball, your trust will not be rewarded. At no point while playing Space Taxi Pinball will you feel like you actually have complete control over where the ball is going, like you do with a real pinball table.  At least the flippers feel somewhat responsive. One of the most deadly things you can find in video pinball is a set of flippers that don't seem to move very fast. In real pinball, when you slam a flipper, you expect it to jump and shoot the ball. In Space Taxi Pinball, you press the button you make the flipper, well, flip -- but without the varying degrees of pressure, it really limits your choices on where you can to put the ball.  Visually, Space Taxi Pinball is not the most attractive pinballer on the market.  For one thing, there's only one table in the game.  That's likely because of the size restraint of downloads, but still -- one usually hopes for multiple tables with video pinball.  The table we do get is cute, we suppose, but not especially inventive. The space taxi theme does come across, however, so at least there's that.  Bottom line, though, is if you're a fan of video pinball -- look elsewhere. All you get with Space Taxi Pinball is a middling video pinball game.  Right now, there are three far superior games on the Game Boy Advance (Pinball of the Dead, Pokemon Pinball, Sonic Pinball Party) that will sate your needs much better.  Pinball is a hard enough genre to crack on a console -- you're never quite sure if you can trust the ball physics, and it seems like the flippers never put the ball just where you want it. Now, if a pinballer on, say, the GBA doesn't inspire confidence, how do you think a cell pinballer fares? Space Taxi Pinball is certainly entertaining for a few plays, but ultimately, you just never believe you're in full control.  And that's a killer for a pinball game.", "date": "Nov 5, 2003"}
