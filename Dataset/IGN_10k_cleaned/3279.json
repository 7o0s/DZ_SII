But things are slowly changing. First EA's NCAA Football 2003 arrived offering a better experience than the latest Madden. Now, NCAA College Basketball 2K3 has hit Xbox and PS2, providing more fun and a stronger atmosphere than NBA 2K3. The collegiate game has arrived and while perhaps not gaining financial dominance in the market, both these college games make a strong statement with superior gameplay and presentation styles over their pro counterparts. NCAA College Basketball 2K3 has its flaws, but is also one of the best sports games this year.Features Over 300 Division 1-A teams Deep scouting and recruiting options help you keep your team stocked with quality players Legacy Mode puts you in the coaches shoes as you try and work your way from lower-end schools to the cream of the crop Import graduating players into your NBA 2K3 franchise The most true college hoops experience on the market Challenge friends online 5.1 Dolby Digital  PresentationNCAA comes to the court with over 300 Division 1-A teams, 60 school-specific fight songs, a slew of team-specific chants, and many accurate arenas. Like most other Sega Sports games released this year, NCAA uses the new ESPN license to offer ESPN-style overlays and menu music. Gone are all remnants of Sega oval menus, replaced by friendlier and more familiar menus lists. But, unlike NBA and NFL 2K3, there's no graphical menu representation in Legacy Mode, just more lists. That lack of consistency between titles can be accepted the first year, next year there should be no excuse for failing to have a uniformed look between all Sega Sports titles.While the numbers are impressive as far as schools and songs, NCAA impresses most with its overall college feel. From gameplay to graphics to sound, this is as close to the college hoops experience as any game has ever gotten. If you love the college game, you will love NCAA College Basketball 2K3.That said, NCAA College Basketball 2K3 has a few presentation problems. There are plenty of teams not included in NCAA hoops. However, many of these teams are also missing from EA's March Madness 2003 (out only for PS2) meaning that it's likely some weird licensing issue and not something to be hung on Sega's head. But where March Madness chooses not to include these teams in any way, Sega places fake teams with similar names into those conferences. For example, instead of UC Riverside (which for whatever reason isn't in the game), Sega created Riverside State. While it's not the actual college, it's important to have a college take its place. Losing one or two teams from a conference certainly alters the dynamics. This way, while there is no UC Riverside, the Big West Conference maintains ten teams.The more troubling problem comes with proper recreation of some of the big teams. All uniforms seem incredibly similar and on a closer examination, while the school colors are correct, unis are close but not very exacting replicas, which is unfortunate. Sure, for smaller schools that's okay, but Duke and Kentucky should be given extra care. Speaking of such, the major schools' stadiums were given high attention in their recreation. But, even this wasn't done quite perfectly. Kentucky, a top-tier school, has a very stupid mistake in the court design. Kentucky's insignia and floor highlights are North Carolina powder blue and not the dark blue of Kentucky. How could something that obvious get screwed up? As cool as the presentation is, big mistakes like that, things that anyone and their mother would have noticed, hurt NCAA's authentic feel.And lastly, after winning the NCAA Championship, there's no extra cookie for your efforts. No quick cut-scene of cutting down the net, no crowds or even your team storming the court, nothing but the picture of a trophy (with no trophy case to be placed in for later viewing). How long would it really take to make a quick ~cut down the net~ scene? Certainly it's not a hard thing to do, it's just a matter of effort. And here that effort isn't made. To be fair, this lack of effort is something we've seen far too much from just about every sports game since the dawn of time. Someone's got to start rewarding gamers for winning the big game -- will it be Sega or EA who has the brains to do it first and do it for every game?GameplayCollege and pro hoops are quite different. Aside from the obvious things (college games are divided into halves not quarters, college has a longer shot clock) there are plenty of subtler differences that a developer could easily overlook. But NCAA College Basketball 2K3 nails all of these nuances with the kind of exactness we've come to expect from Sega Sports.Defenses play zone, slashing to the basket isn't very easy, and playing to your team's strength and using your bench are vital to success. Though it uses the NBA 2K3 engine, NCAA doesn't play much like its pro sibling. Where EA's two hoops games play and look nearly identical, Sega created a true college gameplay experience.While you can certainly play a fast break offense, defenses are actually much tougher in NCAA. There are a few less crazy crossovers and while there are some fantastic dunks, it's not as easy to break through and dunk with every player on your team. Where you can get by in NBA 2K3 playing the superstar game where one player shoots most of your shots and gets most of your points, you won't get far in NCAA without passing and playing a more team-complete game. Yes, there are sky-high alley-oops, 360 slams, and half-court prayer shots that win championships, but in-between these you need to create space, find the open man, and take advantage of your opponent's mistakes. Playing NCAA College Basketball 2K3 like it was NBA 2K3 is a natural occurrence the first time you pick the game up, but if you don't change your play style, you will never cut down the net.It's this complete adjustment to gameplay that's so impressive and makes NCAA endearing. It's familiar enough that any NBA 2K veteran can pick it up and play instantly, but is quite specifically geared towards the college game. Where NBA 2K3 relied a bit too heavily on its realistic angle, NCAA offers a more balanced experience and, frankly, a more enjoyable one. It's this simple: I love this game.The GoodnessWhile NCAA College Basketball 2K3 features the NBA 2K3 engine, it offers a mixture of improvements and back-steps. Some of the improvements added to NBA 2K3 are actually done better here and others seem to have not made it at all.The ability to change your shot on dunks and layups is there as is the properly adjusted shot percentage (no more 70% shooting nights for you!). On the improved side, the passing is a lot better in NCAA. That's not to say it's perfect, but it's much easier to hit a player in stride. The default control set-up uses the right stick for analogue passing and there is no button to call up passing icons. Switching to the other control options will allow for passing icons, which remains the safest and most accurate way to throw a pass. But the best addition is the hotkey that passes to the player closest to the basket. This allows for quick passes into the post and also allows for more fast break opportunities as you can make outlet passes to the lead man quickly. And it even makes it easy to pass the ball back to the trailer; A great option that helps passing and brings a better flow to the game.Also improved is the dive action. In NBA 2K3, when the ball is loose on the floor you can only dive for it if it's going out of bounds. But in NCAA you can dive after just about any loose ball. So when a ball is swatted away by a defender and is bouncing towards half-court, just press the circle button and you'll lunge at it. You'll see a couple of loose ball scrambles each game and that's plenty to put a smile on my face.My favorite of the goodies, however, is the momentum meter. This meter remains constant in the bottom right corner of the screen, below the score, throughout the game. As a team sinks shots, gets steals, and blocks shots, momentum begins to swing in their favor. Go on a 10-0 run to start the second half and you'll likely fill up the meter in your favor. To counter this, the other team can makes shots (duh) or take time outs, which can sometimes cool off the other team. This doesn't just affect the flow of the game, as a team with momentum is more likely to continue its run of lucky bounces, but the crowd reacts to momentum as well. A home team with a lot of momentum earns louder cheers and a more excited crowd. However, when the visiting team comes in and starts dropping three-point bombs, the crowd grows silent. In fact, where the crowd may wave signs and chant ~Brick~ when a visiting player is shooting free throws, when the momentum is against them, you may see just a single person in the crowd waving a sign and no one will be able to muster a single taunt. That's the kind of cool feature that deserves expletives to describe it. Insert your own where you feel appropriate. I'll merely say, ~That's awesome.~Trouble in ParadiseWith these additions and refinements come a few things that have not been fixed or that are just bad all on their own, without help from the NBA 2K series. While NCAA doesn't have nearly the number of goaltends as the nefarious NBA 2K2, you will see plenty of absurd ones, mainly off of rebounds. It's incredibly annoying, especially since it hinders your aggressiveness on the boards. Where in NBA 2K3 a player under the backboard will step out and shoot, in NCAA they will shoot into the back of the backboard or straight up into the rim. Ugh. Inbound passes can also go quite errant at times, but if you want you can lie to yourself and say that's just the college game.Two other nagging issues affect every single game. First there are no sliders, so you can't directly adjust any part of the game that you might feel needs personal tweaking. This includes foul calling. I mention this because there are far, far, far too few fouls in NCAA College Basketball 2K3. Granted the college game sees less fouls, but you will only see three or four fouls in an entire half from both teams combined. And a bit more troubling is some bad coaching AI. Computer coaches will sometimes use all their timeouts in the first five minutes of a game and other times won't use a timeout until a minute left in the second half. Substitutions are handled well, but some late game decisions are questionable.For example, you may have a situation where the computer-controlled team is down by six points with a forty-five seconds left. They've got to score quickly, but instead they waste a half-minute passing back and forth, not trying to force some openings, as if they had the lead and were trying to run down the clock. Also, as time in the first half ticks down, often the computer player won't take a buzzer shot. I don't care what the score is, kids always launch from half court when there's two seconds left.If you add up all these problems, it does hurt NCAA a bit, but the overall success of the college gameplay far overshadows these problems. It's certainly less troubled than NBA 2K2 and has some improvements over NBA 2K3, but NCAA's still got some issues.Legacy ModeLegacy Mode is the entree to some fine gameplay appetizers. Truly the meat of the game, Legacy Mode is the franchise mode for NCAA. When starting you have a fundamental choice -- do you want ~career~ on or off? With career off you can choose any team to coach and you'll be coach of that team for the life of your Legacy. That's dandy for anyone wanting to hop in and play as a coach of their alma matter or favorite team. But that's not where Legacy shines.With career on, you'll create your own rookie coach and work your way up the college ranks gaining respect and getting jobs at other schools. Oh, and you can be fired for under-performing. You'll still play the games and such, you're only coach in terms of recruiting and setting line-ups. When starting your coaching career, you'll have about a dozen or so choices, all for schools that will rarely see the outer brackets of the NCAA Tournament. Your seasonal goals will be things such as win half your games, win more games than last year and when you are at better schools, be ranked in the top 25, win the conference title.As a coach, you'll have a job security meter, which will adjust each year based on your team's performance. Achieve your goal and you'll get added security and tougher goals. You can actually fail a goal but gain security if your team still performs well. You may, for example, not win your requisite 70% of games, but winning the conference title will more than make up for this. Do well for a few years and other teams will give you offers. Do bad long enough and you'll be fired, forced to choose from a trifecta of lesser teams.Scouting and RecruitingRecruiting is a stroke of genius. Eight weeks into the season you can begin scouting players across the nation. Each state (we have fifty of them in case you didn't know) tends to grow a certain type of player. New York, for instance, tends to grow slashing guards. This is all an invention of developer Kush Games, selecting certain player types for each region. It's a great idea. Players are often more likely to play close to home, so where your school is located affects, in some ways, the type of team you can create. You've got to adjust your coaching style (a series of sliders that influences recruits and player development) to match your team each year.The final six weeks of the season offer another unique experience. You can participate in regional high school all-star games. This way, rather than merely reading about a player's skill, you can actually play them in a game and see their flaws and pluses. A brilliant idea executed perfectly.After the NCAA Tournament, you'll begin recruiting to fill spots left by graduating players and those who've left early for the NBA (an option which can be turned off). Over the next five weeks, you'll spend points to visit and call various players, trying to sway them to sign with you. This could have been daunting, but Kush created a sorting feature that lets you mix and match requirements. For example, you can look for players in the New York region who you've scouted and have a high interest in signing. If you've got a good team, you'll have an easier time recruiting blue chips, while lesser teams will have a harder time convincing players to sign a letter of commitment.More Trouble in ParadiseHere's where the problems begin. At the start of a Legacy, Duke is a great team and the Iowa A&M; Spiders are unheard of and easy fodder for all. But the engine running the Legacy mode does not take Duke's history into account. So, over the course of say a decade, Duke may hit hard times and start sliding. Now, in real life, even with a bad year or two, blue chips will still come to Duke. I mean, it's Duke. But in NCAA College Basketball 2K3, Duke is only as good as their record. So should Duke slide a bit for one or two years, they will have trouble recruiting any blue chips. And since they aren't getting good recruits, they will continue to have sub-par seasons. Within five years of that initial loss, Duke can become as unwelcome as the Iowa A&M; Spiders. And conversely, Iowa A&M; can have a good year and grow into a powerhouse.I simmed through five different Legacies, all of them 50 years long. In each one, within the first 10 years, long-standing great teams were falling off the map and mediocre and even unknown teams rose to prominence. In two of these Legacies, Duke didn't make the NCAA tournament for 20 years while Samford (yes, Samford) won 12 National Titles in 30 years, with Holy Cross winning 8 in that time frame. Everything will look fine for the first few years, but over any significant length of time, Legacy mode falls apart, in a sense.Now you may like the idea of Duke going to the dog house and the Samford Bulldogs' becoming top pooch, but it does create a problem. See, you're playing a coach trying to work his way into the college upper-echelon. But when North Carolina has a bad year and is willing to hire you, you are not inheriting the UNC tradition. You'll be lucky to get a 3-star player your first year. Because there is no perennial top 25 teams anymore, it means nothing to be hired by the Tar Heels. And there's more that's troubling.One Legacy, I was able to get onto Kentucky as they were on a downslide. I rebuilt the team and won the National Championship my third year. Firstly, my security level emptied. I wasn't fired and in fact my job was secured, but there is a bug in the final code of NCAA which shows the incorrect job security level. But that's not the real problem here. Having reached the pinnacle of college basketball, I was still only getting job offers from .500 teams. Okay, I can live with that. Maybe I need to prove myself more. Four years, three conference titles, and one National Championship later and I could still only get job offers from mid-range teams with records (at best) around .600. So, what's the point of a career mode if you can't climb any kind of recognizable ladder?This would never have become a problem if NCAA recognized the history of its college hoops teams. There are no rivalries that EA's two college sports games handle so well. There are no championship banners hanging from the rafters. There's no difference between the Indiana Hoosiers and the Loyola Marymount Lions other than record, and that isn't true to the college game at all. With everything else so exact to the college game, it's a shame to see such a large oversight. Granted, Legacy mode is still an amazing invention, but this one major missing factor undoes what could have been the best franchise mode out there.Other modesNCAA doesn't end with Legacy Mode, though that's clearly the main feature. There is, of course, an Exhibition mode, plus the following: Season - Control up to four teams as you take them through a single season in an attempt to win the National Title. Tournament - Play in the full NCAA Tournament or in any of the conference tournaments. Gym Rat - Think Street Mode from NBA 2K3 only you're taking kids onto the college courts with anywhere from two-on-two to fine-on-five.OnlineNCAA performs much like all other Sega Sports games online. It's relatively smooth with a few slowdown hitches. Though there was a bit more lag then I've experienced with NBA 2K3 online, it's still a great experience. There's no latency and for the most part it feels like you're playing someone sitting right next to you. The bonus here is that you don't have to smell them, since they aren't literally sitting next to you. The only letdown is that no names, customized teams, or created players can be used online. Downloadable content won't be available either, so it's basically just head-to-head play, which is still the main feature for Live anyway.GraphicsVisually, NCAA College Basketball 2K3 isn't quite as sharp as NBA 2K3. The animations are fantastic and, in fact, the majority of animations are unique for NCAA and not simply ported over from NBA 2K3. Drives, dunks, blocks, floor dives, hop steps, and steals look great. The specular highlighting of the pro game has been greatly reduced so that players barely shine at all. While this gives a slightly less realistic look, it also seems to fit the college game better.In that same respect, player models look accurate for kids at the collegiate level and the arenas and crowds fit the college game. Some of my favorite arenas include playing the NCAA Championship in the Super Dome (location changes each year, thankfully) and seeing the giant dome stadium properly reconfigured for a college game. You can see the rest of the stadium hiding behind the sold seats, which is a great touch.Problematic, though is the heavy amount of clipping around the rim. Players will quite often go right through the rim, which can even affect gameplay. It looks ugly and is a bit distracting. Add on crowds and coaches who look quite unattractive up close, and some jaggies and the overall look is a bit weakened.On a final positive note, though, NCAA features some great crowd interaction. When shooting freethrows, fans with wave brick signs and at random moments fans hold out signs spelling a team's name or ESPN. They also often jump up and down with excitement like they'd just shot-up some Starbucks into their veins.SoundSega's dedication to 5.1 Dolby Digital continues with NCAA. Though I'd venture the best use of surround in a Sega Sports game to date has been World Series Baseball, NCAA is a close second. The crowd plays an important role in Sega's college hoops game, with cheers, oohs, and ahhs all mixed in with a team's momentum. While there's no player chatter and very little ever heard from the bench, the crowd sounds are enough to get you in the spirit of college hoops. Best is when the crowd begins a team-specific chant, of which every team has at least one, or when everyone chants ~Brick! Brick! Brick!~ when the visiting team's at the charity stripe. Hearing the crowd loom down on you is enough to give any sports fan goose bumps.The commentary is solid with a two-man booth. Comments are often thoughtful and almost always accurate. Even though you'll have heard it all before after a few dozen games, it's not idiotic commentary, so it doesn't grate on the nerves. But, where NBA 2K3 utilized a new type of sound cutting technology so that all commentary flowed properly with the game, NCAA uses old-school streaming techniques. Commentary is often late, with at least a half dozen, if not more, late comments per game.NCAA College Basketball 2K3 is my favorite basketball game this year. Though the final score isn't higher than NBA 2K3, it's only because there are so many nagging little problems. However, those problems don't cancel out a great experience. If Kush and Visual Concepts can iron out these troubles and focus more on the Legacy Mode next year, this could be among the elite sports games of 2003. If you're a college hoops fan, this is definitely worth your holiday cheddar. If you're not a big college fan but love hoops, you may still want to check NCAA out. This is a unique experience, different and more enjoyable than NBA 2K3. On a technical level, sure, NBA 2K3 excels, but NCAA will be in my Xbox far more over the coming year. It's the fact that NCAA could have been so much better with just a little more attention to detail that upsets me so much. It's so close, but just isn't quite there. Next year, though, I have high expectations. We'll see if Sega is up to the challenge.", "date": "Nov 26, 2002"}
