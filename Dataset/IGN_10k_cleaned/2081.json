The Choro Q series has been a very popular one in Japan, and once you take a look at this game you'll quickly understand why. It's overly cute and is one of the most adorable racing games that you're ever going to play.  Gameplay Takara definitely took a cue from Polyphony Digital and its Gran Turismo series when it came time to put this game together. While it's far from a simulation and stays true to its roots, Gadget Racers has a main mode complete with three Gran Turismo-like license tests and loads of parts that can be purchased to customize your car.   And for better or worse, getting these licenses aren't going to be nearly as difficult as in Gran Turismo, as golds can be gotten in just about all the tests without even a hint of driving skills. Nonetheless, it's a cute approach and in some ways the game actually tops GT, as there are more than 120 gadgets that can be used to customize your car including ones that can make your car fly or be able to move in the water.   Likewise, there are a total of 97 courses, which might just be a record for any racing game, more than 100 cars, and a ton of races and race modes. It's definitely got its fare share of options, but the problem lies in the fact that it's just not that deep as a racing game. The cars control well enough in an arcade sort of way, but the races just aren't all that engaging and often a bit boring in the beginning.  However, once you get deeper into the game and start picking up some of the cooler gadgets for your car, like the wings for the top, the game's fun factor increases exponentially. The sensation of speed you get with the fully powered cars is pretty high and when you factor in the multiplayer racing, which supports up to four players and features exclusive tracks and special battle modes.   Even still, there are plenty of more exciting racers available on the PlayStation and the game is definitely geared more towards the younger gamer as the difficulty level on the whole doesn't really seem all that high. Because of this, the more serious racing fan won't really find much of a challenge in this game and this might kill its play value.  Graphics You're not going to see anyone talk about the graphics of Gadget Racers and use the phrase ~the power of PlayStation 2~ unless it's a part of some joke. The game looks more like a high-resolution PlayStation game than it does a true 128-bit next generation title. The textures are very plain, the car models are blocky and the backgrounds are pretty sparse.  That said, the game does move at a nice 60 frames per second rate, has a very clean overall look and does have a certain appeal. The little cars are extremely cute and will even make the most staunch sourpusses smile a little.  Sound Outside of the cute little slot cars, the most charming aspect of this game is its very quirky soundtrack. The strange, upbeat noise coming out of your speakers might freak you out initially, but if it affects you like it does me, you'll grow to like it. It, and the very comical sound effects and background noises, definitely give this game a very cute and childish appeal.  All-in-all, Gadget Racers is a fine racing game that should give the casual racing fan looking for a quick fun fix if they're not looking for an immersive racing experience. It's more of a niche game, though, so we can only recommend that you rent it first if you're interested as it's likely not going to be your cup of tea.", "date": "Aug 23, 2001"}
