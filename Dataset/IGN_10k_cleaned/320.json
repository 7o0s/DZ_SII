Missing the stereotypical overpriced star performers, cheap food and dancing girls, Vegas 2000 attempts to cover all the bases with a little bit of something for everyone.  Gameplay The motivation for the project still seems a little suspect in my eyes. Maybe the standard nuclear family might gather around the TV to play Roulette or Craps on their PlayStation, but surely if you want to play four-player Poker, you would do it with a real pack of cards.   That being said, the benefits of playing this game prior to taking a trip to Vegas might justify the purchase price alone. The multiple iterations of Poker in particular can be tough to learn especially when a good pair has a chance to win in Five Card Stud, but very little chance of winning in Texas Hold 'Em. And there is no denying the vicarious thrill of pushing a pot up to $7,800 and seeing your opponent's 2 Pair fall to your 3 of a kind. Understanding what usually wins and why is the secret to success in most of these games.  The most useful and interesting of the games are the five variations of Poker. These are Seven Card Stud, Five Card Stud, Five Card Draw, Jacks Or Better and Texas Hold 'Em. If you don't know how each of these standard forms of poker are played then that's 3DO's pitch for a sale right there. The intricacies of betting and calling are self-evident and the interface is easy to use.  The biggest problem with the Poker remains the lack of player personalities and different styles of play. If you play a conservative style of play, only pushing when you start off with a pair  regardless of the mode of poker  then your stake will grow consistently and fairly quickly. This is especially true if you select one of the higher betting minimums where pot sizes can grow significantly.  Poker is certainly the strength of the product and generated the most play value as I took in each of the games.  Baccarat is a game most are familiar with from the James Bond movies. Frankly it's never been a game that interested me as it appears to be based purely on luck with little betting strategy involved. Craps is another game that I have limited experience with but for the opposite reason. The multitude of options is thoroughly confusing and does not invite in the beginner to learn. An available tutorial via an options screen would have been most welcome and would have encouraged me to learn this game.  On the other hand, Roulette is my game and one from which I always return with more money than I started. My standard strategy for winning money from the casinos involves betting on either red or black exclusively (at Even, the best odds on the board), doubling when I lose, and regressing back to the original bet when I win. As long as you can afford to double if you lose 6 or 7 times in a row then an entertaining and profitable couple of hours are assured. Vegas 2000 allows me to demonstrate this technique successfully along with practicing various combinations of numbers and/or even money bets to see how many bets I can keep track off.   Similarly Black Jack can be played this way as long as you can afford to double each time you lose. The Casino variations of insurance and doubling down are available as appropriate.  The Video Poker and Slots offer the standard variations and are fun for a short while. It's probably good entertainment for some drunken Aunt at a Christmas party but part of the ~thrill~ of playing such machines is the instant gratification of the coins dropping out of the machine. Here it is a sterile experience. Graphics For such a simple concept and implementation some of the graphic decisions seems a little perplexing. The font used to display the regular text is quite hard to read and even the numbers on the cards can cause a double take, especially when cards are partially covered such as in Black Jack. Essentially what you get is a top down view of the table  obviously video poker and slots are a little different  with no character interaction.  It was a strange decision to use such a Spartan design for the overall presentation. Normally adding graphical fluff to a title is superfluous but in this case with such a static and staid game, this is a classic example of a game that could use more chrome, not less. There are a couple of touches, such as the 32 different card back designs, that break up the monotony but the graphical credo should have been ~more is more~ not ~less is more.~ Sound Musically, Vegas 2000 is a disappointment with no snappy sound track to draw you in and a background noise track that obviously loops very quickly. It may be great to hear the next table over, but when ~four's the winner~ every couple of minutes you want to be able to place your money on that table rather than your own. Opinion Vegas 2000 is similar to the multitude of casino games available on other systems. Their overall low production cost allows such titles to generate profits for companies at low sales totals. They are less of a gamble  pun intended  and a useful addition to a company bottom line. Whether they make a useful addition to your entertainment experience is dependent on a number of factors, not the least whether you plan to visit Vegas. Roulette is by far the most family friendly of the games on offer and as noted, the Poker games are a good learning tool and fun, but it would have been nice to have a more challenging group of opponents.  Dean AustinI can appreciate the fact that some people enjoy playing these games without the risk of losing their houses, but I just can't see myself playing Vegas Games...ever -- beyond this review, at least. As a casino compilation goes, it's standard, maybe just a little less than that. But as a fun Game Boy Color game? Not even close.", "date": "Oct 16, 1999"}
