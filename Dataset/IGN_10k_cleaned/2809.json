With all the hicks and slacked-jaw yokels that watch destruction derbies and NASCAR races, it's no surprise that a company would try and capture the smell of burning gas, the spectacular and gut-wrenching explosions, and everything else that makes men grunt like the primates they are.   However, a game of this genre (the smash-anything-that-moves genre) usually lacks the depth that the gaming public has come to expect from video games.  Head-on collisions and flying tires can only satisfy human needs to a certain extent, as sooner or later they crave the adventure and storyline that is rare to find in this genre.  That is why games like Crazy Taxi and Wreckless were created; they add a new spice to a genre in need of several exotic (and maybe erotic) ingredients.  Unfortunately for Rage, Totaled! is a few pinches of salt and a splash of pepper short from making this a much better game.   Gameplay   The point of the game is to smash and bash the competition before they do the same to you.  Your car is given a life bar (which only lowers when a car hits you, not when you hit it) and plenty of nitro boosts to battle the competition.  As your life bar gets lower, car doors, hoods, and other parts start to fly off until you're left with a pile of machinery that even Al Bundy wouldn't touch.  With each hit you initiate on the enemy, you are awarded a certain amount of points, depending on the area of collision and the manner in which is it executed (my personal favorite being the T-bone).  The simplicity of the game makes it more boring than one would have hoped, but it does provide a few minutes of heated arcade action.   The controls are what you would come to expect from an arcade game.  The analog control is very tight, where holding the stick all the way to the side feels like you are making a 90-degree turn.  You can go in reverse, accelerate, use a hand break, and use the nitro boosts to plow through the competitor's car.  The controls and gameplay fit into the stereotype of an arcade game.  However, it doesn't have the excitement and edge-of-your-seat action that is usually found in the arcade.  In other words, it's an arcade game without the in-your-face action.   The career mode initially features four different maps of fictional locations from around the world.  Each map has a different objective required to complete the mission.  The most basic of these objectives is what you would come to expect from a destruction derby: cars duke it out against one another in a bitter fight to eliminate the competition.  If you or the A.I. can't turn the other cars into rubble, the car with the most points at the end of the time limit will be awarded the victory.   Another objective is jumping off ramps and over large objects.  In this case, you must take one of your speedy cars and jump over at least 10 buses in order to complete the mission.  Luckily you have a few nitro boosts to help propel your car over the obstacles.   The final mission is similar to a game of tag.  However, instead of tagging someone, you are merely supposed to smash the living hell out of the designated vehicle until the time expires.  In this particular objective, the only way to obtain points is from smashing the designated car.  Once again, if you don't feel like going after the designated car, you can simply destroy all of the other cars before the time runs out to claim the prize.   These missions are far from original, but they still provide you with a quick fix of fun.  Still, the game lacks the speed and action found from top-notch arcade games.   Speaking of prizes, after each mission is completed, you will receive a bonus.  The bonus can either be a new track, a new car, or an extra mission on an existing track.  The longevity found in this game is found here, in one's desire to unravel all of the hidden goodies.  However, with only one difficulty level, it's quite possible that you will only be playing this game for a total of three hours before you complete it.  A bad move on Rage's part.   Good ol' country fun.   Graphics   Totaled! is a mixed bag in the graphics category.  While the car models are stylish and smooth, the maps are the exact opposite: the detail is low, objects appear extremely clustered from far distances, and the lighting is poor.  An example of the poor lighting is found in the Anopolis Amphitheatre level in which a large, Greek-style wall smacked in the middle of a desert sunset surrounds the track.  While one would expect that there would be shadows from a fading sun, the areas of the map that do not see sun light are completely black; there isn't even the smallest amount of detail.  It sometimes seems as if you are racing in a mortuary as the backgrounds have little or no activity to them.  The maps are the most disappointing aspect of the graphics.   The car models, on the other hand, are quite nice, as the cars have a similar feel to those found in Crazy Taxi.  The hotrods are smooth with plenty of bright, vibrant colors and good shading, but they are plagued by aliasing when they are viewed from far distances.  At some distances, they look like black blobs rather than masterful machines.  There are no major complaints about the car design, just as long as you don't view them from extended distances.   What really upsets me about the graphics is the fact that you can choose the game's video setting.  Now, I understand the Xbox is the closest game system to a PC, but why would anyone need to choose from a soft, normal, or sharp picture setting?  If the game can't perform on a sharp setting, then it shouldn't be included.  While I love having tons of options to choose from, this one seems to be unnecessary.   Sound   The soundtrack in Totaled! is one of the games bright spots.  The options menu allows you to choose from several different styles of music.  These styles are racing tunes, fighting mix, rap allack, electrance, alt rock, and jazz.  While jazz doesn't seem like an appropriate choice to use while cars are exploding, I do appreciate the variety of jams.   The sound effects are pretty basic.  The cars sound like muscle cars, the explosions go boom, the commentary sounds is rarely used, and the engines rev like it should.  While they aren't the highest quality of sound, they do fit the requirements for their particular uses.  The screeching does sound awkward (more like a sorry attempt at a whistle than a tire griping the pavement), but that is my only complaint about the sound clips.The lack of difficulty settings, a short career mode, and a somewhat poor display haunts this title.  The game simply doesn't have enough depth or innovative concepts to put it in the same boat as other games in the genre.  I would highly recommend that you rent the game from Blockbuster before you think about buying it.  Despite all of the action and destruction that can be found in Totaled!, it's hard to get excited about playing this game.  While it isn't all that horrible, you might want to pick up Crazy Taxi 3 before you pick up Totaled!.", "date": "Jul 23, 2002"}
