The Adventure Company would, of course, disagree as they are still putting out about one true point and click adventure a month.  This month's flavor is called Black Mirror.  Developed by relative newcomer to the market, Unknown Identity, Black Mirror is a dark and twisted adventure with pretty good graphics, horrible voice acting and been there, done that puzzles.  The plot is pretty generic, that of ~Someone or something is killing people, find out who or what it is and stop it.~  As a matter of fact, I really wonder if there is a plot manual out there somewhere for adventure game developers to follow.  Does it outline that what adventure gamers want is to play the same game over and over?  If there is, someone needs to burn it.   That being said, Black Mirror does a fine job of putting the story through its paces and adding a few twists to set itself apart.  The game plays in 3rd person perspective following the protagonist, Samuel Gordon, as he tries to uncover what killed his grandfather and finally set to rest the truth behind his family's history.  One of the problems I did have with the story is how disjointed it is at times.  At first, it appears to be about a fire that occurred over a dozen years prior to the start of the game, in which Samuel's wife perished.  Later, we discover that this was contrived to give the main character some history, but really has no bearing on the point of the story or its ultimate conclusion.  Throughout the game, several characters from the past are introduced, but the details on their demise or their relationship to the story are sketchy at best.   The delivery of the story itself is done in several ways.  First, there are more than enough conversations to sort through with the varied characters in the game.  Second, diaries and historical articles abound to get the needed clues to the games puzzles as well as some more back-story. Finally, Samuel himself will relate any details he can add as thoughts.  While it is always great in an adventure game to learn about the story, at times Black Mirror's telling drags on needlessly.  There is also this annoying delay whenever Samuel approaches an individual.  In and of itself, it is tolerable, but due to the sheer number of instances Samuel talks to different people, the time delay really adds up to the point players may just find themselves nodding off at times.     The puzzles themselves aren't really anything original, but they do their job.  None of the puzzles are overly complicated and every single one makes sense within the confines of the story.  Puzzle types include putting together torn up items, solving riddles and, of course, sliders.  Players would be well advised to save the game often, especially right before puzzles, as at times if you make one bad move, you'll find Samuel has stalled or worse, has died.  The one feature this game could have benefited from is a quick save and quick load feature.  It seems to be glaringly lacking because of the style of the game.   The interface was very simple, a plus for any point and click.  Around the screen were various obvious hot spots, and left clicking on a hot spot will give some information or cause Samuel to interact with it.  Sometimes, right clicking would cause even more interaction as well.  The inventory is accessed by moving the mouse to the lower part of the screen and left clicking will pick up items.  A general menu for saving, loading and changing options is easily accessible as well.  Subtitles are not on automatically, they must be turned on, and I greatly suggest doing so.  Conversation can be skipped through by hitting the space bar or clicking the mouse, and it all likelihood, you will read much faster than many characters talk.  A map is found early on in the game and will allow Samuel to quickly travel from location to location.     Moving around from screen to screen is done by simply clicking.  Double clicking will immediately take you to the new location.  There was one thing about movement that baffled me, though.  For the most part, screens are static and to move to the next area of the room, you click to move there and it brings up a completely new screen.  However, in a few strange places, it scrolls and you must click the edge of the screen and your character will walk, slowly, to the edge at which point you will be able to continue clicking around the screen or change locations.  This seemed out of place and I'm not entirely sure why they did this.  Since they did put this style of play into the game, there should have been a way to quickly run to the edge and there wasn't.  The screens which required scrolling were important enough to the game that it added unnecessary time to the game play once again.   The graphics were pretty good for point and click adventures.  There were a few dream sequences that I really enjoyed and added a great deal to the story.  Animations weren't fantastic but they weren't horrible either.  The backgrounds and landscapes sometimes edged on beautiful and were some of the most well done I've seen recently.  The ambient sounds and background music was at times haunting, and while never really putting me on edge, set the tone appropriately.  The one thing that was really horrible was the main character's voice acting.  Most of the other voice actors were really good, but I couldn't get past the main character's slow style of speech and I never felt real passion from the actor.  I couldn't get past the almost humorous, stilted manner of speaking to feel an attachment to Samuel Gordon.   When all is said and done, this is just a mediocre adventure game.  It takes a generic story and adds some twists to it, but the twists and the ending really aren't worth playing the game through.  There aren't that many puzzles and the game drags at times due to slow speech and the need for passing time doing nothing.  Good graphics, background sounds and decent (if not original) puzzles cannot redeem this game. Adventure games must be compelling and this is not at all compelling.
