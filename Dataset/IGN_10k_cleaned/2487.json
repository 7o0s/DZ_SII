That's what it's all about.~ I can see very clearly that the fun-loving, envelope-pushing creators at Rockstar had exactly this in mind when they brainstormed their new beat-'em-up, State of Emergency. The crossover between rock 'n roll and videogames shouldn't strike too many folks as weird or odd, because game makers have been pushing to break old molds for years. Now, with new, powerful systems that enable designers to do more, to explore, push, and expand game genres, the ideas behind games are beginning to flourish. Rockstar, fresh off its stunning hit Grand Theft Auto III, knows this more than most. The fact is, State of Emergency is certain to make your parents gag, if just a little.   But don't make the mistake that State of Emergency is anything like GTA3. It's not. It's not the same developer, not the same engine, not the broad, sweeping tour-de-force that GTA3 is. SOE on its very own, however, is a marvel of technical prowess -- with more than 250 characters on screen at once -- and it's certainly a concept that's never been pushed to this extent.   State of Emergency takes a classic videogame genre, the beat-'em-up, once dominant in the arcades with Final Fight, Streets of Rage, and Double Dragon, and has stretched, widened, and infused it with a modern theme and more than 250 characters in screen at once. In short, it's a riot game. You riot. You break windows, blow up cars, shoot people, and break as much as possible, and it's an enormous release, a smashing good time, and hell-bent, non-stop action.   Gameplay What began as an idea more than three years ago has finally come to fruition. It's the beat-'em-up that ate Tokyo; huge, violent, and wildly entertaining. State of Emergency should make you an instant addict. The concept is simple, but it's so accessible and easy to play that it almost seems dangerous. Like, why on earth is this so easy and fun to play? Well, hey! It's a game, it's supposed to be fun (dummy). And this certainly is.   But let's also be clear about something else: State of Emergency is certainly going to ruffle some conservative feathers. Oh yes. It's got an M rating for a reason. You take on the role of an angry, pent-up civilian, join a freedom movement, and then smash everything you see into bits, killing anyone who gets in the way, too. The goal of course is to stop the oppressive regime from taking away your God-given rights, and so you mean to aim the violence at the bad guys, ~The Corporation,~ but it just so happens that if you're not aiming the mini-gun or the flamethrower in the right direction, a handful of innocent victims are mistakenly killed. You are penalized for that, too (Bad gamer, bad!), because the goal of the game is not to kill civilians.   Split into two parts, Revolution and Chaos, State of Emergency enables gamers to vent frustrations, challenge friends for high scores, and presents itself as a great party game for two or more people. It's not a two-player game (though it should be), but it becomes a social glue of sorts that's hard to resist. You sit around, pass the controller, and have fun.   Revolution follows a story, and places you in missions -- as many as 185 missions, starting out in the Capitol City Mall. As you progress, new locales open, including Chinatown, Eastside, and Corporation Central. You meet new people and they offer new objectives, ranging from straight attacks, chase and attack missions, to defend, escort and defend, and a few more. Players get to select two characters to begin, either MacNeil or Libra. As you progress, becoming skilled, you open up new characters, including Spanky, Bull, and Freak.   Revolution is fun, but only for a while. It's designed to provide gamers with a huge amount of missions, and it does indeed offer a lot of playtime. The thing is that the missions eventually become repetitive and brainless. It's not like I would buy State of Emergency to stimulate the more intellectual neurons in my brain, but hey, after 50 defend, escort, and chase missions, all very similar in kind, I'm not only a little numbed with repetition, but I'm anxiously hoping the story, or something else, will entice me to continue. And that doesn't happen.   The game is played from the third-person perspective, with a slightly loose camera, that is correctable by using one shoulder button. The camera work is OK, but with such quick gameplay in which every second counts, a faster acting camera that sticks with you better, could have served the game and the player better.   The control behind each character is quick and responsive, and the button scheme is nice and simple. Players can walk, run, or sprint, and have a decent array of fighting moves; they can throw enemies, and they can even pull off a dash-and-smack move to chase down weasely corporate culprits. The animation and control over the characters isn't as good as I have seen in other games, it's a little frayed at the edges, and on occasion the lack of precise contol is annoying, causing unlikely deaths, but it's good enough.   The weapon list is quite extensive, including a sword, pistol, Uzi, AK 47 Kalashnikov, shotgun, M16 Assault Rifle, mini-Gun, grenade launcher, rocket launcher, tear gas launcher, flame-thrower, grenades, Molotov Cocktails, tazer, pepper spray, and street ~furniture.~ The furniture set is relatively vast and mostly consists of junk (but very, very useful junk!) such as crates, garbage cans, benches, etc., furniture also includes, I guess, the heads of dead people. Yes, if you slice somebody with a sword, you can pick up his or her head and smash someone else with it. Though not subtle, it's still a nice detail that is consistent with the game's philosophy. In Revolution, you start with small weapons and as you progress larger ones become available, but only until later are a wide variety of weapons around.   Even though Chaos mode isn't terribly deep either, it's the very core of the game. It's where I could literally sit and play from morning 'til dawn. Set up into three initial parts, Chaos gives players un-timed free range play, a three-minute clock, and a five-minute clock. The main goal is to score as many points as possible, and the hyper-happy narrator provides sub-goals for you to hit certain areas at a specific time. For instance, he'll say, ~blow up cars for extra points,~ or ~smash windows for multipliers.~ By performing these acts at the required time, you will indeed earn as many as 5X multipliers. Some goals are warnings, including penalties for killing civilians, points that are deducted from your total score.   The brilliant idea in Chaos, which I mentioned earlier, is in my mind the raison d'etre is to reign terror in the midst of a full and complete riot. Weapons can be picked up around in various locations (the regenerate randomly as different weapons afterward), and you can simply go to town, smashing and killing as much as you can within a certain time. The idea being to score as high as possible. When you score 500,000 and open the next locale, or when you see those multiplier scores spinning, the surge of adrenaline is unmistakably fine. There is also Last Clone Standing, another mode, which is exactly what it sounds like, and it's also very worthy of your time. That mode opens up after you've succeeded in scoring big points.   But ultimately, the single carrot in State of Emergency is the desire to smash things. And then smash them again. I only wish that there was a two-player competitive or cooperative mode. It would have deepened the gameplay, and it seems like such a natural extension of the game's core ideas, but alas there is none of that. SOE succeeds wildly in its narrow, focused goal, but don't expect to find much depth. You won't find it. This game is about arcade-action -- fast, violent, large-scale arcade-action.   Graphics Using a propriety core engine and renderer custom build around the PlayStation 2's innards, State of Emergency is a technical feat that only Koei has come close to, with the Dynasty Warriors and Kessen series. But even in those cases, the characters weren't on screen all the time, like in State of Emergency. Here, players have the opportunity to feel like they are truly part of a huge, frenetic riot, and the feeling is truly intense. The 250 characters, comprising what seems like to be about a dozen different body types, all follow different AI paths, and they all react to the actions occurring around them in realtime. It's pretty amazing to see more than a dozen characters react in fear, ducking, crouching, shivering, and/or screaming while you shoot off a rocket into a nearby building. Heck, it's damn impressive.   Visually, the game takes on a rather humorous appearance, and it looks like the artists chose a comic book look for at least two reasons: One, because of the subject matter itself, and two, because of the inordinate level of activity happening. Buildings, vehicles, storefronts, fire hydrants, water fountains, and other things are built well, but textured simply, with minimal lines and design. Characters are caricatures, falling into categories, those with giant bellies, stocky legs, and ruddy faces; others with medium-sized builds; and the skinny variety, you know, super-thin, gawky, long-legged and strangely big-footed.   Ultimately, State of Emergency won't blow you away with its graphic textures or amazingly imaginatively drawn cities. Rather, it's meant to show off a comic nature, a goofy caricature of the real world. There should be no mistaking that. And for what it is, the graphics do their thing. I should mention that the sheer volume of characters is really quite astounding, making for a wide variety of characters, and some very likeable ones, too. It only takes about five seconds to see Spanky run to know what I mean, and to know which character you're really going to latch on to.   Sound Ahhh, the sounds of State of Emergency. Well, to be honest, there is a lot of sound, and it's that of hundreds of people running around like chickens with their heads cut off in a full-fledged riot. People scream, chortle and die when shot; they holler, gag, grunt, and yell, and all of these sounds fulfill a necessary function, and they all work. The sounds of the flame-thrower and the shotgun are wonderfully satisfying in the right context, and the sound of a giant tanker or Hummer exploding in full is also quite a thrill. These things are done well.   As for the music, well once again, this is not Grand Theft Auto III. The music, oddly enough, is more of a background flavor, a white noise that keeps the tension high and the blood flowing. There is nothing drastically noticeable about it, in fact. There's this sort beat that keeps tings lively in the background, and it comes in decent techno-rock blends. I know I have said this at least twice, but it should be said again, State of Emergency is a tried and true beat-'em-up, and it doesn't offer the stunning replay value or depth of some other Rockstar titles. It's very different. In fact, it's sort of like taking one aspect of GTA3, say a gang fight, and blowing it out to a huge proportion. Like 200 times as big. It's intense, wild and even a little shocking, and that's coming from a weathered gamer who's played hundreds of violent games with rarely the blink of an eye. State of Emergency is a calamity in its own way.  But that shouldn't deter you from buying it. Because it is a damn good beat-'em-up, and it thrills, shocks, addicts, and stuns all in one intense flavor. It's just a million times bigger than any other beat-'em-up out there. And while I didn't care much for the Revolution mode, the Chaos mode alone is absolutely worth the price of admission. The addiction level in this game is extremely high. So yeah, get this one. It's fun as hell for a while, and you may put in down after only an hour. But it's the kind of game that you put down, and three days later, its sheer accessibility makes it instantly fresh again. State of Emergency is especially good fun for a group of people, just trading the controller around, competing to get the highest score. Just make sure to keep it away from any super conservative, paranoid, reactionary PTA moms, and far from the kids. People always like to take things out of context, and let's face it, this is a videogame, it's meant to be fun.", "date": "Feb 15, 2002"}
