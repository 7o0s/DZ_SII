Pardon the lame pun that a million reviewers leveled at Helsing, but the game kinda sucked. However, Lavastorm has had better luck with Disney fare, such as their series of TRON-inspired games. Does the streak extend to Arthur?   Features:   Play as Arthur, wielding Excalibur  Discover power-ups  Defeat the Woad hordes   Lavastorm's Tobin Lent described King Arthur to us once as being similar to SEGA's own classic bruiser, Golden Axe. He has that right. But instead of being a watered-down derivative of the arcade and Genesis great, King Arthur is something of an homage. It recognizes SEGA's brilliant brawler for its simple control scene and non-stop action, which is exactly what we expect from a wireless game based on the Knights of the Round Table.   In King Arthur, you must fight of hordes of Woad warriors and barbarians, under the command of the evil Cedric. Cedric wants Saxon for himself, so it's up to the man and the myth to defend his birthright with his own two hands.   Fortunately, you'll only need to use one. King Arthur employs a cool control system -- simple, but very, very tight. Everything is handled on the touchpad, from movement to attacking. Pressing left and right moves the good king, but as soon as Arthur is within striking distance, the controls instantly shift to attack mode. Double-tap towards a foe and Arthur delivers a wicked slash.   The fields are full of rocks and barrels, which you must use to put distance between yourself and enemies. Of course, what defends you one moment could trap you the next, so look out for getting pinched between a Woad and a hard place.   Along the way, Arthur must pick up power-ups to keep on top of the Woads. The best, of course, is Excalibur. This legendary sword (though not quite as legendary as the magic-less movie would have you believe) grants Arthur a temporary boost in attack strength -- useful for cutting down advancing barbarians. You must also pick up shields to defend yourself, and health potions to boost life. Be wary of black potions, though. Easy to grab in the heat of battle, these poisons will sap you of your strength.   King Arthur takes place over several environments, including one-on-one showdowns. The levels, classic side-scrollers that they are, are colorful, but not terribly detailed. More attention was obviously spent on the action itself, with detailed characters sprites and great animation.  King Arthur is an excellent effort from Lavastorm and Disney. It easily washes away any lingering Helsing vibes we had while downloading the game. The control scheme is easy and intelligent, making any falls on the battlefield your fault and yours alone. This is what a summer movie game could and should be.", "date": "Jun 17, 2004"}
