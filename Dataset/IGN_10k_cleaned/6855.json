We hope you enjoy it and, if anybody has any suggestions as to how we can get Trent to stop saying EXTREME, please tell us.  Tal: Hey Trent, check out this new tennis game we just got in.  There's a flaming tennis ball on the box cover.  Trent: Dude, that's so EXTREME!!!  Tal: Oh man, if this game is half as good as its name, this is going to be some fun.  Trent: You mean it's going to be some EXTREME fun!!!  Tal: It looks like you start outside of the Pro Shop.  Trent: Hey dude, that's pretty EXTREME!!!  Tal: Hmmm ... looks like the Pro Shop is run by a guy named Tony.  Trent: Tony is such an EXTREME name, dude!!!  Tal: So I can go in and pick from 16 different players with fake names like Andrez Aguasi, Pret Sampras, and Vorys Fecker.  Trent: Fake names are so EXTREME!!!  I used to have a fake name once ... it was Jimmy.  Tal: Oooooh K ... did you notice that they're all drawn really poorly and look like emaciated GI Joe figures.  Trent: GI Joe wishes he was EXTREME!!!  Tal:  I can also choose between four different rackets, even though it doesn't make any difference whatsoever which one you pick.  Trent: Not making any difference is totally EXTREME dude!!!  Tal: But shoe choice actually does affect which court you play on.  Which do you like best Trent, clay?  Trent: Clay's EXTREME!!!  Tal: Hard surface?  Trent: EXTREME!!!  Tal: Grass?  Trent: Dude, not at work. That's a little too EXTREME.   Tal: OK, I'll just pick synthetic.  Trent: EXTREME choice dude!!!  Tal: Alright, now on to the game ... looks like I can play either a single match or a tournament.  Trent: Play a tournament, dude.  Tal: Why?  Trent: Cause tournaments are EXTREME!!!  Tal: Should I play a doubles match or just singles?  Trent: You're only one person, dumbass.  If you were two then that would be EXTREME!!!  Tal: Good point ... I'll play singles. Wow, these graphics are pretty bad don't you think?  Trent: They're EXTREMEly bad.  And what's up with the choppy framerate?  Tal: That's EXTREME!!! Oh great, now you got me doing it.  Trent: That's 'cause you're EXTREME!!!  Tal: Hey, you don't even have to hit a key to volley.  You just move your player with the arrow keys and he hits it automatically.  It's like 3D pong.  Trent: 3D pong would be EXTREME!!!  Tal: It's not ... see.  Trent: Oh yeah ...  Tal: And I've already found a spot on the court where I can serve it and ace the computer every time.  I can't be beat when it's my serve and I've only been playing this game for 15 minutes.  Trent: Your technique is totally EXTREME, dude!!!  Tal: Well it's finally his serve.  Looks like I'm going to have to jump for this one.  What the hell?!?  Why did everything just freeze?  Did my system lock up?  Trent: System lock-ups are EXTREME!!!  Tal: Oh wait ... there it goes.  The game just had to pause and load the jumping animation.  Trent: Maybe the jumping animation was a little too EXTREME for the game to handle!!!  Tal: I gotta quit man.  This game bites.  Trent: Yeah ... it really didn't turn out to be very EXTREME at all.  Tal: Oh wow ... it even locks-up my system when I exit the game.  Trent: 'EXTREME' must be another word for 'suckass' dude.  Tal: I think we better get somebody to perform an extreme unction on this game.  Trent: Word.", "date": "Jan 27, 1999"}
