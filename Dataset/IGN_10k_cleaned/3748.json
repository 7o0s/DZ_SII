Formerly known as Galacta Meisaku Gekijou: Rakugaki Oukouku, this unusual effort from upstart developer Garakuta-Studio is one of the most unique pieces of software for the PlayStation 2 so far.   Mixing a variety of different genres under one banner, Color Quest is the only title in recent memory that successfully combines adventure, role-playing, arena battle, and paint programming into one huge amalgamation of entertainment. Come to think of it, it's probably the only game to create such an arrangement. That said, it's probably not a product that's going to jump off the shelves and grab the public with its limited mass-market appeal. What it should do, however, is hook a community of players that are willing to test their mettle and give it a chance. In short: nobody's going to play it. But for those of us who do, hold on to your socks -- it's actually pretty good.   Story  Free as the game may be in form (more on that later), the storyline and background play an important role in Magic Pengel's progression. Without following it, new abilities and palettes for the illustration program cannot be learned and the power and flexibility of your doodles will be severely crippled. If you end up with a batch of doodles that are limited because of this fact, your chances for victory lessen more and more with every passing scenario.   The plot itself weaves between two distinctly connected chronicles. The first is a search for the missing father of two supporting characters named Taro and Zoe; and the second is about freeing the enslaved people of your community from a corrupted monarchy. Extremely basic and short by today's RPG standards, Magic Pengel's quest doesn't last very long if players stay focused and follow the main goals (expecting less than 15 hours is a generous estimate).    Luckily, there are plenty of opportunities to extend this experience by speaking with NPCs around your village in order to learn more about what's going on. Not only does this add a little weight to an otherwise buoyant storyline, it also gives you plenty of time to battle with other doodles. For fans of RPGs that seize your imagination with interesting characters, stunning plot twists, and epic aspirations, however, Magic Pengel probably won't satisfy those cravings.   Gameplay  Until we actually started playing it, the structure of Magic Pengel was almost impossible to fathom. At its heart, the game is a mix of role-playing and adventure with a good bit of Pokemon-type fighting sequences thrown in as the battle system. Of course, the most important tool in the entire experience has to be the Paint Shop inspired illustrator that's used to draw your assistants. Beginning with only four colors, one brush type, and two body variables, your early creations aren't going to be much. As your skills and experience improve, however, the things you can do with the paint program become enormously elaborate. And while your only limitation is the confines of a multi-speed cursor and a total of 64 body parts, skilled artists will be able to create some seriously beautiful images.    As an added bit of strategy, the types of colors in use, thickness of your brushes, and placement of certain body parts affect the power and attributes of your drawings. Use a lot of red, for instance, and your character's hit points increase. Add a touch of blue, and your luck goes up a few notches. There's a full rainbow of colors to experiment with, and the number of limbs, pieces, and other such factors all make a difference in your creation, with a potentially unlimited amount of possibilities. Artists are going to love it.   Anyhow, once a warrior is created they're immediately available for combat. Held in several different arenas each possessing unique rules and guidelines, duels are instantly reminiscent of titles like Pokemon and/or Digimon. Working on the ~Rock, Paper, Scissors~ philosophy, the combat system is so simple its ridiculous (but don't worry it's in a good way). There are four special skills that can be used in all (Attack, Block, Magic, and Charge), and each has their own special relationships. Attack is stronger than Block, Block defeats Magic, and Magic overcomes attack. Charge is unique in the fact that it is defeated by all selectable skills, but if your combatant survives until the next round, their potential for damage is immensely increased. To keep things interesting and balanced, a move must charge for one round before it becomes available for selection once more.   Simple as it sounds, the duel sequences are still incredibly addicting and since these battles are the meat of the game, it's a factor that goes a long way. There are over 100 different kinds of attacks, for example, so while the fighting system itself remains basic in nature, the types of things you can do are always changing; especially if you attempt to exploit the benefits of using magic and become adept at managing your spell points. Even better is the fact that you can fight for an almost unlimited amount of time outside the storyline before and after conquering the game. Now that's replay value!    Unfortunately Magic Pengel isn't without its problems. The adventure-based navigation system is bizarrely inconsistent with its controls, and the need to constantly adjust the camera to keep from bumping into things is a common nuisance. Another issue arises with the lack of  plot-based elements that we referred to earlier in the story section, as you absolutely have to be deliberate with your actions in order to get anything extra from your playing experience. Unless a user specifically seeks out the extra duels apart from the shallow storyline or challenges his buddies via two-player combat, there's little else to do other than move from point A to B and back again.   For the more forgiving set of players who become addicted to the illustration tool and battle engine, however, these are all points that can be easily overlooked. The real hitch though is that not everyone falls into that category.   Graphics  Because of Magic Pengel's ~do-it-yourself structure, the visuals are pretty simplistic. As good as you may become at creating your own doodles, the basic skills provided don't allow you to even come close to matching those of the surrounding world (though creating minions such as bears, robots, and even people is entirely possible). So while many of the game's buildings may have distinct chiseled appearances and moderately advanced textures, the majority of the environment and its characters resemble the drawings of a talented younger child.    From a stylistic standpoint, however, Magic Pengel is quite brilliant. Bathed in a myriad of colors with a hefty dose of cheery character designs for good measure, Color Quest offers a refreshingly unique approach to the typical RPG scenario. It may not be on the same level as say, Dark Cloud 2, or even UNLIMITED: SaGa, but it gets the job done well enough. Too bad the camera is so unpredictable during the adventure/RPG segments.   Sound  The soundtrack in Magic Pengel seems to bounce all over the place. Highlighted by a few low-key compositions early on in the adventure, the majority of music can best be described as a cross between Mario Bros. and SpongeBob Squarepants. Obviously modeled after live-action Saturday morning theme shows, it's not the type of score that'll attract older players, but it could definitely elicit a chuckle or two.   The voices and sound effects follow a similar theme with cheery ~boing~-like audio snippets and over-exaggerated vocal stylings. It's kind of strange really, as the overall storyline of Magic Pengel lends itself well to the dark side while the graphics and sound follow a completely different inspiration. It's conflicted perhaps, but definitely interesting.Agetec and Garakuta-Studios' attempt at something different certainly succeeds with its goal. And while its minimal problems may prove to be a roadblock for some of us, its positive aspects far outweigh the bad ones. If we're going to be perfectly honest though, Magic Pengel is most assuredly not for everyone. And its premise, style, and execution could end up turning off thirty or more people for every one that it appeals too.If you're in the mood for a creative alternative to the norm, however, then Magic Pengel: The Quest for Color delivers in more way than one. More interactive than your typical paint program, more customizable than any previous monster creation title, and a lot more unusual than anything else on the system, the PlayStation 2's premiere ~something game~ is worth every penny.
