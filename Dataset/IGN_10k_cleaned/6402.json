The Yankees recovered from a disastrous start to take the American League East, again. Cleveland made a historic charge up the standings in the AL Central and nearly caught the surprising and eventual world champion Chicago White Sox. In the NL East, the Braves, Mets, Phillies, Marlins and Nationals fought tooth and nail to the end before the Braves moved away from the pack.    To capitalize on the baseball frenzy that swept the country, 2K Games took a chance and published a World Series edition of its Major League Baseball 2K5 game at an MSRP of $24.99, five bucks more than the price of the original version, which can be found on shelves now for $15 bucks. MLB2K5: WSE is the exact same game, so what's the deal? Well, 2K Games included a MLB-produced DVD that highlights some of the greatest World Series moments of all time. There is also a new Pennant Fever mode, which is basically a franchise mode that begins 120 games into the 2005 season. Pennant Fever is a great idea for, say, Mets fans that want that extra challenge of catching the Braves, and it would be nice if the standings, like rosters, could be updated online in the regular version of the game. Speaking of rosters, they have been updated so rookie studs like Robinson Cano on the Yankees don't ground into a 6-4-3 every AB.   This is almost as cool as the DVD. The best new feature, though, is the World Series Championship Moments mode, which is basically a situation mode in which you can relive some of the greatest postseason situations in history. The first challenge, for instance, is playing as the Sox down 3-0 to the Yankees in the 2004 ALCS. In the eighth against the greatest postseason closer of all time, you have to come back and win, just like the Sox did. There are also challenges in which you rewrite history, like playing as the '04 Yanks and trying to overcome that huge deficit in Game 7 of the ALCS. While the ~rewrite~ moments are a nice touch, you won't get nowhere near as excited as when you recreate a great moment, like knocking a game-winner with Kirk Gibson against the '88 A's, unless you happen to be an A's fan.   As mentioned, the game is the exact same game to which we gave a favorable review in February. Back is the awesome broadcast presentation with Karl Ravech, Joe Morgan and my namesake Jon Miller at the microphone. To sum up, baseball presentation has never been done better -- not by the MVP franchise, not by anybody. That also means the comical player models and, um, interesting player animations return, not to mention the gimmicky Slam Zone feature.    So the question remains? Is MLB2K5: WSE worth yo' scrilla? Yes and no. First off, the DVD is awesome and any baseball fan will get fired up remembering the heroics of Kirby Puckett and Jack Morris in 1991 and the Bash Brothers in 1989. More importantly, the 10 championship, hair-raising moments on the DVD are included in the Series Championship Moments mode in the videogame. Honestly, after watching the documentary-style DVD, I was never more excited emotionally to play a baseball videogame. Sure, we all get juiced -- no pun there -- to play a new baseball game on opening day, but usually you need a roster update that reflects the emergence of talented rookies and also superstar slumps ala Jason Giambi.In the end 2K Games couldn't have picked a better time to release a special edition version of the game as baseball fans everywhere were in a baseball frenzy. The DVD, Championship Moments and Pennant Fever Mode are perfect October additions and well worth the extra five bucks. If you already own the game, you will be hard-pressed to fork over the dough. But since Take Two purchased Visual Concepts and the MLB license, MLB2K5: WSE is an excellent tune-up for fans of other baseball franchises as we head to 2K7, which will be the only MLB title on the market.", "date": "Nov 21, 2005"}
