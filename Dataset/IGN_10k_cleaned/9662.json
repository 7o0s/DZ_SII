Ubisoft's first horse sim for the DS, Horsez, was released in time for the holidays last year and proved to be a less than stellar stuffer for anybody's stocking. Its aim was to put players in the role of a girl named Ginger attending a prestigious equestrian boarding school, giving gamers a glance into the world of strict, demanding horse-riding competition. But its presentation came across way too forcefully  playing it, even if you did well in the game's activities, you were consistently berated and insulted by the in-game non-player characters, and that negativity drained almost all of the fun out of the package.   But this year, improvements have been made. Petz: Horsez 2 retains several of the positive elements of its predecessor, while simultaneously ditching several more that brought it down. Most notably, now, is that though the main character is still Ginger she's no longer enrolled in a boarding school. She's graduated and moved on, and has now purchased for herself a small ranch in the south of France, right next door to her grandfather.   It's a welcome change of scenery, and much more accessible for new players. Ginger's grandfather is a kind, inviting character  a far cry from the overly aggressive and antagonistic headmaster from the first Horsez  and it's just much more pleasant to play in a more peaceful environment, surrounded by more peaceful people. Grandpa is joined by other characters like Luc, the family friend, and Kevin, the local competition trainer, as the people Ginger gets to encounter and interact with. And while there's still tension introduced, through a land-hungry woman named Charlotte seeking to buy you out of your ranch, overall Horsez 2 sets up a cast that's just nicer to be around.   For whatever reason, maintaining your horse's trotting speed is interpreted as a shape and color matching game.  With the most major issues of presentation well addressed, it's easier to get into the adventure this time and start experiencing the core gameplay that's available. Unfortunately, though, the gains made above don't seem to carry on throughout the entire product in Horsez 2, as aspects of the horse-riding gameplay are still presented in a questionable way.   Dressage is the biggest offender. It's the horse-riding sport where a trainer displays his or her skill in guiding their animal through a variety of gaits and maneuvers, turning and trotting around a field, performing figure eights and the like. But whereas the other recent horse-focused release on the DS, Horse Life, implemented dressage in an engaging and satisfying way, here it's kind of a mess.   Horsez 2 separates dressage into four completely unrelated styles of mini-game, which seems more than a bit inexplicable as a design choice. But four games there are, and they run the gamut  the first is a shape and color matching test, where a triangle, circle or square appears briefly on the screen, then disappears, then you have to pick the one you just saw out of a line-up of six that appear on the sides of the screen. Choose correctly and your horse continues forward without stumbling.   The second dressage mini-game has you tapping red circles as larger circles shrink to intersect with them  a very basic version of a style employed in several music games. The third has you following a bouncing red ball on the touch screen with your stylus, and, finally, the last tasks you to draw different shapes and lines on the screen in quick succession.   It's just very puzzling to see these four totally different styles of touch-controlled game mashed together into one event, and it throws a wrench into the positive progress that the rest of the product was making. It doesn't help, either, that the pattern recognition in the last of the four designs seems off, often not giving you credit for traces that should have counted for you.   If you move beyond the overall oddity of dressage and retreat back to the rest of Horsez 2's experience, you'll be comforted to find that the remainder of the game is much as you'd expect. Owning your horses, both grown and newborn, is done well and takes advantage of some of the better interfaces first introduced in last year's effort. Training a foal continues to be a fairly unique feather in the cap of the Horsez brand, as other competing horse sims on the DS haven't trod that ground as much. And there's the bonus of interconnectivity with another Ubisoft product, for gamers who own it too  you can send sick ponies to be cured to Imagine: Animal Doctor, if you or a friend have a copy of that game handy.So the shift, in the end, has certainly been in the positive direction for this new installment of Horsez. There are still some areas that need attention, particularly the oddly implemented mini-games in dressage competition, but the work that's been done through the past year to improve this product is enough to earn it a passing grade this time around. If you're a horse-loving gamer, or you're scheduled to be stuffing the stocking of one this holiday season, Petz: Horsez 2 would be a better choice to fill that sock over the fireplace than the first Horsez was last year. But also take the time to check out the reviews of the competing products, too, before making a final decision  D3 Publisher's Horse Life and Eidos Interactive's Pony Friends could be closer to what you're looking for.", "date": "Nov 30, 2007"}
