By now, any one who reads the site has to know how captivated we've been with this series. Offering an excitement and accessibility that few titles can even approach, it's as sophisticated and versatile as a shooter can get. Wait, I thought we said we were going to skip that bit. Oh well, with a title this good, it's hard not to gush at every opportunity we get.  It's hard then to offer any real substantial changes to the core gameplay without risking a serious change in focus. The previous expansion Road to Rome was merely content to add a few new forces and a handful of new features. In that regard, it's much closer to the true spirit of Battlefield 1942 than the current expansion.  Secret Weapons of WWII, while based in historical equipment and encounters, nevertheless offers up a steroid-enhanced version of the regular game with plenty of new weapons that were on the cutting edge of technology (or merely on the drawing board) at the close of the Second World War. For some players, myself included, this extra touch of Hollywood seems a bit out of place relative to the previous games. Still, the fundamentals which so captivated us previously are strongly represented here and the speculative nature of the new vehicles is hardly a reason to criticize the game. Confused by the seeming contradiction? Perhaps we should consider the alternative.  At this point the developers have two options. First, the could merely continue to expand the theaters and forces available to the player keeping them in line with the unique brand of historically-based cinematic realism that makes the title so engaging. But since this is an action game the average Battlefield player would tend to want more than just extra units. I mean, it's not like most action gamers are cut from the same cloth as Advanced Squad Leader fans -- the same folks who'd pluck down an extra eighty bucks just for the Finnish armies chits. Although to be honest, it might be cool to see the Finns hold back the Russian advances armed only with skis and a love of Jean Sibelius.  The other route to take would be to capitalize and expand upon the cinematic aspects of the game. This is more of the XFL approach, where the basic components of the game are taken to new levels of excitement at odds with the historical realities of the war. Hence the jet fighters, jet packs and other ~what if?~ inspired additions. And when you consider that people tend to prefer playing things that are fun rather than things that are historically accurate, the new direction isn't all that surprising.  The reason that it all works is that the new super weapons are brilliantly incorporated in to the gameplay. What's more, they're surprisingly well balanced at least when taken as a group. On the speedy side, you have two motorcycles with machine-gun equipped sidecars for all your drive-by shooting pleasure. The big tanks, the Allied T-95 and German Sturmtigers, are well protected and heavily armed but are balanced by low speed and limited turret tracking. Trying to line up a shot on a moving target is a lot like parallel parking here in San Francisco: turn the wheel, inch forward, turn it back, inch backward, repeat as necessary.    The new Sherman tank, equipped with a row of rocket launchers, happily borrowed from the Russian T-34, can lay down a massive amount of destruction in a fairly short time but is limited in terms of ammo and turning ability. One of my favorite new vehicles is the Flakpanzer. Mounting air-defense cannons on a tank, the Germans can chew through any plane in sight and can even tear up the game's more rugged armored vehicles. Since the gunner's head sticks up through the top of the turret, you need to make sure you have adequate infantry support.      And given the impressive number of new planes in the game, you'll definitely want to protect your Flakpanzers. There are four new jets in the game, most just coming into service at the end of the war, and the new jetpack. While it evoked echoes of Tribes, the jetpack in Secret Weapons requires a much more subtle approach. You can't simply dart around the map at will. A heat meter limits the range of movement you have with the jetpack and really functions as a bit of a superjump more than anything else. The fact that the jetpack kit also comes with the medic's weapon set makes it a bit more balanced.  The jet planes are damned impressive. The Allied Whitworth and German Horton offer high speed, twitchy controls and loads of ground attack capabilities. The tiny Goblin jet fighter serves well as an interceptor (at least it keeps up with the other new planes) but will be a real challenge for pilots. I crashed my fair share of Spits in the previous game but this new plane's controls and high-speed make it a bit tougher to fly. Likewise, the Natter rocket plane features just one speed setting, fast as all hell, and runs out of fuel before you've had a chance to take that fourth pass over the enemy base.  There's also a new kind of anti-air weapon in the Wasserfall rockets. These rockets are fired from stations (much like def guns) and you'll control their flight as they seek out enemy planes. Again, as with the Natter, you're limited in terms of fuel, but at least you don't have to worry about finding a good spot to land while you're piloting this thing. You'll need all your skills just to hit another aircraft with it.  To my way of thinking, the C-47 transport plane would have the most potential to throw the game out of balance, but as with most of the weapons you have to use it intelligently to reap its full benefit. So in a way it merely rewards smart players with a significant advantage -- which is what head-to-head play is all about anyway. Functioning as a mobile aerial spawn point, the C-47 can even be landed behind enemy lines to provide a new hidden spawn base for your players. I've seen this radically shift the balance of power in the game.  There are fewer additions on the naval side of things. Dealing with this particular period and theater of the War, that's not surprising. The focus now is on lakes and rivers rather than oceans so you'll see a few smaller craft on the water. The small raft lets you get a lot of players across a body of water without much fuss while the Schwimmwagens and Water Buffaloes give each side a much-needed hybrid craft that can travel on land and water. Given the amount of water on the new levels (and the fact that some spawn points lie across vast lakes and canals) the new amphibious vehicles are a godsend.  New weapons are also in store for the regular footsloggers. On the Allied side engineers now get a new shotgun that really takes the edge off those house-to-house engagements. The German engineers have a new grenade launcher attachment on their Mausers. New weapons for the other elite troops include throwing knives and new assault rifles as well as the Bren and a silenced version of the Sten.    And then there are the maps. Featuring eight new maps of battles and operations latter half of the war, Secret Weapons has plenty of variety. Whether you're taking out a secret aircraft hangar in Prague or stroming Hitler's Eagle's Nest, there's a lot of work to be done here. The maps themselves are fairly large and incorporate the vehicles quite nicely. Having plenty of aircraft on your side means that the enemy has plenty of anti-air assets on their side. Having large bodies of water leading to out-of-the-way bases mean that you'll have access to some kind of amphibious vehicles. There's definitely more visual variety to be found here than in Road to Rome as you'll journey to a valley in Norway, a small French seaside town, and a number of German factory towns.      There's even a new objective-based mode on six of the new maps. Here the Allied side is tasked with destroying some essential piece of German equipment: either a UFO prototype, a set of V2 rockets or fuel dumps. This gives the game a bit more direction than it previously had as everyone is pretty much going all out to assault or defend these objectives. That the fundamentals of the core are still in place during these missions makes for a bit more variety. Still, the point of it all is taking out the objective, not reducing the enemy tickets. As such, you can find some objective-based games are over much more quickly than in the straight conquest modes.  Single player is still remarkably poor, particularly when compared against the fun of multiplayer. Since I honestly don't know anyone who even plays these games in a single player format, that's not a terrible criticism, but it would have been nice to see more work on the offline AI. Likewise, the title still needs a better filtering system for game searches. Also on the ~we expected more~ list are the game's graphics and sounds. While the title still holds up against most other games in the genre, there's simply not much of an upgrade here.As I said before, this expansion takes a small (but necessary) step away from the things that really captivated me about the original Battlefield. It's like the Alien movies. In an effort to top the scary intensity of a single alien on a non-military ship, the filmmakers had to crank things up and present you with lots of aliens and plenty of guns. The addition of plenty of super-powered weapons here takes enough liberties with the setting to turn some gamers off. After all, there's something infinitely more grounding about controlling the vehicles from movies and History Channel specials. Having new vehicles softens the sense of connection with the War and presents a sort of Hollywood version of war. Perhaps if it was called Battlefield 1946 I wouldn't mind so much.Still, assuming you can swallow the more fanciful additions, you'll find plenty of excitement here. The balance is still superb, the physics system embraces the new jet-powered vehicles, and the new maps allow for gameplay almost as compelling as you'd find on Wake or Market Garden. Though the $30 asking price is a bit steep, fans of the series won't be disappointed with this one.", "date": "Sep 11, 2003"}
