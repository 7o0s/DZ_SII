I've got some words I need to season before I eat them. In October of 2003, I wrote a preview of the mobile edition of Tomb Raider: The Osiris Codex -- which, yes, has taken two years to cross the Atlantic. I stated:   ~Of course, the big question is: Will it suck? Or, better yet, will it suck as hard as the last few games?~   There are very few things I like to be wrong about -- but video games are not one of them. I wish every game was worth playing, and even though the Tomb Raider franchise has been drug through the mud in the last few years, IOMO's mobile version is surprisingly enjoyable. It's certain worlds better than Angel of Darkness, but then again, so is slamming your babymaker in a door.   This is a basic side-scrolling adventure game that crosses the basic set-up of the original Tomb Raider with some mechanics lifted from Prince of Persia. That are two good games to borrow from, which is why the results of Tomb Raider: The Osiris Codex aren't terribly innovative, but are definitely a good way to while away a few mobile minutes.   One thing I really liked about Tomb Raider: The Osiris Codex was how each level is bite-sized. You can burn through one in a few minutes, but since there are fifteen-odd levels, you'll definitely get your money's worth.   Levels consist of basic adventure puzzles, like pushing blocks into place, hitting switches to open doors, and seeking out extra items from hidden places. You'll climb ladders, use zip lines, jump across fire bursts, avoid spike pits, and unholster twin pistols to shoot whatever gets in your way. All of these actions make sense, with a context-sensitive action key that jumps when you stand at the edge of a ledge and activates a lever when you walk up to it.   There are a few ways you can play Tomb Raider: The Osiris Codex. Most gamers will play through the regular adventure, but there is an arcade mode and a time attack mode. The time attack mode is kinda fun, as you race through the level trying to beat your previous time records. I'm not sure how many gamers will play through these multiple modes, but they are there and they also add value to the game.   The sprite work in Tomb Raider: The Osiris Codex is pretty solid. This is definitely an older game, but there are some nice touches that show IOMO put some solid effort intot he game. For example, when Lara pushes a block, she grits her teeth, and you can see a couple pixels of her pearly whites appear on her face. The backdrops are somewhat same-y, but they work for the theme.  Tomb Raider: The Osiris Codex turned out much better than I thought it ever would. I have long since abandoned my interest in the franchise, thanks to the awful game play Core has foisted on poor gamers. However, IOMO boils things down to the essentials -- as is often forced when bringing an established vid to mobile -- and succeeds in creating a minor adventure that fans (or what's left of them) will enjoy. In fact, any mobile gamer that likes a little adventure will have a good time with this femme'd out Indiana Jones.", "date": "Nov 1, 2005"}
