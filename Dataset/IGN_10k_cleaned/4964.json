But that's exactly what Atari has done and the result is Asterix & Obelix: Kick Buttix. If you're unfamiliar with the characters, you might as well stop reading this review right now since the only appeal for this subpar platformer is to see one's comic heroes move around on the screen. Well, now that most of America has been excluded, let's go on.   The look and feel of Kick Buttix is that of a PSone game through and through. The environments are built with a minimum amount of polygons and the textures that are wrapped around them are often pretty low-quality as well. In fact, anyone could be completely forgiven for thinking that this is a PSone game just by looking at it. Similarly, the gameplay feels like it has been preserved from the last generation of games with its old school platforming style.   In Kick Buttix both Asterix and Obelix are playable characters with a minor role for Dogmatix as well. Asterix is small and quick and can handle himself well in a fight while Obelix is the tank of the pair. Big and slow, Obelix can demolish enemies that mistakenly get in his path. Working together the play is usually centered on Asterix, but control will pass from character to character in order to solve the variety of puzzles in the game.    One of the key elements to civilization is fire so it might as well playa a large role here as well. Many puzzles involve Asterix using a torch and passing a flame from one place to another. The torch has a tendency to go out on its own which is an automatic timer to run to the next firepit that can be lit and used to relight the torch as well. Other challenges in the keeping of the flame include passages if a cave with high winds that need to be passed with good timing. If all goes well, the result will be a lit barrel of explosives that will clear a new space and allow the duo to progress.    Other puzzles in the game involve Asterix working different elements and opening up a path for Obelix who isn't as nimble enough to climb and jump around. By crawling through a hole and pulling a lever or turning a crank to open up a platform, Asterix has many ways og helping a buddy out. Obelix returns the favor, of course, and will help to clear out passages in his own way.    Of all the elements of the game, it's these puzzles that stand out the most. Sometimes the challenge in figuring out the next trick will be an engrossing challenge that quickly gives way to the ~been there, done that~ feeling of the rest of the game. With many collecting challenges a lot of time gets spent running around and making sure that every nook and cranny has been thoroughly searched. The reward for all of this extra legwork is a nice collection of helmets. Everyone loves helmets, right?     If you're unfamiliar with the comic, Asterix and Obelix were a couple of Gauls who were constantly fighting the Romans. After a good fight, both of them liked to collect a pile of helmets as bragging rights to how many Romans each one had clobbered. Here in Kick Buttix there's a much more practical reason for the helmets that fly off of the Romans' heads, erupt from boxes, or are generally just lying around. At certain points in the game, a merchant will appear out of nowhere, literally, and offer some combos for sale. With these combos, it's possible to pull off some crazy moves and cause even bigger destruction.   If there's one thing to be said for Kick Buttix it's that the general fighting is in line with the comic book. The enemies can be punched around and when they get knocked out they literally get knocked out of the screen, flying off in an elongated form. Romans can be swung around like a wet rag and Asterix can plow right into a large group with a speedy run. It's all so very satisfying from a fan's perspective, but pretty quickly even this gets pretty old and it's up to the combos to save the day.   The problem here is that the combos are awkward to use and are often better left unused. With little to attract an older audience with anything remotely deep about the fighting, this is clearly a title that's best left to the younger folk. The inherent problem is finding a child in America who is familiar with such a foreign pair of characters and is willing to look past the uninspired feeling of the rest of the game.    The saving grace here, if it can be called that, is the size of the game. With a grand total of 40 levels in the game, Kick Buttix certainly doesn't skimp on the quantity of a game, even if the gameplay is a bit lacking. So while kids may not be familiar with magic potions and a dog called Dogmatix, this title certainly has some value in the amount of screen time it can contain.    When it comes to how well the game sounds one wishes that more time and care had been put into the audio. The voice acting is off for both of the main characters and the background music is often filled with some driving electronic music. It's understandable that the music for a game should be driving and provide some energy, but it's a sore point for this game that it sounds like tunes from European clubs have seeped into this kids game. Like many of the other elements that make up this game, the overall feeling is of a game that had been cobbled together from pre-existing parts and given life with a franchise.Asterix & Obelix: Kick Buttix is a competently done PSone style platformer that is recommended for some hardcore fans of the comic books who desperately need to see their heroes in action or for some younger kids if the price drops low enough. With graphics and audio that feel at least five years old and a clunky combo system that are all easily ignored, the puzzles and size of the game are what really make up the overall experience. The gameplay is decent, but just barely, and this title will most likely be missed by an American audience that won't be pulled in for the game itself.", "date": "Sep 9, 2004"}
