{"name": "Everblue 2", "name_review": "Everblue 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/02/26/everblue-2", "text": "In the annals of noble videogame experiments, numerous games stand at the forefront of the pack, the most recent of which is Dead of Alive Xtreme Volleyball, a volleyball/dating sim with hard bodied Japanese women. Nothing particularly wrong with that, it's just different. Most of these games, like wacky Japanese cooking games, dating sims and titles such as Racing Lagoon (racing/RPG) only ever appear in Japan, where gamers go wild for strange niche titles of this sort on a regular basis.    Everblue 2 recently struck me as slightly oddball. Capcom's oft-partner Arika created this game and Capcom, for whatever reasons, has brought it Westward. I have been very cynical and yet mildly curious about the game since Capcom announced it. See, Everblue 2 is a scuba diving-RPG that sends players underneath the ocean waves to explore reefs and sunken ships. Why so cynical then? That's different, right? Mostly because none of the writers on the site who like RPGs wanted to touch it. And that Capcom has given us the indirect message that it's not one of their, shall we say, AAA titles. But Arika's funny RPG surprised me. I've snorkeled before and I have experienced the amazing sensation of seeing exotic fish and underwater locales for the first time, and I've come to the conclusion that this game is, without any doubt, created by a group of likeminded, fanatical scuba diving maniacs who also happen to make games. So, being an open-minded fellow, I dug into what can only be called the world's second scuba-simulation-RPG. Oh yeah.   Story  The early part of the story works well enough. It occurs one year after Everblue 1. Taking on the role of Leonardo again, players go sailing with Leo's bald, aging buddy Zuccho (a possible Queequeg reference?). But because Zuccho didn't research the ocean conditions beforehand, your vessel is caught in a devastating storm, forcing you onto a small, nearly uncharted Caribbean island (called Valentir Island). The locals ridicule your crappy scuba gear, but a young female islander (Ellis) takes a fancy to you and after a few trials, you become a part of her scuba diving clan, the ~Amigos.~ Cute, the Amigos, and there's three of them (in addition to Ellis). Real cute.   After learning more about the island, you discover many friendly types, villagers and local small business people who learn to like you, to do trade with, or once they find out you're a scuba ~expert,~ compete with you. The story becomes a little more complicated too. You find there's another group called SeaDross, an ~evil~ syndicate that charges exorbitant fees to find sunken things for people. As you accept more challenges for individuals, you learn you're cutting in on their business while helping a few thankful individuals, which creates a nice tension throughout the game, but more importantly you it helps you to learn about the mysterious treasure that's haunted Leo's family for hundreds of years. The rest is for you to discover, my wet and wily friends.   Gameplay  In truth, Everblue 2 is a scuba-exploration game disguised as an RPG. Or a scuba fish-collecting game with an RPG backbone. Or a realtime fish collecting RPG adventure. In truth, it's a real strange mix. Half the game is spent exploring underwater locales, while the other half is spent bartering, selling, buying and learning about the story. An easy way to look at it is like this: Instead of a battle system that earns you health, experience points, weapons and the like, substitute scuba diving. Underwater, you see things from a first-person perspective and you can move about, collecting a litany of valuable things. Using sonar devices you earn along the way including metal, clay and glass detectors and fish finding devices, you're paid to collect lost items for people and collect junk for your own profit. And, for those folks who just love fish as much as Arika (which is a lot of scaly love, I'm telling you), you can collect pictures of every fish you see, and later you can collect the fish themselves. Weeeeeeeeeee!   The underwater exploration, which like I said is the game's meat and potatoes, is both exhilarating and frustrating. Using the sonar devices, an audio blip indicates the relative distance to an object. Once on top of the item, depress X and you'll have collected a new object. You'll take a bag that only holds a limited amount, and which you'll upgrade as you progress. This matters quite a bit because the weight of the objects affects the amount of time you can spend underwater: The more stuff you collect, the heavier it gets, the shorter your time is underwater. And if you drown, you lose it all.    The funny thing is, most of the time the stuff you collect is junk. But even the smallest trinkets on this ocean surface are wanted by the eccentric mix of Valentir locals. You collect everything under the sun, from expired medicine, ashtrays, dog tags (thanks MGS2!), chairs, radios and even old CDs! To dive, you're given Health Points and Air points. Each time you dive you'll decrease these. They're easily regenerated by sleeping or by buying medicine to rebuild them. You can increase the maximum level by spending long periods underwater, by collecting stuff and by reaching new depths. You can also be poisoned underwater by blowfish, sea eels and the like, or even injured by sharks. Yes! Frickin' jaws is out there!    A map shows the general area, and a pointer indicates the last dive point, your swimming path, and significant places of interest you've visited. For example, to become an ~Amigo,~ you must find the sunken ship the Pensolata and find a trophy inside it. The second big challenge is to find a sunken airplane, and so on. Each time you successfully complete a task, that vessel becomes a permanent part of the map. Once you reach shore again, you can have the goods assessed and then sell them. Also, an former soldier who hangs out on central square will give you a ranking, for the hell of it, I guess.      The underwater gameplay is a really a mix of things, but the focus is on exploring the depths of the ocean to find and see different things. You can collect junk, but one of the real thrills is seeing new underwater sea life. I know that sounds funny, but honestly, it's actually exciting in its own limited way. There are dozens of fish to see from the most average Clown fish to squid, King Crab, giant Hammerhead sharks and even Seahorses. There is a real thrill in finding new fish to photograph and catch (once you have opened up the aquarium). It's also scary. Finding out you've been poisoned by a sea eel isn't so frightening, but seeing a Great White for the first time is terrifying in a way. Also, when you search through old ships, it's dark and very restricted. Getting caught in one of those things is terrifying.    Exploring underwater also has its limits and Arika doesn't do a terribly good job of helping you out. The ocean in this game is vast and finding the specific items, such as trinkets or even huge sunken airplanes can be a daunting task. I've search for hours for things that seem to be huge and obvious but I simply couldn't find them. Likewise, even with upgraded fins and equipment, once a Great White sees you, you're pretty much screwed for the rest of that dive. You'll have to surface and hope you don't see one again. I know it's supposed to add tension, and it does, but it also is nearly impossible to ditch these guys. And if you do manage to evade one, you'll be completely off the track you were previously on.   There are several underwater races too. The Drift and Salvage races are a nice side trip, but they're more or less distracting little sub-missions that don't actually add any interesting aspects to progressing the story.   The terra firma aspect of the game is rather silly. While some of the characters are endearing, such as the old man in the rocking chair, Ellis and Cal the Fish Lover (YES, CAL THE FISH LOVER), almost every single character seems to be a parody of orthodox RPG characters. They're dangerously one-dimensional. Players don't actually move about the landscape either, they use flashing buttons to visit the Beach, Central Square, the Village and the Old Market. In short, the underwater aspects are cleverly worked into the RPG side of the game, but once you've explored the surface, you'll quickly race back underwater again because the surface world is so incredibly dull.    Everblue 2 is an intriguing concept that's relatively interesting once you get the hang of it. When diving, the addictive drill of salvaging and collecting, be it in the form of snapshots of fish, trinkets, heavy items, or in gleaning valuable items for an individual, is compelling. There is something here that certainly works, albeit strangely. But the ocean floor is not nearly as beautiful as those seen in Ecco The Dolphin -- they're more on the realistic side -- and you'll constantly get lost because they're not only more realistic, they all look identical. On land, the static characters will grow dull because of their one-dimensional qualities, and the mechanical movement and lack of stuff to do clarifies the developers' obvious biased love for the scuba aspect of the game. It is indeed an RPG, but a lopsided, obscure one at best.    Graphics  Everblue 2 is even more lopsided visually. The developers' effort toward creating a realistic ocean bottom, replete with corral reefs, sunken ships and dark mysterious caves, is quite good. And, perhaps even more effort was put into the creation of absolutely incredible looking sea creatures. When I saw the first lobster I was so impressed. Really! I'm serious. You laugh, but this game is far better than any fishing game at re-creating sea life. The King Crabs, Hammerhead sharks and even Squid are replicated with great care and attention to detail. Like I said earlier, there are some real scuba diving fans over at Arika, without a doubt. Getting back to the point, the ocean bottoms, unfortunately, repeat shape and form way too much, which sadly creates a quickly boring, repetitive and visually confusing set of visuals.   Special effects play a minor role. The water is never really a huge visual plus, since you see from a first-person perspective and you never experience it other than to see bubbles floating up around you. Light does filter though the water's surface, and it's moderately pretty. The underwater flashlight creates an effective realtime lighting effect, contrasting light against murky underwater areas, but it's not a terribly big deal.   What really takes the visuals down is the land-based graphics; it looks like a standard PlayStation 1 game. The characters are sprites that either don't move at all, or they have one or perhaps two animations. Again, on land, you don't actually move, but point and click, so everything looks at best like Web Flash visuals. And even if you like the game, there's no arguing against these lackluster graphics.    Sound  Sound gets short thrift in Everblue 2, big time. The music is a parody of itself. If there were a default ~Caribbean tunez~ button on your Fisher Price electric keyboard, this is what it would sound like. The characters don't talk at all, and the sound effects are minimal whether they're underwater or on land. There is nothing redeeming about the sound in Everblue 2 whatsoever -- and that's counting the statue-esque mariachi band, muchacho.Yeah well, my opinion about Everblue 2...hmmm. Let me just wrap it up this way: Everblue 2 is no doubt an interesting effort into the underwater gaming world. It makes some strides in blending underwater exploration with RPG elements. I respect Arika for going out on a limb and trying to make it work. Because it a way, it does work. If you have ever snorkeled or tried scuba diving, this game really does re-create the magical sensation of scuba diving. And the fish, hey! What can I say? They're truly the best fish on PS2. Honestly and sarcastically. Arika gets the ~BEST FISH ON PS2 GRAPHICS AWARD (if and when we ever create that award...).But the downside to Everblue 2 is far greater than its success. It fails to create a captivating story, anything more than moderately interesting characters, and the game interface on land is just silly. The underwater world is interesting to a point, but the surfaces and textures are repeated so often you'll constantly get lost, frustrated and annoyed. Give this a rental if you want to simply try something entirely different, but unless you're absolutely a diehard scuba diver/gamer, stay clear of this very fishy game.", "date": "Feb 26, 2003"}
