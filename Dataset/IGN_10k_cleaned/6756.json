{"name": "D&D Online Unlimited", "name_review": "Dungeons & Dragons Online : Stormreach", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/03/22/dungeons-dragons-online-stormreach", "text": "Although I never played much of the pen-and-paper version, I've loads of fun with computerized D&D over the years, particularly Baldur's Gate. But Stormreach is set in Eberron, not the Forgotten Realms. The emphasis is on fantastical architecture, a new slew of factions and on Stomreach itself, a huge port city with perhaps an even huger warren of caves, tunnels and catacombs. There might be as many denizens living below ground as above. Or unliving.   DDO also hews closely to the license rule set; you'll get dice rolls for every combat action, the d20 damage and armor system for judging gear quality, and the classes we've come to know and love, plus the Warforged. These juggernauts differ from their brethren by requiring repairs instead of heals. A mage takes care of them instead of a cleric, and they have their own potions, tools, and scrolls to restore health. And you'll want to have a cleric around in general, since the D&D system doesn't allow for health regeneration. You'll periodically come across a rest shrine during your quest, however, allowing you to get back a nice chunk of health, although each shrine can only be used once.   You also use these to resurrect party members. And thankfully, the death penalty is light; instead of doing a corpse run, you move as a ghost back to the shrine, although someone has to get your resurrection stone from your body and take it back to the shrine. And if you get too far away from this person while your ghosted, your health can go into the negative numbers. It can be an frustratingly short leash sometimes, and there isn't a clear indication of which party member is carrying your stone. There's also a full screen death effect that can make it difficult to navigate, although reducing the quality of the visuals will mitigate this.     Speaking of visuals, DDO is a good-looking game. Character models have lots of detail and the varied gear looks pretty neat. Only your helm and your chest piece affect your armor's appearance, which may be a disappointment to players of other RPGs and MMOs. But the outfits look good in their own right and this allows everything to match. It does take some beefy hardware to run DDO at its maximum settings, however. I'd recommend at least a GeForce 6800GT or Radeon X850 if you want the game to look nice. If that's not an option, the game offers a multitude of settings to tweak to your liking. Don't know what stencil shadows are? Don't worry. Hovering the mouse over an option brings up a tooltip with a brief explanation and recommendation. I don't have a boatload of screenshots, unfortunately, because my game rig crashed and burned on account of an unrelated hardware issue.   The screenshots here are taken with an X1900XT running at Very High settings, although I recommend notching it down to High or running at a lower resolution when you're in a large room or near a large body of water. The aquatic effects are pretty, but taxing. Graphically, DDO feels built for the future, and it shows when you enable all the bells and whistles. However, I was able to run the game on High at 1280x1024 (LCD) with a 6800GT with no noticeable slowdown. I'll be adding screenshots I took with that system later on. To be honest, I can't see a significant visual difference between High and Very High, but the game seems to go a lot smoother at the lower setting.   At any rate, the architecture of Stormreach is quite varied, both on the surface and in the dungeons, and it feels like a real city. The interface feels clean, and you can click and drag almost any window to get things the way you want them. Below ground, you get all manner of environments. There is no generic dungeon scheme in Stormreach. Spider lairs, underground cities, mushroom caves, and catacombs abound. Sometimes the area will be small, sometimes huge, and sometimes in between. To find out, all you need to do is click on the entrance. It will tell you the recommended character level, the name of the dungeon, and a description of the quest. Here you can also choose from three levels of difficulty, but you have to play the first mode to unlock the other two. Many quests are also repeateable if you find a dungeon you particularly like, or there's no one around to do the quests you haven't done.     Speaking of quests, the party search system is pretty well done. Unlike World of Warcraft, which gives you nothing more than a chat channel that spans across three cities, the party grouping system is an actual system. Just hit O to open a window where you flag yourself as Looking for Group. This immediately puts an icon over your head, and you'll show up in the list of people automatically. You can also add a message of what types of quests you're looking for. It's a very fast way to put a group together, as you can see what class the person is and what level they are. If you're the party leader, you can also go with the Looking for Members option, which allows you to select what level ranges and class types you want to advertise to. I've never had to wait more than ten minutes to get in a group, and I don't have to continually spam a chat channel.   Unfortunately, there isn't a lot to do while waiting to get in a group for a dungeon. There's no crafting, no player-versus-player combat, no random monsters to beat up, and no auction house. This is true to D&D -- I won't deny that. But in an MMO environment, it can lead to a lot of thumb twiddling. There really is nothing to do. You can turn in some dungeon drops to collectors (more on that in a minute), repair your gear, sell your spoils of war to a vendor, and look for more quests. Other than that, there isn't really any actual game to play. You can't go into a dungeon on your own, unless it's small and you're at least one level above the requirement. But in this situation, it's over quickly and you don't get a lot of experience points. D&D's party- and dungeon-oriented system just doesn't slide smoothly into the MMO model.    At least the dungeons are fun and varied. And the loot system feels more refined. Monsters will occasionally drop items valuable to collector NPCs, and all party members will get their own item on a single drop. The actual loot is found in the many chests hidden behind secret doors and intimidating beasts, and its contents and dispersal is randomized. When you open the chest, you'll get your own list of items to pick up, reserved for you. Party members can swap with an intuitive interface, although the window stays open when you're done with the transaction, which leads to some odd silence for those of us who are used to WoW. Many quests also have item rewards, and the choices come in the dozens. There's bound to be something quite useful to your class and level. These quest rewards only come once, although you get a gradually reduced batch of experience points every time you run through the same dungeon. On the other hand, doing it on the hardest difficulty returns a 50% bonus.     DDO also has built-in voice chat. All you need is a microphone or headset, and you're good to go. Well, you have to check a few boxes in the options menu, but everything else is smooth. The quality is about on par with a speakerphone. I've found it a lot more useful than typing, and it's great when the whole party is miked up. Some people choose to only listen and not talk, though, which can be awkward. In the midst of things, you can forget that there's some green text down there you have to keep track of so you can communicate with the silent members of your team. Then there might be someone who doesn't have voice chat enabled at all. It's really quite a bit better than typing, unless you get a grating kiddie who sounds more at home in Counter-Strike. It's a bit of an immersion buster. For the most part, though, it's been a pleasant experience. There can be no arguments over loot, and accidentally grabbing the attention of a large group of monsters doesn't necessarily mean the team is going to get erased, so there's little bickering. There are no ~elite~ monsters in a D&D dungeon. Just lots of cannon fodder, a few higher level guys, and maybe a boss deep down somewhere.   But getting back to sound -- DDO does this pretty well also. The tavern music is genuinely pleasant to listen to, and the world is awash with appropriate environmental sounds and ambience. However, the sound of a crowded tavern, with conversation buzz and clinking dishware, is kind of weird when you look around and don't see all those patrons who are creating the racket. There are a few static NPCs, some quests givers, and a vendor or two -- certainly none of the bustling soundscape the noise suggest. At least the music is good. Although the musicians are also absent. Again, though, this dynamic is nothing new to the MMO world or RPGs in general. At any rate, the dungeon music is textured yet not tedious -- it's tense, foreboding, moody and unsettling, all weaving together fairly smoothly as the action changes. My only complaint is that the ~we're fighting now~ music gets repetitive. There's a whole heck of a lot of fighting in a D&D dungeon, and there's only one song to choose from. I suspect that the music portion, despite its polish, will be one of those things the player mutes after a few days of DDO.     While the quests revolve around some truly large dungeons as opposed to kill and collection quests, the depth of each engagement means there's only so much development time available to create compelling content. It's easy to implement ~kill X of these and come back to me,~ which doesn't require any dungeon at all. To Turbine's credit, each little adventure feels distinct, with a genuine sense of accomplishment at the end of it. But the truth is, it will take people a lot less time to go through ten big dungeons than fifty kill missions. One fellow editor told me he got to the level cap of 10 in about a week, although he was pounding his way through it because of a deadline.   But from talking to him and others, and from playing the game myself, it seems to me that even a casual player could finish by the end of his one-month initial subscription. And once you hit the level cap, there really is nothing to do. Like I said, no crafting, no PvP, no faction grinding -- nothing to extend or add another layer to the experience. You can create a new character, and there's a boatload of races and class types to choose from. But whatever you choose, you will always go through the same missions in the same places, in roughly the same order. Your geographical experience is limited almost entirely to Stormreach, although it is admittedly a large location. The great care that Turbine took to craft each quest location apparently comes at the cost of sheer content. And while those typical MMO kill and collect quests can become equally repetitive, at least it gives the player something to do.Turbine quickly announced that it would be adding more content in April -- another large dungeon with a raft of quests, and the first dragon that Dungeons & Dragons Online players will actually get to see and fight. But it shouldn't take more than a few days to get through it before you're back to square one. I don't claim to know what's best for the MMO gamer, and I recognize that there will be a constant juggle of quality versus quantity in any design document. But it looks like content with the depth of D&D can't be done easily in MMO-sized amounts, if you want to get your game out the door in a reasonable amount of time; before your budget runs dry and before you get too far behind the technology and features curve. I think DDO's single-player content is more compelling and its dungeons more accessible and numerous than in World of Warcraft or EverQuest II. Its visuals are technologically superior to WoW's without suffering from EQII's unsettling mannequins and relatively bland environments. But DDO doesn't hold a candle to either in terms of breadth or replayability. If only they'd had more time, or a larger team, then I might be singing DDO's praises to the rooftops. Instead, it's a cool experience that's essentially over all too quickly.", "date": "Mar 22, 2006"}
