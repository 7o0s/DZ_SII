In part due to this simplicity, in part due to a few exclusive home modes of play, Virtua Tennis ends up being one of the best single or multi player Dreamcast games out there, and yet another must have title.  This is true, surprisingly, even if you don't care for tennis as a professional sport, something that can't necessarily be said of most other sports games.  Anyone can pick up Virtua Tennis and after a couple of matches find themselves dashing across the court like a pro.  The game uses a simple two button setup, with one button for a standard stroke and another for lobbing.  You can also do a mid-range lob, and cancel a shot in mid progress.  Movement is achieved through either the analogue or digital D-pads, although analogue seems to be the way to go, despite the game's origin as an 8-way joystick-controlled arcade title.  It's a quick process figuring out what does what, and you're then left alone to deal with matters of tennis strategy rather than struggling clumsily around with a controller.  You could say this is exactly how a pro plays tennis.  He's already mastered the basic shots, and now he needs to make use of them for the best strategy against someone who's mastered the basic shots as well.  There should be no awkwardness in how to hold the racket or run around the court.  Even with this simplicity, Virtua Tennis provides the full tennis experience.  You can hit the ball anywhere you'd like if using the analogue thumb pad (maybe digital as well - I haven't tried it out too much), and this including hitting the ball into your net or outside of the court (I can do both with much consistency, thank you very much).  You can also achieve varying shot strength by pushing forward or backward on the thumb pad just before and after contact with the ball.  The only trick is that due to the simplified control setup, the Dreamcast chooses what exactly your player does, be it reaching overhead for a smash, diving for a ball, reaching around the back for a definite crowd pleaser, or some other fancy-smanshy move (I managed to make Courier hit the ball between his legs a couple of times).  You always feel in full control of the proceedings, though, which is important for a tennis game, as there's so much strategy to be found.  Do you hit the ball back at the opponent?  Do you hit it into the widest gap?  You have to pay attention not just to your opponent's current position, but also to where he's going.  Using real tennis strategies will actually help you out here.  Add in the fact that the game's sixteen players (eight available from the start) each have different strengths and weaknesses, and the surface type of your court, be it clay, grass, hard, or turf actually affects gameplay, and you'll need to use your head and have your strategies translated quickly and fully into in-game actions, something that Virtua Tennis manages to do brilliantly.  The game's also very fast, requiring quick decisions and quick reactions.  Few things are more intense than a volley battle at the net (no, you don't need to know what a volley is to do it).  You can feel the adrenaline build up as your concentration grows razor sharp - and then HOORAH, the feeling of victory, or SON-OF-A- [SLAM CONTROLLER DOWN], the sting of defeat.  This is as intense an experience as you're likely to find on the digital gaming screen.  Of course this trio of simplicity, intensity and strategy makes for an amazing multiplayer experience.  And thankfully, Virtua Tennis allows for anywhere from two to four players to go at it in singles or doubles matches.  The game makes multiplayer gaming a charm thanks to its quick interface, complete with near zero load time, and options for setting the number of matches and using a CPU controlled player.  Anyone who's played doubles tennis in real life will tell you that it's great fun, albeit very tricky (especially when it comes to positioning your players), making four player Virtua Tennis a natural party game.   It's also an excellent one player title as well, thanks to the various modes of play included by Sega.  You can make your way through the arcade mode, climbing through five progressively tougher singles opponents, all in an effort to see the game's credits, it seems, as I don't recall having earned anything through this.  The computer does get rather nasty once you've reached the third opponent, even on easy mode, so going through arcade mode can be an excellent challenge.  You can also try out a singles or doubles exhibition match if you so wish, choosing your opponents and partner, as well as your court.  Opponent AI can be very tricky at times, and an opponent won't necessarily fall for your same tricks over and over, again making this a tough contest, especially on the hardest difficulty.  But the real magic of one player Virtua Tennis comes about through the so-called World Circuit Mode, in which you pick a player and tour around the world, playing various opponents as well as undergoing skill tests.  Your competitions include singles and doubles matches that take place on a variety of different courts.  These competitions give you cash rewards for focusing on particular shots, such as lobs or serves, or strong shots.  Skills tests ask that you take out targets with well placed hits, among other things, also earning cash along the way.  Sega's actually come up with tests that, in addition to proving that Virtua Tennis's simplicity can result in a good amount of precision, are also quite clever and imaginative - I'm not going to ruin the surprise for you by listing the different forms of tests here.  The cash you earn can be exchanged for new players (up to eight), new courts (up to five), and up to twenty-eight pieces of strictly-for-show clothing, all of which can be used in the arcade and exhibition modes.  The World Circuit Mode is going to occupy a whole lot of your time as you try and get everything and try to reach the top position.  There's a progressive difficulty in that finishing up each challenge opens up a tougher version, and I'm still adamant that one of the challenge in particular is impossible to get through (a score of 100 on the bowling pin game?  Sha', right!).  Sega's actually included a silly RPG-style system by which your player and racket energy depletes with every game - this feels tacked on, and is a complete nuissance.  If you can put up with it (do what I did - go into the shop and replenish your energy after every match), expect Virtua Tennis to last for days and days of play time.   There are a couple of things that get in the way of the experience being pure gold.  The computer occasionally makes the wrong choice in what your intentions are, meaning I sometimes wanted a smash, but my player pulled a garden variety stroke instead - hardly amusing when you're in the heat of a deuce.  It also seems too difficult to chase down a ball that's flown over your head, despite the fact that a real player would be able to at least keep the ball in play.  I also had some difficulties with the partner AI in doubles matches.  Partners hog the ball too much it seems, even if it means getting out of position or diving and rendering themselves useless for a bit.  There's also a tiny problem for the hardcore tennis fans.  The game's players include the likes of Jim Courrier, Tommy Haas, and Carlos Moya.  You're not going to find such hot shots as Pete Sampras or Andre Agassi.  Women players?  Forget it!  The arenas of play are unlicensed, unfortunately, which means fake names, although they look similar to the real thing.  A broader range of licenses would be greatly appreciated in the next update.  But tennis fans won't complain too much once they get a look at the game, which manages to replicate the sport from a broadcast level like never before.  From the amazing players, who animate better than in any other sports game out there and look as good as in EA's PS2 FIFA, to the clarity and complexity of the stadiums, which include detailed sponsor signs and video monitors for the indoor stadiums, this is possibly the best looking sports game ever.  The sound effects and voices are also impressive, with arena announcers commenting in different languages and clear ball and racket sounds.  The amazing fade-ins and fade outs and motion blurred replays will suggest to people that they're playing an amazingly presented videogame, and then they'll see the occasional overhead shadows, the active ball boys, and the turning heads of all the onlookers, and they may actually think they're watching a real game.  Even with the questionable player faces and the stock rock music in the background, tennis fans will be in heaven upon first spotting this game.  And then they'll pick up a controller and won't be able to put it down as they play a game of singles or doubles against a human or CPU opponent.  Virtua Tennis is one of those games that actually transcends its roots as a sport.  You play it not just because you're a tennis fan, but also because you love games.  Wasn't Pong, the original game, just a simplified form of tennis, after all?  Everyone must own Sega Sports' latest masterpiece.  -- Anoop Gantayat, IGNDCI've never had so much fun in a tennis game before.", "date": "Jul 8, 2000"}
