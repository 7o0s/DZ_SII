As a portable rendition, the conversion was relatively smooth -- but there was some room for improvement, especially in the graphics department. The game's all about color matching, and you absolutely need to utilize the system's color capabilities for the gameplay. That's where Bust-a-Move Millenium comes in. It's the latest incarnation of the puzzler that updates the last version with new features, including Game Boy Color-exclusivity and, yes, link cable support.  Features: Story, puzzle, and versus modes Normal and widescreen single player modes Link cable support Only for Game Boy Color    If you've been a fan of the series since its creation back in the early '90s, you'll fall right into place on this version for the Game Boy Color. In this puzzle game, it's all about hand-eye coordination, quick thinking, and planning ahead. At the bottom, you've got your bubble shooter. At the top, you've got your stack of bubbles. The task is to shoot colored bubbles one at a time at the stack above, connecting three or more of the same line to make those bubbles pop. All this must be done before the stack drops below the line -- right under your bubble shooter.  Since bubbles connect to one another, you can drop a whole load of bubbles off your screen by removing the support bubbles that hold them in place. It's an amazingly addictive game that's very ~happy~ in its attitude...and you'll always find yourself being sucked in.  The Millenium edition isn't much more than what Bust-a-Move 4 was on the handheld, which means the combo system introduced in that game is included here. When you clear out a stack of bubbles by wiping out the supporting bubbles above them, those bubbles will home in on any two-links of the same color, which will wipe out many more stacks in one single shot...if you're lucky. This addition was one of the weaker points of the latest versions of the Bust-a-Move series -- when this was introduced on the console versions, Taito included an option to turn this feature off. You can't do that on this version -- it may not seem like a big deal when going up against a computer opponent, but when you play this game over a link-cable you may find the combo system shifting the balance unfairly...until you figure out how to work it to your advantage.   That's right, the game finally supports two players on the Game Boy Color, and it's in fine form. It only makes sense to include this feature, since you can play against a computer opponent and you'll have his playfield next to yours. The two-player mode is a great addition to an already fine game, and it's about time Acclaim finally sees that the link-cable should be supported. Hopefully the company will continue to use this feature in future Game Boy games.   Other features include an endless mode, a story mode (that'll put you up against increasingly difficult computer AI opponents), a puzzle mode, and a challenge mode where you have to play five rounds perfectly before heading to the next round. There are a lot of options here that'll keep you playing -- the only thing really missing is a battery to save your highscores for bragging rights, as well as to save your progress in the puzzle and challenge modes. Bust-a-Move Millenium isn't bylined as a Crawfish development, but it's obvious the Bust-a-Move 4 engine is at work in this title. There have been improvements to the graphics all over the place, including enhanced colors for better visibility -- but at its core the game features the same bubble and character sprites that were used in the last edition. Even though the color palette has been raised from the last version thanks to exclusive Game Boy Color programming, the picture still seems generally washed out during play. The yellow-tinted background doesn't really help much in this regard -- the developer should have worked on making the game a much prettier game.  But the game is still Bust-a-Move at its core, and it's still a great game...and it's the best portable version yet.  If you judge the game based on the screenshots, you may think that there haven't been many changes to the last edition of Bust-a-Move on the Game Boy Color. The graphics have only been given a slight facelift, but the options have been overhauled with more features. The new edition removes the pulley element from last year's version -- a shame, too, since I really enjoyed that addition.  The game rocks as a two-player game, though, so you'd best find another person with the game and challenge him or her to a bubble-popping riot.", "date": "Oct 26, 2000"}
