From the humble beginnings of Pong to today's masterpieces like Grand Theft Auto and Metroid Prime. However, retro is still somewhat in fashion these days, and Indiagames has crafted a simple cellphone shooter that would be right at home in 1981.  Features: Spectacularly bad gameplay Boring, uneventful graphics Not as painful as stubbing your toe, although toe-stubbing is at least free   Man, they shoulda left this one there. Combat Jet Attack, named like a bad Japanese translated title, is a reminder that not every game that came out in the so-called Golden Age was brilliant. This is a sad, boring vertical shooter with poor graphics, awful control, little action, and boring game play. We're this harsh right up front so you don't mistakenly spend the few bucks downloading it before we reach our scorecard.  Now, nobody expects a super-complicated game on a cellphone. (Which is too bad, but that's the result of straight year of under-achieving games.) But for something as mundane as this to come along and demand your dollars is insulting. Really, look at that pic. Who would want to play that? An SM freak, maybe.  All you do, level after level, is fly through space (at least there's a starfield) and blast ships. Fine, that's really the crux of some of the best shooters, after all. But there is so little to shoot, and your fighter moves so slowly, within three minutes you pass tedium and go straight into irritation. There are one-up power-ups to collect -- no weapon upgrades. And you can move all four directions, but with your ship being so monstrous, and the enemies so spring chickens either, you'll need to stay on the bottom of the screen.  Since the whole package is so abysmal, we were hardly surprised when our bullets passed through enemy ships. Hey, you couldn't pay us to QA a game like this, either. Why do people even waste their time making games like this? I mean, I guess I could see it as a learning effort for a first-time programmer -- getting used to sprite movement and whatnot -- but as a final product that somebody expects money for? Please. Verizon currently offer this on their Get It Now service, which is a disservice to their audience. This serves only to pad their catalog. I'm sure Indiagames has some very talented people there and probably some good games in their future, but this was not the best way to introduce themselves.", "date": "Sep 19, 2003"}
