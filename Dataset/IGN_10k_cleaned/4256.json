Angel Studios' last independent game before it was acquired by Rockstar Games earlier this year is a decent arcade racing shooter. Many things have been retooled in this PS2 and Xbox sequel, from the engine itself to the graphics to the strategy, which makes perfect sense, since the first remake was handled by Paradigm Entertainment, not Angel Studios.    But the overall net effect of these changes hasn't necessarily made SpyHunter 2 a much different experience. It's an arcade blaster-racer, only this year it's got better particle effects, an ever cooler car design, and it's far more difficult. Yes, there are some more changes, but that covers the outline of things.   Gameplay  Re-created in 3D by Paradigm Entertainment in October 2001 for PS2, and then afterwards on other systems, Midway's resurrected title brought with it the great original concept. The 2D game was basically a James Bond film stripped down to the car action scenes, and it was replete with smoke screens, land-to-air missiles and even a transforming car-to-boat sequence that was a surprise back then. A great hybrid arcade game.   The re-make brought with it the essence of the original, enabling players to do nearly everything again in 3D. The implementation and feeling was far from the original, but it worked. Players had access to the G-6155 Interceptor and an even better one later on, plus use of the oil slicks, smoke screens, ground-to-air missiles, machine guns, plus weapon upgrades such as heat-seeking cluster missiles, EMP blasts to stop bombs, tagging devices for tracking suspect vehicles, flame throwers, and a few more.    SpyHunter 2 essentially takes the remade model and tweaks it for better -- and for worse. The first remake was pretty easy on normal difficulty, and it didn't make much use of enemies from behind. It was linear and had some relatively difficult bosses to beat, but not too many. Little work was made of taking out enemies from behind. Angel Studios (now referred to as Rockstar San Diego) offers nearly all the same elements of the remake but fixes these problems. Players can upgrade their weapons (opened up after each new level), they drive a bitchin' 3D car model (the customizable G-8155 Interceptor) that's smoother and sleeker than the previous game's version, and it's brought in an engine that's strikingly similar to that used in Midnight Club 2. Also, using a functional rear view mirror, players can attack enemies from behind using smoke screens, mines and the like.     The result of these changes is generally good. The car handles with instant arcade action. It's quick to accelerate, instantly responds to your steering, no matter how jittery or extreme the driving may be, and it's fast. A less than detailed environment, plain textures and a generally linear path helps to up the sense of speed on most courses, too. Throughout the 16 levels and eight new Nostra boss fights, the gameplay in front and back of the car is far more balanced, making SpyHunter feel more like original arcade game. The level of skill one requires to beat the game is higher, while the level progression scheme is more lenient. But the levels themselves are harder after the first five or so.    The changes, however, aren't so drastic that many people will even take notice. Angel tried to branch from the remake as much as the design would allow, yet the game still feels remarkably similar. Several courses enable players to take more than one path (though this was very much a part of the Paradigm model), there's an off-road transformation (heavy tires, four wheel drive, etc.), and a snowmobile, which is like a land-based jetski. Of course, there is the cycle, the boat and the weapons van, too. Giving the game a little sex appeal is a female secret agent and a little more variation in the mission objectives. For instance, players have multiple goals that require pure racing, a little strategy, and far more skill. The result is an action-adventure racer that feels a little different than SpyHunter, that's harder and that has a slightly different structure. Plus, the new bosses are modeled on classic arcade style bosses, giving players patterns to follow and ratcheting up the skill level with each new boss enemy.     What's odd about SpyHunter 2 is that despite these changes, it still requires very little brain power or relative skill. The overall experience is, despite its flashy exterior, pretty average. Only now, we've got a whole new set of weird little things to confront. For instance, the level balance is like a roller coaster. One level will be easy, the next super hard. The following level will be surprisingly easy, followed by a level that might take 20 tries to beat it. Needless to say, instead of having fun, I was scratching my head in wonder.   After making this mental note to myself, I then witnessed several AI problems that made me question how much testing went into the final version. Playing on only the seventh level (~Meeting of the Minds~), the boats literally disappear when hitting docks. They disappear but continue to shoot at your vehicle. They sink but continue to lay mines. This level actually proved to be one of the more difficult ones to beat because the enemy boats actually do more damage if you're in front of them. Many of the levels convey this slippery feeling.   And even though the handling is generally more likeable in most ways, reversing and bumping into objects is awkward and clunky. Reversing is way slow, relative to the speed the car moves forward. Also, often times, objects that can be driven on, like sloped ramps and junk piles, slow the car down tremendously. And piloting the boat, which there is a lot of, is sluggish and awkward too. It's just less fun than driving the car. And by the way, variation is always good, so it's not like I hate the boat rides. It's that they're dull and uninteresting to comparatively. Quicker handling, better water physics and some aiming on the boats would be have been a huge bonus.     While the engine generally feels better and the weird camera angles are gone, there seems to be fewer secrets and secondary paths, which is a bummer. This, and the longer levels actually provide fewer powerups. Little things feel wrong about the game too. Long distance shooting is not welcome. Targeting is loose and a little sloppy. The reticule for non-guided weapons always aims higher than the target, so you're never sure if you're hitting an enemy or not. And since there are so few pickups along the way, you never want to use the coolest new weapon until the last section of the game. The list of little annoyances goes on, but essentially what happens is that any new changes to improve SpyHunter 2 are met with an equal amount of grievances, be they subjective or technical.    Graphics  The visuals in SpyHunter 2 follow the same topsy-turvy erratic behavior as the inconsistent gameplay on both the PS2 and Xbox versions. Some things have changed for the better, while other elements are worse. For instance, the new car model is sweet, juicy car love. Sleek, sexy and the ultimate machine, Angel's G-8155 Interceptor is a beauty. The car animations are numerous and eye-catching, enhancing that instant affection. Every weapon automatically appears from some smooth section and blasts away, then disappears afterward to retain the car's aerodynamic visage.      But the game is all about explosives -- particles. The care with which things explode, combust, smoke and catch on fire is excellent. Some cars are blasted into mid-air and then combust in fiery over-the-top explosions. You're constantly blowing up your enemies, and these gorgeous blasts of fire make for great satisfaction. A game of this nature should have good particles, and SpyHunter 2 doesn't disappoint.    But like everything in SpyHunter 2, the bad things prevent the title from ascending to gaming heaven. The game is rife with little visual glitches, be they weird AI boats that sink without being touched (and that get stuck on objects and wiggle frenetically), or flat textured water, or some of the most forgettable textures on the face of the planet. With the exception of flashing light and complex explosions, nothing catches your eyes. There are tons of areas with pop-up, flickering and aliasing on both the PS2 and Xbox. Luckily, the game offers quick load times on both systems.    Sound  Thankfully, SpyHunter 2 doesn't pelt you with the Peter Gunn theme like the first remake. The classic Spy Hunter theme is still present in various forms, but it's just underplayed, as opposed to overplayed. Thank you Midway.    The musical style is a cool combination of catchy rock tunes and techno blurbs that fill in the blank spots, and it's never too oblique or annoying. Though I have to say, the highlighted work of pop sensation Vanessa Carleton is a mystery to me. I can't sing with beans, nor can I play the piano, but her addition doesn't in any ways make the game sound any better.Midway's game is both exciting and disappointing, but mostly the latter.The frenetic action of driving and shooting is indeed here, replete withits minuses and plusses, and the game is harder and more challenging. With each new improvement Angel Studios made, it also added a blemish tobalance it all out. The new vehicles are cool to an extent, but theydon't necessarily make the game feel any better, especially since theyaren't handled that well. Some of the boat levels are just plainheinous. Also, the difficulty balance is like Sybil. This is a game withmultiple personality disorders -- Sometimes hard, other times easy.Which means that SpyHunter 2 is weirdly balanced, certainlyunpolished and maybe even unfinished. Not such a good thing.  If you'rea fan, well sure, go ahead, but he warned. Otherwise, rent at yourdiscretion.", "date": "Nov 25, 2003"}
