Forget for a second that MVP 06 NCAA Baseball is the first college baseball game in, well, ever. Forget that those lovable, overpaid big-leaguers you enjoyed in MVP 2005 are replaced by baby-faced, unlicensed student-athletes. Heck, even forget that EA's new title costs only $29.99. MVP 06 brings to the table two revolutionary new features. The first, the Load and Fire batting system, with which hitting is controlled with the right-analog stick, will change hitting as you know it. The third, ESPN Integration, will revolutionize the entire genre of sports videogames, period.   Because it's so danged cool, let's start with ESPN Integration, which requires that your machine is online. Thanks to new technology that EA has dubbed ~Online Everywhere,~ you will be privy to all the latest scores, updates and ESPN.com headlines, which are displayed seamlessly on the familiar ESPN scrolling ticker at the bottom of your screen. Each time you boot up MVP, the game will silently log on, and the flood of sports information will begin. That means while you are knee-deep in Dynasty mode, you can read ~Mularkey resigns; Levy back to Bills' sidelines?~ or ~Angels, city of Anaheim begin name change trial.~ Online Everywhere is the next logical step forward as more and more gamers take their consoles online. With it, people on your friends list can send you invites and messages as you play offline games. What's more, they can jump right in to your current game as an opponent or, new this year, your teammate as part of the co-op experience. It's not revolutionary, but you can now take turns batting, pitching, etc. on your way to the College World Series.   Great diving and throwing animations when you want to get dirty. But think for a second about where ESPN Integration and Online Everywhere could go. It would be no surprise that by as early as next season you could pause a game, read an ESPN.com story that just scrolled across the ticker, send an invite to a friend and come back to play co-op on your original game. As if this weren't enough, every 20 minutes the latest edition of ESPN Radio Sportscenter queues up and Buzz hits you with all the latest scores. These are the live broadcasts from ESPN Radio and you'll never hear the same thing twice. For sports nuts, ESPN Integration and Online Everywhere are dreams come true and the first great online innovations of the year, pleasant surprises from a current-gen title. Pardon the pun, but MVP 06 is a real Web-gem.   On the field, EA Canada just kept right on going with the Load and Fire batting system. Unless Nintendo packages a baseball bat accessory with the Revolution controller, Load and Fire will act as the benchmark for hitting control for some time to come. How it works: As the pitcher is about to release the ball, pull down on the right-analog stick to load your swing, shifting your weight back and coiling like a spring. As the pitch enters your swing zone, fire the stick up to take a hack. Aim left or right to pull or go opposite field; hold the L trigger for power swing or R trigger for contact swing. It's that simple, and it brings MVP right into the realm of the Tiger Woods and Fight Night franchises in terms of, ~How did I ever hit/swing/punch without the right-analog stick?~    It took the development team over at EA Canada months to map the swing to the stick, but it's paid massive dividends. Never before has swinging a virtual bat felt so good. When you foul one back off the handle, the controller rumbles for a second, meant to resemble the terrible sting that every baseball player knows. But when you stroke one clean, you know it. The controller motion, the player animation and the crack of the bat are perfect. When you get a hold of one, you can literally feel it.   With Load and Fire, there's no real way to control hitting fly balls versus grounders as in years past or adjust to the height of a pitch. The development team says that hitters have to adjust more for inside or outside pitches, and they naturally adjust to the height of the pitch, but I disagree, especially when it comes to sac-fly or hit-and-run situations. For a sac-fly, a hitter will try and golf a low pitch to the outfield to score a run. Conversely, a hitter will try to chop a high pitch through the hole created by a hit-and-run. However, using the power swing or contact swing helps this problem along as these could almost be named ~pop-up swing~ and ~grounder-swing,~ respectively.     Baserunning will take a little bit of getting used to for MVP fans. Individual runners are now controlled with the D-pad instead of the left analog stick. This year on the stick, if you press up or down, all runners will advance or retreat, respectively. You'll get in more than a few pickles as you adjust to advancing runners with the D-pad. In fact, because hitting is controlled solely with the right-analog stick, it's safer to keep your left thumb firmly entrenched on the D-pad. It feels awkward at first because, heck, this is 2006 already, but EA ran into all kinds of trouble trying to map the running controls to the trigger with the Load and Fire system. It's no better or worse; just different.   Directional sliding is back and you'll see all the same great animations from last year. Back too is the now-standard pitch meter, EA's mechanic that revolutionized pitching way back in 2003. For some reason, the hot and cold zones will disappear after the first pitch, which adds an extra challenge to avoiding hot zones when you're on the mound.    In the field, a sprint button has been added that adds a bit of risk/reward. Do you sprint for the diving catch or play it safe? A bunch of new animations have been added, mostly because there are a bunch more errors this year to reflect the college game. The skill-level of college players plays into that, as well as the difficulty of fielding the lasers that ping off aluminum bats. Your first baseman will get plenty dirty stretching for errant throws, and it looks great the whole time. My favorite new animation is one that baseball games have needed for a long time: an outfielder, waiting to field a sacrifice fly and keep a runner from advancing, charges forward to catch the ball and uses that forward momentum for some extra oomph on the throw.     Load, fire, enjoy. MVP 06 also introduces Precision Throw Control, another right-stick innovation. If you hold the stick too long, you will overthrow the ball, which usually results in your first-baseman digging your throw out of the dirt or an error. If you don't hold the stick long enough, you will release the ball to soon and throw high. While it definitely takes some getting used to, like all new mechanics, Precision Throw Control adds the release-point factor to throwing. The minor problem with the mechanic is when you dive for a ball, which is also controlled with the right stick. If you make a diving catch, occasionally the action on the right stick will carry over to the throw. So if your shortstop dives toward third to snag a liner, he will sometimes begin the animation to throw to third, even though you are slamming the stick toward first in frustration. Fret not: this is easily remedied if you simply flick the stick instead of holding it down when diving. In the end, the mechanic improves on traditional throwing, but it's not the great leap forward like Load and Fire is to hitting.    So MVP plays great. How does it capture the essence of college baseball? NCAA College Football 06 took home IGN's Xbox sports game of the year because it's a great-playing football game, of course, but also because it truly captures the atmosphere of the sport. This is where MVP could use some improvement. Forgive for a moment that EA chose a college-rock themed soundtrack over school fight songs -- there just aren't marching bands at baseball games. It would have been great to see school mascots jumping around on top of dugouts in big games, or have school-specific cheers. I personally called Florida State to confirm that fans perform the War Chant at home games, and the answer was a resounding ~Oooooooh, oh oooh oh ooooooh yes.~ A quick aside: Atlanta Braves fans first did the trademark Tomahawk Chop during FSU alum Deon Sanders' first at-bat with the team -- check the FSU media guide.    True, EA was building the first-ever college baseball game, but it would have been nice to hear some fan-cheers or some pointed heckling, although the NCAA probably nixed heckling for the same reason it asked that charging the mound and bean balls be removed: ~sportsmanship.~     Included are 128 universities, a number that EA says will increase dramatically next year. There are only 19 authentic ballparks included. The rest are canned fields resembling the venues from the create-a-stadium mode in last year's MVP. True, there are not that many remarkable stadiums in college baseball, but EA says it will up that number next season as well. If you aren't happy with those parks, the Custom Ballpark mode this year is one of the best ever seen -- you can literally make the wall into any ridiculous design your deranged mind can conceive. Or you can use some set templates, like ~Bronx Stadium,~ which has a strange resemblance to that one famous stadium in New York.what's it called again?   The Dynasty Mode is a bright spot in MVP, thanks to year-round recruiting and NCAA challenges that unlock gear from Rawlings, Nike, Easton, TPX, Louiville Slugger, Majesticthe list goes on. Each week, your staff is given an allotment of recruiting points to be spent on high-school and JuCo prospects. An interest meter lets you know if your emails, recruiting packages or coach visits are paying off. While it's enjoyable to seduce these impressionable young men, it would have been better if there was a bit more personality to the feature, like the recruit telling you to get the hell off his property because he doesn't like your proposal -- kind of like the contract negotiations with the pros in last  year's game.   That's ASU alright. Personality seems to be a minor problem with MVP as a whole, while it might not be EA's fault. Hardcore college baseball fans are going to love this game, no doubt. But because college baseball players are lesser-known than football and basketball players, it's difficult for any sports fan to know the names of more than a handful of players. We automatically build an attachment to, say, Duke basketball because we can name almost every player on that team. That team loyalty will carry over to the computer-created recruits that appear every season in Dynasty because you already have that base. It's the same in NCAA Football 06. In MVP, you have to build that attachment from scratch, the kind of attachment that will inspire you to play 20 seasons with the Cal Poly Mustangs. This all goes to show that pumping up the college atmosphere with chants and a raucous crowd is even more important. NCAA Football struggled with this for a number of years before it finally nailed it. Let's hope MVP nails it next season.   MVPs visuals are good, but not great. The PS2 version suffers from occasional slowdown and isn't as sharp as the Xbox version. The licensed stadiums look great, but the generic stadiums look, well, generic. The player-models look fine, but you can't help but feel that a lot of them look the same, although it could be argued that most clean-cut college ballplayers look the same anyway. In the single-player game, the camera switches to a television-broadcast style behind the pitcher, which is a great touch. However, if you're going to have a camera that focuses on a few rows of fans for half the game, you should really have a dynamic crowd with fans that spill beer on themselves and run to the bathroom. Instead, the fans just sit there and sway in perfect unison, which is kind of creepy.     ESPN-vet Mike Patrick is in the booth this year, and he does an admirable job considering EA had a very short time to record audio for MVP. There is some repetition to his calls if, say, you foul two balls off in a row, but Patrick has an engaging tone and he's regarded as one of the best in the biz. I would mention three-time All-American pitcher Kyle Peterson as the color man, but you hear from him so rarely -- only in replays and cutscenes, in fact -- that he becomes an afterthought and a bit of a surprise when you do hear his unfamiliar voice.    Great camera angle. Dead crowd. The online modes played well, for the most part. There are occasional instances of lag and more than once we lost voice chat on Xbox Live, but that didn't stop me from twice shutting out one of EA's developers in heated online matchups. As of now, MVP 06 is not playable on the Xbox 360.  All nitpicking aside, MVP 06 is a great baseball game. Load and Fire, which will surely be imitated in future baseball titles to come, is the most fun and satisfying hitting system to date. The pitching, baserunning and fielding is all vintage MVP -- with the exception of Precision Throw Control -- and combine to make one of the most technically-sound baseball games on the market. A deep Dynasty mode will keep you coming back for more, and any baseball fan shouldn't have a problem with the mediocre college atmosphere. That didn't detract much from NCAA Football in the past, and it doesn't here either, especially when you can create your own school, stadium and players. In terms of presentation, Online Everywhere and the seamless ESPN Integration raise the bar for all future sports titles. These features are great now, but you get the feeling that we haven't seen anything yet. And at $29.99, MVP 06 NCAA Baseball is the greatest value in a sports title since ESPN NFL 2K5 at $19.99. It's a shame EA lost the MLB license, but EA Canada chugs right on without it, all the way to Omaha, and we're all the better for it.", "date": "Jan 14, 2006"}
