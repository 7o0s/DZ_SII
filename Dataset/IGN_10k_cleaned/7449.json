The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause for the GBA offers a decent variety of challenges, levels, abilities and modes that ultimately add up to an overly long, bland adventure.    The story follows Santa Claus (Tim Allen), who somehow battles Jack Frost (Martin Short) by running around collecting milk and cookies. There's a story here, told through snippets of dialogue and photos from the film. But the cinemas are put together so badly I had no idea what was going on. One minute Santa is running around the elves' factory collecting milk and cookies, the next he's replaced by his alter ego (Scott Calvin), who is looking for his kidsby running around collecting milk and cookies. There isn't much attempt made at tying the story into the gameplay, and the cinemas are just regurgitated photos and dialog from the film.    The game itself is a pretty standard platform collection game. As Santa (and occasionally Scott Calvin), the player runs through each level jumping on platforms, sliding on ice, bouncing off toys and pushing blocks in order to collect 20 milk and cookies icons per area. To advance, the player needs to find a candy cane arrow pulsating toward the end of each level. It's not essential to find all the milk and cookies to advance, although the developers certainly encourage it by allowing the player to revisit any previously-completed levels for another chance at finding them all.    Santa has a small collection of moves at his disposal, such as a double-jump, a glide, a jack-in-the-box melee attack and a contextual smash attack that destroys prohibitive ice blocks. There are some bad choices made here though, such as Santa's ability to jump, glide and jump again, but not double-jump and then glide. And when bouncing off a trampoline object, he can do neither. But in spite of these problems, he controls pretty well.    Enemies are standard fare - disappearing snowmen, flying ice bats, rolling snowballs and walking tinmen, which all behave like minor characters out of a Mario platformer game. There's not enough variety in enemies, but they take a backseat to the platforming anyway. In addition to the main game levels, there are secondary modes that pop up in between them. In the Elf Puzzle stages, the player controls Santa's helpers as they attempt to assemble a particular toy by locating its scattered pieces. Unlike Santa, the elves have an annoyingly shallow jump and one wrong touch kills them, ending the challenge. Adding insult to injury, this mode can't be replayed unless the levels before it are replayed first, so completists will find themselves replaying a lot of the main levels just for another shot at the frustrating Elf Puzzles.       Another mode has the player controlling Santa as he dumps coal and presents down on marked houses from his sleigh. Yet another has him outrunning a giant snowball while forcing his way through a gauntlet of enemies. There's a lot going on here. In fact, if anything a bit overwhelming. But none of it is particularly exciting.    Visually, the game is a mixed bag. The sprite characters look mushy, but they're animated with great energy and are enjoyable to watch. The backgrounds are drab and bland, but layers are dedicated to parallaxing objects and snow effects for a slightly more pleasing landscape. The menus are polished and even sport an attract mode. The game offers a Sleep Mode, but since each level in the game is only about a minute in length, with automatic saving after it, there's not much use for it.    Audio in the game is about average. Sound effects fit and are occasionally cute. Music never gets annoying, but is also pretty forgettable. There's not a lot of audio going on in the game, but it doesn't really need anymore.    There are a few problems that plague gameplay. Many of the collectables are one-shot only; Miss them, and they're inaccessible without starting the level over again. Some of the levels force the player to leap into blind pits, while other identical pits (often in the same level) lead to instant death. There's really no way to tell the difference other than to predict the direction the level is headed.    Some of the enemies (such as security guards) cause instant kills, but are placed in areas they're very easy to run into. The camera is a bit slow to follow the player, and must be occasionally reset by jumping around. And the HUD (heads up display), which shows how many milk and cookies remain in each level, vanishes anytime the player is not collecting something. Since the character is always in the center of the screen, there was really no need to ever remove the HUD.    What ultimately ruins the game though is just the overall blandness of it. Everything in the game works, and enough content is in here to not feel hollow. Just when a series of levels seems to go on too long, up pops a new gameplay tweak to freshen things up. But none of it is exciting or interesting. The developers obviously put some time and love into the game, they just didn't put anything new in Santa's bag.   The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause is a harmless, forgettable game that isnt particularly good or bad. Anyone older than the target age will find themselves bored by the generic gameplay and repetitive design. At the same time little kids, especially those who are fans of the film, could do worse for a licensed GBA game. It never really rises above its mediocrity, but its not an awful game either.", "date": "Oct 26, 2006"}
