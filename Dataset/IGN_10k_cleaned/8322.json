{"name": "Heartbreakers", "name_review": "Heartbreakers Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/04/03/heartbreakers-review", "text": "The dating sim is actually an established genre in Japan, but has made little headway here in North America. Gameloft published Love Triangle in 2005, which was essentially a mobile-ized version of Sprung on the Nintendo DS. This year, Love Triangle developer Longtail Studios went solo to publish its newest dating game, Heartbreakers. Heartbreakers switches sexes from Love Triangle, slipping you into the chiseled jaw of Danny, a sandwich vendor that's juggling two relationships instead of seeking out the far nobler goal of true love.   I enjoyed Love Triangle when it came out in 2005 -- it was frothy and silly, a trifle that you could chew up and spit out in a single afternoon. It had replay for those that enjoyed the sassy dialogue, but I heard from some gamers that were disappointed with the game's overall brevity. Heartbreakers does a few things to bolster essentially the same game mechanics. As Danny, you work through conversations, picking out sharp responses and innuendo-laden bon mots to save your cheating ass. But it also adds a confidence meter that can, if emptied by cutting remarks from the ladies Danny is courting, brings the adventure to a close. This is a marked change from Love Triangle, where you actually had to make an effort to screw up.   Heartbreakers extends across 13 chapters (seven more than Love Triangle), each full of solid writing that often pops with good wit. Danny is guided through his love quest by a little devil that helps him keep his lies spinning like plates. The lack of an angel is noticeable -- and on purpose. You need to keep up Danny's charade as long as possible or else the ladies send you to the curb. Figuring out which lines to let roll off your silver (forked) tongue is trial-and-error with some assistance from the devil. For some gamers, this style of game play is fine but after an extended test, I found the nature of the play occasionally frustrating. Danny has to switch gears often to keep these women from discovering his web of lies -- which is likely the cross every Lothario must bear. Keeping up with appropriate responses drains Danny's confidence meter rather quickly. But when you do fail a scene, you have to start it over, even if you were just about to end the stage.   Between stages, you can play mini-games that ape tile-matching games and Bejeweled. If you succeed at these mini-games, you can earn extra confidence for the next dialogue exchange. You can play these mini-games outside of the story, but they are such minimal experiences that I doubt anybody will even visit that corner of the game. You are also treated to between-round rating on a mock-up of those old love tester arcade games. (Remember those old coin-ops where put in a dime and squeezed a handle to find out how hot you are?)   Once you finish Heartbreakers, you can play again to try out different lines and see where else the story goes. While it's good to see some additional outcomes for Danny, I wish there were more perspectives for the game. Danny is a no-good cheat that you may find yourself rooting for if you're into guilty pleasures like ~Desperate Housewives~ or ~Blind Date.~ I would have enjoyed taking a stab at Danny from one of the ladies' perspective, trying to poke a hole in his lies. This would have given the game extra longevity.   Heartbreakers features some excellent art. I really like this style of drawing -- the characters are expressive with a wide variety of emotions. The sound is also quite well done, smoothly matching up with the game.  Heartbreakers is a good play based its crackling dialogue and guilty pleasure mood. It's over twice as long as Love Triangle, too. My biggest complaint is how you can get almost unfairly tangled up in Danny's lies by not being entirely sure of what angle to take with the ladies. Sometimes a lie will backfire, even if you're playing your cards right up to that point. Longtail's artists have crafted some excellent characters with good expressions that really rely the emotional rollercoaster that is Danny's love life. If you want to give a dating sim a try and don't mind being the cad, Heartbreakers is a good place to start. Just be ready for the trial-and-error game play. Which, if you really think about it, sums up the dating scene in general.", "date": "Apr 3, 2007"}
