Today, those guys have evolved  into the armored, sci-fi soldiers of Halo, or the realistic recruits in Tom Clancy's titles. But back in the '80s, things were a little less civilized, a little less advanced, and a little less fully clothed.   Snake and Eagle are the names of Bloody Wolf's two bulgingly-muscled, shirtless soldiers of fortune, in this classic run and gun shooter design that took its inspiration from such sources as Sylvester Stallone's Rambo films. It wasn't alone  other companies had done the same before, with Konami bringing Contra and Rush 'N Attack, Tradewest developing Ikari Warriors and Capcom contributing Commando  but Data East's Bloody Wolf stood pretty much alone as the sole representative of that style of fast-action, trigger-happy gameplay on the TurboGrafx platform.        It's just a shame that it isn't nearly as good as any of those other mentioned games.    Things start off well enough, as the President's been kidnapped and you're given a machine gun and a knife to go get him back. But the gameplay reveals itself immediately as stiff and slow. Control feels wooden as you maneuver your chosen mercenary up, down and around the top-viewed environments, and your weaponry seems timid and ineffective. Bullets move slowly, strike with little satisfying impact, and make you wish for some kind of upgrade.   And then you find some kind of upgrade. Bloody Wolf's not without its power-ups, and the action does intensify when you get equipped with a spread-firing shotgun, a bazooka, or a rideable motorcycle. But these are all limited to a set amount of uses  eventually, it's back to the pea shooter.   Games like this can often be forgiven for any single-player failings by including strong simultaneous two-player modes  and with Bloody Wolf's two different protagonists, you'd think it'd be right there. But it's not. This game started out as an arcade title and did indeed have a multiplayer mode in its coin-op cabinet, but in being ported to the Turbo that feature got the axe. This is just a one-man show.   And it's not that long of one. The port did add some extra content to the game's campaign to try to compensate for the lack of two-player support, but even with bonus levels added in this rescue mission's over quickly. It's a fairly straightforward progression of dodging bullets, saving hostages, killing boss characters and, occasionally, doing something a bit different  like swimming. Overall, just not that memorable. And just not that impressive. And really, just derivative of the better games that came before.  Contra III: The Alien Wars and Gunstar Heroes both took up early residence on the Virtual Console, all but rendering other genre challengers from the same era to be dead on arrival. The stronger recommendation remains for those two established titles, but if you're a lone run and gun fan looking for a game you missed out on years ago, Bloody Wolf may be worth some consideration. Just don't expect any bells, whistles, or unique gameplay ideas.", "date": "Jun 19, 2007"}
