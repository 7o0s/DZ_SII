Have one or two off-seasons in the videogame world, and suddenly your franchise is on the way out. That statement becomes an even bigger truism when your title happens to be in the highly competitive football market. And when faced with a lineup that sees award winners like Madden and ESPN staring you right in the face, the challenge becomes far more daunting.   Such is the scenario presented to Red Zone Interactive and 989 Sports with the latest football offering, NFL GameDay 2004. A commercial and critical disappointment and second party release directly from Sony Computer Entertainment, the GameDay series has certainly seen its share of ~fourth and longs~ in the last couple of years. And up until recently has shown few signs of being able to convert.   But 2004 is a different story. Reassessing what's been wrong with the series and going back to the drawing board, 989 and Red Zone have decided to rebuild. Visually, fundamentally, and philosophically different from every Sony-produced football title since the premiere of PlayStation 2, the GameDay namesake is finally on its way towards redemption.    Gameplay  Gameday's most immediate change this year comes by way of pressure-sensitive controls. The harder a user a taps a button or the longer they hold it down, the quicker and more powerful the maneuver is performed. This feature translates into every interactive aspect of the game too, so whether we're talking about stiff-arming as a runner, throwing as a QB, or tackling as a defender, the way in which you manipulate the controls has a legitimate affect on the outcome.    It's most useful when quarterbacking, and after a few scrimmages in the training mode feels a lot more realistic than last year's version. If there's a receiver 30 yards downfield, for instance, you can't just tap the button and hope the bomb gets to him -- it'll miss. You'll have to take the time to build up enough strength to hit your target and face the consequences of waiting that extra second or two just like a real QB.   An important defensive change has been made as well. Using what 989 has coined ~The Jump Start Button~ players can now anticipate the snap and get an early advantage on the offensive line. Though to be truthful, the ~Jump Start~ option is actually more of a series of features that allows for a more dynamic defense. Hit L2 prior to the snap and you can view your defensive match-ups across the line; press L2 and Triangle and you can check out individual defensive assignments. From there it'll become obvious as to whether or not you've screwed up and you can either call an audible (Square) or shift your defense accordingly with L1 and R1.   You can move your line and view player assignments from the offensive side of things as well; just press L2 before the snap and the camera pulls back to reveal your receivers and their icons. Tapping Triangle in this mode shows their routes and blocking assignments and using the right analog stick opens up an effective and totally customizable hot route system. Basically an audible for individual players instead of the team, hot routes allow you to change character-specific assignments without going into the huddle.   To do this, simply select the player you want with the R-Stick and tap Square followed by the proper movement combination (eight variations in all). Press square again to confirm it and snap the ball for an instant one-player audible. Not very useful against the CPU, this advanced technique is extremely effective against human players and ensures that even when the opposition has got you cold, you can still mix it up a little.    The most talked about addition to NFL GameDay 2004, however, is the Headset Voice Recognition. A cool little bonus that rewards people for buying SOCOM, the USB VR support allows players to actually ~call~ the game instead of doing so manually. Or at least, call some of its more basic aspects. Recognizing almost 40 different vocal commands between the offensive and defensive set, the device enables users to do everything from hike the ball to send players in motion (make sure to hold down R2 to activate it). Other commands, like referee time outs, onside kicks, defensive changes, and no-huddle plays can all be instructed through the headset as well, and when used in conjunction with some of the features we highlighted earlier, brings an all-new element to the video football experience.   As you can probably tell already, GameDay 2004 is a much deeper and refined game than any of its previous incarnations. But that's not to say that it still doesn't have its issues to keep it from surpassing the standards set by Madden earlier this year. The headset commands, for example, don't always register the first time you say them and any unrecognizable request automatically takes you to the quit screen. It would have been a better move to flash a small message on the screen that says, ~Command not recognized~ or something similar rather than prompt you to leave.   That's just a small little quibble though; the big trouble with GameDay 2004 is the dominance of the running game. Unless you have a deep understanding of football and its defensive formations, you're going to get trampled on time and time again. Even if you're a football connoisseur, however, the defensive line will continue to open up huge gaps for the offense to run through. And while it wont cost you 10-20 yards each and every play, it's not uncommon to find your fullbacks gaining 3-4 yards every time they push -- even if you're the Texans, Jaguars, or Bears. This was a huge problem in last year's version of GameDay and while it's been fixed a little bit, is still far too dominant to be cool. At least the quarterback-scrambling successes are down and the receptions are less absolute.    But there are other issues too. The playbook, while much bigger than last year's, is still dwarfed by those found in the EA and Sega competition. The character creation utility is still broken into ~regular and super~ player components (why not give us a single flexible tool that allows us to do whatever we want rather than divvy it up?), and the interface is still a little clunky. Taken individually these issues aren't terrible hindrances, but put them together and you have yourself a collection of things that still need to be fixed.   Online  Nobody believed us last year when we claimed that NFL GameDay had the best online sports model, and we've been getting silly looks again for saying the same thing this season. Perhaps now somebody will listen to us though. As GameDay 2004 still has the best PS2 online sports options going. Similar to Microsoft's own Xbox Sports Network, the 989 Sports Online feature brings all of Sony's second party athletics under a single roof. Able to email buddies, find friends who are playing other 989 games, and given the capacity to create 64-person tournaments, users are provided with an instant sports community right out of the box.   Leaderboards, player rankings, and chat rooms are also completely accessible from within the game and there's even a message board system with an option to set up private tournaments for close friends. Other settings like downloadable rosters, specialized contests, and in-depth user profiles can be accessed as well. But it's the real-time sports ticker, that's truly handy. If you haven't heard of it previously, the ticker updates gamers with real life athletic scores and news bits just like ESPN and FOX does during their television programs. It even informs you of the happenings and scores in the ~virtual 989 world~ going on around you.    The online games themselves are smooth and are rarely plagued by lag (though admittedly, we tested it before it was released to the public and the servers were practically clean), and players can chat anytime with an onscreen or USB keyboard by pressing the select button. Best of all, gamers will be able to play with either a broadband or dial-up connection, and cheating should be difficult to pull off.   Graphics  One of the biggest criticisms in the GameDay series is the quality of its visuals. Seemingly two to three years behind the competition, attributes like helmet reflections and idle animations have always been named as ~new features~ several seasons after the Madden and Blitz offerings had already introduced them. Of course, the most prolific complaint in the PS2 era has consistently been the game's robotic and unrealistic player models; and the rarely convincing field textures and poor weather effects haven't helped either.   Luckily a lot of these issues have been addressed and fixed for NFL GameDay 2004. As the graphics engine has been completely rebuilt from the ground up in an effort to shed the taboo of looking like ~last year's football game~. Granted, the detail in Madden and ESPN are still superior in terms of polygons and colors used, but the differences are so much smaller now that its no longer the glaring problem it once was. From the huddle to the tackles, coaching cinematics to victory celebrations, it's a better-looking game overall. Another solid bonus is the decision to include 16x9 widescreen support and 480p progressive scan for the second year in a row. It's always a welcome feature for HDTV owners.    Sadly there are still a couple of snags that keep GameDay from looking its best. Though for the most part, the majority of these troubles are pretty minor (butt-ugly cheerleaders, frequently repeating cinematics), there were still a few graphical hitches that left us scratching our heads in surprise. The most obivious of which is an animation issue caused by data streaming off the DVD. During running plays in particular, the screen will frequently pause or stutter in mid-motion. Making it easier for the A.I. or human opponent to avoid tackles because of the hiccup delays to your input. And while this hitch may only affect your game for two or three instances a session, it's still two or three times too many.   Sound  The same broadcast team that powered GameDay 2003 has returned for this year's edition as well. Dick Enberg does a dynamite job as the Play-by-Play man with Ian Eagle and Dan Fouts pulling their weight in color. It's truly one of the franchise's rarely praised aspects, but the commentary is among the best in videogame sports -- and other than a few repeats, sound very different from game to game. Lani Blair's sideline reporting, however, doesn't fare quite as well and her comments are oftentimes cut off in mid-sentence without an explanation.   Despite the fact that Crowd noises and player grunts haven't changed much in the one year since GameDay's last inception, the Dolby Pro Logic II encoding makes for some solid acoustics with the right receiver setup. One addition that has been made, on the other hand, is the heavily licensed soundtrack that features artists such as Fear Factory, Stereomud, Overseer, Audioslave, and Disturbed. There's about a dozen hard rock tracks in all, and when used in conjunction with the classic NFL bumper music during breaks, halftime, and menu sequences, provides a much better presentation than in previous seasons. Not to mention the fact that Rex Paca's narration kicks ass wherever it's applicable.   Probably deemed impossible by a succession of disappointed football fans, 989 Sports and Red Zone Interactive have finally taken the first big step in becoming competitive again. Still in the rebuilding process and not without its troubles, NFL GameDay 2004 isn't the year's premiere football title that Sony would probably like it to be. The disc-streaming and running obstructions more than make sure of that.What GameDay does offer, however, is a legitimately solid football experience. Deep enough for experts and accessible enough for the newbies, it's a respectable trip to the gridiron that sincerely took us by surprise. With continued hard work, more adjustments to the A.I., a less powerful running game, and the desire to push forward in terms of graphics and features, next year's GameDay 2005 could mark one of videogame's biggest comebacks. The seeds have been planted my friends --it's up to 989 to see it through.", "date": "Aug 27, 2003"}
