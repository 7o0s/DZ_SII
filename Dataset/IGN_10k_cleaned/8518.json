Now, the seven wonders of the ancient world are excellent inspiration for a mobile puzzle game -- but another tile-matching game?    Each wonder is constructed by completing five stages of tile-sliding. You must swap pairs of runes to match three or more in a row, thus eliminating the brick backdrop. You must make a successful match on every square in the grid, like Jewel Quest. But this isn't the only requirement for success. 7 Wonder's twist is adding a handful of blocks that you must drop to the bottom of the screen by clearing runes beneath it. When the block reaches the bottom, a little worker comes out and pushes it off-screen to be part of the wonder under construction.   Of course, there is a clock along the right side of the screen that counts down your play time. You must move the block(s) to the bottom and clear on the backdrop bricks before it reaches zero.   Later in the game, 7 Wonders splits the grid into multiple zones with deal space between them. This increases the difficulty, but it also leaves a chance for getting stuck. For example, on one split stage, I found myself unable to make any tile swaps on the lower half of the screen, leaving me no choice but to restart the stage. To prevent getting trapped, make sure you look before you leap -- examine your moves to make sure you don't leave a brick in the corner that will be impossible to clear when time is of the essence.   As you create wonders, you unlock power-ups that clear out sections of the board, such as blasting out a row or column. You also earn bonus points by making super-combos. These drop decorative runes into the screen that, when switched, augment your score.   If you get the feeling you've played this before, you certainly have -- unless you've just stepped out of the ancient world yourself. But 7 Wonders has a few tricks up its sleeve that make it endearing, even though it is wholly familiar. When you complete the fifth stage, you see your wonder fully constructed and learn a little factoid or two about it. As you clear the brick backdrops, small pieces crumble to the workers scurrying along the floor of the screen.  Like Glu Mobile's Brain Genius, 7 Wonders is a solid entry in the puzzle genre -- but it comes far too late. The presentation is excellent and the mechanics are certainly sound, but casual gamers have by now played this tile-swapping genre into the ground. If you haven't tasted Jewel Quest, Bejeweled, and any of the match-three puzzlers that dominate the casual scene, 7 Wonders is a good download. But I doubt this describes anybody at this point.", "date": "May 23, 2007"}
