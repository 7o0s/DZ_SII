It's still a licensed property, and the Game Boy market thrives on licensed properties, so to play a version of the flick on the handheld isn't surprising. What is surprising is that the GBA title actually isn't god awful; it's far from a ~good~ GBA game, barely pegging ~average~ on the scale - it still lacks a creative flair and it's over before you can say ~what, no puppets?~ But considering what the development studio's produced on the system not too far before this one, it's downright amazing to experience something that's not as hacked together as the team's previous efforts in the form of Van Helsing and Around the World in 80 Days. Features Nine missions Puzzle and flying challenges Password save  We'll leave the film criticism out of this review, apart from us wondering why the heck you saw it in the first place. But as for the GBA game, published by Vivendi Universal and developed by Saffire, this combination Lost Vikings-meets-Zaxxon design is based up on the real-life 2004 remake of the classic, kitschy marionette-based 60s British television show. No puppets. Well, except for Bill Paxton. But that's just the way he delivers his lines.  It's really not difficult to see that Saffire was responsible for Thunderbirds' design and development. The team, like most GBA teams, clearly reuses its technology over and over again, and a Saffire game tends to have a particular look and feel that's translated from one game to the next. Thunderbirds features the same grainy, black-outlined but smoothly animated rendered character sprites and somewhat industrial, gray background designs as Van Helsing and Around the World did.  But where the team's last two games failed in providing a ~fun~ game design, Thunderbirds on the other hand really isn't all that bad. The game takes the idea of using three Thunderbirds team members in a Lost Vikings inspired cooperative action game. Each team member has his or her own special abilities that will be put to task in the nine different areas based around the movie. Alan, cool dude and jock athlete, has the ability to jump and shove crates. Tin-Tin, the game's token girl, has the same jumping ability as well as the ability to move things with her mind. Fermat, the stereotypical geek, can't jump but he can hack computers and roll through ventilation shafts. The level designs put these abilities to use in some puzzling structure.  Though its inspiration is Lost Vikings, it's not nearly as clever or creative since the characters only have a couple of attributes that set themselves apart from each other. Which means puzzle designs are just variations of the same ~shove crate, hit switch, roll through vent, hack computer~ idea.  Unfortunately, the other portion of the game is the dud of the batch. Between these puzzle missions are really, really, really lame flying missions that borrow heavily from Zaxxon and River Raid, with a little Barnstorming blended in the mix. But the design that's used here is amazingly bland and tired with some of the worst collision detection ever seen in a shooter. Though a game based on the Thunderbirds license is expected to have some spaceship missions, the GBA game would have been better off without 'em.  And then there's the length. The game is obviously aimed at kids, what with the movie being targeted at that demographic and all, but any gamer familiar with a D-pad can blow through the nine different missions in a short couple of hours. The three character password system's a little goofy to see, until you realize that you can count the amount of save positions on two hands. Some of the situations are a little forced (like requiring the Thunderbirds team members to pull switches and trigger traps in their own building), but the Lost Vikings levels, though simplistic in nature, aren't badly constructed. The shooter levels, on the other hand...well, Atari 2600 games put them to shame. At the very least, Thunderbirds for the GBA is better than expected, but still not what would be considered ~better than average.~ It'll tickle the few kids that enjoyed the flick, but that's about the only people who should be bothering with this game anyway.", "date": "Aug 10, 2004"}
