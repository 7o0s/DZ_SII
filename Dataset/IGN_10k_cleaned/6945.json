The tech of those old coin-ops and today's working-class cells are pretty evenly matched. Most classic arcade games never required more than two buttons, and that suits some input-challenged handsets quite well. So, it was with a mix of hope and nostalgia that I downloaded Paperboy on my LG VX8000 yesterday. Without handlebars, would the SEGA Mobile-published game offer at least a reasonable facsimile of the old favorite?   It does. Paperboy plays almost exactly like the classic arcade game, as you steer a newsie down a series of suburban streets, delivering the paper to subscribers and avoiding pitfalls like errant tricycles and remote-controlled cars. You get big bonuses for tossing the morning paper right into the mailbox or on the front doorstep and lose customers for mistakenly breaking their windows or missing their house completely.   And then there's the non-subscribers. Apparently, only Dracula and pedophiles don't take the local paper, because you never deliver to scary houses -- many complete with backyard cemeteries. You can certainly terrorize those houses by throwing the paper through a window for some extra points, but unless you're good at picking up spare paper bundles in the streets (and avoiding sewer grates that catch your tires), you need to conserve.   Paperboy handles quite well with easy controls. It certainly looks like the classic game. The sound is fine, too. A pretty good recreation, if you ask me -- and since you read this far, you kinda tacitly did.  This is a solid port of Paperboy, so if you liked the arcade original, there's no reason you wont dig having it on your mobile phone. I always enjoyed the classic game, so this was a worthy download for me. It should be for you, too.", "date": "Jun 1, 2006"}
