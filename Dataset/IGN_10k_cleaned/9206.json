This is as fine a Zelda game as we could've hoped for on Nintendo's diminutive console; any fears that stylus-only controls would weaken the Kokiri sauce can be abated once and for all. This is the good stuff right here. Those who want a fresh experience need not read the whole review - just check out the conclusion and score. For everyone else, I'll try and remain as essentially spoiler-free as humanly possible.   As the official sequel to the GameCube's Wind Waker, Phantom Hourglass shares a great number of similarities in content, gameplay and characters. After hooking up with Tetra (Nintendo reminds players that this is actually Princess Zelda's tough-as-boots alter ego during the intro) and setting off on an adventure to find the mysterious Ghost Ship that's been terrorising the waters, she ends up jumping aboard the cursed ship and gets herself trapped in its evil hull. Link, diving to her aid, falls into the water, where he is carried to an island and wakes up.   It is on this island that you eventually cross paths with Lineback, the seafaring 'adventurer'. While he's a bit of a scrawny weasel when it comes to getting into the fray, his boat eventually becomes the most essential tool in the game - next to the fabled Phantom Hourglass and eventually the Phantom Sword. Like the major Zelda releases to date, the pacing is spot-on. You'll cut your teeth on basic puzzles; you'll get your sword and learn the ropes of combat. While we're on the topic, combat (and virtually every other action in the game) is solely performed with the stylus.   This is a make-or-break decision - to relegate not only movement but all combat, item use and environmental interaction - to the stylus. It's a stroke, so to speak, of genius, because it works flawlessly and adds a whole new level of interaction to the game world and puzzles. Sure, I know that sounds like corporate buzz-talk but the truth is, this is a Zelda game that feels like no other but loses none of the elements that you, as a fan, have come to expect.   The start of the game gives you a gentle introduction to combat and, erm, map annotation.  In practice, slashing around Link in little movements works pretty well, but it's in the lock-on leap attack that the game shows its lightning pace. By tapping enemies, you'll automatically attack. Boom. Dead. What that means is that Nintendo can craft some tricky situations where multiple enemies can all spawn around you and you'll need to tap them out of existence or get overwhelmed. The result is a combat pace that is faster than you're used to in a Zelda game - more akin to Ninja Gaiden, minus the Ninjas. And the Gaiden.   There are all the series staples - quirky characters, boomerangs, bomb flowers, shovels, shields, side quests, an expansive overworld (albeit dominated by an ocean), a stirring score that ranks up there with the best on the system (and in the series) and a good number of temples of gradually increasing complexity. Then there are the secrets, the incidental conversations, the comedic animation and outstanding puzzles, now with a touch-based twist.   As with the last few Zelda games, you have a fairy companion. In Phantom Hourglass, Ceila is your fairy, giving Navi-haters a reason to boo and hiss. Her glowing blue-white icon acts an indicator of where you're pointing with the stylus, which is very clever integration. At first sweet and adorable, her constant interjections (effectively speaking on Link's behalf) definitely start to wear thin. It makes sense, of course, for her need to speak, as it carries the story. But a lot of the charm of the strong, silent Link is undermined by this fluttering chatterbox.   Phantom Hourglass gains a lot of ground, though, with its impeccable presentation. There is no finer looking DS game that we've come across that combines this level of artistry with impressive textures and some startlingly good special effects like soft glows, reflections and animated faces. Just outstanding. Nintendo, like Square Enix, knows how to manipulate hardware and make it sing. Even smaller details like the rolling of waves on the ocean, the movement of clouds and (gasp!) sun flares have been crammed into the engine, which cranks it out in cel shaded glory like a pro.   The score too also sounds remarkably good on DS hardware; side by side, some of the compositions from Wind Waker sound nigh-on indistinguishable. The original songs, such as dungeon scores and unique island themes, also sound fantastic. One element that needs to go, though, is the constant grunting from Link as he swings his sword or spins around. It's a bit much, especially if you're doing lot of swiping to clear grass or kills swarms of manic bees bent on Link-blood.    Seafaring continues to remain the overworld transport method. However, we actually prefer the simplified, stylus-mapped navigation and steam-boat powered movement to Wind Waker's constant wind-direction adjustments. By mapping out a course on the world map, you can travel from port to port, island to island, with ease. After unlocking the canon and crane arm, the sea becomes alive with activity - enemies, obstacles, treasure and secrets. It's just about the same level of depth that Wind Waker offered, minus the ability to hop off the ship at will. While we would prefer that level of freedom, only being able to dock at certain ports still works well.   Islands are not terribly complex; most are reminiscent of A Link to the Past, were it divided up into tiny land masses, rather than the sprawling Windfall of Wind Waker. However, each is populated with plenty of NPCs to advance the story, which eventually tasks you with three Spirits of Power, as well as manipulating the Phantom Hourglass while inside the Temple of the Ocean King - a dungeon with numerous basement levels filled with puzzles and guards called Phantoms. The hourglass keeps you from taking damage for as long as there is sand in the top of the hourglass. You really need to get strategic with your time, too - even incremental time increases that you find around the place only give you just enough time to experiment a little bit with routes.   The structure of the game revolves around steadily working your way deeper and deeper into this temple. The Ghost Ship and rescuing Tetra are also paramount, but you're constantly being pulled in one direction while the main plot thread sits just out of your view. It's actually pretty clever storytelling and it keeps the game structure well paced throughout.   The Battle mode; it's good, sure, but is merely 'good' acceptable in a Zelda game?   We have a couple small criticisms though that we'd love to let slide, but can't. Progression in the game is well paced, but definitely on the easy side. This is not Zelda-Lite, but we're not talking about Water Temple tricky either. By introducing stylus-solutions to puzzles and combat, the pace is upped. There's less need to get the targeting right with your bow or boomerang, for instance, or to estimate where to toss a bomb. Just point and you're effectively done.   Once in a while, the roll-mechanic - triggered by swirling a small circle at the edge of the screen while running - is slightly unreliable. The Battle mode, where Link faces off against Phantoms, guardians of the golden Force Gems, is a mild distraction but never comes close to the intricacies of Four Swords, which came for free on A Link to the Past on GBA and as the standalone GameCube release. It might not be fair to sniff at a freebie, but it feels a little pointless and isn't as fun as a straight-up bombs and arrows fight would be. That raises the old argument, 'if you can't do it better, then why do it at all'? Ultimately, it's worthwhile but it's barely a legitimate multiplayer feature, let alone a selling point.   But so much for that. Enough negativity, because there's so much to be thrilled by in Phantom Hourglass. We haven't even touched on the Gorons and their island, the treasure collecting and online trading, the annotating that you can do on the maps in the game, the hidden islands or upgradeable defensive and offensive powers - granted to you by Spirits of Power. This is a very full game that goes a long way towards ensuring that it is viewed as a legitimate Zelda adventure. It doesn't dumb down the gameplay by adopting stylus techniques - rather, there is a surprising flexibility to it.    There are a few moments where you'll know exactly what needs to be done before you've done it, and experienced players will rarely stumble along the way - Phantom Hourglass never strays too far from the Zelda gameplay canon, after all. But the integration of touch screen elements, some occasional microphone use and loads of entertaining exploration, action and storytelling make this one of the best all-rounder games on the DS.
