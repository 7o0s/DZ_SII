Last year, the Full Moon crew coded circles around the competition and walked away with the only real ~Triple A~ launch title on the system. What's great for consumers is that the team's follow-up is even better. It's a return to the franchise that paid the company's bills over the last five years and it's one of the most adored and acclaimed series in the PlayStation library -- it's Ratchet and Clank (in case you missed the headline), and it's really, really good.   Interestingly, Insomniac's latest Lombax adventure is a little different from those that came before it --and not because it's the first one to make the jump from standard-def to HD. Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction is different because it takes itself a little more seriously.   Yes, you can dress up as a pirate. Longtime fans needn't worry, though. ~Taking itself more seriously~ doesn't mean that the game has lost any of its humor or style. Clank doesn't womanize or gamble, nor does Ratchet have a drinking problem -- they've just grown up a pinch and it shows in the storytelling.   One of the most surprising things, actually, is just how much story there is. While the narrative isn't as hefty as what you'd find in an adventure or an RPG, R&C Future still has a lot to say. Where did Ratchet come from? Where are all the other Lombaxes? And why is Clank seeing invisible soft-spoken robots (Zoni) every time something important happens? These questions and several more are addressed before all is said and done, and the writers manage to derive some genuine emotion out of it. As it turns out, Ratchet and Clank's relationship is good for more than just a few dozen laughs.   But as you'd expect, those laughs can still be found at every turn. Captain Qwark's buffoonery is at an all-time high and the number of one-liners and ridiculous observations he makes should force even the most serious gamer to chuckle. Lead bad guy does play second fiddle to Ratchet's other nemesis, the pirate captain Slag. Or to put it another way, Up Your Arsenal's Dr. Nefarious keeps his crown as ~Best Ratchet Villain...~ but mainly because Tachyon is so underused.   Lombaxes never looked so good. On the plus side, Tools of Destruction wins ~Best Ratchet Everything Else.~ This is truly the pinnacle of the series in nearly every regard, and the game has been polished to a level well above its predecessors (and most competitors).   Simply fire it up and see for yourself. Ratchet Future is one of the best looking titles of 2007 and is easily the most attractive PlayStation 3 game to date. Other than a few odd hiccups (during cutscenes of all things), the framerate never falters and the activity is always high. In even the most subdued of levels, vehicles fill the sky in huge numbers with every special effect imaginable highlighting the characters and terrain below. In some stages, dozens of highly-detailed soldiers shoot it out with an array of different weapons while surrounded by explosions, spaceships and the unpredictable commotion coming from player one. The screen is consistently hectic and colorful and it's a beautiful thing.   Much of what makes Tools of Destruction so appealing are the little things -- those extra steps that prove that there is indeed a difference between ~high production value~ and ~high budget.~ When visiting a fiery prison planet halfway through the game, for example, listen closely to the intercom voice for nods to shady folks from past games like Slim Cognito and Ace Hardlight. When using your Tornado Launcher (more on that later), pay attention to Ratchet's head as he follows its path of chaos; and don't forget to listen carefully for musical and visual cues that pay homage to a certain Johnny Depp/ Orlando Bloom trilogy during the pirate sequences. In short, a lot of care went into the making of this game, which makes it a whole lot easier to care about what you're getting out of it.    Happily, what you do get out of it is a lot. Though not original in comparison to other R&C games (let's face it, every installment is essentially the same formula -- just refined) it doesn't mean that it isn't a hell of a lot of fun. The familiar linear pacing and ~explore if you want to~ setup is back once again, but the stage design is terrific and the progression system is dead on. Backtracking almost never happens in Tools of Destruction unless you want it to, and even then Insomniac had foresight enough to implement shortcuts for easy returns to the important sections of a stage.    Another big plus is the revisitation of Ratchet and Clank's roots. While a blast in its own right, 2005's PS2 actioner Deadlocked was knocked around a bit because of its focus on arena battles and lack of Clank. The Arena showdowns are back for the PS3 effort, but they've been dramatically scaled back. Instead, the game designers stuck to the same 80% shooting, 20% platforming plan that worked so well in Going Commando and Up Your Arsenal, and it makes for a much more compelling game. Clank's old-school ~control a bunch of robots~ segments are back too, only this time they have new abilities (like ~levitate~ and ~manipulate~) and bigger levels to traverse.   As any Ratchet fan will tell you, however, it's the weapons that make or break this series and Tools of Destruction has some great ones. My personal favorite, The Nano-Swarmers, are beehives that jettison angry little insects that pelt your enemies to death. The Mag-Net Launcher is an electrified cage that traps enemies in an energy net, and it works great when used in conjunction with the Razor Claws (that are ripped straight out of Halo), which become more and more powerful the longer you use them without being hit. The aforementioned Tornado Launcher got a good bit of press several months ago, and it's a great help against bosses, but its Sixaxis funnel control is pretty poor -- so don't expect to manipulate it much. Look for some variations on older weapons too, like the Fusion Grenades, Shock Ravager, Shard Reaper and the like.   Among your destinations, this comet base. Other cool additions to Ratchet PS3 include a tiered hexagon-upgrade system that goes hand-in-hand with the experience points attached to your weapon that allows you to customize your guns exactly how you want them (you can even unlock secondary fires for everything in your arsenal. Devices are new as well, and these are specialized ~limited use~ items that include the Transmorpher (it's Penguins this time, alas not as a perma-weapon) and the ultra-famous Groovitron disco ball. These extra goodies are great fun and add yet another layer to an already deep gameplay experience.   If all that isn't enough for you, take comfort in knowing that there are vehicle-riding sequences, space battles (that are absolutely gorgeous, by the way), some pretty insane boss battles and a number of other fun things that's best left for you to discover rather than have me spoil them for you. Just know this, once you beat the game you're not done -- you can go back and get even more, previously unattainable things your second time through.   What's not to like? Well, if you're the type of player that prefers Devil May Cry 3 and Ninja Gaiden Sigma to Heavenly Sword and other ~mass appeal~ games, then you may be disappointed in Future's difficulty. It's not that hard at all (save for a boss fight or two) and thanks to your amped up weapons and armor, you'll rarely die unless you misjudge a jump. There's also an occasional bug or two that slipped through the cracks (a secret ~Holo-plan~ item I found wouldn't register no matter how many times I claimed it, though'm hoping that when I get to it in Challenge Mode again that it'll work this time). Oh, and I don't like the Decryptor lockbreaking game (it's a tedious ~roll the marble over there~ mini-game that isn't as fun as the old Tresspasser lasers), but otherwise, I've run out of negative things to say.Whether you're new to R&C or someone who has played them all, Ratchet and Clank Future deserves to be in your library no matter what. Not only has it supplanted Going Commando as the best title in the franchise, it's also the best game of any series on the PlayStation 3 thus far -- and that's saying a lot when you're up against Oblivion, Ninja Gaiden, Warhawk and Insomniac's very own previous effort, Resistance: Fall of Man.Congratulations Full Moon folks, you're two for two.", "date": "Oct 23, 2007"}
