The sequel to Championship Surfer on PS and PC, Sunny Garcia's Surfing on PlayStation 2 is aimed in the same direction as its predecessor, but it's improved partly because of technology and partly because it's a better game.   With this next generation of surfing games, there is a lot to overcome. Developers need to develop a great wave engine, with water physics that create varying wave types shapes, they have to create a superb 3D engine, find good camera angles, and then, most importantly make the game exceptionally fun to play.  Sunny Garcia Surfing, at least, performs well in several of these areas. Krome's game is relatively simplistic in its arcade-like style, offers a good cast of pro surfers, and it provides a likeable soundtrack, too. All in all, Sunny Garcia Surfing is likeable, but with the stunning extreme-sports games out in the market, including the upcoming TransWorld Surf, Sunny won't be taking the gold.   Gameplay For those who haven't played Championship Surfer, Krome's first surfing effort, Sunny Garcia Surfing is a steadfast sequel to the game. OK, it's not really a sequel so much as it is a facelift, but it's an admirable facelift. The game offers arcade-style surfing, enabling players to ride a good stable of different size and shape waves, to pull off upward of 50 tricks, and to do it all with a smooth, easy sense of control.   The gameplay modes are very much like those that were offered in Championship Surfer, starting with Freesurf (clock-free surfing), Arcade (an obstacle course of sorts), Time Attack (pull off as many tricks under the specified time), Challenge (unlockable skill-testing course), Multiplayer (two-player mini-games), and Championship, which is the best of the lot.   In Championship mode, players can choose from a big cast of pro surfers, each with different characteristics and skill sets, and compete in a seed-style elimination contest, based on accumulated points. Players can pull off tricks, sit deep in the tube, or find a style all their own to earn as many points as possible to progress. The best part, however, is opening up new surfboards and even better, new surf spots. The more competitions you win, the more you open. And later on (when you beat beginning and amateur) the bigger waves become increasingly challenging.   The control in Krome's game has always been solid, and here, it's once again good and easy. Moving the surfers around on the wave is smooth and simple, and while pulling off tricks is a gradual process, it doesn't take too long to start pulling off aerials, floaters, and 360s. In fact, the controls are pretty much exactly like they were before, and so are most of the tricks. There are 50 in all, a nice number, and they all can be pulled off with a little practice. The biggest obstacle I found was that I wanted more, and not just more tricks, but a more complex tricks system. Extended combos would have been nice, and more abilities to tinker with every single move would have been ever better.   This isn't criticism about the basic trick systems so much as it's a note about the trick system's limitations. You'll feel like you've pretty much learned this game in a few short hours, and well, honestly, the crazy, annoying, obstacle-course Arcade mode just won't lure me in to play five more hours. Likewise, the two-player mode is more of a novelty and a distraction, than anything else. Some more imagination and creativity, such as those found in the Challenge Mode, might have helped to create a deeper, more well rounded set of gameplay modes.    The cameras still baffle me a little. The camera faces toward the surfer, so that there's not too much in front of him that can be seen. It's a daunting task to surf a huge wave, or a wave with sections, when you can't see too much in front of you. There seems like there has to be a better camera angle than these. The camera's distant stance doesn't pull the gamer in as much into the direct action with as much visceral pop as it could, and in Arcade mode, with obstacles coming out of nowhere, the camera spot simply defeats the purpose.   It's worth noting that the waves in Sunny Garcia are better overall than in Championship Surfer. Or perhaps it's my imagination. But I don't remember the various sections and different styles of waves being as individualized as they are here. I really like the wide range of waves in Sunny Garcia. Also, it appears that the surfer cast and board selection have grown to affect the gameplay more as well, creating a better sense of diversity in other areas than waves.   Graphics The jump to the PS2 has been helpful to Krome and Sunny Garcia. Sunny Garcia Surfing is now a smooth-looking game that boasts a good framerate, solid steady animated waves, and good-looking surfers.   Mind you, the game is not a great looking game, in fact, it's very basic in the graphics department, but what seems to have developed are the waves themselves. The waves actually look better, less broken up, and have a smoother, more fluid sense to them. The waves range in size and form, which is nice, too. For instance, Rockpiles provides a rich, deep dark blue-green wave that provides a great big barrel, and offers a thick lip that's incredible to pull tricks off of.   But other than the better-looking, more fluid waves, this game is incredibly basic in every visible area. It's plain as the girl next door, before she blossoms into the hot Betty in her high school years. And the underwater presentation is nice, too, but it's still very, very, very simplistic and even a tad dull.   Sound Love it or leave it, Sunny Garcia has one of those trendy ~alternative band~ musical lists that seem to appeal to the hip, new stylish kids on the block who love games, extreme sports, and are just getting over the pimples and into girls' shirts (or at least they're hoping to). The list is fitting for the sport, but not very teen angsty in tone, and just a tad predictable. Still, the tunes without the singing, and a few reggae/mod-power pop-tunes so feel right.   The list includes: Southbound and Doing Time (MxPx), Never Be (Mustard Plug), Angel (Slick Shoes), Never (Ghoti Hook), Nightlife (Digger), 100 Proof (88 Fingers Louie), and Man, Beautiful, and American Made (Sprung Monkey). Make what you will of it: love, like, or hate. Sunny Garcia will certainly get overlooked with the incredible litany of brilliant games that are hammering the retail channels right now, and with some good reason. The game is presented in the most simplistic of manners, with absolutely no frills whatsoever. It's plain looking, and it seems very basic in every way. So, there is nothing terribly next-generation about it. However, the game does have a good core. The basic surfing controls and moves themselves are solid, smooth looking, and easy to handle. The waves system has grown to become more unpredictable, with waves sectioning off and speeding up in areas to create more spontaneous gameplay, and a greater sense of depth to the game. If you like surfing games, this one of the better ones out there, even though it will almost instantly be overshadowed by the more complicated, more diverse and pretty looking TransWorld Surf. What this game really needs is a major enhancement to the trick system, to make it more full, and much deeper in trick combos, link, and to finally to offer some new creative gameplay modes that nobody has done before. Also, the camera system, at least in my opinion, has to somehow follow the surfer rather than lead him. It may look cool at first, but it's not the way to go in the long run.", "date": "Oct 31, 2001"}
