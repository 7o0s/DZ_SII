Sure, you get to play all types of titles before the general public does, and yeah it's a nice little bonus to be able to talk with developers you've admired for years. But it's not always chips and Mountain Dew for those of us in ~the biz~. Sometimes necessity calls for you to cover an outright terrible offering. Something so horrifying, you're afraid to talk about it with loved ones after dark. Not too long ago I had to tackle South Park Rally, thinking I had played the worst driving game ever made. After all, with control and play issues like those, there was no way it had any competition... right? Wrong. With a capital ~W~. Spirit of Speed 1937 is the poorest excuse of a Dreamcast game I have ever laid eyes on. Dethroning previous clunkers like the aforementioned SP Rally and the abysmal Fighting Force 2, the level at which bad games are to be judged plummeted a couple of notches the day this disc left the presses.  A part of me wishes that there was a positive aspect to my experience with SOS 1937 (Fitting that its initials are known as the international acronym for ~help~ isn't it?), but the reality is that there was no such thing. Immediately as I first powered up my Dreamcast and witnessed the painfully slow load time, my inner-voice began to tell me that something was about to go terribly wrong. Twenty to thirty seconds of blank screen just to get to a menu? IT'S A PERFECTLY STILL MENU FOR CRIPES SAKE! WHAT'S SO DIFFICULT ABOUT THAT? Sadly, it was only the beginning of load time Hades.  Race after race, loading and waiting plagued every attempt at joining a competition. At one point I actually started grumbling to myself in tirades without answers: ~Why do the menus appear to be geared towards driving the player to alcohol abuse? Why does everything have to load for half an hour before some sort of action other than choosing a car can be accomplished? And why in the hell am I even bothering with this mess of frustration?~  Secretly I was hoping that the phrase ~All good things come to those who wait~ would ring true. I was wishing down deep that all this loading and decision making I had to deal with would blossom into something more when I started to race. But once I was underway, and found myself nose to nose with everything but the open part of the track, my disappointment continued. I finally managed to figure out why the game was testing my patience... it was trying to warn me not to play it. All this extra time it was giving me was to help clear my head into rational thought, but I didn't discover that little gem until it was too late.  You see unlike most racing games, Spirit of Speed doesn't want you to go in the direction the course is following. Instead, it prefers that you slam into guardrails, obstacles, and every possible object on the side of the road. You don't get any extra points for this, you can't unlock special cars with it, and you won't see a hidden ending. No friends, what you will get is the sad realization that the control is worse than you can ever imagine. Who needs nightmares when you have a reality like this? SOS 1937 does try to give us some sort of variety in its attempt to kill us. Nine different racing tracks and more than a handful of cars look like a solid attempt at depth in the beginning. But play a bit longer and you'll expose the truth. Actually, I take that back, don't play it. I'll spare you the pain and unleash the secret myself: all the cars and tracks are pretty much the same deal. The autos are difficult to handle and sport likely attribute scores evenly dispersed in different categories. In the end though it doesn't really make much of a difference, as traversing the oval shaped levels is a task rife with boredom. Who cares if the textures are slightly different from the track before? It's still the same race with bad design and worse handling!  Although the options menu lets you adjust your button layout to whichever scheme you want and avoids the choices brought on by presets, it doesn't matter; It will still suck. Whipping around corners at a whopping speed of 80 miles per hour, don't be surprised if you have to let go of the gas completely and come to a full stop in order to avoid smashing into everything in sight (yeah right, like you won't do that anyway). How could the testers let this through? ~Well, you can make it from point A to point B eventually, right Larry? Just pack a lunch... APPROVED!~ Lord help us.  Matching the controls pound for pound in the filth factor would have to be the graphics. Zipping along at what has to be a brisk 10 frames per second, the poor quality backgrounds chop like the Hudson River (and if they had an odor would probably smell just as bad). Uninspired textures pasted onto less than complicated polygon models doesn't help the matter any. Could they have made it look any worse? It's as though LJN decided to create a Dreamcast game with the Net Yaroze and only ported it half way! Truly unbelievable.  I could go on about Spirit of Speed's shortcomings all day long, but I can feel that vein in my forehead slowly popping out of its container. In this day and age of superior technology and an enhanced awareness of the average gamer, it baffles me as to how a product like this can make it through quality control. A waste of time, a waste of resources, and a waste of money, SOS 1937 is at its best, the first successful attempt at converting sewage to the digital medium. Do yourselves a favor and flush it.Ouch!  Yes, this game does indeed have some problems, in all areas, from presentation to the general feel.  I like the idea behind it, though, as driving cars from this classic era is a cool concept (and 'em youngins drivin' 'em Civics and Camrys could learn somin').  Hopefully, someone will do this idea right next time.", "date": "Jul 12, 2000"}
