Extraction Point Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/24/fear-extraction-point-review", "text": "Since F.E.A.R. was one of the best shooters to come out in recent PC history, its expansion, Extraction Point, was an eagerly awaited release. From the bits we got to play for preview, the game offered up some new weaponry and snippets of storyline and seemed like it could make for a really good expansion. After shooting our way though, Extraction Point didn't manage to clamber up to the lofty status of the first F.E.A.R. While it's great to play some new levels in the F.E.A.R. universe, we couldn't help but feel some disappointment with Extraction Point's brevity.   Extraction Point offers six new stages (called intervals) to play through, the minigun, laser carbine, gun turret mine, breakable item crates, new story scenes, a few new replicant and robotic enemy types, a translucent ghost foe, and some new enemy A.I.. The game begins right after the first F.E.A.R. ends. Once you hit the ground, you find Fettel and Alma running amok across the ruined metropolitan landscape. The first four stages of Extraction Point are really fun. As you move through them F.E.A.R.'s entire arsenal and all the new weapons will be made available, and for good reason too. Extraction Point throws larger scale battles at you, with more enemies in bigger areas. You'll need all the firepower you can get.    While Extraction Point has entertaining fights, it has too few of them. The last two intervals of the game were particularly unsatisfying since they offered very little action. The fifth interval, for instance, is comprised almost entirely of shock-scare sequences. The sixth interval is only one firefight. Another issue with Extraction Point is the environments are nearly identical to F.E.A.R. In other words, more dark rooms, square brown corridors, stark shadowed walls, office cubicles, and parking garages. With an expansion, we expect new kinds of experiences. Though Extraction Point's environments and combat have been slightly altered, you may at times be fooled into thinking you're playing the first F.E.A.R.   Another disappointment is the storyline. Though F.E.A.R.'s mission objectives were never really that varied (find person A, eliminate B, rendezvous at point C), at least it had some cool storytelling through phone messages. This is nearly completely absent in Extraction Point. A few phone messages can be triggered, but they're painfully vague, to the effect of ~I heard what happened, are you OK?~ With no side stories going on, we were hopeful the main narrative would lead somewhere interesting. Alma and Fettel pop up frequently, but unfortunately nothing ever gets revealed. There are a few scenes that look and sound like they should provide some answers or revelations, but they don't.    Extraction Point's new weapons add some entertaining variety to the already crowded arsenal, but little depth. The minigun shreds anything at close range while the laser can slice up baddies at close or long. Any standard replicant foes go down in seconds against these armaments, making them fun to shoot but not really expanding Extraction Point's gameplay. The turret mines, on the other hand, are a welcome addition. These things can be planted on the ground to function as automatic guns. In some of Extraction Point's fight sequences, these come in extremely handy. If they don't kill an opponent with their bullets, they'll at least distract them so you can unload your own deadly projectiles.   The expansion's new enemies, outside of the translucent ghosts, don't really give you any kind of new experience either. A minigun and shield wielding heavy armor soldier shows up at a few points, but fighting him is nearly the same as engaging the penetrator-toting variety. They're slow moving, easily out maneuvered, and take about the same amount of damage from what we could tell. You'll also square off against a larger powered armor unit, a bigger version of the bipedal enemy from the first game. He shoots more rockets, looks more imposing, but taking him down feels nearly identical to blowing apart a smaller powered armor. The big one just takes more hits and moves more slowly.   Fighting the translucent ghosts was more fun. They're difficult to see in the dark and very quick. They act a little like the cloaked enemies but seemed to attack in larger groups making the fights more frantic. Other than the new guys, every other kind of opponent you fought in F.E.A.R. makes an appearance in Extraction Point except for those annoying triangular flying robots. We don't miss those things at all. As with F.E.A.R., the A.I. in Extraction Point is extremely good. Enemies put up a hell of a fight, and now tip over boxes to create new cover positions. Still, they're practically the same fights we've seen before.     The graphics are, as they were before, technically gorgeous. Slick slow motion effects, excellent light sourcing, and disturbingly realistic enemy animations are all part of the package. Extraction Point's sound really reinforces the visuals too, especially the power down and up effects when popping in an out of slow motion. The minigun looks great when fired, emitting blue-white fireworks from its many barrels and sending enemies flipping around like they'd touched an electric fence. Really the only thing we wanted to see improved visually was the environmental variety. It's amazing how often you find yourself in construction yards and warehouses. Even the newer environments like the hospital and church ooze familiarity. Some of the larger battles may also cause some framerate hiccups on your rig.    Many of the sounds and sights that were so effective at inducing fright in F.E.A.R. return for Extraction Point as well. While characters appearing out of nowhere or flaking away into nothingness aren't as disturbing since we've seen it before, there are a few sequences bound to give you goosebumps. Since we've encountered and know about Alma and Fettel already, the frightening air of being hopelessly embroiled with the unknown is whisked away. Instead of walking down flickering corridors and being confronted by some freakish child shrouded in furtive evil, you'll just say to yourself ~hey there's Alma.~ If some new character or alien evil were introduced, it would have been more interesting.Even on the highest difficulty setting, Extraction Point is going to take around five hours to beat. Considering only four of the six intervals turn out to be full-featured stages, that's pretty bare bones in terms of price versus gameplay time. The expansion also adds nothing to the multiplayer. It still offers more excellent first-person shooting gameplay, but feels like something that could have been tacked on the end of the original product. While Extraction Point's extra features may look great on paper, playing the game all the way through reveals this expansion is too thin.", "date": "Oct 24, 2006"}
