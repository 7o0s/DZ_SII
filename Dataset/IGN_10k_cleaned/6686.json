The Latino toys are the theme for Starwave Mobile's Dominoes 'n Dice, a solid collection of games that certainly do nothing to betray the game's title. There are indeed dominoes and dice.   Your surrogate Homie is Chameleon, an original Homie designed exclusively for the game. He's a strapping young man decked out in some khaki pants and a white tank top. Of course, his spartan appearance offers you plenty of opportunities to dress him up with gear bought with your winnings. Sunglasses, facial hair, hats -- all can be bought at Home Lee's store.   You can either play through the game's story mode, which introduces an entire crew of Homies or just play the individual mini-games on your own. The story mode is strecthed across an entire city, with you visiting locations like El Chilote, Homierollerz, and the Junkyard to engage other Homies in contests. As you win games, the story (and it's pretty minor) is pushed along in slight cutscenes that make a grave mistake of printing yellow text on a white background. Ugh -- that was a poor design choice.   Let it be said, Homies offers a lot of variations on dominoes and dice. You can play Cuban, twenty-One, Muggins, General, Cross, poker Dice, Block, and Crag -- but not all right away. Some events need to be opened up before they are available from the quick game menu. In these games, you'll play against other Homies with names like Chango and Bouncy -- and none of them play foolishly. It took me a few games of Muggins to score a win. However, it is kinda frustrating that you have to sit there while a bunch of AI-controlled players make their moves and leave you looking at a ~Thinking~ screen. I played the game on my couch. If I was trying to get a quick game in between classes, the pacing might be more frustrating. Still, the level of content is admirable and I think a lot of mobile gamers will get their money's worth out of this one -- you know, provided they are into dominoes and dice.   Homies includes online multiplayer, where you can log on and challenge other Homies playas around the country. If you'd rather not eat up airtime, you can simply pass the phone back and forth.  Homies is a well-produced game (save for the irritating story scene text) full of character and personality, as well as a lot of games. I admire that Starwave and Humagade didn't skimp on content here -- it makes the game a tremendous value. While I may not exactly be that into playing dominoes and dice games myself, I do know people that love to play dominoes, and can imagine them being entertained by this title. Nice work.", "date": "Mar 4, 2006"}
