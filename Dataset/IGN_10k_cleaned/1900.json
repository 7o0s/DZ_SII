That's part of the reason that I liked Majesty so much. It was a new look on an old and sure idea that was also pretty addicting and had plenty of replay value. It wasn't without its share of problems, but with the announcement of the expansion pack labeled Majesty: The Northern Expansion, I had great hopes that some of the problems would be fixed along with some great new additions. Well, they did have some great new additions, but as for solving all of the problems? Well, I'll have to gather a few more friends around to slow down to about 10 frames per second so I can really get my point across.  For those that are a little slow and haven't read about every game that has come out in the past few years (losers... I hate people with lives), Majesty is an RTS designed to take the direct control of units out of your hand and into the hands of the loving computer AI. It's your job in the game to build your kingdom up and set it in the right direction so that you can complete a mission. In order to do this, you can build different types of buildings such as a Warriors guild and then recruit warriors for a cost. You make money from collecting taxes from buildings such as marketplaces, blacksmiths, and inns so you can upgrade buildings etc... But like I said before, the main difference from a normal RTS is your lack of direct control over your units. Instead, you must play the role of a sovereign by attaching a monetary value to a job to persuade units to do what you want. Otherwise they all have minds of their own with their own desires and goals and will attack things and explore whether you give them incentive or not. The Northern Expansion is virtually the same game, with a few add-ons that should please everyone including a new tileset, monsters, buildings and spells.   Veteran Majesty players definitely won't be overwhelmed by the list of new things in the expansion, but they won't be totally disappointed either. First, let's talk a bit about the buildings. All of them were helpful to the cause and worth the design. The new Sorcerer's Abode is a magic building that allows you to cast some nifty new spells all over the map. These include some direct damage spells such as chain lightning for units and earthquake for buildings, as well as a useful spell that will teleport whatever units are near the Abode to a specified location on the map. That particular ability can be very useful if you can catch your enemies off guard. Change of Heart is another extremely useful spell that will cause your units to run away if you don't want them fighting, or stay and fight if they are trying to run away.  The other buildings include the Magic Bazaar where units can buy new potions to make them faster, stronger, invisible... whatever they buy, it means more money for you cause they use them a lot. The Embassy allows you to ~import~ veteran heroes from other kingdoms to fill open spots in your guilds. I thought that was a great idea until I saw the price was nearly double for units that more often than not turned out to be a burly veteran of level 2, which means virtually nothing by the time you actually need to start importing heroes. The Mausoleum however, is extremely useful. This building allows for storage of a number of heroes that have gone the way of the dodo. When you select the building you'll get a list of the dearly departed and for a pretty hefty price, they can be brought back. But this is really useful later in the game when you want to bring your high level heroes back if you weren't able to hit them with reanimate or reincarnate in time. The last new building, the Hall of Champions, is really just an easy way to assign bounties on creature types. If a creature type has been killed at least once during the game by a hero, it will appear on a list in the Hall. From there you can assign a bounty to all of the creatures of that type. It's a timesaver if you're trying to get rid of a certain pest quickly.   Unfortunately, I was really looking for new hero types to be added with the expansion. But there are none to be found. At least not on your side. There were a few new monsters added as well as some special monster heroes, but nothing new for you to use. That seemed to be the thing most lacking in the original due to the lack of more than one playable faction.  The other thing that I was hoping would be addressed was the incredible slowdown when there are a lot of creatures on the map. Playing on a PIII 600 with 256MB RAM should be enough to run a 2D isometric game with very average graphics. But when lots of units appeared on a screen, the game slowed so badly that it probably took 2 to 3 times longer to complete a mission than it should have. And there are a bunch of missions in this one that require a lot of units. One of them in particular challenges you to clean up a city that has sunk into thievery and debauchery. Unfortunately, the map is already populated with tons of units and is slow from the getgo. It makes for a frustrating experience.  But to the credit of the expansion, it did add some new features that will increase the life of the game. The biggest of these is the ability to modify the build tree for multiplayer games. This means that you can limit how many of a certain building type can be built in a game, or what types of buildings can be built in a game. It allows for some interesting scenarios. They have also implemented special scripts that will continue to unload monsters onto a scenario that you have completed and decided to continue playing in as well as a feature that will allow players to type in commands that will spawn monsters. Add that with downloadable quests from Cyberlore and you've got yourself plenty more game time.  Now as to whether the game is worth its weight in gold is another question. If you're a fan of the original, then you'll definitely enjoy the extra bit of gaming you'll get for twenty bucks. However, if you were a marginal fan and were just thinking of trying it again, I'm not sure you're going to find too much to keep your interest for very long. It's still a very solid game with a great premise and interesting style of play that you just gotta love, but the lack of new friendly units and the slowdown that puts you in slow motion at times is a bit annoying.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
