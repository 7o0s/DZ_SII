We must say introducing a new ship from the upcoming movie into the oh so familiar Star Wars Starfighter Special Edition universe is a mild stroke of genius. But Xbox owners looking for something entirely new in Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter, really ought to know better than to expect such things.   In Jedi Starfighter we're sent on yet another series of side adventures that run parallel to the events of Episode II. With parallel adventures come parallel characters. You're playing as accomplished Jedi Master Adi Gallia and you get to take control of the slick prototype Jedi Starfighter that comes complete with force-enabled powers. It's times like this they made me realize how far the Jedi have fallen on the cool-o-meter since The Empire Strikes Back debuted over 20 years ago. This side story to Episode II teams Adi Gallia with good old Nym from the original Starfighter: SE game on the 'box as they get to the bottom of the Trade Federation's latest nefarious plot.  If you've played the previous Starfighter game, either the Special Edition or the PS2 original, then you're already familiar with the controls, gameplay, enemies and mission types of Jedi Starfighter. The biggest difference now is that your Jedi Starfighter comes with Jedi powers. Force powered force fields, lightning blasts, shockwave and time slowdown actually come from Adi but transmitted across great distances in space by the ship. I always thought the Sith's were the only ones who could shoot offensive lightning blasts like the Emperor in Return of the Jedi. Who knew?  There are plenty of unlockable goodies in this Xbox version including trailers for some unannounced, upcoming LucasArts games for the Microsoft console. The bonus ships you get include Boba Fett's love-it-or-hate-it Slave I, but earning them is quite a challenge as always. And that leads to the overall problem I had with Jedi Starfighter.  The Xbox version of Starfighter doesn't offer enough Xbox specific content or features when compared to either the PS2 Jedi Starfighter or the previous Starfighter games on either PS2 or Xbox. It's almost like a copy of a copy of a copy which leads to an inevitable breakdown in quality.  Until we become attached to the characters, ships and themes of this latest trilogy like we are the original three films, titles like Jedi Starfighter would do better to rely on innovative and engaging gameplay rather than the Star Wars license. The greatest benefit here is that Xbox owners only had to wait a few weeks behind their PS2 brothers with this Starfighter game, and not 10 months like the original games.", "date": "Jun 4, 2002"}
