The game was at its core an Out Run style racer brought into the world of 3D, and Nintendo pounced at the opportunity to secure the exclusive rights for its then-upcoming Ultra 64 game system -- no one really had the heart to tell them the original game was a bit lame, but hey, an exclusive is an exclusive. The series was popular enough to spawn two sequels -- Cruis'n World and Cruis'n Exotica, and now N64 owners aren't the only ones to get a home version of the series. Midway recruited Crawfish Interactive to build the portable version on the Game Boy Color -- technically, it's a marvel, but a great engine can't hide the fact that Cruis'n Exotica isn't that exciting of a design.  Features Twelve tracks Twelve vehicles Password save Only for Game Boy Color  Right off the bat, the game wows with a very slick behind-the-vehicle engine not quite what you're probably used to on the Game Boy Color. The road scrolls underneath the cars smoothly and with a 3D feel, more so that what's been done in games such as Top Gear Pocket and Wacky Racers on the system. The framerate doesn't flow as crisply as other games in this perspective -- a trade-off to give the game perspective a lot more freedom. And with this unique engine comes another ~innovation~ for the GBC -- camera positions. With a push of the select button you can raise and lower the camera in three specific positions, giving you a choice on how to view the action. What's more is the fact that the game is entirely playable in all these perspectives, no matter what you choose -- it wasn't necessary to offer this feature, but it really shows what can be done on the GBC hardware given a little programming trickery.  But as impressive as the game engine is, the game is just flat-out bland. The idea is to race through twelve circuits that cut across twelve different locations. To keep up with the traffic, you're offered three ~tricks~ to add seconds to the clock as well as bump up the top speed of your vehicle for a couple ticks of the clock -- double-tap the gas for an easy wheelie, or tap the D-pad left or right for a helicopter spin. There's also a Mondo Roll and a back-flip if you time the taps carefully -- these tricks are important to pull off since you'll never win any races against the computer opponents without capitalizing on them.  It's challenging to come in first place, sure...but the fun factor just isn't there. All you're really doing is constantly doing wheelies (for speed), all the while maneuvering back and forth to keep in the middle of the track to keep from slowing down. The computer AI isn't very aggressive, only offering a challenge in how fast they're moving in relation to you -- in other words, they don't cause problems in the form of swerving in your way. And due to the sprite limitations of the Game Boy hardware, you can't have a pile-up of cars on the track to cause problems -- the arcade game design needed to be rethought for the portable version.  What's more, the design itself doesn't limit itself smartly -- if the game stuck with the overall idea of earning each track as you complete them, like it does in the Cruis'n Exotica and Cruis'n Circuit modes, that would have kept people playing. But instead, they offer a Cruis'n Freestyle mode where all the tracks are opened...now where's the incentive to play the circuit mode if you can race all the tracks in a separate mode? That's not exactly smart planning. At least the team hid vehicles that unlock after a certain amount of miles have been accumulated, and you can pull them up after a power-off by entering a password. But the replay factor is destroyed simply by the inclusion of one single mode that really didn't need to be there.  I tip my hat to Crawfish for one of the coolest, pseudo-3D engines on the Game Boy Color, but I'm not going to look the other way when it comes to the gameplay -- Cruis'n Exotica is just a bit too boring to recommend as a portable racing game. The design needs a lot more ~oomph~, and the Freestyle mode shouldn't have been included in the first place -- hiding the tracks would have kept the kiddies playing just so they could see all the locations hidden in the cartridge.", "date": "Nov 16, 2000"}
