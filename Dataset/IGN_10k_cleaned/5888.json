{"name": "Bust A Groove", "name_review": "Bust-a-Groove", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/11/26/bust-a-groove", "text": "Originally created and published by Enix in Japan, Bust-A-Groove (formally Bust-A-Move in Japan) takes the simple tapping gameplay from Parappa-the-Rappa and created a bonanza dance-a-thon that lifts the dance-sim game to new levels of fun and dancing pleasure.  More than just a novelty item, Bust-A-Move features a plethora of dance styles and musical themes in its gameplay model that require a level of skill and sense of beat to play the game successfully.  Couched in modern MTV-style presentation with scratchin', sampled sounds, and a quick visual takes, Bust-A-Groove provides gamers with a gaggle of dancers, each with wonderfully outrageous costumes that best represent their style of dance and music, be it Vogue, break-dancing, disco, Capoeira, hip-hop, jazz, J-pop, or funk. The game is exceptionally well choreographed and skillfully motion-captured to bring a sense of realism and art to each dancer.  Bust-A-Groove features 10 initial dancers all from the Japanese version, including the gun-toting Striker, the stylish African American Pinky, trippy sex kitten Kitty-N, and the Fat Albert rappin' Hamm. The other characters available are Heat, Frida, Kelly, Shorty, Hiro, and Gas-O, as well as the gigantic final boss Robo-Z, plus as many as four unlockable bonus characters.  Players can challenge either the computer or vie against another human to determine who is the master-blasta dance king (or queen), and are rewarded in several ways. Against the computer you dance against each of the players and if you beat them all, you'll face Robo-Z in an unusual urban dance scene. Each time you beat the game with another character, you open up a ~dance view,~ which enables different viewing options of your character pulling off all of their favorite moves. Win with all the characters and you'll open up new dancers.   Other interesting features are the Dance Fever bonuses, awarded to dancers who perform exceptionally well in a particular dance, the linking combos, and the different choices or paths during each dance.   Bust-A-Groove features solid options, a Dance Edit mode (in which players pre-set dance moves in advance), and a great practice mode. Due to the game's simplistic command system, no analog or dual shock features are available or needed; this game work just dandy in digital.At first, I just thought this game was silly. (And it is!) But it required a long second look, and so I resisted my embarrassment, and sat down to play. As soon as I played through my first character, I was hooked solid. I've beaten the game with a few characters already and now I'm going to beat the game with every single dancer and master this bitch. While it may sound repetitive I'll simply get better with the four- and five-button moves than before, and try to get Dance Fever over and over again. At one point in the game I thought I really sucked hard, and instead of turning red, I felt white all over. Right around the fourth opponent, the learning curve turns up, making things difficult. But with a little practice I blew right past Pinky and from there on in I busted. To my surprise, the final boss  Robo-Z  wasn't much more difficult to beat than any of the last tier contestants. Stating the obvious, this game is terribly unique and there is nothing like this on Nintendo 64 or on the PC. I absolutely love the game's library of musical sensibilities, and all of the songs are truly danceable tunes that I can listen to over and over again. Bust-A-Groove is like Parappa in that it's a button-beat dance game, but it's a step up from the fun-loving 2D doggy life, so if you already own Parappa, you won't feel bad about buying this, it's that much different, and that much fun.", "date": "Nov 26, 1998"}
