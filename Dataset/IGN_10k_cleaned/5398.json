Quite popular across the Atlantic, HandyGames has decided to follow-up on its momentum with the inevitable sequel, Townsmen 2. We had some complaints about the original game, such as complex gameplay without adequate instructions to help the player reach their goal, but still found the overall experience to be quite entertaining.   Our great hope when starting up Townsmen 2 would be to see oodles and oodles of documentations and tutorials that would explain to the casual player just exactly how to maintain their village. After all, with nine different types of resources to manage, buildings to erect and maintain, and defensive forces to mount against possible encroachment, HandyGames would certainly see the need for a little edification. Unfortunately, while Townsmen 2 certainly offers more tutorial resources than the first game, there just isn't enough of a help guide to get a player up and going.   And you're going to need some help because Townsmen 2 really ratchets up the difficulty. Your new village is a breakaway from a corrupt kingdom, so while trying to build a new utopia in the woods, you must court and employ knights to defend your township. And defense is only a fraction of the equation, as each mission requires you build up specific parts of your village to HandyGames' spec.   Resource management is plentiful, because resources are plentiful. And just as Dustin Hoffman postulates in ~I Heart Huckabees,~ everything is connected. Take metal, for example. You need metal to create weapons to defend your town. That's fine, but there is a huge process to got through before you can start crafting weapons. First, you must dig iron ore out of the ground. Then, you must have a working smeltery to process the ore. Once you have processed the ore, you must have a blacksmith that can take the ore and refine it into the iron -- which is then sent to an armory. Whew! The system of converting trees to usable lumber is no less complicated, too.   Now, complex gameplay is usually a good thing. Nobody likes a total breeze. But this level of management actually becomes something of a chore from time to time, as you must create these resource systems repeatedly to satisfy mission goals. It would be slightly easier if you had sufficient money at the start of missions, but again, Townsmen 2 believes in no such thing as a free lunch. You start each mission with a small purse and are charged with trading goods, such as fish, to build up your piggybank. Naturally, there's more to fishing than just dropping a line in the water. You must build fisheries and keep them regularly employed to turn out a decent amount of fish for trade.   The original game sported a pleasant visage, but if there's one facet of Townsmen 2 that is truly improved, it's the graphics. The township is bright, colorful, and detailed. And bustling. There's something satisfying in watching the little people go about their business. The buildings they pass between, from the castles to the mills are nicely drawn -- Townsmen 2 has an excellent style. Townsmen 2 also has some very pleasing in-game sound effects played when you access the different buildings.  Townsmen 2 is hard. And hard work. For those that are really into resource management-style games and don't mind a steep learning curve, Townsmen 2 could be quite a rewarding experiences. The depth is amazing -- juggling all of the resource systems takes real talent as the game progresses.But not everybody has the time or inkling for this kind of work. (For example, maybe you have a term full of boring biology classes ahead of you.)It's too bad that Townsmen 2 doesn't offer better instructions, or a simpler mode for casual gamers.", "date": "Dec 14, 2004"}
