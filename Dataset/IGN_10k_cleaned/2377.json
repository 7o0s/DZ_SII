{"name": "Cyberia", "name_review": "Cyberia", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/22/cyberia", "text": "One of the first PC ports for the PlayStation, Cyberia has taken the idea of the slickly rendered graphic adventure and brought it to the console.  Where previously great graphics were the stuff of cut-scenes only, the programmers of Cyberia have taken it upon themselves to make it part of the entire game. Kudos to that! The whole use of multiple camera angles, eerie soundtrack, detailed light-sourcing, and short, effective cut-sequences realy pulls the player into the game. However, the game itself is of a linear nature, which is fine if track-based graphic adventures are your bag. If you're into exploration or wandering off on tangents, Cyberia may not have enough flexibility to hold your interest. Even the arcade-style sequences are mostly track based.  There's no denying the appeal of great, prerendered graphics, but gameplay does tend to suffer in graphic adventures, which usually consists of doing things over and over until you do it right. But as it stands, Cyberia is a very enjoyable game.", "date": "Nov 22, 1996"}
