It's usually the likes of Grand Theft Auto and gritty first person shooters upon which they set their sights, but if there's one genre that features more killing than just about any other (rated on the 'KPS scale' - or Kills Per Second), it's the 'epic battle action' genre, to use a term I just made up. Why aren't these games targeted? The Dynasty Warriors series, after all, see the player slaughtering thousands upon thousands of enemy soldiers, literally wading through them all on a brutal killing rampage. Is it simply the fact that these games are so over the top as to be ridiculous? Or do they just fly under more conservative radars?   Whatever the case may be, when viewed from a rather oblique angle, the Dynasty Warriors games really are gaming's finest mass murderer sims, and Gundam is no exception. In our first mission alone, we sent over 430 enemy soldiers home in body bags. Now that's a good day's slaying. They're also one of gaming's more mysterious genres - part mindless hack and slash, part strategy, all spectacle, with a rather cult-like appeal. It makes sense, then, to cross-pollinate Dynasty Warriors with Gundam - one of the most well-known and loved anime franchises. Adding giant robots to just about anything, after all, is a recipe for success, and doing it with characters and mobile suits from a huge range of Gundam series' is sure to get the fanboy Pavlovian drool response going. So how does this curious mash-up shape up?   Giant robots that look, erm, like not so giant robots, sadly.  Relatively well. Perhaps the best way to put it is that we enjoyed playing despite ourselves. On one level we were reeling at some of the more backward and amateurish elements to the game design, structure and presentation, but then, on another more base level, we were reveling in kicking ass and leveling up. Is Gundam a great game? Absolutely not, but it can be quite compelling and fun.   The two main modes in the game are Official and Original, both of which are distinct sets of missions, tied together with completely nonsensical and poorly communicated storylines (at least to a casual Gundam fan such as myself). Official, as the name suggests, follows official Gundam canon - the story from One Year War, Gryps Conflict and First Neon War, which originated in Gundam, Z Gundam and Gundam ZZ. Original is a true mash-up, bringing in heroes and villains from across a host of Gundam creations, meeting in situations that could never happen in the anime.   Regardless, it all boils down to gameplay that quite successfully balances mashtastic action and strategy. Each battlefield, you see, has a whole host of 'Fields' - areas that can be captured and held by one side or the other. Get inside a Field and kill enough enemies (and often several Guards) and you'll capture it, which means more troops will be dropped in, and you're in a better position to take on or hold the next area. The system gives battles a good ebb and flow - you'll often have to dash to a Field that's under threat to bolster your defences, and it also means that while the battlefield is quite epic in scale, it's divided into nice, bite-size chunks.   The means of capturing Fields, of course, is in slaying anything in your path, and while Gundam may have zillion mechs on screen at once, it really fails in terms of the spectacle. There's an awful lot of standing around doing nothing for most of the other fighters in this war, which - if you stop and look around for a moment - looks patently absurd. Thankfully you're usually too busy attacking to care too much. Enemy grunts, then, are nothing more than cannon fodder, but thankfully the game spices things up with higher ranked opponents that need to be defeated, who provide more of a challenge, and named opponents, who are much tougher, and often give as good as they get. The game will even cut to little scenes between two warriors as they come across one another on the battlefield or lock weapons, and... erm, these are far less exciting than they sound.   Kill the identikit army!  In fact, that's a pretty good way to describe the presentation as a whole. You'd assume that having hundreds of 18 metre tall mechs on screen all duking it out at once would be pretty impressive visually, but there is absolutely nothing 'next-gen' about this game's presentation. The mobile suits have zero sense of scale and no sense of weight, and it would be hard to dream up a set of environments with less personality than these. They really are exceptionally dull, with a murky quality to the visuals to boot.   Still, that doesn't stop the game being fun, and Gundam's brand of frenetic melee gameplay is certainly appealing, especially with the dash move which means you can close the gap on an enemy in an instant and launch straight into an attack (provided the camera is behaving, which it probably won't be - the system is awful). It also means that you can get around the battlefield a little quicker, which is valuable. One of the biggest appeals of the game, naturally, is in gaining experience and leveling up both your pilot and your mech. You can also earn new parts and abilities to equip, and it all adds up to steadily kicking more ass with each mission. We should also mention that each pilot has a different attacking style and quite different feel, so there's a bit of variety to be explored there.Gundam really is this strange hybrid of lazy game design and terrible visual design (aside from the iconic mobile suit designs), with pretty decent gameplay. More forgiving gamers may find this an acceptable trade-off, but for us it's basically inexcusable in this day and age. For instance, how can Omega Force possibly justify the utter absence of options in this game? When we first started playing we got into the game and found that the camera (on the right stick) moved in the opposite direction to the way we wanted it to move. 'No problems,' we thought, pausing the game. Oh. No options... guess they must be on the main menu. Oh. No way to quit out of the mission. Okaaay. Restart the game. Go to the options screen. No option for changing the camera. Sigh.Dynasty Warriors Gundam is far from a bad game, it's just unremarkable and backward in a number of areas, and completely fails to even attempt to introduce the Gundam universe to its audience. As such, this is a game that only hardcore Gundam fans would consider paying for. For everyone else, this is a rental at best.", "date": "Nov 16, 2007"}
