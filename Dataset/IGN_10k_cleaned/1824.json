And the company's dominance in this realm has never been more apparent than it is right now with PlayStation 2 where no competitor has even put out a title that is a close second to EA Sports' equivalent product. That is, until now.   With the release of ESPN NBA 2Night, Konami has given sports gamers a viable option to EA Sports' NBA Live 2001. It's not quite the Live killer, nor is it a better overall game, but ESPN NBA 2Night is definitely in the same league as Live 2001 and even does some things better than EA Sports' product.   For instance, the general level of presentation in NBA 2Night is exactly what you'd expect from a game with the heralded ESPN license, which means that it's pretty damn good. The are lot of niceties in the way of box score and stat updates that pop-up that help give the game the feel of being on TV and the available camera angles and the level that they can be customized is superior to that of its two PS2 counterparts, as most players will be able to set it up so that the camera is set to their exact desires.   The feature set isn't quite as robust as it could be, but does have all of the typical trimmings, including exhibition, season and playoff modes, plus all of your conventional roster management and create-a-player capabilities. The create-a-player is actually quite good and allows players to customize their players very precisely and can even pick things like wristbands and kneepads and there's even the option to change the stats of existing players, which can be cool if you think that some player has been rated incorrectly or you just want to make your favorite player better than he is.   The only major complaint to be made about the game's off court features is that it's lacking a career or dynasty mode, but none of NBA 2Night's competitors on PS2 have one either. And on a lesser extent, people that care a lot about their stats will be disappointed to find out that as soon as you go into the playoffs, you lose all of your team and player stats from the regular season. It's something that people probably don't care about but is still inexcusable given the size of the PS2's memory card.  Gameplay While all is good so far, things get a little messy once you step onto the court and begin playing the game. People that have played a lot of hoops videogames will quickly notice that there isn't a turbo button, as Konami has opted to go with complete analog control, meaning that when you have the controller pressed all the way to max, you're essentially using the turbo button. This is actually a bit more realistic and requires that the player learn to vary his speed of movement by just using the analog stick efficiently, but some people might be turned off by this whole idea.   Another problem with the game is that shooting percentages are a bit screwed up. On the game's default setting, which is an unrealistic arcade mode, players will drain all sorts of shots at will regardless of their abilities. When you change it to simulation mode, it becomes more realistic on the player's side of things, but the computer will still hit just about everything that isn't blocked and it's common to see the CPU have a shooting percentage of between 75% and 80%, which just doesn't happen much in real life.   If you decide to forgo the jump shot in simulation mode, it's still possible to get similar shooting percentages as the computer if you decide to rely primarily on the good ole slam-dunk. Dunks are a bit too easy to pull off and the only real defense to them that the computer has is the offensive charge penalty, which will often get called when the computer runs under a dunking player.   Passing is also a bit bizarre in that passes are much too slow and players will often lob a pass to a player that's right next to him. The unresponsive passing makes is almost impossible to run any sort of a half-court or fast break offense and is probably the game's biggest flaw. The only reason that I say probably is that some could argue that the game's steal flaw is even worse. When pressing the steal button, instead of just poking his arm out at the ball, the player will lunge forward and often tackle the person dribbling the basketball. This results in an overabundance of fouls and plenty of instances where you think you're playing football rather than basketball. At least we know that Konami has tackle animation ready for its football game coming this fall.   Other problems with the game include an overabundance of blocked shots by the CPU and poorly executed rebounding. While players do a good job of boxing out, they generally just stand there as the ball is bouncing around the rim and wait until the ball hits the ground before going for it. There are very few rebounds where the player will jump for the ball and it's actually a better strategy to try and get the ball after it hits the court than to jump up after it.  Graphics  Even with the game's flaws, NBA 2Night is still an enjoyable game of hoops and shows a lot of promise for the series. The graphics engine is already solid, and in many ways is superior to competing products on the system. The player animation, especially on dunks, is some of the best you'll see in any basketball game and the game really gets high points for all of the atypical character animation that'll be seen throughout the course of a game.   When players aren't doing the evil floating chest pass from hell, they'll sometimes do these cool one handed pass where they'll actually reach to the side and pass around the covering defender. And when a player is dunking over them, they'll actually duck and move out of the way in a very realistic fashion and you'll also notice players stumbling after big dunks or block attempts. There are just a ton of little animations that help make the game look like the real thing, and unlike Live, there's not a huge problem with missing transitional animation.  Sound As with most sports titles, the commentary can be annoying at times, but is generally in tune with what's going on with the game. Things get repetitive at times, but you'll often hear something completely new that makes things much less annoying. The sound effects and crowd noise is typically good, with nothing really to complain about.  In terms of presentation and visuals, Konami has managed to put out a product that is at worst an equal to the product put out by EA Sports, the current king of console sports game. If not for the problems with the passing, steals, shooting and rebounding (sounds like all the key parts of basketball), this could've been a really good game. Given that the problems that the game does have are things that could be easily fixed, Konami might have a big winner on its hands when it comes time to release next year's NBA 2Night.", "date": "Mar 7, 2001"}
