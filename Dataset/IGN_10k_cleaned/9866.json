They make overpriced dolls with overpriced accessories, then print books and make films about the characters. Kids read the books, fall in love, then demand a doll that looks like any other, but costs three times as much. The brand has expanded in recent years, so it's no wonder that the video game market has been breached. American Girl: Julie Finds a Way is a Webfoot developed horror that I only pray does not find its way into anyone else's Nintendo DS.   The game opens up by introducing Julie Albright, and talking about ~changes~ going on in the young girl's life. Immediately I knew I was not only not the target demographic, but hopelessly clueless about the metaphorical blossoming of a tween girl. Plus, my mom would never buy me the American Girl dolls because they were ~too expensive~ or because I'm ~not a girl, jeez what's wrong with you?~   Julie Finds a Way incorporates the stories of four of the character's corresponding American Girl books chronicling the life of the young girl in 1970s San Francisco. Through the game Julie moves away after her parents divorce; fights corrupt school officials to get equal treatment; saves endangered eagles, and travels across the country in a covered wagon to honor the Bicentennial. It all sounds very exciting, but Webfoot managed to make the experience as dull as possible.   It might be a little unfair to criticize the story and dialogue since it was based on a book series. So maybe it's not the developer's fault, but this stuff is ridiculous. For instance, when Julie wants to join the boy's basketball team, the coach shoos her away. It's the '70s, girls can't play basketball! I have to go find ways to convince the school to let me (I mean her) play basketball. My first piece of evidence: Title Nine, a groovy new law that states explicitly that the school has to let girls play. Bam. Game over. I win. Oh wait, the game is still going to make me ask people to sign a petition, and try to convince the school of my basketball prowess. Didn't that whole law thing negate the need for that?    Why is there a beige ghost in this bedroom? There are other things, too, like the constant lamenting about Julie's rabbit, Nutmeg. Apparently Dad got custody of the pet rabbit in the divorce, so Julie has to go across town just to play with it. The logistics of that are completely ludicrous.   Playing one chapter of the game takes longer than reading the corresponding book, thanks to the frustratingly slow framerate and clunky controls. Julie waddles like a penguin at a sleep-inducing pace. Pressing X can make her run, but that's useless since the controls are too poor to maneuver her properly. Julie bangs into doors, counters, walls, and sometimes nothing at all. She would have so many bruises, her parents would have been arrested under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (yet another important law passed in the groovy 1970s!)   When I wasn't bumbling around restrictively small levels on inane fetch quests, I was usually playing a minigame. I use the term ~minigame~ only in the most basic sense of the term. Very little about these things feel like games at all. My biggest issue with them is that the instructions aren't given before the game, but rather are displayed on the top screen as the minigame starts. Since a few of them are timed events, precious seconds are lost reading what I'm even supposed to do. It's a game aimed at young girls, yet doesn't make any effort to help them play.    This is a problem with Julie Finds a Way in general. Even the adventure mode is filled with vague goals that don't tell how to do something. I'm not asking for the game to hold my hand, but if an adult is frustrated by the poor communication and instruction, then the 10-year-old that buys it will be, too.American Girl: Julie Finds a Way reeks of a cash in. There's a distinct lack of quality or care put into this title that pretends to ~get~ the target demographic. The very epitome of this money driven apathy towards the customer is best summed up by the fact that the American Girl mission statement printed on the back of the case is sprinkled with multiple, very noticeable typos. Julie Finds a Way is boring, clunky, and manages to make these ~inspiring~ characters come off dumb. The American Girl company gets a lot of flack for misrepresenting females, offering low quality and overpriced goods, and caring more about money than the education it pretends to promote. This game is par for the course, then.", "date": "Jan 17, 2008"}
