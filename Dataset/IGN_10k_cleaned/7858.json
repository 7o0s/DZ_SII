Capybara updates the setting to a mine and vastly improves the graphics and play experience.   There actually is a plot to Super Shove It!, though it's not essential to enjoy the game. In the future, people have become reduced to watching miners explore underground caves in search of bling.  (Evidently, Lost has been cancelled - though perhaps Two and a Half Men continues its interminable run, which accounts for the popularity of Extreme Mining.)  You control Joe, a superstar among Extreme Miners, who is trapped by an earthquake in the ruins of a place called Luxicore and must fight his way to the surface, all the while collecting bling and rescuing trapped miners.  Of course, it won't be as easy as running from one end of a cavern to another.  Your path is blocked by rocks, fallen steel girders, and more.  Fortunately, you'll get some advice between levels from your surface contact, Hank, who offers information about ~stratigraphical fluctuations in submetric density~ and wonders if you've also fantasized about killing someone.   But nothing is more useful than your miner's gloves: an ice glove that can freeze a solid object, and a fire glove that ignites a small flame.  Use the fire glove to expand the steel girders or freeze them with the ice glove so they can be pushed or rotated.  As you advance, there will be other obstacles in your way, notably gas fires, water leaks that have formed insurmountable puddles, and yawning chasms (hey, maybe you can use those girders to bridge the gaps).   The controls are simple and intuitive.  Use the directional pad on your phone (or the 2, 4, 6, and 8 keys, if you prefer) to move Joe.  The 1 key activates your ice glove, 3 sets the fire glove aflame, 5 rotates a frozen object, and 0 opens the map that allows you to glimpse what lies ahead.  The ease of game play is determined largely by the dimensions of the buttons on your phone.  I played SSI on a sample Nokia handset whose directional pad was a mite small, causing some minor thumb discomfort and one or two wrong turns.  Had I played it on my own Samsung phone, with its wider pad, I would have had no problems.   A game like SSI lives and dies on addictiveness.  If you're a fan of puzzler games, you know they're often either maddeningly repetitive, or pure handheld crack.  I get irritated easily with this genre, but God help me, I just couldn't stay mad at SSI.  The levels are cleverly designed with obstacle courses that become progressively more challenging - and more rewarding.  Yes, it's aggravating to get near the end of a level and discover that you really needed that block of ice you casually tossed into a chasm, but SSI has a handy automatic save feature that allows you to restart right where you left off, alleviating the need to replay endless levels to reach the one that finally smashed your patience.  In a game that boasts 50 unique levels, this is a not-insignificant design choice (if only they'd offered that luxury back in the days of Q*Bert and Dig Dug).   The fire and ice gloves help to distinguish Super Shove It! from other puzzlers.  This isn't merely a matter of moving blocks around, but of determining what method is needed, and when - and, sometimes, when you only have a given number of charges available per glove, what is truly essential.  While you may or may not have any interest in collecting ~bling~ (and, if you're like me, you might have preferred that the game's designers not latch onto a slang term that's already well on its way out the door of the pop-culture lexicon), I guarantee you'll feel an acute pang of regret each time you expand a girder in the wrong direction and watch 1,500 points go up in a puff of smoke.  I could have lived without the annoying soundtrack, too - and thanks to a menu option to turn off the sounds, I can.Super Shove It! won't blow your mind, but it will very likely burn off the tedium of a long bus ride or flight.  With its sharp graphics, appealing design, cheeky humor courtesy of Hank, and solid gameplay, this is a guaranteed good time for puzzle and bling enthusiasts alike.", "date": "Dec 20, 2006"}
