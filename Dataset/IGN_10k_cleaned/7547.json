Stranded is an adventure game set on a desert island, with a set-up that isn't entirely unlike the hit television show ~Lost.~ Your a survivor amongst a lucky few and you must somehow make due with your plight while hoping for a rescue.   The story stretches across six chapters -- each advances the story and introduces some new mechanics. At first, you'll just get the basic introduction to mission set-up and completion, foraging for food (hunting and fishing), and exploration. But soon, you learn farming and cooking, as these elements factor into the economics of the game. See, it turns out you're not alone on the island -- there are some original inhabitants that you must interact with throughout the game. Now, I'm not about to spoil any story here, but rest assured that its a great yarn with some good plot twists to keep you hooked. At least, I was.   There are two ways players can attack Stranded -- either barrel through the storyline or explore the island and all of its game play elements. For example, there is a nature guide of sorts that catalogs all of the animals you have encountered. Some animals are quite rare, some only appear at specific times of day (such as the Nocturnal Potbelly pig), and others are native to one specific area of the island. The game keeps track of the animals you have encountered, and I know it will bother some players to see empty entries in this diary. The farming elements will also keep you busy, as you grow specific plants that can be used in recipes. All food helps you recover health, but certain recipes really restore your character's stamina. The more complex recipes can also be sold to the island's natives for a lot of cash (shells, in this adventure).   As mentioned, a lot of this is optional -- but to not make at least a decent stab at these extra elements is to not get your full download's worth of money. But considering how mobile is indeed the kind of gaming you play in stolen moments (such as on the toilet, as I've come to discover at airports or in office complexes), I can appreciate why some players will just stick to the main missions that drive the storyline.   If I had one real complaint about Stranded is that it's not terribly difficult. This could very well be by design so it appeals to the casual crowd. But more serious gamers should be rewarded with some difficult missions, not the scavenger hunt elements.   I played Stranded on a Sony Ericsson Z525a handset -- it's a mid-range phone with a decent-sized screen. The game looks solid, with readable text, nicely detailed sprites, and some pretty good use of color.   Stranded is an excellent adventure game for mobile -- the main quest is both involving and engaging while offering plentiful extra activities to appeal to the completionist gamers. (You know, the kind that has to find every single heart container piece in a Zelda game.) The visuals are appealing, the controls are satisfactory, and the length is just about right for a mobile adventure. This isn't going to be every gamers' bag of chips, but for those seeking refuge from poker or puzzles, Stranded is a good game to get, uh, lost in.", "date": "Nov 9, 2006"}
