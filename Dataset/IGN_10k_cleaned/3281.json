Its goofy concept, maniacal challenges and hidden extras are just some of the reasons why this game has sold so well on the Nintendo console. THQ and Sega have branched out its success in a handheld rendition of the first game, Super Monkey Ball Jr.,  and it's pretty much as impressive (if not more so) in its Game Boy Advance form. Realism, a development studio formed from key members of Software Creations before its Acclaim absorption, has put together a stunning GBA production that mirrors nearly everything that made the GameCube title such a charmingly fun console game. Don't miss this one, folks. Features More than 60 challenges in Normal Mode Unlockable mini-games: Monkey Fight, Monkey Bowling, Monkey Golf Four playable characters Cartridge save (one slot) Link cable support for four players (multiple cartridge) Only for Game Boy Advance Super Monkey Ball isn't exactly a new concept, as its main game is honestly just a 3D version of Marble Madness; players control one of four different monkeys as they wander around inside a ball. The monkey inside the ball is honestly just the game's personality...he doesn't exactly do much during the action except walk, run, or rotate around inside the enclosed sphere. The game's main mode is a ~simple~ challenge of maneuvering the ball around mid-air suspended mazes of increasingly difficult construction in a set amount of time. Most of the game ~labyrinths~ have no barriers surrounding their edges, so one false move and your poor monkey falls off into the great beyond with an ear-piercing ~yahhhhhh!!!~ The challenges range from simple and flat mazes to complex structures that slope and wind around curves, holes, and pinball-style bumpers. There are platforms that slide on their own, rock up and down, or spin around to make maneuvering through the challenges that much more devious. Stack this on top of the fact that the clock is ticking away...and that bananas are tossed around the area for extra points. The challenges are downright nasty in the expert levels, and even more so if you manage to unlock the EX levels by completing one of the difficulty settings without continuing.  In Super Monkey Ball Jr., Players don't actually control the ball, they physically manipulate the entire level with the controller, tilting the entire area to cause the monkey ball to roll down the hill.  While the GameCube game had the luxury of analog movement through the use of the control stick, the GBA title has to make due with the not-so-versatile digital D-pad; the on-off controls aren't quite Super Monkey Ball friendly since there are many areas where you'll have to roll the ball slowly down a narrow platform or around a complex series of pitfalls, so the developer offered a little more control in the form of action buttons: the B button used with the D-pad will allow for more exaggerated ball movements, and the A button, of course, makes the inclines a bit more subtle. It works, it just requires a bit of practice.  Like the GameCube game, all of this takes place from a behind-the-ball perspective, and the terrain itself is actually manipulated through a very competent 3D engine. The GBA engine, in fact, is extremely impressive simply because the developers have produced graphics that the GBA was never really meant to pull off; the graphics are simple polygons, sure, and more complex levels feature a bit of draw-in off in the distance, but it's still great to see the ambition that went into this project. Most GBA developers would probably have gone the cheaper way out in 2D had they been given the Super Monkey Ball Jr. project from THQ and Sega, but Realism must be commended for keeping with the original title's style on the handheld. The team even went the extra yard to keep the console game's soundtrack intact on the GBA. Even the console's menu system has been recreated in Super Monkey Ball Jr. These guys really understood what made the original game so cool. Either that, or they worked extremely close to the original design team. Either or, the game benefits from the attention to detail, big time.  The main game in the GBA version does suffer some of the same ~camera~ issues of the GameCube version, which indicates that it's more intentional than accidental. See, the camera doesn't always stay behind the ball...if players roll the ball towards the camera, it won't immediately swing around so that players can see ahead in the opposite direction. This causes some serious problems when the player wants to roll the ball in a specific direction, but cannot see where he's going simply because the camera refuses to rotate around and settle behind the ball where it belongs. This could have definitely been remedied had the L or R buttons be utilized to manipulate the camera when these issues happen. It seems they're only in there to make the game more difficult than it should be. It's a minor problem in an otherwise excellent design.     The development team didn't just recreate the gameplay of the main challenges, heck no. Tucked away in the cartridge are three unlockable mini-games that are based upon the same ones that appear on the GameCube: Monkey Fight, Monkey Bowling, and Monkey Golf. On the console, these mini-games simply used the existing game engine for their unique challenges, but for the GBA renditions -- with the exception of Monkey Golf -- the team had to create a separate graphics engine for their more unique gameplay modes. And all three are excellent games that really add to the overall Super Monkey Ball experience. Monkey Fight is a fun diversion where the monkey balls are given large boxing gloves to ~punch~ each other off of a circular arena; the more knock-outs a player gets, the more points he earns. Monkey Bowling is a deceptively deep and challenging bowling challenge with decent pin physics...and for a ~mini-game,~ it's almost worth the price of the game just to access this mode. And Monkey Golf is a collection of 18 of the most deviously-designed miniature golf holes ever concieved. Easily frustrated folks need not apply...but then, they'd be missing out on another great mode. All three of these games are excellent in their own right, and they complement the main game so darn well. It is unfortunate that the original GameCube mini-game Monkey Target didn't make it into the package, especially considering that's the mode that's played in these offices the most. But considering how much the development team managed to get into the cartridge, the omission is certainly forgivable. Super Monkey Ball Jr. fully supports the Game Boy Advance's link cable so that as many as four players can get in on the action. And while it's unfortunate that the development team didn't manage to get a single-cartridge game mode into Super Monkey Ball Jr., because Realism did so well on this product there's a good chance that it'll be easy to find GBA gamers who own a copy of the game to play. Each of the mini-games in Super Monkey Ball utilizes the link, as well as one more mode that only opens up if a two-player network is activated: Monkey Duel This mode lets two players challenge each other on any one of the different levels in the game (except for the EX and bonus levels)...the faster time wins the match. Super Monkey Ball Jr. is definitely one of the finest Game Boy Advance games released during this year's holiday season. It not only offers a hell of a challenge in its main game, it also encourages replays by awarding points that will unlock well-produced mini-games. Monkey Bowling is a surprisingly excellent title by itself, with its super-smooth use of the GBA's sprite and background capabilities to recreate the same mode that appeared in the GameCube original. It's also a wonderful title to take advantage of the GBA's link capabilities. Super Monkey Ball Jr. just gets the whole presentation of Super Monkey Ball down pat; if you already own the GameCube game, you're not going to get anything new on the GBA...but it's still a great showpiece for your handheld system that offers nearly the exact same enjoyment.
