That's right, the onslaught of videogame renditions of the license that prints money. THQ is officially out of the gate with a game design that follows the plot of the fifth Star Wars flick from start to finish, so Game Boy Advance owners can wield their virtual lightsabers while waiting for the lights to dim in the theater. The game produced by  David A. Palmer Productions (previously responsible for Doom on the GBA) offers a solid take on the Star Wars gaming saga, but its awkward design structure is a little too much to ignore...even if you're a diehard fan of the series. Features Two modes of play: sidescrolling and 3D levels Password save Only for Game Boy Advance  Because the game linearly follows the plot of the film, and because we're writing this on the day the film debuts, we're not going to risk sprinkling spoilers throughout this review. So breathe a sigh, because we're not going to ruin the flick for you. You're welcome. Attack of the Clones for the Game Boy Advance is actually built upon two entirely different game engines. For about 80 percent of the time, you control either Anakin Skywalker (the guy that grows up to become Darth Vader...oh, yeah, no spoilers. Right...got it) or Obi-Wan Kenobi (the guy that grows up to be that bearded old fart in the original Star Wars) in a side-scrolling hack-and-slash. Players wander from left to right, waving their sabers at a seemingly endless wave of enemy characters, characters that vary depending on which level you're walking across...you may be slashing at droids early in the game, but later you'll defend yourself against banthas mounted on dewbacks. Though these enemies can certainly be taken out with a single or double brush of your weapon, you'll quickly realize that blocking their laserblasts is more effective since you can send their projectiles back at them much more rapidly and gracefully. As you wander the level, you can pick up icons that'll increase your force power. The first power is a simple super-jump that will gain you access to higher platforms. Build up your force power all the way and you can clear out a screen full of enemies with a simple wave of the hand.  These side-scrolling levels are very much like the old Genesis/Amiga game Sword of Sodan, since the lead character takes up an incredible amount of screen real estate, and remains the center focus during the screen scrolling. The animation here is definitely top notch, with the Anakin, Obi-Wan, and enemy sprites offered tons of frames for each of their movements. But the character interaction with the background isn't handled very well...the walk cycle is slower than the screen scrolling, and the developers don't give the objects shadows...so everything seems to have this ~pasted on~ look during these levels. And while the designers tried to implement platform hopping in the later levels, it's almost obvious that the game engine wasn't really made for it...so these challenges feel clumsily executed. The level designs also go on far too long in places, and the game becomes more a challenge of endurance than it is a challenge of skill. And in some of the more elaborate levels, the goal isn't made clear...just a helpful hint: search every large doorway you see in the first Obi-Wan level. These designers need to learn the art of explanation.  Peppered in between these sidescrollers are clumsy 3D vehicle challenges that seem entirely way out of place. These levels are obviously intended to make you guys go ~ooh, neat.~ But after that initial ~wow~ factor, you'll most likely go, ~What the heck just happened?~ These levels aren't entirely explanatory; in the speeder level, for example, you simply have to avoid traffic and other nondescript objects for 100 seconds...but it's never made clear what's an ~object~ and what's a ~power-up~ because the artwork in these rounds is just awful. The ~chase down Jango Fett~ level is even more cryptic, because you don't know if you're supposed to shoot him down or simply avoid the dozens of asteroids floating around in space. Answer: avoid the asteroids.  Definitely the  ~way cool~ factor goes to the inclusion of the actual, digitized orchestral score during the storyline scroll. This is the first cartridge-based Star Wars game to actually do this...and there's nothing worse than a MIDI rendition of the theme that everyone knows. The actual background music during the game is pretty impressive as well, as are the sampled sound effects of the lightsaber swish and enemy explosions. And the developers put the GBA's high color abilities to use with the still cutscenes lifted right out of the movie...these digitized photos are really pretty on the LCD screen, no question.   This Star Wars game isn't exactly the most polished of all the videogames that use the license, but it does have its moments...in brief shots. The side-scrolling levels could use a slight tweak or two to make them a bit more challenging and less redundant...they go on far too long with no ~checkpoints~ for when you bite it during the round. The 3D vehicle levels need serious work, not so much in the gameplay...but in explaining what needs to be accomplished. Not everyone's going to whip out their manuals to learn that ~weird, round yellow and red ball = bad...jellyfish circle = good.~ It's a somewhat enjoyable romp, though...it's just not a very ~clean~ Star Wars title.", "date": "May 15, 2002"}
