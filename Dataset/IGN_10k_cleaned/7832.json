For example, when a fielder goes after a fly ball, a giant spinning blue star follows along under his feet, and the icons marking the flight of the ball are likewise laughably gigantic. And when you knock one over the fences, there's all kinds of explosions and fireworks going on, as if every game were the World Series or something. Hooray for the juiced ball!  Another problem is matching up the buttons they're telling you to press on the screen with the actual buttons on your gamepad. The help tab will tell you to hit 'S' to substitute a player, though there is no 'S' on a SideWinder. Why not load the right names for the buttons into memory, depending on what controller the user is using?  The menus themselves are never very clear either and the manual is your typical sports game masterpiece of brevity: 36 pages of double-spaced one sentence explanations of each and every button in the game. Nor will the game save your memory settings between sessions, reminding you once again that consoles don't have hard drives.  Trying to navigate through the primitive menu system in order to execute a double switch can be a monumentally frustrating ordeal. The first time I tried it, after five minutes of moving back and forth through several screens, believing that I was canceling out of roster moves I didn't intend, I somehow--and I have no idea how--moved Barry Bonds out of the outfield and onto second base, the catcher onto first base, all without managing to get a pitcher up in the bullpen. First baseman J.T. Snow simply disappeared. Maybe he was as frustrated as I was and simply went home. Triple Play has by far the most unmanageable roster management interface in this year's crop.  And it goes on. Critical information is frequently ignored; where, for example is the wind meter or the pitcher's fatigue meter? Buried off the main display. There are management options, a season mode, even a fantasy draft--but there's nothing like the real kind of depth you're looking for in a baseball game. Prime example: you can set your batting order for a DH or non-DH league, but there's no separate batting orders for facing left handed as opposed to right handed pitchers. Weak.  But there are things Triple Play does do well. Control is never an issue, and there's even a new mouse mode for those of you who like to experiment with a different input device. The learning curve is really easy--except for the aforementioned substitution glitches. The game's graphics--apart from the glitzy eyesores that follow the players around--are solid most of the way through. There are plenty of options like render detail, filtering and shadows that you can turn on or off to help your system out.  And as an arcade game, it's not bad at all, though many of the series' earlier problems still recur: too many home runs and singles, not enough extra base hits. Hitting is pretty easy, with three styles--a normal swing, which includes a check swing to let you pull back off a bad pitch, and a committed power swing, with no option to bail out. There's also the usual bunt.  Pitching in Triple Play--which is the part of playing baseball games I actually prefer, in contrast to most gamers--is a thankless job. It can almost feel like you're just a batting practice pitcher up there feeding pitches to the hitters, the computer gets hits on you that easily. Pitch placement covers a good range, and you can get the ball high or low, inside or outside, and inside the strike zone or not, but trying to paint the corner and get the AI batters to go for a bad pitch--well forget it. Big innings for the computer AI when it's losing are par for the course, with hit after hit magically falling into place.  So basically, Triple Play 2000 is an average PC baseball game. It doesn't have a lot of depth, but if all you want is a good arcade game of baseball with a lot of hitting and home runs, it's not a bad option. If you're looking for anything more though, you'd be better off with High Heat, bugs and all--though there's still two or three more PC baseball games due out this year.  --Jason Bates", "date": "Apr 17, 1999"}
