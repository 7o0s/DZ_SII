{"name": "Triple Play 1999", "name_review": "Triple Play '99", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/08/14/triple-play-99", "text": "Maybe I'm nostalgic but it seems to me there was a time not too long ago when baseball games had all the features a baseball game should have. These features worked right out of the box, and as a result the games were fun to play. Although games like Tony La Russa Baseball didn't look or sound anything like today's high-priced, big league computer games, they've wasted almost as much of my time as Civilization, Doom, and some of those other games. Triple Play 99 won't.  Triple Play 99 adds 3D hardware support, a career mode, a manager mode and a league-wide draft to a series of games that sorely needed these latter features, as Triple Play in the past has often felt like a glorified version of a Home Run derby.  The game is, of course, still the best looking and sounding in the business. The player animations are top notch, the audio is stellar, the play-by-play announcers are entertaining, and the appearance of the game's menus is not only among the best in computer games but among the best in the software industry. EA Sports certainly understands that end of things. The stands empty as you lose the game and fans boo rather than cheer opponent home runs. These little touches are important ways of creating suspension of disbelief in the knowledgeable baseball fan.  Unfortunately, actually using these screens can be painful. Specifically, trying to access a player's statistics becomes a tedious exercise in scrolling, as too few columns are actually shown on the screen. How come simple games like Baseball Mogul can manage this, and EA Sports can't?  Then what about the game on the field? Something simply feels wrong about the statistical model, or at least the decisions the AI makes. The computer's starting pitchers rarely get yanked, and its batters rarely work out a walk. Baserunners make dreadful decisions, and I simply gave up trying to control my own infielders. Finally, information about opposing players or even your own team is buried during games. On the plus side, the game has a very slick interface in terms of hitting, pitching, and positioning your defense. The ease with which you can play the game, arcade-style, makes up for a lot of gaffes in other parts of the game.  Triple Play 99 is a vast improvement over the arcade-style, kids' games that have marked this series in the past. It has managed to add much-needed depth and complexity to the series without losing its great look and feel and sense of fun. But it's not enough depth and flexibility to please baseball fanatics. It will be interesting to see what happens with the series next year. -- Jason Bates", "date": "Aug 14, 1998"}
