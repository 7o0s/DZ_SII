Following in the footsteps of that kind of easy-breezy one-button game play that really is only possible (aad appropriate) on mobile, Korean game maker Com2Us has released Mini Game Pack. The casual title includes no fewer than seven mini-games, each playing like an extended WarioWare micro-game -- and that's a real compliment.   Here's a basic rundown on the seven events from my preview of the title with some additional extrapolation:   1. Trampoline: Time your jumps on a trampoline to fling yourself high into the air. The goal? Nothing short of going into low orbit. The more air you achieve, the greater your score.   2. Skippedy Mini: This is a good one -- jump rope. You may laugh at that, but anybody who played the first WarioWare on the GBA knows what a freakish addiction this can be. While jumping rope, try and catch a star that floats by for additional points.   3. Run!: Your little animal runs along, jumping over adorable friends that get in the way. You must dodge your furry buddies in order to earn a super-jump that makes this event a little easier.   4. Block Breaker: Basic Breakout-style action with your fuzzy form replacing the traditional paddle.   5. Krazy Road: You rush around a city track as fast as you can, trying not to go out-of-bounds as the course switches back and forth, essentially trying to ~shake~ you. You can use a wing power-up to fly over the track, but you need to be mindful of where you land. Go out-of-bounds and suffer a penalty.   6. Invasion: Your animal buddies are falling from the sky. Avoid them while scurrying around the ground.   7. Snake: Everybody knows Snake, but Com2Us dresses it up with their cute characters instead of a serpent.   Honestly, there isn't a stinker in the bunch. Admittedly, I enjoyed some more than others -- such as jumping rope and trampoline -- but none turned me off at all. But while the game play itself may have been enough to keep me glued, Mini Game Pack offers unlockable characters to keep other gamers dialed into the game. As you score points and meet goals, the cast expands up to nine different adorable creatures.   And that brings me to the overall look of the game. I love this kind of artwork. I think the minimalist approach to the backdrops is refreshing, and the character design is so sugary-cute it will make hardcore gamer snobs barf. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to find out that every toy store in the COEX mall in Seoul sells plush dolls of these little fellas.   Mini Game Pack offers two things that I am a major proponent of in mobile gaming: simple, one-button gameplay and original IP. Maybe Mini Game Pack would sell a little better if it was tied into some popular cartoon, but these are cute-poo characters that I hope to see more from in future Com2Us games. (They are already stars in Korean mobile gaming.) And the easy-going game play is perfect for a relaxing gaming session -- you know, the kind of zone out moments that we all need from time to time between classes or to take a break from a work project.   Lucky for me, playing Mini Game Pack is a work project.  Sometimes you only have a few stolen moments to get your game on. Sometimes you want something incredibly breezy to play. Sometimes you need to do something with your hands to keep yourself from eating the last slice of pizza. Mini Game Pack is a solution to a multitude of scenarios. I loved this collection of mini-games much in the same way I swooned for Skipping Stone. Cute kitties and penguins, addictive jump rope events, pleasing line art drawings -- there is nothing not to like here. Get with the downloading.", "date": "Apr 28, 2006"}
