The instant a really original design achieves critical and commercial success, a slew of imitators are sure to follow in its wake. For some strange reason, Irrational's fabulous four-color offering called Freedom Force seems to have been immunized against this, the sincerest form of flattery. Though it has much in common with squad-oriented, real time tactical games like Commandos, Freedom Force is undeniably one of a kind and has remained so ever since it was released nearly three years ago.  Seeing how no one else has yet picked up the ball and run with it, Irrational is graciously offering up a sequel, Freedom Force vs. The 3rd Reich. The game won't be out until next Tuesday but our good buddy TimeMaster brought us a final copy last week and asked us (with booming voice and shaking fist no less) to offer up an early review. For those of you who were fans of the first game, don't worry: the sequel is just as good. It's doesn't break any new ground for the franchise, but it offers up the same great action set in the same fantastic style.  If you're not familiar with the first game, Freedom Force and it's sequel are squad-based tactical games. You control a team of four, four-color heroes tasked with saving the world in a variety of missions. You'll battle massive monsters as they tear through crowded city streets, you'll fight your way deep into the underground labs to save your captured comrades, you'll assault a military base in a race to disable nuclear missiles before they can be launched at cities around the world. In short, all in a day's work for a hero. In between missions you'll have the chance to hire new heroes and improve the abilities of those already on your team.  The new game picks up a year after the first one ended. The world is safe but Alchemiss is plagued with bad dreams relating to the end of the first adventure. After saving the world very near the beginning of this game, the members of Freedom Force find themselves traveling back to 1942 to fight a new menace in World War 2. Unfortunately, I really can't talk much about the story without giving anything away. I'd love to share every little twist and turn in the plot but that would completely ruin the experience. Suffice to say that, what with all the time-traveling, dimension shifting action involved there are plenty of great surprises for fans of the first game. It's all handled really well too. The past eras, alternate dimensions and parallel continuums even start to make sense after a while -- at least, as much as they ever do in comics.   The tone is just right. The campy cliches of the comics from both the 60s and War eras are handled very well here and, if you've read comics from those eras, you'll be right at home with Freedom Force vs. The 3rd Reich. The kitschy conventions are very tough to get right. If you shift things too much on the side of satire, you alienate those very people who would appreciate the references in the first place. If you try to take things too seriously, you wind up looking slightly ridiculous. Irrational's managed to walk the line beautifully here with the tongue just far enough into the cheek that we're laughing with them, not at them.  Another great part of the presentation are the comic book origins of the characters. I don't recall the previous origins being quite so dark -- one character is wrongly sent to the electric chair, another kills an innocent government worker to keep a villain from reading the secrets in his mind -- but these are still perfectly in keeping with the comic book tone of the game. The Kirby-like illustrations are great but a multipanel presentation would have definitely helped reinforce the comic book angle. This time around, I'd also really like to have seen the origin stories of the enemies as well. These are minor complaints at best.  But as good as the hero origins are, Freedom Force vs. The 3rd Reich suffers from the same baffling character introductions that the previous game did. This isn't such a minor complaint. The origin stories are fine but there's absolutely no explanation as to why that particular hero hooks up with the Freedom Force. This is less of a problem for the World War 2 era heroes whose introductions to the team make sense within the context of the story. Since the comics that inspire Freedom Force tend to make a big deal out of how and why new characters join a team, the arbitrary appearances of people like Tombstone and Green Genie is just confusing. At least tell us how they were introduced to the team in their origin stories.      In addition to the great heroes, there's a whole slew of outrageous villains. Fortissimo is a fat opera singer who uses his voice as a sonic weapon. He also-a talks-a like these. Red Sun is an honorable but vicious Japanese warrior who can call forth fiery elementals to fight alongside him. Blitzkrieg is a goose-stepping, high-brow (literally) Nazi mentalist who can cause all sorts of trouble just by looking at you. A lot of the old villains return as well but not always in predictable ways. Their various schemes and machinations (sometimes deliciously directed at one another) are always just confusing enough to be credible. The minions are great too -- from the Nazi soldiers to the Roman legionnaires to the head stomping dinosaurs and everything in between.  The fantastic character creation tool from the first game hasn't changed a bit. You can still select from an impossibly large number of endlessly tweakable powers and choose from a wide range of visible effects for each. It seems like it would be easy to allow gamers to tinker with the colors of those effects, but the number of effects you can choose from is still broad enough that you can find pretty much what you're looking for anyway. Creating a new look for the heroes by making your own texture maps is as easy as it was the first time around but actually changing their geometry is an activity best left to the experts. On the subject of recruiting characters, it seems like the Prestige awards are much higher this time around, meaning you can import more of your own heroes onto the team.  Not much has changed in terms of the interface. You can still select the default powers a hero will use in combat and the game still automatically pauses when you want to issue a specific order in a specific circumstance. Since the various powers of the heroes all compliment each other, you'll need to use smart strategies in combining powers. For instance, you might want to use a long-range stun power to knock an enemy flier out of the air and bring them in range of your melee fighters. Or if your characters are busy taking down a heavy enemy, one character can use knockback powers to keep other enemies from getting involved in the fray.   Making these decisions is the meat of the game. The AI will take matters into its own hands if there are nearby enemies but only if you don't have those particular heroes selected. Once you take control of a hero you'll have to give them direct orders to attack. There are a few pathfinding problems here and there as well so you may find some of your heroes getting stuck from time to time on their way to a far away objective.  The objectives for each mission are spelled out right at the beginning. They can change during the mission, of course, but you'll never not know what to do next. Unlike the original game, Freedom Force vs. The 3rd Reich lists all your optional, secondary objectives right at the start. Though this removes some of the mystery of the game, it helps you gain experience more quickly. Though I regret the lack of a minimap, the objective indicators on the edges of the screen will still point you in the directions you'll need to go. A minimap would still be useful in those moments when you've got team members spread all over the map or when you're trying to gauge the distance to your next objective.  As I said, the graphics are probably the most noticeable and welcome change to the original game. The basic designs are all still the same and I'm hard pressed to find many differences in terms of the character models. What you will notice is that the world around them looks a whole lot better. The cities in particular look much better. The textures on the streets and buildings have much more depth to them now which really helps the overall presentation. There seem to be many more objects around too. Better still, the extra cars on the road won't run you over this time. (Drivers in the previous game never yielded the right of way to fighting super heroes.)  The damage modeling in the levels is also great. A fight in a forest is likely to topple lots of trees. You'll see little stumps left behind as a reminder of the action. When characters are thrown to the ground you'll see little craters in the pavement when they get up. Buildings crumble much more realistically now with lots of bricks and beams lying around in the rubble.      The lighting and shadow effects have been improved as well. You get a real sense of atmosphere now, particularly when the brighter powers are being wildly flung around. The power effects are also a lot better. The difference between the flame effects on El Diablo to the ones on the El Diablo of the previous game is like night and day.  The camera controls aren't really changed all that much from the previous game. I'd still like a bit more zoom on the close ups. The character models, effects and animations are so good, I feel like we deserve a closer look at the action. In any case, the rotating and zooming options on the camera mean you can get a good angle on almost any event or object in the game.  And it just wouldn't be a Freedom Force game without the campy voices. I have to say, I still think the voices are dangerously close to crossing over into satire here but they really get the job done. They're full of character and attitude and really let you know what the hero is all about. The explosions and various biffs and bams of combat are stylized without being cartoony.  There's way more going on in terms of multiplayer this time around. You can check out all the modes and match-ups in yesterday's feature. In terms of evaluating how fun it all is, I think Irrational has definitely improved on the offerings from the first game. The quantity is certainly a hell of a lot better. Some of the game types (like Massacre) get a little too chaotic to qualify this as a ~strategy~ game but there are some conveniences that help you get through it. Enemy portraits at the bottom of the screen mean you won't have to click all over the map trying to attack a specific character. I'm interested to see what people start to do with the Story Mode. Though it lacks the scripting options that would make it a fully functional mission editor, you can still use it set up a variety of cool engagements.  Beyond the multiplayer and single player campaign there are also a few extra single player options. If you enter the Rumble Room, you can set up all kinds of battles against the AI. Though these one-offs feel kind of detached, they make a great place to test out new hero designs and tactics against specific enemies and there are more than enough varieties of game types to keep your interest high.   In the end, I can't really complain that the sequel is pretty much just like the original game. Though I'd love to have seen a few more gameplay innovations and some minor changes to the story, the fact that Freedom Force is still pretty much the only game of its type around encourages me to be a bit more forgiving. Though we complain a lot about copycat development, I'm honestly surprised more developers haven't tried to tackle this type of game. It's not like there aren't other comic eras that are crying out for this kind of treatment.Maybe it's because no one can do it as well as Irrational can. They broke the superhero curse with the first title and proven it wasn't a fluke by releasing a follow up that's every bit as good. The design here is just as amazing as it was in the original game and the presentation is as solid and slick as ever. The story's great and full of more comic book conventions than you can imagine.The only thing that could even possibly disappoint me here is that the game is almost a little too similar to the original. Given the three years since the first title, I expected that more than just the graphics would be improved. Sure, you get some new multiplayer modes but it's still hard to shake the feeling that this is just a prettier version of the original Freedom Force. That still makes it one of the best games around.", "date": "Mar 3, 2005"}
