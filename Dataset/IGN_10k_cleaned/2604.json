The question is, whether or not there are any games out there that even hope to challenge this dominance. Barking Dog, Crave, and Electronic Arts were hoping to grab a piece of the pie with their newest title called Global Operations. While I don't think that Gearbox really has to worry about being knocked from the throne by this newcomer, it couldn't hurt to share a little of the power. Global Ops certainly has its share of problems on the technical side, but if you can get past that, you'll be in for quite a treat of a game with plenty of skill, strategy and fun waiting inside.   The premise behind Global Ops is a pretty simple one. There's no story here but there doesn't need to be since it's primarily a multiplayer games without NPCs. In fact, the single player game is pretty much useless except to get to know the maps a little bit before you jump into the real games. As you all know, there are various terrorist and criminal organizations around the world. Most countries around the world also have elite armed forces and law enforcement squads to deal with these groups. Global Operations pits one side against the other in a no holds barred fight over various objectives in particular locations around the world.   In each of the locations, you'll find the appropriate groups facing off against each other. In Columbia U.S. Special Forces face off against the Corozones y Armas. So you won't be able to fight with these groups in Chechnya, where you'll instead take the Russian Army and Caspian Freedom Force for a spin.   Along with each of these maps comes the specific forces attached to them and a different mission. For example in Mexico, you might take control of the Mexican Army while you try to plant explosives and destroy a transport truck or drug shipment while the Gallardo Cartel tries to stop it from happening. But in the South China Sea, you'll either take the role of the Australian Special Operations Forces and try to take control of a frieghter that has been hijacked by pirates. To do this, you'll first have to turn the engines on and keep them on, and then take control of the bridge. Of course, as the pirates, you'll want to stop this from happening. There are also some missions that are particularly cool in making you feel like you're working forwards towards a goal. Sri Lanka is a good example. After the Sri Lanka Army (yeah, who knew?) takes control of a tower bunker, your drop-off helicopter will be able to drop you off farther up the map and closer to your final objective. This doesn't mean you have to complete this first objective to win, but it will make things easier in the end.    Each of the 13 maps that are included in the game at the moment have different objectives to complete in order to win. This is one of the strengths of the game and keeps things interesting. I haven't found any that I've considered boring at this point. I have, however, found some that are extremely difficult for one side or the other for various reasons. This is partly because this game is really designed for organized teams of players fighting against each other. As of right now, people are still learning the maps and aren't exactly organized. I still had a lot of fun, but I can imagine this game would truly shine in organized clan matches where teams took full advantage of all of the classes in the game.   The maps themselves can be a little daunting at the very first just like any other FPS might be. Learning the maps is definitely an integral part of getting better. Unfortunately, the manual only comes with brief descriptions of what you might be getting into and leaves the rest of the guess work up to you. This can be a little frustrating when you're also trying to learn the ins and outs of the combat system and weapons. After a little frustration and searching, I did find that you can find labeled maps on the Global Operations website, but it would have been nice to have little labeled maps in the manual to show basic locations of important stuff like extraction points and VIP starting positions.   As it is, the maps are put together fairly well. There're positions and points on the maps where all of the combat specialties in the groups are necessary whether that be sniper or heavy gunner. The most fun parts also tends to become one of the most potentially frustrating parts if the re-spawn rate is too low. There are some serious choke points in the game that are really tough to get past when forces collide. Especially when fallen comrades are constantly reinforcing them. I personally like respawning instead of waiting for the mission to be complete. And in the case of these missions and maps, it makes more sense, but sometimes its just impossible to complete a mission when the respawn is too close together. But I suppose that goes for any of these types of games.    Once you get over learning the maps, you'll find a well-balanced game that begs for league matches. Global Operations is a bit of a hybrid of the team-based shooter games on the market. It's got the class system like a Team Fortress (or a more complicated version of Wolfenstein for those that don't play TF) and the fast and furious action of a Counter-Strike but with timed respawns. It also has those interesting, and sometimes exceedingly difficult, objectives for both of the teams involved.    As I've mentioned, these objectives will require some slick organization and teamwork to be successful. Luckily, Global Ops comes with a nifty class system to facilitate teamwork in a deeper way. The class system is divided into 8 different groups (demolitions, heavy gunner, commando, recon, medic, sniper, and intelligence). Depending on your class, you'll be able to purchase different types of weapons. The demoman is the only one that can buy a grenade launcher, for instance.   Each of these classes has their own uses and advantages Take for instance, the heavy machine-gunner. This guy is the brunt of the coverfiring force. He's strong and can handle the heavy weapons with the most accuracy. But if you put a sniper rifle in his hands, he's crap. And he's also as slow as a turd. Then you've got the sniper, who's greatly accurate with a rifle, but weak and won't handle a heavy machine gun well if he picks one up. Perhaps one of the most interesting roles in the game is that of the recon specialist. He comes equipped with a sensor that will detect all enemies and friendlies in the vicinity through walls, below your feet, or above your head. It gives you the heads up on the enemy and is of huge importance. Of course, at the same time, he can't use a weapon while he's got the tracker up and running. Lucky for all of us, there are basic tutorials to fill you in on the basics of each of the classes and how to use them.   On top of all of the combat classes is the one class that remains outside the direct playing field, the intelligence officer. So far, I really haven't seen anyone take a liking to this position and the few times I gave it a whack, no one listened to me... go figure. But once again, for organized matches, it's fantastic. This guy stays on the map giving positions and directing troops for maximized efficiency. He'll also have access to all of the cameras as long as your team has captured them.    Of course, along with all of the good thoughts and premises comes the bad. Unfortunately, Global Operations is not a perfect game. One of the features that was supposed to make the game stand out is the superior ballistics model. While bullets going through certain types of material and all that seems to work most of the time, it must be a real system hog because the game really doesn't run all that smoothly. It ran pretty well for me for the most part on my nice fast computers, but even on my roommate's computer that is as fast as mine but with a GeForce2 instead of a GeForce3 suffers a little bit. Those with anything under the recommended requirements (not the minimum) are going to be at a disadvantage.   I'm pretty sure that the system drag isn't due to the looks of the game either. It's not the best looking game around. The levels may be well designed, but textures and character models themselves aren't exactly jaw dropping. Nothing is exceedingly ugly except for the model's faces however, which are pretty uninspiring. The game is also unfortunately messed up with graphical glitches as well. Pretty often, you'll see characters jump and never come down, floating across the floors like the Dalai Lama on acid. You'll also see some clipping problems and flashing models through walls when they're standing too close to a wall and you're a ways away.    What did you think of Global Operations? One of my other main problems that has a little to do with this was the difficulty in telling your team from the other team in some levels. Each of the squads uniforms are based off of the real uniforms from the real world. But some of these uniforms look a whole lot like one another. The only way of telling your team at a distance is the little name that shows at the bottom of the screen. If it's there and green, it's your team. Sadly, sometimes, trying not to shoot your teammates costs you your life. There should be a quicker recognition device of some sort like a change in the targeting reticule or something...   After playing this game for a while now and getting used to the levels, weapons, and classes, I have to say that I really enjoyed myself quite a bit. Every now and again, you'll get seriously frustrated at the laggy network code (how can I lag with a ping of 56?) and the frame rate might drop in a huge firefight, especially if you have a slower computer, but the rest of the time you'll be having a lot of fun with a pretty creative and balanced game that deserves at least part of the attention and time devoted to Counter-Strike.I had a lot of fun with this game and hope to continue having fun in my few spare moments. Getting the feel of each of the classes and knowing how to use them successfully is pretty fun and the various maps have not gotten boring yet. Players are already getting better and better in only a couple of weeks since the game has been out thinking up new strategies and using different weapons more efficiently all the time.The problem is, there really aren't a whole lot of players out there. Every time I log on, there's probably anywhere from 45 to 77 servers available to choose from. And many of these have pings that I won't even touch.Barking Dog has made a good product here that I want to recommend to everyone, but just can't because of the high specs and network problems. But it's a damn good game with a lot going for it if those with the machines to run it will give it a chance.", "date": "Apr 9, 2002"}
