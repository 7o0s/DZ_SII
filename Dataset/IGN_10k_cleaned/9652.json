The reason he's been diagnosed with schizophrenia is because, apparently, he has a split personality that guides him through the game. Needless to say, you know there's a problem when the back of the box is wrong. Schizophrenia, as some of you may know, is often confused with dissociative identity disorder, which is a far more accurate label for Captain Gray's ~condition~ which involves split personalities/multiple identities, etc. This sour piece of information really has nothing to do with the game itself -- it merely serves as a testament to the amount of quality material Swashbucklers contains. And unfortunately, it's not much.   An action adventure RPG of sorts, Swashbucklers: Blue vs. Grey gives you control of Captain Gray as he fights to earn a little coin and a better ship for his various plundering and swashbuckling activities. Although the backdrop of this title is supposedly the Civil War, the game definitely has some mixed stylistic elements that give it a unique (although not necessarily positive) feel. Gray is really more of a cowboy than a pirate, with a pack of cards strapped to his wide-brimmed hat, a tan and dusty cloak covering a red bandana, and a quick-draw revolver awaiting a twitchy trigger finger. This ~cowboy pirate~ could have been a fantastic character, but unfortunately the split personality dynamic feels awfully forced and there really isn't a strong story to support the gameplay.   Don't you love sailing? But before we dive into the problems that make this a pretty bad game, let's at least shed some light on what the game does right. Swashbucklers obviously pulls a lot of inspiration from other pirate games, and those various elements, when executed correctly, make for a very enjoyable experience. The issue is that Swashbucklers doesn't execute things properly. There are numerous modes of play to engage in, including a minor town-exploration system reminiscent of classic RPGs, a world map you can sail around on, naval battles that take advantage of your custom-made pirate ship, battles on foot that change depending on how you've leveled Gray up, and even a one-on-one dueling system that pits Gray against rival ship captains.   With all this stuff going on, Swashbucklers sounds like it has a lot to offer, but unfortunately the game just takes the same ten minute experience, repeats the cycle continuously, and doesn't even do so with elegance. Most of the initial missions you take in this non-linear title are fetch quests, naval battles generally play out the same way, and when you board an enemy craft, you almost always proceed through the same three environments before facing the ship Captain. It's boring.   So although there is potential in Swashbucklers, most of it struggles to reveal itself as it lies buried underneath lackluster and cumbersome mechanics. Surprisingly, the one aspect of the game we truly enjoyed is the music, which is genuinely good. Granted, the track list could be longer, but the tunes we heard were atmospheric, lively and honestly fun to listen to while playing. We must give special note to the Shipyard theme--a piece that should clearly inhabit a much better game.   So what's really wrong with Swashbucklers? Well first, it's extremely repetitive and certain sections are almost physically impossible to beat due to broken fighting mechanics. The title also attempts to copy such games as Okami that substitute full voiceovers for voice sound effects (mumbles and grunts), but Swashbucklers fails at this miserably, creating some of the funniest ~dialog~ scenes we've seen in a while. It doesn't help that the text displayed during cutscenes will often go by so fast that it can't be read.   Getting pwned. Sigh. The remainder of the game's problems can often be flat out funny because they seem so obvious when you play. In a beginning cutscene, a bandit drinks a bottle of booze through his full face mask, you can't invert your aim in naval battles, mashing a special attack button will subtract points from your energy (even when you only do the move once), and you don't start the very first battle with your gun equipped, even though the tutorial is trying to tell you how to use your gun. Issues like these pile on. We probably don't have to spell it out for you, but Swashbucklers is one poor game.  You should probably avoid Swashbucklers: Blue vs. Grey even if you're obsessed with pirates -- it's just not a well-made game. The soundtrack will often delight and the shadows of potential pulse faintly under layers of mud, but those statements clearly don't warrant a playthrough. This cowboy pirate should just hang up his revolver and call it a day.", "date": "Nov 29, 2007"}
