And usually, this trepidation is warranted because these games honestly tend to suck. Most of these games fail to milk the source material properly, opting instead to borrow a film's name and aesthetic. This would be fine if developers supported the visual and aural presentation with compelling gameplay. Unfortunately, that's usually not the case. In steps the latest movie-to-videogame adaptation, Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, developed by Frontier Developments.    Certain folk may remember that Frontier Developments made the last Wallace & Gromit game, Wallace & Gromit in Project Zoo. While nothing stellar, Project Zoo did a decent job of capturing the essence of the beloved Wallace & Gromit property and backed up the presentation with straightforward, respectable gameplay. Curse of the Were-Rabbit plays very much like its predecessor. It's still a reasonably straightforward action/adventure title. But it adds a little more to the formula than the average movie adaptation and more than your average kids game, too.    The plot follows the basic storyline of the movie, so there's a decent amount of rabbit hunting in the game. And for those who don't know, the movie sees the dopey inventor Wallace and his sidekick dog, Gromit, battle a mutated rabbit hell-bent on eating the vegetable gardens of innocent denizens. The story may sound hokey for those unfamiliar with the original series, but fans know this sort of thing is what makes the Wallace & Gromit so endearing. It's a good thing then, that Curse of the Were-Rabbit does an even better job of capturing the look and feel of the property than Project Zoo.     The game looks downright cute, to be honest. And the voice work and dialogue will conjure smiles in fans and (maybe) non-fans a like. The cutscenes look good for the most part, too, and also help to move the narrative forward. Not that's riveting, ultra-engaging stuff, but it's very fitting. It works, in other words, and never feels too hokey for its own good. The only negative in terms of the presentation is the fact we couldn't skip the cutscenes. And some of them can take awhile to finish. Not so hot when all one wants to do is jump in the game and start playing.    Curse of the Were-Rabbit doesn't offer anything new to the platform genre, but what it does offer is solid (albeit stale) gameplay. It offers three playable characters, including the titular duo and Hutch, Gromit's new rabbit friend. Each character boasts varying abilities, but they control exactly the same and therefore feel pretty similar in the end. Although, a bulk of the game requires the use of more than one character to achieve objectives, so we found ourselves swapping between characters constantly.     It's this very dynamic that helps elevate Curse of the Were-Rabbit above several movie-based, kiddie games. Each section of a particular stage (much of the game takes place in a quaint town) features a variety of multiplayer puzzles to solve. While many aren't that inspiring or inventive, they do help make the game a little more interesting. For example, many of the doors and traps in the game require one character to activate a switch while the other retrieves an item. Or there would be a ladder controlled by a crank and the only way to climb the ladder and reach an item was to have the secondary character control the crank.     In addition, Curse of the Were-Rabbit uses a day/night cycle. Again, this isn't anything particularly innovative, but it helps keep things fresh. We could switch between day and night whenever we wanted, with each time of day featuring different mission objectives. Swapping between day and night was a simple matter of locating special manholes scattered about the city, something made very simple using the game's in-game map. During the day, the game offers a series of different missions given by the myriad citizens walking about. We could tackle them whenever we wanted, so Curse of the Were-Rabbit benefits from a pinch of non-linear play.    Usually, these missions were simple and mildly entertaining. Most revolved around capturing a set number of rabbits by using a collection of inventions such as the Bungun, Screwdriver, Airblast, Pesto Pal, Bolt Cutters, Auto-Brolly, Bunny Hopper, and Lady Were-Rabbit Decoy. These inventions were actually pretty fun to use, especially the Bunny Hopper, which let us bounce around the environment to reach special items or simply to explore. We used the Bungun the most, since it's the game's primary device for sucking up bunnies for storage in a giant rabbit holding pen.     Curse of the Were-Rabbit has a bunch of hidden extras that fans of the show would like. And finding ways to acquire these extras is pretty fun as well. Unfortunately, the main chunk of the game wears thin quicker than it should. Using the inventions, capturing rabbits and helping local townsfolk is entertaining for awhile, but it's nothing that will excite older gamers. The obstacles and enemies simply won't provide much of a challenge. Plus, the jump mechanics can feel a little clunky at times, so there's plenty of opportunity for missed jumps, etc. Although manual control of the camera helps alleviate this somewhat, jumping between platforms still feels a little off.   Wallace & Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit does a good job of capturing the feel of the movie. What it doesn't do is provide engaging gameplay for older gamers. As a game for younger gamers it's actually pretty decent. It's rough around the edges, regardless of who's actually playing it, but kids are more likely to forgive the somewhat tired game mechanics and lack of difficulty. In short, though, it's a decent kid's game with a lot personality. Rent it if curious.", "date": "Sep 30, 2005"}
