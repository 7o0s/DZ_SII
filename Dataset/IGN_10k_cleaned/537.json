While games like NFL Blitz and NBA Jam throw reality out the window in order to create a fast-paced gameplay experience, we've got no beef with that, because they're fun. They provide a quick and dirty alternative to the strategic play of Visual Concepts or Electronic Arts' titles, and dang it, there isn't anything wrong with that.  While Blitz and Jam maintain their popularity in the States, Japanese gamers can't get enough of the Virtua Striker series. You'll rarely find a Japanese arcade that hasn't got a few VS2 machines linked up for competitive play, and there's always a group of businessmen squaring off in a footie match in my local game center. The game's pathological following was reason enough for Sega to port Virtua Striker 2 ver. 2000.1 from the NAOMI board to the Dreamcast.   Let's get one thing out of the way: Virtua Striker 2 is not FIFA. Though it's qualified as JFA Official Goods, the names on the jerseys have no relation to real-life players. Then again, the rosters do bear more than a passing resemblance to the real-life teams...  And as the game was born and raised in the arcades, it doesn't play anything like FIFA, either. While the game is rules-based (don't expect players to kick each other in the heads and leg-sweep the competition), it plays damn fast. Out-and-out offense is the only way to win, and cranking up the time limit for each match results in outrageously high-scoring games.  Virtua Striker 2 nicely breaks down the footie-playing action to four buttons. Hitting A lets you perform a short pass or a slide (in the case of defense),  X does a long pass, and B ~accumulates the power!~ to shoot for the goal. Finally, tapping Y lets you change your team's layout from a defensive 4-3-3 position to an offensive 3-4-3.   In any case, Virtua Striker 2 is easy to pick up and play. Unfortunately, dumbing down the art of soccer for the arcade market has made for some major gameplay confusion. While running about and making turns comes off easy via the digital pad (analog isn't supported, for some odd reason), the CPU automatically picks which character you're controlling. No, you can't switch 'em yourself, so don't bother trying. While the AI does an adequate job of grouping your mates across the field, there are times while playing defense when you'll keep swapping between two or three teammates without rhyme or reason. It gets incredibly annoying, and can hose even the best strategies. Also, I'd like to point something out to our friends at Sega: the Dreamcast has four controller ports. USE THEM! Virtua Striker 2 only supports two-player match-ups, which is an enormous cop-out. Shame on you guys.   While the random player-swapping is wretched, the graphics are divine. Virtua Striker 2 never drops below 60fps, even with a screen full of super-detailed players. The crowds bob up and down (actually, it kinda looks like they're doing ~the wave~), and the different stadiums are exceptionally detailed, with country flags waving from the sidelines. If Visual Concepts got a hold of this engine for a new soccer game, we'd be in heaven. Heck, you've even got tiny animations running in the VMS the whole time (if you ever get the chance to look down from the action).   There are a few new gameplay modes included, including International Cup, League and Tournament modes. In these, you're able to add a little extra depth to the gameplay by enabling off-sides, cards, and court changes at half-time, along with the ability to save your progress on the VMS. There's also a sweet little Replay Mode, where you can watch your best goals over and over until your eyes bleed.  Virtua Striker 2 is like a ditzy yet foxy prom-date  while it looks good and provides a few hours of fun, you'll find yourself searching for something with a little more depth after a few hours. Maybe it's time for Visual Concepts to get crackin' on a soccer game  if this is Sega of America's only entry into the footie market, a lot of footie fans are going to be extremely angry.   -- Colin ~Footsie~ Williamson, IGNDC", "date": "Dec 15, 1999"}
