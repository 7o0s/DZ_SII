The simple idea of creating games around the plastic toy soldiers that so many of us have played with as kids has milked in millions for the company, as several of its Army Men titles have gone on to become best-sellers. Unfortunately for gamers, though, the fact that 3DO's Army Men titles somehow manage to sell like crazy does not necessarily make them exceptional pieces of software. And in fact, as the publisher's Army Men: Sarge's Heroes 2 for N64 demonstrates, these 3D action offerings can -- clogged by clunky controls and poor graphics -- be quite the contrary.  The Facts   All new story line featuring the Brigitte Bleu and her forces. Levels include dining room, bedroom, graveyard and innards of a pinball machine Vikki will be a controllable character this time around. 18 missions include search and destroy, defend and rescue operations. New weapons include the powerful Air Strike. Four player split screen multiplayer game. New control mechanism allows for easier strafing. Eight multiplayer levels.   Gameplay For those of you who have never played the original Sarge's Heroes before, in the title you control a plastic soldier through a series of 3D environments, collect items and take out the bad guys with lots of different weapons -- from sniper rifles to bazookas and grenades. The idea itself sounded good on paper, but 3DO's execution of it all was decidedly sloppy and the end result was a third-person action-adventure Army Men game with sometimes frustrating, slow-moving, unintuitive controls and smeared visuals. The experience wasn't exactly poor, but there was definite room for improvement. To quote our own review:  This is a classic example of an ~it's ok~ game. You know, where your buddy asks ~how was the game?~ and you reply, ~well, it's ok.~  The levels are generally well thought out and the good Sniper mode is off-set by the frustrations with the poor camera implementation and a lack of save points.  There is however an interesting foundation in place and if it can be built upon well then game players will look forward to each new release. Give it a rent to see if you like it.  Sarge's Heroes 2 picks up where the first left off. The evil Plastro, the leader of the Tan army, has been reanimated and he, along with his beautiful new sidekick, seeks to rid himself of Sarge and crew once and for all. The story itself isn't much, but it sets up the action well enough. Gamers can take part in a quick Boot Camp course complete with various obstacles and targets to shoot at, which works to familiarize them with the control configuration (which, incidentally, definitely takes some getting used to). From there it's off to solve several missions that usually deal with protecting portals, blowing up helicopters and robots, taking out the enemy with a plethora of different weapons and finding hidden items. None of the levels are particularly innovative in design -- in fact some are downright simple. But it's clear from the start that Sarge's Heroes 2 is skewed toward a younger audience, and it's this demographic that's most likely to be satisfied with the level of difficulty presented.  Unfortunately for those of us with hands, the same problems drowning the original title are once again featured in Sarge's Heroes 2 -- mainly a somewhat puzzling control system, clunky movement, the inability to aim precisely even in first-person sniper mode, and an always sluggish framerate to bring everything together. It's as if 3DO took a good, hard look at the flaws of the original game and opted to ignore them, and instead offer quick fixes. Instead of speeding up the sensitivity in which Sarge turns around, for example -- a swampy affair in the original -- the developer has rather instituted the use of a 180-turn movement designated to C-Up. Using it, you can make Sarge flip a 180 so that he can quickly view what's going on behind-his back. The fact that there needs to be a button simply to turn around is a testament to how slowly Sarge himself moves -- and that's just one issue of many that should have been addressed.  Sarge's Heroes 2 features an expanded four-player mode this time around with several battle arenas that range from a computer desktop to a graveyard. The multiplayer showdowns feature all of the weapon goodness from the single-player modes, of course, including power-up items. Interestingly, when playing against two friends, the screen splits unfairly so that the first-player has the top half of the screen all to their self while the other two gamers have to settle for smaller corner boxes (a la a four-player mode) below. Not a major problem, but noteworthy all the same. What is more frustrating, however, is the sense of speed in the multiplayer mode and the sluggish framerate. Which leads us to the most disappointing aspect of this sequel...  Graphics Crisp, clear, high-resolution textures, unparalleled animation and a super-smooth framerate -- 3DO waved goodbye to these things when making Sarge's Heroes 2. Instead the company opted to fill the environments that Sarge seizures through with muddy, blurry textures that would make Carmageddon 64 proud. Then, to spice things up a bit, 3DO also included a poor framerate and an incredibly outdated, seemingly pre-first-generation engine. Don't turn too fast or you may leave the redraw behind, Sarge! Sadly, Sarge 2 suffers from exactly the same visual shortcomings that its predecessor did, a recurring theme of this game.   With that said, nothing is so hard on the eyes that it'll sour you on videogames for life. In fact, a few areas in particular, especially after the enemies are cleared out, run with a decent framerate. And there are lighting effects and reflections to be found too. But nothing is overwhelming, and most of these additions usually come at the price of fluidity.   Sound Yes. The minimum. Compressed music mixed with a standard selection of explosions and grunts -- and not much more to speak of. Last year's Army Men: Sarge's Heroes was an average third-person action-shooter with many, many flaws, but because of its license it sold through the roof. This year's Army Men: Sarge's Heroes 2 is exactly the same game with a few minor additions -- still flawed to the core and featuring outdated graphics that by today's standards are even more recognizable. If you were okay with the original, you'll probably enjoy the sequel as well, but for those of you expecting something new and exciting out of 3DO's Army Men franchise, this definitely isn't it. Rent before you buy. And don't spend your own money on the rental.", "date": "Sep 27, 2000"}
