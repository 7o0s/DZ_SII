{"name": "Sahara", "name_review": "Sahara", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/04/23/sahara", "text": "Fans of adventure yarns are no strangers to author Clive Cussler's hero Dirk Pitt, hero of a series of novels about NUMA (National Underwater marine Agency) and its around the world exploits. The plots usually involve a world threatening plot/villain, a few high-concept action pieces, the miraculous appearance of classic automobiles, and some deliciously stilted dialogue. Cussler's ~Sahara~ has recently been converted to celluloid, and as is the case with any big-budget flick, a cellphone game was quick to follow.   Gosub 60's Sahara is perhaps one of the most literal, and literate, film-to-cell games we've played in some time. It follows the action pieces of the movie beat for beat, culminating in a fantastic high desert fight involving toxic waste, a Civil War ironclad, an evil French businessman, and a wicked Mali despot. Fans of the book or movie (we understand that rarely do the two meet) will certainly appreciate how closely Gosub 60 sticks to the source material, filling the screen with plot points and dialogue that matches the tone of the series -- breezy and loose, with the occasional ham-fisted ~we must save the world~ exposition. All of this text is accompanied by portraits of the film's stars (Matthew McConaughey, Steve Zahn, Penelope Cruz, William H. Macy).   If you have played Gosub 60's previous hit, OP15, you will be comfortable with Sahara -- the two games share the same game engine, but Sahara does show some advancements. For example, Sahara features some stealth play -- move Pitt into the shadows to help him avoid enemy contact -- to add a layer of depth not found in the previous title.   Unfortunately, being based on an old engine keeps Sahara slightly mired in the past. For a game based on a movie that runs 80 miles-per-hour from opening credits to the final fade out, Sahara's physical pace is somewhat plodding. Pitt does not move fast, and neither do the trucks and boats he is able to commandeer. Your enemies don't move very fast either, which does keep the odds a little more even, but for a game that wants you to cover some real estate to find hidden objects and meet objectives, it needs to run a little faster. We tested Sahara on an LG VX8000, a speedy phone for sure.   The stealth element is also hit-and-miss. Sometimes you can use the shadow of a palm tree to sneak up on an enemy outpost, but it seems the moment you get close enough for a target cursor to appear on a foe, they notice you no matter if you are still firmly planted in the shadow. Thanks to the game's isometric view and small character sprites, it's hard to tell if you are maybe in eye-line, even if you are in the shadow of a tree or building.   Pitt has a nice maneuver called a ~Panama~ where he pilots a vehicle, brings it up to top speed, and then jumps out so the vehicle rams its target and explodes. The tactic would have much more impact if it was used sparingly, but several of the levels allow you to use it to great effect. For example, in a mission where we had to find a house surrounded by palm trees, we simply walked around until all of the bad guys were chasing us (at a snail's pace), got in a truck and pulled a Panama. Crashing the truck into the group of enemies eliminated almost all of them -- mopping them up with the pistol was easy after that. We discovered afterwards that this trick can be used well more than once.   Gosub 60 does give Sahara players reason to replay levels, as there are artifacts hidden in the desert that can be leveraged for cheat modes. This is a clever little technique that would have gone much further if the game was worth replaying, but Sahara is a strict one-time-through affair.   Sahara looked decent enough on our test phone. The digital portraits of the actors were immediately recognizable. The backgrounds are appropriately brown -- this is the Sahara, after all. The night-vision sequences bathe the screen in green, but the outlines of enemies show up quite well. The game has a variety of sound effects that enhance the game, as well as a nice opening theme.Sahara is a decent action game that will probably be enjoyed by fans of the movie -- or players of Gosub's previous OP15. I wish that some of the tactics, such as stealth or the Panama were either more useful or less powerful. But the game spins such a good yarn with such personality that it somewhat makes up for some iffy play elements, because as mentioned, Sahara treads in the film's footsteps with incredible loyalty. Gosub 60 is a talent and I'm always curious to play their wares, but I just wish Sahara was a little faster and engaging. A reasonable download, but there are better ways to spend your gaming dollars.", "date": "Apr 23, 2005"}
