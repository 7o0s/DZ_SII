That's not an insult. Actually, some of the best games I've played in my time in front of the television have been fairly brainless affairs. Samurai is more of a twitch game, something of a wink to the hardcore gamer that is beginning his/her flirtation with mobile gaming. Games like this are certainly necessary if we want to expand our audience, but the unfortunate thing in this case is that Samurai may not keep them around for long. Sure, action games are expected to be shallow, but Samurai makes the mud puddle outside my window seem deep by comparison.   The story is pure staple. You are a samurai charged with recovering a special sword from a demon lord. In order to do so, you must skewer hundreds of anonymous enemies between six rather entertaining boss encounters. This is actually my biggest gripe about Samurai. I felt like the designers were really psyched about their boss battles and just padded the game with some rote action between the end-level fight scenes.   Enemies will confront the titular samurai from either side -- often one from each direction -- and it's up to you to successfully juggle these attackers. Slashes to the left and right are mapped to different buttons on the number pad, and while these moves will certainly be used, Samurai kicks to a mildly higher gear when you obtain stronger swipes. Kicking and stabbing enemies, though, gets occasionally tedious -- especially when you get the feeling you are starting to overpower them.   Samurai enlists a few other genre requisites, like breaking open crates to uncover throwing weapons and health power-ups. You must also carefully jump over traps or correctly time walking through them.   Control is pretty good. I played the game on a Sony Ericsson 710a, which has one of those slightly uneven number pads, but I was still able to get the control down after a few minutes. I sometimes get frustrated with games that map all of the controls to the number pad, but to have one hand up on the thumb pad and the other dancing on the number pad would have made for an uncomfortable experience.   As I've come to expect from all JAMDAT games, Samurai employs good production values. The character art is quite good, especially the samurai and the boss characters. The in-level enemies are slightly varied, but they are pretty much all cut from the same cloth. The backdrops are well drawn, too, making me suspect I would find a few Japanese woodcuts if I visited the Ironmonkey offices. I thought the theme music was very good, too, as are the in-game sound effects.  Samurai truly has a one-track mind, but games in the mobile space usually require such laser focus. However, Samurai just isn't as compelling as I wanted it to be. I really enjoyed the boss encounters and the production values, but the game between those highlights just isn't that fun after a play or two. Slashing enemy after enemy (with few attack patterns) gets a little rote, but the levels are mercifully short in that respect.I think twitch gamers will get a little kick out of Samurai's challenge, which is strong -- you have three lives and only a couple continues. Once those are out, it's back to the beginning. That's pure 1990, Strider-style challenge.Casual gamers that prefer card games and word puzzles are better off steering clear of Samurai. But if you're looking for something akin to a traditional vid on a cell, Samurai is more your calling. I just wish I could tell you that the experience is more fun than it is. Perhaps you're better off waiting for a sequel -- which is deserved, because there are some good ideas in here.", "date": "Jul 23, 2005"}
