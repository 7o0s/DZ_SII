Granted, the console has some years to go before it catches up to the wayward PC, but with Onimusha: Warlords, Soul Reaver 2, Kessen 1&2, and now Drakan: The Ancients' Gates jumping onboard, the genre is growing, and I might say, slowly, but with strong, likeable games. Unlike the other games on the system, Drakan follows a more old-school approach to the adventure paradigm -- diversifying its dungeon crawls with above-land quests, and bolstering its character development with a good story (and a naturally evil villain) that packs lots of side quests and sub-plots. But Surreal's RPG-like quest brings the adventure game to a new level, to a broader, more elevated status, really, with the introduction of Arokh, the dragon.   Arokh's ability to fly isn't just a tech demo, or a ~lite~ addition to the core of the game, he is a fully integrated and fundamental aspect of the game, fighting enemies without your aid, ferrying Rynn from place to place, battling enemies in the sky or on the ground, and leading you deeper into the mythos of the environments, the landscape, and into the history and story itself, of which Arokh and his race are a crucial part. And just like a good adventure game, Drakan: The Ancients' Gates is big and long, packing in well over 25 hours of gameplay, along with a giant assortment of locales to sift through, explore, and inspect, and the kind of gameplay that gets you in trouble with the wife or the girlfriend. You say, ~I'll be done in half an hour,~ but before you bat another eye, it's 2:30 am, she's in her negligee, fast asleep. And for me, well, I didn't care, cause there was always just one extra quest to wander into before the sun rose...    Gameplay  Drakan: The Ancients' Gates is in many ways connected to the PC game that preceded it, but it's independent enough for gamers unfamiliar with the PC game to start up and play, immediately. The story follows Rynn and Arokh, who stand exhausted in a smoking, devastated village, wondering who survived the battle. Nobody is left, we learn, and a dark force has crushed other villages around the country. The once peaceful land, in which humans and dragons lived harmoniously together, is long gone, and blackened, flying humanoid creatures, with wings that resemble ragged butterfly wings messenger back and forth to the last standing powers of good, threatening and warning that humans must not try to undermine the new ~authority.~   Thus, Rynn and Arokh agree to regroup in a hidden territory, where a massive castle still stands and where a good queen still holds power. As you quickly learn, Rynn must open a handful of magic gates that will help to awaken the slumbering dragons, who, once they learn of the dark and evil new ways, would come to the rescue of the few remaining good folk. The gates and the items that help you open them lie in distant lands, and it's up to Rynn and Arokh to unlock them and free up the troubled lands that still exist.   What gamers will find out soon enough is that Drakan is a massive 3D adventure, with dozens of various lands to travel to and explore. The initial palace is quite big on its own, and the mountainside locale in which you initially travel is voluptuous with mountains and valleys, meadows and rivers, waterfalls, caves, scattered houses, fully populated, and a small village or two. And what you will find out is that of the eight environments and 15 levels, all of them are this big, ripe for exploration, be it on foot or on the back of the scaly one.    The game's basic style is much like Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time in that players enter into realtime fights, travel across massive landscapes and encounter more than two dozen interactive characters. It borrows heavily from both Zelda mechanics and Dungeons and Dragons' lore. I smiled a little when I found the Mourning Tree, which wasn't quite like Zelda's Deku Tree, but it did remind me of it. With regard to the D&D lore, it offering fights with familiar creatures, including troglodytes, sea serpents, ice behemoths, evil magic-using fiends, and most notably, dragons.   Straddling the RPG line a little bit, Drakan enables players to level up Rynn, and to delegate those points as they see fit. Points can be distributed to melee skills, archery skills, or magic skills, and once those points are distributed, the game confirms your decision. Every player is going to build up Rynn's abilities as they choose, making the game slightly different for each player. Rynn starts off with a small short sword, and no magic, but as she travels along, she picks up all the weaponry and armor she'll need. The first little hike to the first village is a training ground in itself, wherein players learn to use Rynn's abilities (walk, run, attack, defend, use a bow and arrow, jump, climb, hang, converse, swim, use magic, and manage the inventory). Once you begin earning cash, attaining weaponry is easy, since there always seems to be a blacksmith on hand. In the castle village, Rynn also can buy spells, visit the pub or the alchemist, who specializes in things such as Life potions, health drinks, and Mana, and pick up little side-quests from nearby villagers.   To acquire things, players can trade and buy them, and they can also repair existing weaponry, or refill arrow supplies. Why repair? Because each weapon takes damage, encouraging you to wield a wide selection. And all weapons have damage points, level requirements, and speeds. So, you may start out with a level 1 sword, but within hours, you might be using a level 3 Mythrill long sword that's very fast to fast, or a medium speed wooden axe that's excellent for clubbing troglodytes, crates and barrels.    Learning to manipulate Rynn is relatively easy, despite the character's inherent problematic control. The third-person perspective camera follows her every move rigidly from behind, and she is decently animated and responsive. Rynn moves more fluidly than Lara Croft from the Tomb Raider series, but also doesn't have the feckless precision that Lara had easier, which in that game was a blessing and a hindrance. Here, Rynn can jump and attack in mid air, use more than 50 kinds of weapons, attain and cast 30 magic spells, and ride a frickin' powerful fire-breathing dragon.   The great thing about Rynn is the solid construction of a ~z-targeting~ system, making combat good fun. Press R2 and the closest enemy will appear with a swirling yellow set of discs around it, and you'll be able to circle, strafe, and attack that enemy with ease. Tap it again, and the targeting disappears. In big fights with more than one enemy, the targeting transfers to the closest enemy within a limited distance, and the enemy AI is programmed not to unleash the full power of say, six enemies, at once, creating a unfair advantage.   Creatures sort of take turns, and will also throw in attacks while you're facing another enemy, creating some tension and forcing gamers to learn to combat skills as well. That type of motivation and encouragement is rare in any type of videogame, let alone adventure titles, which obviously makes it a big plus in Drakan's book.    Control problems come in small doses, hindering the game's jumping move the most, and creating difficulty when trying to walk past Arokh without mistakenly jumping on his back. I would have liked it to be a little more formidable in the archery department, including moving around while in zoom mode, instead of always becoming a moving target. Also, while this isn't a fighting game, a few more attack animations would have broken up the monotony of these attacks, which consist of a single, double or triple combo attack.   Controlling Arokh, however, is brilliant in comparison. Arokh is designed to defend himself while alone, and is easy -- and ridiculously pleasurable -- to saddle and control. Just walk close by him and you'll instantly jump on his back. To fly, simply press triangle, to descent, press X. Arokh flies through the sky at various speeds at your command, and can instantly stop and hover. His animations are smooth and his movement is fluid; he's a real pleasure just to watch. And zipping around a huge environment is quick and easy.   Arokh's targeting works similarly to Rynn: Press R2 to target an enemy, and you'll lock on for battle. What's splendid about air battles is that Arokh strafes side to side, but can dodge enemy fire by ascending and descending as well, making air-to-air battles enormously exciting. Arokh can perform air-to-land attacks as well, showing off just how powerful is truly is. You can burn large enemies on foot to a crisp with a limitless supply of fireballs. Arokh performs two default attacks: A fireball attack and a shot-range fire breath, a wide swath of fire, which handily whips ground troops in a second. Tying Rynn in closer to Arokh, his health is the same as Rynn's, so when one is low in health, so is the other. Arokh is capable of five spell attacks, including fire (the default attack), sonic, lightning, ice and darkness, and it's far more fun to use magic with him than it is with Rynn.    The best aspect of this game, by far, with regard to technical abilities and game design, is the ability to switch on the fly from fighting on foot with Rynn to battling in air with Arokh. This simple ability is just damn cool in itself, but another factor makes it all the more impressive. When on foot, the world around you appears huge, and sometimes impossibly large to traverse on foot, but up on Arokh's back, traveling from point to point is remarkable simple, fast, and stunning to experience. Surreal is able to create a feeling of immense scale and size on the one hand, and then to literally enable the player to feel and experience it in full in air.   I especially liked the menu system for both characters. To access weapons, players can use the menu system, or additionally use a Hot Slot system, in which players mark a weapon or item, which then becomes useable during play by pressing R2. Weapons can instantly be scrolled through and used during play. The rest of the menu system is perfunctory, but I especially enjoy the map, objectives, and weapon setups. They're easy to use, quick and simple. The only drawback I found was that the menu system doesn't stop time, thus players are vulnerable to attack while restoring health, mana, or switching weapons, which may be a little realistic (or something like that), but it just seems kind of ruthless, not at all in the player's favor.   Where Drakan weakens is its prolific amount of redundancy and simplicity. While the small amount of freedom to differentiate Rynn with melee, archery or magic skills is unique, the actual act of fighting is relatively plain. Bash, bash, bash the enemy and move on. Spells are great fun to cast, but specializing in the art of a mage in Drakan would be difficult indeed without simultaneously building up one's melee points as well. In fact, specializing in anything but a fighter is rather worthless. To get the most from Drakan, one must first become a powerful fighter and then secondarily bolster archery and magic using.    When it comes to fighting, the combat concept is implemented well enough, but it's once players master the targeting technique, it becomes increasingly apparent that the enemy AI is very predictable, and often incredibly stupid. Naturally, some of the enemy characters SUPPOSED to be stupid, but I'm talking ~not worthy.~ Enemies can often be approached by the side or even sometimes after rounding corners without being seen. And they often stand in one spot as you cast rounds of arrows into their chests and kill them.   Unlike Zelda, which is rich with complex puzzles and tasks that tie into one another, Drakan is quite simplistic in regard to puzzles. In fact, there are almost no real puzzles to speak of, other than the fetch-quest sort. After experiencing a few environments, it becomes clear that you won't be solving any major mind benders. Having said that, Drakan does offer a rich assortment of quests, all of which are tied into one another rather cleverly.   For instance, in the Isles, you must set plans to sail to a distant land, but once you get there, several new quests are provided before the initial one can be solved. You must as a primary quest recover shards from the mine to help strengthen a small army leader from death, but the ship captain's maps must be retrieved for him to sail. In the meantime a baddy by the name of Bonecrusher has created a nonstop storm, through which no ship could sail. Naturally, you have to level up, face his minions, and then beat him, too.   Lastly, the story didn't compel me to reach the end, like I have in other games (though I did to write this review). The story is good, and it has several twists ands turns with new and wicked enemies appearing, complicating and widening the story's path, but it's not a solely story-driven game. It's more of an action-driven game, loaded with good, relevant quests, and perhaps a dizzying array of not-so relevant quests that distract players from the main story, and perhaps even diluting the central goals of the story.    Graphics  Right away, players can tell that Surreal spent its primary memory on size and scale. The environments in Drakan are not only bountiful in number, but they are exceptionally large. A single level-environment is packed with meadows, valleys, and mountains, all in which civilians function in realtime, enemies hide and attack, and life exists on its own. Not only that, but each locale also features handfuls of caverns and secret areas to explore. With much of the game's power going to its proportions, one can instantly see that the texture variance is less than abundant. So yes, there is occasionally distant fogging, similarly textured areas, and lots of repetitive looking villagers, which count against it.   Having said that, the textures we do see are artfully crafted. Walk into a meadow and you'll see wildflowers, grass, and weeds in abundance, prettying up the area. Jump onto Arokh and land anywhere and you'll see that most visual aspects of Drakan are well taken care of; there is a minimum of aliasing and little to no graphic glitches (there are a few, but considering the game's size, there are very few). The few textures are made good use of, colored with different lighting, used with a variance of color, and nicely blended with other textures, too. The level of detail, texture-wise on characters such as Rynn and Arokh is also impressive: Arokh is a well-crafted dragon that looks compact and yet enormous at the same time. In environments, the level of detail draw line often shows up a little too close for comfort, but given the vast size of the levels, and amount of detail in every area, one can forgive Surreal because it clearly wanted to make each location in every environment unique and attractive.    The characters themselves are well textured, and they animate well, too. Nearly all creatures have moving eyes, blinking eyelids, and moving mouths. Their facial movements aren't quite as good as say those in Final Fantasy X, Agent Under Fire, or even Soul Reaver 2, but they're good. Of the many characters animations, what I found to be enormously entertaining is Arokh's standing animations. When you dismount him, he'll say things like, ~I'll wait right here,~ and then he'll kick back. Only he won't just stand there. He shakes his head, moves his neck around, stammers, and quite often, he'll take the air to check things out on his own. It's also totally impressive to walk out from the other side of cavern, and to see Arokh recognize your location and fly over to meet you. Every movement he makes is smooth and well animated. (You can also call Arokh with R1, and he'll appear from the sky to pick you up.)   Sound  While the game has a kind of standard adventure music filling up space in the background, what's most entertaining is the broad scope of voice acting backed up with good dialogue. Often times the game's non-playable characters dialogue is hilarious, and even when it's not occasionally hilarious, it's very funny, providing plenty of character and personality to every character on screen.   Even Rynn's dialogue is good, showing her character to be sensible at times, emotional at others, and just plain kick-butt at others. She is so much more of a character and a personality than Lara Croft, it's strange that I would even compare the two. And honestly, the other reason I've done it is to separate them. There are several nice touches with Arokh, sound-wise, too. When you call him, and he's close by, he'll say things, like, ~You don't have to yell.~ It's just cool. I have been a little reluctant, perhaps even feeling a little dread, about reviewing Drakan in recent weeks, partly because I knew it would take a long time to play, and also because it's a big game that requires lots of study. What I found after the first hour or so Drakan: The Ancients' Gates, is that it is indeed a large, time-consuming game, and that it's far more addictive that I expected. I spent several nights in a row playing until 2 in the morning, unable to just simply stop, without settling just one more quest. That's the real interesting thing about Drakan. The story itself isn't the most compelling aspect; it's the alluring quantity of quests that present themselves, the constant call of achieving that next character level, and the knowledge that there is so much to do and see, that putting down the controller seems a futile effort. These are the compelling reasons to keep playing. On the surface, there is a lot to like about Drakan: The Ancients' Gates. It's a well-rounded adventure, starring a female warrior and her friend the dragon, who she's able to ride and on which she can fight. The game is huge and pretty, too. But what I especially like about Drakan, is that under the visible surface is a solid, competent adventure offering lots of unique abilities, showing a handful of nice touches, an abundance of characters to meet, and it all comes together in a well-presented fashion. In the end, Drakan is a good game that adventure fans should like, and could perhaps even love. It's an addicting game, and one that I recommend.", "date": "Feb 1, 2002"}
