The game's odd balance of platform hopping and general shooting elements combined to make Blaster Master a genuine classic in the 8-bit days.  The name was strong enough to justify continuations of series across multiple systems, including the Game Boy black-and-white system (Blaster Master Boy) and the Genesis (Blaster Master 2). A decade after the first edition, Sunsoft returns to its classic by offering a new Color edition entitled Blaster Master: Enemy Below. Regardless if you're a carried-over fan of the original or a total virgin to the series, you'll absolutely find a serious challenge in this newly-released continuation. The game is tough, but a lot of fun.  Features Eight worlds Multiple weapons and vehicle upgrades Side scrolling and overhead perspectives Password save For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  The timeline of Blaster Master: Enemy Below is set after the other games, where you're now just an action hero -- no convoluted, swiss-cheese plots to get in your way. You're put in the role of subterranean exterminator, and since you've already proven your worth, you get the same kick-ass vehicle that you got in the previous adventures. This vehicle is what trademarks Blaster Master -- while you can always hop in and out of your vehicle, it's this wheeled bad-boy that gives you all your real abilities.  The best way to describe Blaster Master is simply ~vehicular platform shooter.~ It's very similar to Metroid in design, but instead of controlling a babe in a suit you're behind the wheel of a Moon Patrol-style land rover with a huge cannon as a snout. Early on in the game all you can really do is hop, drive and shoot in this vehicle, wandering through the game's first level in search of the boss (which is devastatingly hard to defeat in its own right) . Enemy critters and creatures wander over the world trying to put you out of commission, but a few well-placed shots from your gun will blow them up  sometimes leaving handy energy power-ups that will replenish your vehicle's shields. At points in the game you'll have to physically jump out of your vehicle to access tight corridors in order to gain access to doorways, but you want to do this reservedly as your persona can't take many hits or falls. And in a game where you only get one life, you'll quickly learn the lesson the hard way.   When these doorways are located, the game switches from the sidescrolling platformer to more an overhead shooter much like Gauntlet. Since the game awkwardly limits your ability to move or shoot in diagonal directions, a lot of fumbling has to be done with the sloppy controls to target enemies. These overhead portions are important since these are the modes where you acquire keys and access the end-of-level bosses.  Remember the mention of Metroid? Here's the deal: the game starts out rather plain, since your vehicle doesn't really have much panache or ~zing~ to it in the form of abilities  but stick with it. When you access later levels you'll acquire more powerful weaponry and techniques that are important to gain access to higher and deeper areas. Probably the coolest feature is the vehicle's ability to go up against gravity and climb walls and ceilings. Very cool, and it works extremely well.  The game is hard -- almost frustratingly so, as when your vehicle or your character takes too many hits, it's back to the beginning of the level or at the point where you left an overhead spot. And in a game of exploration like Blaster Master, this is a little on the annoying side. Case in point  boss battles. Lose a battle, go back to your distant ~checkpoint,~ and you have to fight your way through the round again just to get to the boss battle again  risking preliminary damage before the faceoff.   The other complaint comes in the form of the password system  this is one of those games where you really wish the publisher spent the extra buck or two to insert a battery in the cartridge. The password isn't terribly long, but it's still a hassle to keep track of the last place you've visited by a string of eight unrelated characters. But with those flaws in mind, Blaster Master: Enemy Below is a blast to play  an old-school fix for fans of the classic.  It's also one of the last big Game Boy Color titles that was also produced with the black-and-white system in mind  so if you're still one of those hold-outs that hasn't jumped on the Color bandwagon yet, you've still got one more action game made specifically for you.  Ever since I started IGNpocket more than a year ago, Blaster Master was probably the game I was asked about the most -- and now that it's finally here I'm confident that fans of the classic will dig this version. It's pretty darn difficult, but that just means that it won't take you a night to finish -- you'll get your money's worth, that's for sure. There are points in the game that will definitely frustrate you, and the game definitely needed a better way to save your position. But once a classic, always a classic.", "date": "Sep 20, 2000"}
