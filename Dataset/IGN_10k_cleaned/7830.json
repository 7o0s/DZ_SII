Fans of Hellcats and Messerschmitts have had a small number of series to turn to over the last ten years but gamers who are looking for Spads and Fokkers have been totally out of luck. There was Silver Wish's arcade-focused Wings of War but that hardly satisfied the hardcore fans' longstanding hopes for a true successor to Sierra's Red Baron.  iEntertainment's online flier Dawn of Aces seemed like a good option, but it lacked the considerable advantage of being tied to a fancy pants movie project. Enter Flyboys, the first film in forty years to attempt to capture the strain and spirit of World War 1 dogfighting over the trenches cutting across the fields of France. iEntertainment has taken the Flyboys name and attached it to their own title, a collection of individual missions inspired by the film and a vast online arena where wannabe Rickenbackers and Richtofens can mix it up with each other.   Those gamers who are more familiar with the company's World War 2 flight game (or similar games like Fighter Ace or Air Warrior) will notice that, in keeping with the World War 1 setting, the roster of planes is much smaller here. Happily, the team has chosen the stable of planes very well. The requisite Fokkers and Spads, Albatroses and Nieuports are all on hand, as are bombers like the Bristol and Gotha. Each plane possesses the performance characteristics they were known for; the S.E.5A and the Spad VII are very fast, but they can't compete with the agility of the Focker Dr.1 or the Sopwith Camel.  Having never flown anything with more than one wing, I can't completely vouch for the accuracy of the flight models of these biplanes and dreideckers, but it feels realistic. Stalls, turns, landings all have a convincing sense of weight and timing to them. Control systems on these planes weren't terribly sophisticated, so you won't have to worry about engine mixtures, or flaps, feathering your props -- you just worry about your throttle, three axes of movement and a trigger. In a way, it simplifies things and forces you to focus on the basics -- do you want a stable gun platform or would you rather have a shakier but more maneuverable fighter?  The campaign uses the film as inspiration but it feels a bit flat. Each of the 12 missions is tightly scripted and will play out nearly the same no matter how many times you play it. Your degree of success in one mission has no bearing on your progress. You can, in fact, simply play the missions in any order you want. What's missing here is a real feeling that these missions constitute a career or fit within the context of a real war. Instead, you'll simply pop into the air, shoot down a few enemies, and move on to the next forgettable encounter.   If the play the missions in order, the difficulty ramps up quite nicely. Players will progress through a career starting with basic aerial maneuvers and gunnery and ending with balloon busting and one-on-one fights with enemy aces. The early lessons are fairly straightforward (although the rear gunner mission is a bit difficult) but the difficulty increases with each new accomplishment. Better still, there's a progressive difficulty option that will gradually introduce full realism options like G-effects, collisions and more accurate flight modeling.  Unfortunately, the mission objectives are a bit too straightforward and simple. Once the mission starts (in the air no less), you're basically just supposed to kill everything you see until you reach a predetermined limit. Then you're free to end the mission regardless of your damage state or the presence of enemy fighters. It's a bit awkward to be able to end a mission in success while you've still got an enemy waxing your tail. Asking players to get themselves out of danger and land before ending a mission would definitely help prepare players for the merciless competitors found in the online arenas.      When you're done with the campaign, you might want to try out some of the hidden bonus missions. There are loads of extra missions here but almost all of them make use of the maps and planes from Warbirds' World War 2 setting. You can opt to fly through many of them using the Flyboys' planes but I don't like your chances. One mission lets you fly over a very detailed model of Randolph Air Force Base. Though it lacks the excitement of being shot at, it's worth trying out just to see all the details the designers worked into the environment.  Though the game comes with a free one-month subscription to iEntertainment's popular Warbirds and Armored Assault arenas, the value of the online subscription to the Flyboys arena is negligible. There are rarely more than a dozen players on during the evenings and the arenas are too large for such a small number of players. Luckily there are a number of AI controlled planes flying patrol in the skies but they don't provide the same level of challenge found in human players and don't do very much to justify the fee you'll eventually be asked to pay to play.   Newbies won't be helped by the lack of a relaxed realism arena here. If you want to play online, you have to fly under the strictest conditions possible. The Warbirds community has always been very helpful and patient when welcoming to novice flyers but there's still not much mercy to be found amongst your opponents once you cross the threshold into the online environment.   Once you do manage to get up to speed with regard to the online community, you'll be rewarded with a persistent and thrilling battlefield that offers convenient ways to join the conflict. Loads of airfields, an in-game map that shows air and ground targets, a easy to read aerial ID system and free teamspeak servers make it easy to find enemies as well as friends to fly with. Again, the only problem here is that there simply aren't enough players on at any given time to really bring the experience to life. With more players and more sponsored events, Flyboys could really take off. Time will tell if the World War 1 setting can draw enough players to make it worth the subscription fee.  No one will mistake the visuals from the game for those of the film, but Flyboys still looks very good. The planes are all rendered very realistically, from the basic profiles to the placement of struts and instruments. Even the impractical ironsights of the Fokker Dr.1 are present here. Control surfaces all move realistically, both when seen from the cockpit and the external views. Damage modeling could be a bit more sophisticated -- planes tend to break apart in large chunks, for instance, and oil leaks are indicated by small black globs -- but we really like the smoke and flame effects. It makes shooting your enemies down so much more satisfying.   The ground looks great when viewed from more than a few hundred feet in the air but, once you get down below that, the lack of detailed objects on the ground will kill any sensation of speed you might have. True, the airfields, villages and forests are fun to fly through, but the rest of the country just seems to lack depth. The few objects that you do find aren't terribly detailed but you're usually going by so fast that you won't really have time to notice.  We're quite happy with the sky and weather effects, however. Flyboys' cloud model is very convincing with just the right amounts of softness and haze to make you feel like you're traveling through a real cloud. The position of the sun and the time of day can have all kinds of crazy effects on the sky color. While it might be a little exaggerated, it's great to see such variety in the backgrounds. Likewise, the weather effects, when present add another layer of personality and charm to the game.  The same can be said of the sound. Though not nearly as varied as the visuals, the sounds of engines and weapons really help connect you to the experience. More significant are the creaks and groans heard when you're putting too much stress on your airframe. You'll definitley want to pay attention to those or you'll risk having parts of your plane ripped off.Fans of World War I aviation have nowhere else to turn. If you've absolutely got to get your knights of the air fix, then you've got to try Flyboys. Still, there are plenty of obvious ways that the campaign should have been broadened and there aren't nearly enough people playing online for it to be worth the subscription fee. If the community expands, Flyboys could definitely offer enough online action to satisfy your urges but, until then, it's only worth it if you're name is Billy Bishop.", "date": "Dec 14, 2006"}
