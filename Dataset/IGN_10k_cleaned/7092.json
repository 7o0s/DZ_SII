{"name": "3D Rollercoaster Rush", "name_review": "Rollercoaster Rush", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/07/28/rollercoaster-rush", "text": "Rollercoaster Rush is cut from the same cloth as Digital Chocolate's 2006 masterwork, Tower Bloxx. It's an impishly creative wild ride -- you are a world famous brake man, the chap in charge of controlling the speed of the cars on whiplash-inducing rollercoasters around the globe. You thrill to get coaster junkies the ride of their lives, taking them closer to the edge of the death than they'd ever really care to know, by speeding the cars through loop de loops and other daredevil features.   Using just the 4 and 6 buttons, or the thumb pad, you must adjust the speed of the cars as they move across lengths of rollercoaster track. Each level includes a few ~hazards,~ like steep declines and jumps that must be properly negotiated in order to move on to the next track. The game gives you an indicator of the next coaster thrill along the bottom of the screen, courtesy of a Dance Dance Revolution-style meter. Danger lurks around each feature -- if you don't hit the feature at a reasonable speed, the cars will either buckle or fall off the track, sending your poor riders parachuting to the earth.   To progress through the games series of courses -- stretched across Australia, France, and America -- you have to score a specific amount of points. Every proper thrill you give your riders results in smiley faces that float up to your score. A successfully completed course adds more cars and more riders to the mix, which in turn increases the possible points you can earn from gliding through a loop de loop at a breakneck velocity. However, it does make the car harder to handle through some of the more nerve-racking areas, like incredibly steep drops. It's much easier to over-compensate a four-car train than the beginning two-car set-up.   If you derail, you'll lose one of your riders. If you lose the two riders that came with a new car, though, the car remains on the train. You'll have to suffer handling the fuller train with less riders for fewer points in order to build up attendance again. In the meantime, you are reliant on hidden in-track bonuses to make it to the next set of courses. These in-track bonuses are earned by hitting certain speeds, hitting your riders with a ~zero-g~ moment, etc.   The secret of the game is knowing when to properly slow the cars and when to put the hammer down and send those riders rocketing across the twisted coaster tracks. Getting just a basic handle on this mechanic will get you through the game, but just like Tower Bloxx, simply hitting objectives is only half the game. Rollercaoster Rush earns its gotta-have status by teasing you with fun point rewards, such as Big Air and Dynamic Speed, for taking risks while running the coasters. The tracks are just the right length that you'll replay them over and over without any chance of boredom.   The game has the same cheery look that helped inspire extended sessions over Tower Bloxx. The bright colors and cutesy riders are the perfect antithesis to the coaster carnage that unspools with every wreck. In real life, disasters like ones you cause (sometimes on purpose, I admit) would paint the parking lot with a crimson mist. The track backdrops are appropriate for each location -- the American tracks are set against NYC, for example, complete with the Statue of Liberty. Each run through the courses is accompanied by a pleasant little tune, too.   Rollercoaster Rush allows players to use DChoc's Mobile League service to post scores to leader boards and issue challenges to friends via text messages.  Rollercoaster Rush is a brilliant mobile game -- everything is so perfectly tuned for the platform, from the simplistic concept that initially hides insidiously deep play to the clever track designs. My only real complaint is that I wish there were more courses -- but that's attributed mostly to the fact you don't really want to stop. Those that are in here are roaring fun and worth replaying multiple times to aim for big scores or stage spectacular crashes. Other than that minor criticism, I recommend Rollercoaster Rush to any and all mobile players. This could be 2006's sleeper hit, just like last year's Tower Bloxx.", "date": "Jul 28, 2006"}
