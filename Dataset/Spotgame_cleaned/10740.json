Whether you're playing story or challenge mode, you progress through a series of screens that are filled with coins, gems, enemies, and little green grubs. You have to collect grubs with your tongue and spit them at your pack animal, Slotham, who slowly moves from left to right at the bottom of the screen. If Slotham reaches the end of the screen before you collect the required number of grubs, you lose. Luckily you can slow Slotham down by spitting puddles of honey in his path. To collect grubs, you'll have to jump, swing from your tongue, and fend off enemies that try to carry the grubs away. As if that weren't enough, some enemies can actually kill Wik, so there's the matter of self-preservation to keep in mind as well. With its charming presentation and challenging gameplay, Wik is an enchanting little game that's definitely worth checking out."}
