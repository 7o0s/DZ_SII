How do you adapt the worlds greatest detective for the interactive medium of video games? How do you give players the power fantasy of embodying the man with all the answers, without diminishing a crucial sense of challenge? How do you test a players investigative skills, without it feeling like theyre just following Sherlocks lead?These are all questions Ukrainian developer Frogwares is accustomed to answering, having developed nine Sherlock Holmes games over the past fifteen years. Its last entry, 2014s Crimes & Punishments, answered these queries more astutely than most by placing the onus of responsibility squarely in the players hands. Sure, it may have been somewhat easy to uncover all of the clues with Sherlocks full range of near supernatural powers at your disposal, but piecing each clue together, arriving at a plausible conclusion, and being confident that you were convicting the right suspect was an altogether different beast. With no wrong answers, it was less a game about rights and wrongs, and more about your interpretation, where Sherlocks moral compass was your obligation, and you were forced to decide if these people should walk free, spend time behind bars, or worse.The latest entry in the series, Sherlock Holmes: The Devils Daughter, takes this unusual premise and applies it to five new Sherlockian tales of intrigue, suspense, and grey moral quandaries. As with Crimes & Punishments, this partition of cases is structurally sound. Without the need to stretch out one case over the length of an entire game, these bite-sized stories are free to move along at a fairly brisk pace, maintaining suspense throughout and hitting satisfying crescendos. Theres some foreshadowing sprinkled throughout that alludes to the titular Devils Daughter, but otherwise these are all disparate cases, branching a range of interesting subjects, from peculiar murders, to a deceptive traffic accident, and even an attempt on Sherlocks life.If youve played Crimes & Punishments, locations like Scotland Yard and Sherlocks flat on Baker Street will be instantly familiar, yet The Devils Daughter still resembles a soft reboot of sorts. This is partly due to the sprightly redesigns of both Sherlock and his trusty sidekick Dr. Watson--with Holmes transforming into a bit of a Jon Hamm-alike. Admittedly, this doesnt change all that much: the writing and voice acting are still decent, with a few notable exceptions (such as the grating caricature of Sherlocks daughter), and even Sherlock is a little less forthright--a little less of a decorous bore--which makes him slightly more enjoyable to be around. Theres actually a tinge of Robert Downey Jr.s Sherlock about him, which seems like a conscientious decision when you consider the other ways in which The Devils Daughter has tweaked the formula.Devil's Daughter strikes me as a game attempting to push the series forward in a presumptive attempt to attract a more mainstream audience. Its all a bit triple-A, if not in practice, then at least in spirit. Unfortunately its an approach that never really achieves anything but middling results.You can now venture out onto the streets of Victorian London for the first time in the series--passing merchants shilling their wares, or overhearing the downtrodden complaining about the economy--but its mostly inconsequential. Youll occasionally have to find a house or two by following road signs, but you spend most of the game fast-travelling from one location to another (the long loading times will test your patience). While at first this adventure to the outside world seems novel--providing the game with a welcome sense of time and place--it soon becomes an afterthought as early as the second case, and feels like a missed opportunity.In fact, the most meaningful usage of Londons cobblestone streets arrives early in the first case, when you play as young Wiggins (Sherlocks eyes-on-the-street) and are tasked with tailing a potential suspect through the winding back alleys of Whitechapel. If youre rolling your eyes at the very thought of a tailing mission, youre right to do so: this bout of stalking is as bad here as any Assassins Creed game. Though, mercifully, it only shows up this one time, which is a common theme throughout The Devils Daughter, as mechanics are forgotten just as quickly as theyre introduced.Its quite the list, too. Theres a section where you have to run through a forest, managing stamina, and ducking behind cover to escape an impassioned gunman. Some rudimentary stealth makes an appearance, too, as you stand behind things and make note of guard patterns to sneak through a cemetery unnoticed. Theres one part where you switch between Sherlock and Watson to pull levers and push boxes in order to reach a higher platform, and a comical bar fight that is overcome with a most egregious process of trial and error.Theres even some Uncharted-style tomb raiding as you contend with spike pits and booby-trapped rooms during an illusionary jaunt through an ancient temple. The Devils Daughter is certainly varied, and I appreciated that I wasnt doing the same exact things in every single case. The problem with this scattershot of action-oriented asides is that theyre mechanically unrefined and terribly overdrawn. Player movement is clunky at best, and the things youre doing are rather dull and derivative, which is only exacerbated when they drag on for too long. The game is spread too thin, with a variety of activities that rarely coalesce into something enjoyable.Fortunately, solving cases is often a joy, and is done in a plethora of ways that delve into Sherlocks idiosyncratic methods of investigation. The basic mechanics work as they have done previously--with a few minor tweaks here and there--and revolve around surveying crime scenes to gather evidence, interrogating suspects and witnesses alike, and using Sherlocks divine powers of deduction to piece everything together.Collecting evidence is relatively straightforward for the most part, and the locations you visit are beautifully detailed. Theyre varied, too--taking you from an opulent bowls club to an illegal gambling den perched on one of Londons ramshackle docks--and sleuthing your way through them is a real treat. Occasionally you need to utilize Sherlocks Victorian Detective Vision to uncover clues ordinary folk wouldn't notice. And things can also get a little tricky when, say, theres a lock that needs to be picked, or an ancient Mayan text that has to be translated. These more traditional puzzles are dotted throughout, and put the conundrum-solving part of your brain to good use. A few had bamboozled me on more than one occasion. And if theyre too intricate, or if you only really care about the story, they can always be skipped without penalty.Ive always enjoyed the interrogation component of crime solving games, and The Devils Daughter puts a wonderfully felicitous spin on proceedings. At any time during conversations you can slow down time and zoom in on specific aspects of the person youre talking to. This allows Sherlock to parse details that you or I may never notice. A sewn patch on a childs clothing, for example, might look insignificant, but to Sherlock its an indication that his parents take good care of him; and that his skinny arms (a sign of malnourishment) arent born from negligence, but from a severe lack of income. This is important because, in a very Sherlockian way, you can often catch someone lying by contradicting their statement with a detail you picked up just by observing them. If youre missing a particular piece of information, youll lose out on these opportunities, which injects a welcome dose of meaningful interactivity into what was previously a passive affair.Once youve spoken to enough people and gathered the requisite evidence, its time to piece everything together and come to a conclusion. This takes place within a literal representation of Sherlocks mind, with clues depicted as neurons that can be linked together so long as theyre relevant to one another. Link enough clues and this invariably uncovers more clues, until youre able to reach an outcome thats consistent with your interpretation of events. And thats key, remember. There will often be two or more suspects, each with evidence suggesting both their possible guilt and innocence. Its up to you to paint a picture of the case and come to a decision that youre happy with. Its a peculiar way of ensuring Sherlock is always right--and maintains his air of superiority--but it works. If theres any failing, its that this concept robs each case of the satisfaction of knowing you did a good job. Yet, more than any other game of its ilk, it made me think and contemplate my decisions in a way that had me scouring back through all the evidence, just to make sure I was absolutely confident in my answer.Less fantastic, however, are The Devils Daughters technical shortcomings. Visually, this is a handsome game, but the framerate has trouble keeping up, and screen tearing is a near-constant nuisance. Mechanically, its not particularly intensive, so these issues arent as heinous as they maybe could have been. But they are noticeable, and, combined with the excruciating loading times, amount to a game thats not as optimized as one might hope.Ultimately, Sherlock Holmes: The Devils Daughter succeeds where its predecessor did, by presenting a generous spate of intriguing cases, and giving you the freedom to come to your own conclusions. Its a fantastic detective game; its just a shame that it's bogged down by myriad technical issues, and a mediocre attempt to inject some action into proceedings."}
