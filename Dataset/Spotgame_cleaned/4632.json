You jump into a mission knowing full well what your orders are, you carry out those directives, and you exfiltrate when the job is done. Its the same kind of glamorized efficiency that makes spy fiction so appealing. The narrative device that improves on this premise is, of course, when things dont go as planned, when the agent or squad must adapt to changing circumstances. Its due to a shortage of these surprises, however, that God Eater Resurrection never transcends its safe, uncomplicated design.Resurrections world is candy-wrapped around an anime-influenced aesthetic and the mediums ever-growing fascination with urban dystopias. Along with the variety of environments, theres a lot of creativity to be found in the design of the enemies youre sent to destroy: four-legged beasts with faces of old men, living iron maidens, and large bipedal lizards with stylish helmets.You play the newest member of a team of god-killing soldiers, a group of teens and 20-somethings whove managed to survive an apocalyptic event in which hostile demon-beasts dubbed Aragami took over the world. As with many teen-targeted manga-styled ensembles, the cast is a collection of distinct personalities with limited emotional capacities. All the tropes are here: the archetypically neurotic support teammate, the brooding all-business specialist, and the squad member whose bubbly, saccharine demeanor can be forgiven thanks to her usefulness in combat.Your custom character fits right in as the rookie who sounds self-assured no matter what voice type you pick. Your squads confidence in the face of humanitys likely extinction is complemented by the extreme designs of their multipurpose God Arc weapons. Not only are these tools of destruction often larger than the people who wield them, but these gunblades also eat Aragami--hence the ~God Eater~ name. These echo the kind of transformable armaments found in Monster Hunter and Vanquish, only theyre infused with the ferocity of the beasts they kill.Resurrections faithfulness to the original PSP version, Gods Eater Burst, underscores its limitations. The original appealed to that specific on-the-go audience that enjoys brief play sessions. Its a different set of expectations in the context of a console in a living room, where it feels more natural to tear through a dozen missions in one sitting. Its unfortunate that you cant take on multiple assignments in Resurrection without enduring the time-consuming process of returning to base to assess your rewards after every mission.There isnt depth in combat so much as there are multiple moments in a fight where you need to adapt to changes in an Aragamis behavior. When its enraged, you keep your distance, and when it tries to escape, you give chase. Its like a chess match where the opponent always gets to make the first move. While the majority of the sorties are involved, theres little room for improvisation. You can pick up the pace of play by using attacks that capitalize on an enemys elemental weaknesses, using consumable enhancements, and, most significantly, using the God Arc to bite a chunk off the Aragami. These mid-conflict opportunities not only provide a temporary stat boost for your customized protagonist but to your teammates as well, provided you can spare a couple of seconds to shoot your buddies with Aragami-infused ammo. Yes, you have to fire at your squad. It's unusual, but it sure beats having to run up to them to enhance their abilities.The straightforwardness of Resurrections missions is both its greatest strength and most frustrating weakness. Theres comfort in knowing what youre getting into and in the specificity of your missions. Unfortunately, it takes less than a few dozen quests before monotony sets in. Theres a modicum of gratification in maxing out your gear to keep up with the increasing difficulty of every subsequent batch of missions, yet theres also a palpable sense of routine, since the Aragami throw very few curveballs. This uncomplicated approach has one bright spot: Its easy to manage your team, which is both self-sufficient and made up of meaningful contributors. Given that boss battles can reach a frenetic pace, its often more sensible to leave your buddies to their own devices.The simplicity of the maps reinforces this level of ease. Resurrection avoids the Monster Hunter-style loading-screen tedium of chasing your prey from area to area. A ranged strike from anyone on your team will stop a fleeing Aragami. Rarely does a target use the terrain effectively enough to find respite for longer than a few seconds.Theres a bit more depth to be found in Resurrection's customized gear and crafting systems. Player progression doesnt rely on gaining experience through kills but rather on weapon upgrades and other improvements. The challenge lies in ensuring youre well-rounded enough to have a countermeasure for every enemy type. Its a compelling judgment game to build a small collection of melee weapons that address every possible Aragami weakness, whether thats through crushing, piercing, or slashing attacks. Then you have to factor in the weight of each weapon in the field and to determine how much damage you can deal per second. The one downside? Theres no item or weapon so rare or exceedingly useful that would warrant replays of any operation. Aragami item drops and the mission-completion rewards are abundant enough that youll always have items to craft and gear to enhance.Beyond crafting and buying new gear, theres little reason to spend time at your base, despite the games implication to the contrary. Conversations with NPCs are mostly superficial, save for the occasional chat that triggers the next batch of missions. HQ is merely a poorly created illusion of a grander base of operations, especially given the organizations in-game role in saving humanity.For as much as Gods Eater Burst excelled in 2010, its since been outpaced by similar games. That includes prey mounting in Monster Hunter and a more engrossing atmosphere in Toukiden: Kiwami. Theres comfort to be found in the simple mission goals, but its impossible to ignore how repetitive they are--and how outdated they make Resurrection feel in practice."}
