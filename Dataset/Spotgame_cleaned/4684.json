Frogger 2 for the Game Boy Color, however, sticks to the 2D trappings of its predecessor, making it essentially more of the same old Frogger. This formula's potency is linked directly to how deep your nostalgic streak runs. Like in the original, in Frogger 2 you must make your way across an obstacle course without being turned into a wet spot in the road. The movement controls are identical to those in the original, and because there are no special attacks or special jumps, Frogger 2 can literally be played with one hand tied behind your back. The game is split into five stages, each with seven levels. The first stage is fundamentally the same as the original Frogger, with busy strips of freeway broken up by ponds populated by floating logs, lily pads, snakes, and turtles. The subsequent stages borrow inspiration from the game's 3D counterparts, with levels such as ice cave, lava pit, and lost mine. As the gameplay is essentially the same throughout, the different levels act as little more than scenery changes designed to break up the visual monotony. To its credit, Frogger 2 succeeds in this. Neither the graphical nor the aural presentation in Frogger 2 are at all impressive, but given its classic-game nature, a lot of eye candy would be unnecessary. This is not to say Frogger 2 is an ugly game, because each level is full of nicely but simply animated characters, straightforward level design, and an eye-pleasing color palette. The music sounds like a slight upgrade to that found in the Atari 2600 version of Frogger, but given the circumstances, this works in the game's favor, adding to the overall retro feel of the game. In the end, it's quite clear that Frogger 2 is aimed squarely at the hearts of old-school gaming fans. If NES-caliber sound and graphics wrapped around one of the most memorable classic games fills you with nostalgia, then Frogger 2 for the Game Boy Color is right up your alley. Even with the ultrasimplistic gameplay, casual gamers may find the game to be a novel way to kill some time. However, if your heart isn't filled with nostalgia at the sight of a little green amphibian dodging traffic, then the minimalistic gameplay, simple graphics, and lackluster sound will likely not be enough to attract you."}
