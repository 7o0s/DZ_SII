These decrepit, slow-moving characters can single-handedly take out the fiercest of opponents and with the right support can plough through the best-laid defenses. Swords and Soldiers is similarly surprising, and its cartoon look and offbeat humour suggest simple, uncomplicated fare. What you actually get is an engrossing, accessible experience that offers plenty of fun either on your own or with a friend. This unique yet goofy real-time strategy game is one of the best WiiWare games released to date. Don't get thrown by Swords and Soldiers' 2D platformer look--this is a real-time strategy game through and through, although it's probably unlike others you've played (with the closest comparison being GrimGrimoire on the PlayStation 2). There are resources to be collected, units to be built, tech trees to master, and enemy bases to be rushed, but Swords and Soldiers takes away the sometimes overwhelming complexity present in other RTS games. There's only one type of resource to collect (gold), each of the three factions has only a handful of units available, and you'll have no direct control over your little minions once you create them. They'll march steadily and inexorably away from your base, attacking the first enemy they see and halting only when they're dead. The controls are similarly easy--every action can be done using the Wii Remote, from simply pointing at an indicator to create new units, to moving the camera left or right along the horizontal playfield. It sounds simple, but the heart of the RTS experience--that frantic, fun sensation of formulating a precise plan for victory and then having to execute it with pinpoint timing--beats strongly here. Your units may pay you no heed, but you'll have to think hard about the mix you send out to battle. With each unit moving at different speeds, you'll also have to carefully plan what order you send them in. The Aztec faction's necromancer can raise an army of undead, for example, but if you send him out solo, he's easy fodder. Couple him with the tank-like sun giant, however, and they make a formidable team. But with the giant moving at a snail's pace, you'll have to time the creation of both units so they come together at the right moment in battle. Of course, if you come up against a zen master--who can dispose of a giant in one fell swoop--you'll also need to have some melee backup, which means more forward planning and, eventually, crisis management when things don't go to plan. And it's not just units you'll have to worry about. Each faction has an array of magic at its disposal to aid its troops or hinder its enemies, forcing you to play a watchful game of offense and defense as your units move across the playfield. The three factions are all extremely well balanced. The swarthy Vikings are all power, showcasing a range of spells that can freeze or electrocute foes (they're also the only faction capable of healing units). The swift Aztecs can harness the power of the undead, as well as poison or trap enemies in place. The mysterious Chinese concentrate on magical abilities and can summon extra warriors who can appear behind the front lines to take out any pesky ranged damage dealers. While choosing and performing a spell is a simple point-and-click affair, the remote runs into some problems here. Choosing a specific unit to target in a crowded frontline can sometimes be hit-and-miss, but it's the only frustration in an otherwise solid control scheme. Confrontations in Swords and Soldiers are often tense and fast-paced, and your AI opponents in the single-player campaign offer strong resistance. Each faction gets its own individual campaign, and the game does an excellent job of mixing up your objectives and obstacles from level to level. Some will restrict the amount of gold you have, some will allow only certain units in battle, and others may simply have a time limit in which to achieve your objectives. There are five or six hours of gameplay the first run through, but once you're done, Swords and Soldiers also has a free-play Skirmish mode and several minigame challenges. But the most fun to be had is with its two-player offline competitive mode, which splits the screen in two horizontally to allow both players to see their respective areas of the map. These matches--which can be played on nine different maps and can last anywhere from five minutes to half an hour--are hectic, often becoming frenetic arm wrestles as the front line shifts back and forth between you and a friend. While the gameplay can get tense, you'll get a laugh out of Swords and Soldiers' incessantly colourful and offbeat presentation. The units are broadly drawn caricatures which are cute in their own way, but the environments you'll be fighting in are mostly bland and interchangeable. The motivations behind these factions are as cartoony as their look--the Vikings, for example, are scouring the world in search of better barbecue sauce, while the leader of the Aztecs just wants to protect his gigantic green chili pepper. This wacky humour infuses the entire game, with sly references abounding from sources as diverse as Monty Python and World of Warcraft. Sound also plays its part in pushing the game's less-than-serious attitude--it's hard not to smile each time a necromancer croaks out ~Bring out yer dead,~ and you'll giggle every time one of the Chinese faction's monkey ninjas squeals in death. Swords and Soldiers could have done with more factions, but for its asking price of 1,000 Wii points, its challenging single-player experience and fun multiplayer romp already present a good amount of value. It may not be as serious or ponderous as other RTS games out there, but don't let its appearance fool you--Swords and Soldiers is a great example of its genre, and its simple controls and abounding good humour are likely to engage even those who have never dipped their controllers into the strategy pool arena. Who said there are no good RTS games for consoles?"}
