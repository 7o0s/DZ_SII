This mobile port is a good representation of the arcade classic for cell phones. Pac-Man mobile's failure is merely in the sound department, which doesn't render the beloved sound effects quite the same way as the original, a sore disappointment for fans of the franchise. Otherwise, all the best aspects of the game are solidly translated to this very portable format. Must resist urge to make Billy Mitchell reference. If, by some chance, you've been cryogenically frozen for the past 30 years and have only just now surfaced--and are looking for a good mobile game to play--then meet Pac-Man, a lovable yellow character who is just one slice short of a pizza pie. Collect the dots, avoid the ghosts, and, four times a map, go to town on your nemeses with the aid of power pellets. You don't need to be Billy Mitchell, purveyor of the perfect game of Pac-Man, to spend hours playing this game, because there are three different difficulties to choose from. Besides... Ultimately, the game's brilliance lies in its simplicity. If games are allowed to be philosophically relevant, then Pac-Man is the invocation of Occam's razor. The soundtrack to Pac-Man's life has grown to be just as classic as the (Pac-)Man himself, and this is where the game suffers a little bit on the LG VX7000. Most notably missing is the sound of Pac-Man chomping, the constant hum of success that underlies a typical Pac-Man game. As well, the ghost chomping and dying noises are rendered imperfectly, leaving the sole satisfying sound effect to be the ditty that plays at the beginning of the level. The real fantastic four - Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. If you've gone a little while without playing Pac-Man, there's no better time than the present--the 25th anniversary of the franchise--to revisit the little guy. You don't have to relive the associated fads, which include the cartoon, the cereal, and the embarrassing ~Pac-Man Fever~ tune, to have a good time with this game."}
