Set during the final sagas of the Dragon Ball Z storyline, this game picks up where the second game in the series left off, right after the conclusion of the Cell Games. Fans of the venerable franchise will be very pleased to relive this action-packed portion of the storyline in the form of an adventure role-playing game, and players that have played the other two games in the series will feel right at home with the game, as it plays very similarly. The small problems that have been apparent throughout the series are still intact, along with a couple of new quirks that make the game overly easy. Even so, Buu's Fury is still a decent game for Dragon Ball Z fans. If you've kept up with the Legacy of Goku games, you'll be in for a familiar experience here. Picking up toward the tail end of the Dragon Ball Z saga, you start Buu's Fury with Goku making the hard decision to not return to Earth after Cell is defeated. Along the way, you'll get your chance to play as Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Goten, Trunks, as well as a couple of surprise characters here and there. If you're a fan of the series, you'll instantly be able to recognize exactly where you are in the saga. Toward the end of this epic tale, the series went off in many different directions, all culminating in an ending that few saw coming. As the name of the game implies, this time you're tasked with defeating the most powerful foe that the Z-Fighters have faced, Majin Buu, and along the way you'll also clash with some other incredibly powerful enemies. All told, this game packs in close to 100 episodes of the series into just a couple of hours, making for quite a whirlwind tour to say the least. The game clocks in at around seven hours long--longer if you choose to complete some lengthy side quests for a bit of fan service. If you already know how the events of the series unfold, that's enough for you to know that this game moves along very quickly, condensing an absolute ton of story into a short amount of game time. Buu's Fury marks the third installment of this series for Webfoot, the developers of the game. Webfoot has refined the experience of the series even further by separating the distinct chapters of the game much like an episode of the cartoon. If you've played the previous two games, you'll notice that this game does a much better job of capturing the feel of Dragon Ball Z. This time around, there are some scattered sound samples, speech windows with well-drawn faces of who you're speaking to, and music that sounds like it's right out of the show. Fans will relish the attention to detail. The gameplay has also seen a fair share of enhancements. Players will be treated to responsive controls and to what is generally a good-playing game. Perhaps the biggest change is that now your characters have a speed statistic that can be affected by the equipment you wear. This aspect is where the biggest quirk the game has is brought to light, which ultimately makes the game incredibly easy. The game is too easy, but it still makes for pretty good Dragon Ball Z fan service. Early on in the game, you'll receive a pair of one-ton boots and arm bands, which slow down your character considerably, but in return, these items give you a huge experience bonus when fighting enemies. If you wield these items long enough, you'll simply become accustomed to the movement of your character, and you'll level up at an amazingly fast rate. It's worth noting that your characters are already incredibly powerful to begin with, but they will become more powerful at an alarming rate by simply using these items throughout the game, which, in turn, allows you to breeze through the most difficult of chapters. On the same token, as your attacks become more and more devastating with each level gained, you'll also find that the bosses you encounter become easier to beat. Sadly, each and every boss encounter can be made even easier by mashing your melee attack button and backing the boss into a wall, where you can simply continue to tap the A button until you win. It's a shame to see that while this game features the most refined gameplay in the series, it has such a shameless exploit. In addition to this, the game also has only a dozen or so unique enemies, and as the game progresses you'll notice only slight variations in the foes you face. On that note, the game also recycles some of the graphics used in the previous game, and in some cases, it even lifts entire maps. While, by and large, most of the areas in the game are new, these few cases make it feel not as original as it ought to feel. Be that as it may, Buu's Fury is at times an exciting game that fans of Dragon Ball Z will probably find fairly enjoyable."}
