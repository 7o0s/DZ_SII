In Japan, tons of add-ons and upgrades to DDR have been released on the PlayStation. Aside from the main series, currently in its sixth incarnation in Japanese arcades, there have been a few little offshoots. One such offshoot is a Disney version of the game, complete with animated Disney characters and awful Eurobeat remixes of a handful of Disney songs. With the exception of the Disney face-lift, the game remains mostly unchanged. The game is all about timing. Arrows scroll up from the bottom of the screen and cross a line of outlines at the top of the screen in time with the music. When the arrows cross the threshold, you must step on the corresponding arrow on the floor mat. The better timed your steps are, the more points you score. Miss too many steps, and your game is over. The main DDR games featured polygonal dancers that bust moves while you play. Disney Mix replaces that background animation with sprites of Disney characters behind the wheels of steel, listening to a radio or just jumping around like, well, cartoons. The animation is a bit choppy, but it suffices since you'll rarely notice the background at all while playing. Where DDR Disney Mix really fails is in its music. The game has a few Euro-style dance remixes of Disney songs, such as the Mickey Mouse Club theme song, but it also has a ton of totally unrelated tunes, including ~Let's Twist Again~ by Chubby Checker. The odd mix of music lacks the charm of the music featured in other DDR games, as most of it sounds a little too similar to be exciting. In the end, DDR Disney Mix was designed as a game for kids. Most of the game's stages are quite easy, though there is a harder setting that will bring the game up to a moderate level of difficulty for fans of the series. If you're a DDR fan who hasn't already imported the bevy of dancing games available in Japan, DDR Disney is worth checking out."}
