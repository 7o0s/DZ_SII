If you've ever spent any time with the original Bejeweled, you'd know that there's something about the game that makes you want to keep playing for hours on end. In this sequel, you've got the same great puzzle action that makes the hours pass like minutes, but this time you've got several new modes, sharper graphics and special effects, and a few twists to the original formula that make it even better than the original."}
