The difference here is that you're not just trying to create a certain amount of matches, although doing so will help boost your score; to pass a level, every space on the board has to have had a match made on it. This type of gameplay, while initially pretty boring, becomes much more interesting on the later levels, where you won't be able to succeed by accidentally touching off huge chain reactions. The paid version of the game features some nice bells and whistles over the free Java game, like an excellent jungle-beat soundtrack and enhanced graphics--but unless you're already a big Jewel Quest fan, it may not be worth the $20 buy."}
