Until now, Rayman's appearances have been chiefly in platform games, but like any good mascot, Rayman is branching out into the racing genre. But instead of taking the completely obvious kart-racing route, Rayman Arena instead takes the only slightly less obvious foot-racing route. The results are, well, exactly what you'd expect from a mascot-driven foot-racing game. Rayman Arena is broken up into two types of gameplay. The first is your standard racing game. Each course consists of three obstacle-filled laps, and the object is, of course, to get around those three laps faster than up to three opponents. It isn't just a straight run, though. You'll have to jump over and around barriers, climb up walls, surf down waterways, and do some fast platform jumping to come in first place. You can also attack by picking up on-track power-ups. Attacking plays a much larger part in the game's battle mode, which puts you into a small arena and lets you fight it out against either human or computer-controlled opponents. The game plays like a very rudimentary third-person shooter, complete with the ability to lock on to your opponents. While the level design in most of Rayman Arena's race courses is competent, and each track is full of shortcuts and other options to provide some variety, there really isn't enough for you to do. You typically need only two laps on a course to figure out a path through the level that will defeat the computer racers. Multiplayer, which allows up to four players to play simultaneously via a split screen, is really the main draw of Rayman Arena, but the lack of any real gameplay variety keeps the game from becoming addictive at all. Running, jumping, and weaving your way back and forth through the game's tracks gets old pretty quickly, and the battle mode isn't terribly well done. Graphically, Rayman Arena has a pretty standard look to it. The game runs at a reasonably smooth frame rate throughout all its modes, and the textures are just fine. The character design for Rayman remains unchanged, and the game's other racers fit into the Rayman universe, as well. The course design throws a lot of different looks at you throughout the game, moving from swamps to beaches to pirate ships and back again, but some slightly rounder edges would have added a bit more of an outdoorsy, organic feel that is missing from the game. The game's sound effects aren't very pronounced. Each character has a line or so of selection dialogue that plays in the game's front end. From there, the only sounds are cartoonlike effects that properly convey, say, your racer getting smashed by a rogue tentacle or getting zapped by an electric wall. The music does a decent job of fitting in with the rest of the game's look and feel, but it doesn't stand out. Fans of the few other foot-racing games that have been released over the years, such as Mad Dash Racing, Running Wild, or Sonic R, will find that Rayman Arena fits in nicely with these games. But the game doesn't really do anything to differentiate itself from these older foot-racing games and doesn't bring anything new to the table. Anyone looking for an exciting mascot racing game won't find too much to like here once the thrill of four-player multiplayer has worn off."}
