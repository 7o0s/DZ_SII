That is the question basketball coaches, at all levels, face when considering the primary strategy for their teams. On the one hand, coaches can build a team like the San Antonio Spurs, with a focus on defense, rebounding, and methodical team play. On the other hand, a coach can opt to mold his players into a flashy team like the Sacramento Kings, who specialize in fast-break basketball. In creating the PlayStation 2 version of NBA ShootOut 2001, it is very evident that Sony's 989 Sports division decided to create a gameplay system that leans heavily toward the arcade-style up and down game. ShootOut 2001 on the PS2 is the Sacramento Kings of video game basketball, and that metaphor even extends to its cover athlete, Kings forward Chris Webber.The gameplay system in NBA ShootOut 2001 generally coaxes the player into fast-break basketball. Although play-calling options are available in the game, success in ShootOut 2001 is best achieved by taking the ball to the hole or simply pulling up for a three pointer. The gameplay is slightly unbalanced--scoring is usually a breeze, but playing hard-nosed defense is very difficult. The game brings back the auto-defend system to compensate for the lack of true defensive controls, but the general lack of control while using the system can be frustrating. However, as mentioned, ShootOut 2001 features a rewarding and intuitive offensive gameplay system. There are several dribble moves, including a one-handed fake crossover, and more than 50 signature dunks. The dunk and dribble-drive animations in particular are extremely smooth and fluid, and they look very realistic.There are some specific gameplay quirks, however, that detract from the strong offense-oriented play dynamics. The most glaring of these flaws is the unimpressive AI. Computer-controlled players at times run around like chickens with their heads cut off, with no sense of purpose or direction. For example, a computer player will grab the offensive rebound right under the basket and pass it out to the perimeter instead of taking it up strong. In other instances, players will have wide-open jumpers and pass them up in favor of an ill-fated pass or drive to the basket. Players frequently stand out of bounds and fail to box out, and big men hardly ever post up of their own accord. Illogical AI routines like this, although not prevalent, are noticeable in ShootOut 2001.The game's features set effortlessly meets the most basic expectations, but it is mostly utilitarian. The basic modes of play, such as exhibition, season, and playoffs, are readily available, but peripheral modes such as the one-on-one street mode found in EA Sports' NBA Live 2001 or even a franchise mode are missing from the game. Naturally, this limits the game's overall value and longevity, as the available modes of play can become repetitive after some time. ShootOut initially held our attention with its fast-paced gameplay--particularly in multiplayer games--but there aren't enough options in the game to present you with a lengthy single-player experience.Visually, the smooth animation and the 60fps game speed stand out. Players wind up and throw down monster dunks, and speedy guards show head and shoulder fakes when breaking down an opponent. The player models are solid, with true-to-life facial textures that compare favorably with the textures in EA's PlayStation 2 version of NBA Live 2001--players such as Brian Grant and Shaquille O'Neal are easily recognizable. One minor problem we noticed with the player models is their slumped posture. They run around with their heads down, particularly when dribbling the basketball. For those who remember his style, it's almost like a court full of Clyde Drexlers running around. The soundtrack in NBA ShootOut 2001 is extremely straightforward, with only a few tracks looping repeatedly during menu navigation. However, the lead track--Eric B & Rakim's I Ain't No Joke--is outstanding, and it's relevant enough to hold together an otherwise halfhearted musical presentation. In contrast, the sound effects are more robust, and they're attuned with the on-court action. The crowd noise fluctuates in tune with specific in-game situations, players call out plays, sneakers squeak on the polished hardwood, and arena music blares after spectacular plays. Real-life hoops announcer Ian Eagle handles the commentary in ShootOut 2001. Eagle's announcing is generally precise, and he interjects color commentary and historical facts that are specific to the teams involved in order to spice up the play-by-play. But after a few games, phrases and specific references begin to repeat. The two NBA basketball games available for the PlayStation 2 present very different styles of gameplay. NBA Live 2001 from Electronic Arts generally coaxes the player into a more methodical game, where back picks and pick-and-rolls are used frequently. NBA ShootOut 2001 typically presents a more arcade-style up and down game. Of course, half-court sets and ball rotation can be executed in ShootOut, but in the end, it's easier to just take the ball to the hole for a dunk. This inherently makes ShootOut an enjoyable multiplayer basketball game, but hoops purists might find the lack of strategic play a bit disappointing.Visually, the smooth animation and the 60fps game speed stand out.
