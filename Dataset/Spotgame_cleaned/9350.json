You won't find an incredibly realistic half-court game in this latest NBA Live, but you will find a lot of run-and-gun-style offense with plenty of fast breaks, dunks, fancy passing, and cuts through the lane. Even the post-up game has received a boost in speed, as it only takes a split second to back a defender down underneath the basket. This new style of gameplay is topped off with a new ballhandling control scheme that lets you perform some NBA Street-like moves by using the right analog stick to control the direction of your dribble. It works very well and ultimately helps make NBA Live 2003 a highly enjoyable but slightly unrealistic simulation of NBA basketball. Live 2003 still offers many of the same modes found in previous games in the series. The franchise mode returns in 2003, and while it's not quite as in-depth as the one featured in Sega's NBA 2K3, you still get to perform all the basic functions of an NBA general manager. At the beginning of a season, you can adjust your roster by trading and releasing players and signing free agents. The trading system is similar the one found in previous games in that players are given point values. In putting together a trade proposal, the point value of the players you want to trade for has to be within a certain range, otherwise the computer will reject it. You'll also get to pore over different sets of statistics, including overall team stats, individual player stats, your personal user stats, and the league leaders in different statistical categories. Also included in the franchise mode is a GM's desk option that lets you go behind the scenes to the business side of the NBA. You'll see information on player contracts, injury reports, MVP candidates, player progression, and a list of upcoming free agents. You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos.

The game will also name its All-NBA team, All-Defensive team, and All-Rookie team. While the off-season may be celebration time for some teams, for others, it marks one of the few opportunities to make significant changes. First, you'll see a list of retiring players, so you'll know what holes, if any, you will need to fill via the draft, free agency, or trades. You'll also have to take care of re-signing players if any of them are coming to the end of their contracts and you want to keep them on the team for a few more years. Unfortunately, when you make it to the rookie draft, there really doesn't seem to be enough information to make an educated choice. After completing the draft, you can sign any remaining free agents, make last-minute trades, and then begin a new season. Again, it's not quite as in-depth as NBA 2K3's franchise mode, but it also won't be as intimidating for some, and it seems to fit well with the new gameplay style. The other modes in NBA Live 2003 aren't nearly as involved as the franchise mode. the game features straightforward exhibition, season, and playoff modes, as well as a practice mode that lets you move around the court with a single player. Live 2003 also features a one-on-one mode in which you can select any two players in the league and pit them against each other to see who's better. Whichever mode you select, you'll undoubtedly notice how much faster NBA Live 2003 plays than the games that came before it--or, for that matter, any other five-on-five basketball games currently available. Though there are differences between them, every player on the court is relatively quick even when you're not using the turbo button, making it much easier to execute fast breaks or create a path to the basket. The shooting percentages seem a little out of whack out of times, but not necessarily in the bad sense. With the default settings of the game, it's not unusual to have two or three players on your team hit at least four three-pointers over the span of a single game, and you'll rarely ever miss shots that are within five or so feet of the basket. When you increase the difficulty, the computer will score on almost every trip down the court if you don't keep a defender on each of its players. The passing is surprisingly precise for such a quick game, and like in the older games in the series, it quickly becomes an integral element of play--not only for the purposes of having fun and showing off, but also because it's one of the many methods you can use to break down the defense. Yet, the one thing that truly makes NBA Live 2003 play differently from most other basketball games is the freestyle control. You can score a lot of points on the default difficulty setting. Instead of just going for the basic one-button juke move--or any sort of button-activated juke moves, for that matter--Live 2003 gives you control over ball movement via the right analog stick. If you want to dribble in between your legs behind the three-point line, you simply lightly tap the right analog stick from left to right. Likewise, if you want to perform a sharp crossover when driving up the court, press lightly in one direction on the analog stick then quickly press it back in the opposite direction. This system makes it feel as though you have more control over the player, since the guesswork of context-sensitive juke moves has essentially been removed. Plus, you can create some really spectacular-looking plays that will actually be worth looking at in replays over and over. However, you can be penalized for using these moves, especially when executing them in a crowd of defenders, which often results in a steal. In addition, the freestyle ability really makes the better point guards in the league overpowered, and you'll probably find yourself relying on them more than any other player. Though, since it's obvious this game wasn't meant to play like a true simulation, it's really not that big of a problem. The post-up game still comes in handy when going up against irritating zone defenses, but generally, it really seems to be useful only as a ~last resort~ strategy, which is unfortunate. The post-up game in Live 2003 is quite fun to use, as it lets you back down a defender until he starts to hold his ground and then either put up a jump shot or roll off and drive to the basket. It functions similarly to the system in NBA 2K3, only everything happens much faster. You might think it would be difficult to play defense in a game in which all the players are so quick, but it really isn't. As long as you stay up on an opposing player, or generally stay in his way, cutting off lanes to the basket, you'll be fine. Likewise, defending a man down on the block is equally straightforward as long as you play right up on his back. Shots can frequently be blocked, but doing so usually sends the ball flying out of bounds. Steals are also relatively frequent, since playing the passing lanes usually results in a turnover. So, the defense has been adequately equipped to handle the high-speed offense in the game. As far as online play is concerned, Live 2003 works pretty well. As in Madden, you can enter lobbies in your region and view a list of players and information like win-loss records, drops, and connection quality. There was some noticeable lag in a few games, even on broadband, but as the games progressed, the lag seemed to be less of a problem. Graphically, NBA Live 2003 is a bit unusual, because while the player models are quite detailed--even more detailed than those in NBA 2K3--they aren't necessarily accurate. The details on the faces on bodies are really defined, and secondary details like tattoos are quite visible, but some players look a little too generic, while others look downright odd. In any case, the animation in NBA Live 2003 is excellent, as just about every move, from the freestyle motions to the layups and dunks, is animated incredibly well. There are also some really nice secondary animations such as when a player leaps out of bounds to catch the ball, only to throw it through his legs and back inbounds. All the arenas are accurate, but there's nothing particularly noteworthy about the crowd. It's worth noting that the game maintains a very smooth frame rate throughout and doesn't appear to suffer from noticeable slowdown or choppiness. The new freestyle gameplay mechanic truly gives you more control over the player. NBA Live 2003's audio is probably its weakest point, at least in terms of the commentary. The two-man commentary team gives makes nice comments on the game and repetition is kept to a minimum, but the commentary doesn't really flow throughout the game. There is some good crowd noise, particularly when you're shooting a three--you'll actually hear the crowd yell ~threeee,~ much as they do for the home team in real life. It's too bad that there aren't more sound effects like that in the game. Like in other EA Sports games, the soundtrack consists of licensed music from various artists such as Busta Rhymes and Snoop Dogg, which may or may not interest you. NBA Live 2003 isn't a true simulation by any means. Its fast-paced gameplay resembles something more like an arcade game or the older, 16-bit NBA Live games. However, it retains enough simulation-style elements to appease those craving a realistic game, thus giving NBA Live 2003 a much broader appeal than its direct competitor, NBA 2K3. In the harder difficulty settings, you will have to use the post-up game and work to make sure your player is open before taking the shot. In addition, the great passing game and the new freestyle control should make NBA Live 2003 hard to pass up for any basketball fan.The passing is surprisingly precise for such a quick game, and like in the older games in the series, it quickly becomes an integral element of play--not only for the purposes of having fun and showing off, but also because it's one of the many methods you can use to break down the defense.
