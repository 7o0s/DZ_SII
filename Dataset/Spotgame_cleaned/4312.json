For N64 fighting-game fans who may have missed the first game, the second one definitely deserves a look. However, the game's lack of new graphical gameplay and features make it hard even for fans of the first game to see the difference between the two. The one thing that really sets Fighter Destiny 2 apart from the other N64 fighters is the game's point-scoring system. Instead of simply pummeling opponents with various moves until their life bars have been depleted, the game uses a point-scoring system to determine the winner. Strategies vary in point value; for example, knockdowns are worth more points than ringouts. The scoring system makes playing the game a bit more interesting than most fighting games, since it allows players to employ different strategies for earning points, which varies the gameplay. For instance, some players may try to accumulate points by going for easy one-point ringouts, while others may go for more points all at once by taking their opponents down with a riskier throw.The game features a standard fighting-game mode that allows you to go through the game, beating opponent after opponent. There is also a Tekken-styled training mode that lets you see and attempt to master each character's moves. The game even has an odd but entertaining board-game mode in which you compete with others. The objective here is to complete the challenges you land on to advance.Graphically, Fighter Destiny 2 is a decent-looking fighting game. The fighter models seem somewhat detailed and vaguely realistic. The nondescript arenas and fighting platforms are adequate. Fans of the first Fighters Destiny will undoubtedly notice that the graphics haven't changed a bit. In fact, aside from the game's interface and a few of the special effects when fighters are struck, the games look very similar. The sequel's sound hasn't changed much either. The game still has the same various grunts and thuds from the first game that don't sound very real but seem to fit the game rather well.In the end, Fighter Destiny 2 is incredibly similar to the original - so much so that even fans of the first game will be let down by the sequel's identical graphics, gameplay, and overall lack of innovation. For those of you who are interested in Fighter Destiny 2 and haven't played the original, pick up a used copy of Fighters Destiny first."}
