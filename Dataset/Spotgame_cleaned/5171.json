It's a decent freshman effort, but a lack of gameplay details and multiplayer features and substandard visuals limit the game's appeal to die-hard MLB fans only.High Heat 2002 bears both the MLB and MLBPA licenses, which translates into 30 actual MLB teams and stadiums, including more than 600 major-league players and their accompanying statistics. The inclusion of real stadiums is a bit half-hearted, however, as a loathsome design shortcut limits true-to-life stadium views to the batting interface only--the above-field camera is merely a single cookie-cutter stadium. There are practice, exhibition, season, home run derby, and playoff game modes, and the game features a battery backup to track statistics and season progress.In terms of actual gameplay, High Heat is above average, but it's not without its shortfalls and quirks. The pitching interface is a decent mix of a pitch indicator and an onscreen aiming cursor, all controlled with the D-pad and the A button. Expert pitchers have a wider array of pitch choices and aiming range. Oddly, you can't throw bean balls. Automatic fielding is enabled by default, but it can be disabled in the options menu. Unlike in the Dreamcast version of World Series Baseball 2K1, the automatic fielding in High Heat 2002 for the GBA is an aid and not a hindrance. The game even utilizes proper relay mechanics. Fielder positioning is also adjustable via the in-game pause menu. Batting and multiplayer features are the two areas where High Heat 2002 shows its limitations. Watching the fluidly animated character sprites step up to the plate and go through their gesticulations is nice, but the situation is rendered moot when you can only swing for power and neither aim your swing nor focus on a base hit. At least you can bunt or call for a steal. However, what good is any of this when you can't play against your friends? High Heat Major League Baseball 2002 is a single-player game only. There are no link options of any kind.Until the next iteration, High Heat Major League Baseball 2002 is a decent foray into handheld baseball. The inclusion of umpire speech samples and sharp sound effects solidifies an immersive experience, even if you can't play with friends or entrench yourself in meticulous strategy."}
