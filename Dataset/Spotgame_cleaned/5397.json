What you do in it is eat any fish that's smaller than you are, by guiding your fish around a small area teeming with undersea life--and occasional explosive mines as well as pearl-bearing oysters, for good measure. Power-ups temporarily speed you up and freeze all other fish in place, helping to keep things interesting. The two modes of play let you munch through several dozen stages either against the clock or not. The game's slippery feel fits the setting well, and your fish has a couple of abilities: It can lunge forward or vacuum up anything in front of it at the touch of a mouse button. The game's graphics are simple and colorful, and it's satisfying to watch your fish grow bigger and bigger during the course of one of Feeding Frenzy's brief levels. The chomping noises and upbeat soundtrack fit the game well, and the cartoony look makes this one suitable for Finding Nemo fans of all ages. Feeding Frenzy might not have what it takes to keep you coming back for more, but it provides simple, addictive fun for an hour or two."}
