{"ref": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/red-faction-ii-review/1900-6025499/", "date": "April 22, 2003", "game_name": "Red Faction II", "text": "Filled with the sort of over-the-top violence and cheeky futuristic propaganda seen in Paul Verhoeven's popular sci-fi films Robocop, Total Recall, and Starship Troopers, Red Faction II is a sequel to 2001's popular PS2 first-person shooter. It's got all the stuff that made the previous game a hit: lots of powerful weapons, lots of enemy fodder, and a number of vehicles you can ride in. Unfortunately, it's not difficult to tell that Red Faction II was originally designed for the relatively less powerful PlayStation 2, as this port seems somewhat watered down, with its fairly plain graphics, small levels, and lack of multiplayer support (though you can play mock-multiplayer battles against computer-controlled bots). The game's single-player campaign is also pretty short, but Red Faction II can still offer some good shooting action for fans of the genre. Red Faction II offers up a short but action-packed single-player campaign. Red Faction II takes place in the same universe as the first game: the 22nd century, where humankind is ruled by an evil dictatorship, and only the freedom fighters who call themselves the Red Faction are able to stand in its way. Parker, the hero of the first game, is nowhere to be found here, so no previous Red Faction experience is required or even expected. Instead, this sequel introduces a nanotech-enhanced soldier called Alias, whom you'll play as during the course of the single-player campaign. Alias is part of an elite squad developed to suppress insurgents like the Red Faction, but the squad has turned its coats and now seeks to rid the world of Chancellor Sopot, the man at the root of the Commonwealth's strife and poverty. The plot is pretty thin, and the twist that's thrown in about halfway through seems ridiculous, but at least the story doesn't get in the way of the action. In your mission to assassinate Sopot, and then quell an even greater threat, you'll travel by air, sea, and land while taking on droves of enemies and numerous challenging situations in a diverse and tightly paced series of levels. Most single-player first-person shooters aren't very long, and Red Faction II is no exception. Even though you'll run into several very tough boss battles when playing through the game at the normal difficulty setting, expect to get through the campaign in approximately seven hours. As if to make up for the relatively short length of the campaign, the designers apparently tried to make sure that there's never a dull moment in it. The very first mission has Alias blowing an enemy base to bits using a weapon that fires both rockets and grenades, and things never really let up from there. The flow of the action does slow down on a couple of occasions, such as when you'll be forced to outwit enemy snipers using your own high-powered long-range rifle, but even those sequences are pretty intense. If you've played other sci-fi-themed shooters, you won't find much in Red Faction II that's completely different from what you've seen before, but the game usually hits all the right notes, doesn't get boring, and packs in lots of variety. What looks like a multiplayer mode is actually a single-player botmatch. No human opponents allowed. Much like in the first game, the variety in Red Faction II comes largely from having an occasional in-vehicle sequence to break up all the action on foot. Each of the four vehicles in Red Faction II is remarkably powerful, and they all make for some entertaining shooting sequences. The vehicles aren't simulated with the same level of realism as the vehicles in Halo, but they make up for it to some extent with their toughness and raw firepower. When you're flying high through the air between skyscrapers in the gunship or crashing through war-torn city streets in the tank, the game effectively becomes a rail shooter--you're just the gunner, and your job is to blow up any enemies that get in your way as Shrike, your squad's vehicles expert, steers you through some seriously hostile territory. But when you're in the submarine or the battle armor, you actually get to navigate as well as shoot. All the vehicle sequences are fun while they last, even though they're relatively easy and simple compared with the standard action. You'll especially like the battle armor, which is basically an assault mech bristling with Gatling guns and missiles. You'll take on entire armies in this thing. Then again, you'll take on entire armies on foot, too. Though you'll sometimes fight alongside one or two of your squadmates, you'll usually go at it alone, and a slew of high-powered, over-the-top weapons are available for quickly eliminating enemies individually or in groups. The best of the original Red Faction weapons have returned and are joined by a number of new ones, making for well over a dozen different weapons in all, ranging from deadly small arms to devastating artillery. Speaking of which, as in the first game, in Red Faction II you can use explosive weapons to literally blast through walls. Certain walls, that is. The developers made a really big deal of this with the original game, even though the ability didn't come into play very often. It's put to better use in the sequel, where at times you'll end up making yourself an entryway if you can't find one that suits you. The fact that your character is a demolitions expert certainly justifies all this. Red Faction II features many of the best weapons from the original game, plus some powerful new ones. Explosive or not, just about every weapon of yours has an alternate firing mode or some other special ability. For instance, the rail driver allows you to target and shoot enemies who are on the other side of walls or obstacles. The precision rifle points you to enemies in the vicinity when you're looking through its scope. All this hardware packs a satisfying punch and looks good in action, though the weapon that will likely get the most use is the NICW, an assault rifle with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and a built-in targeting system, evidently modeled after the US military's next-generation objective individual combat weapon. An all-purpose firearm, the NICW can get you through virtually any encounter. You'll appreciate that this and most other weapons in your arsenal are so effective, though you might find it odd that you can carry all the game's weapons simultaneously. Too bad the game doesn't support online play. However, Red Faction II does offer a fully featured botmatch mode, which can be reasonably entertaining for a while. Eight different botmatch game types are available, ranging from standards like deathmatch, team deathmatch, and capture the flag to variants like regime, in which one player is the ~dictator~ and must try to survive as long as possible while all the other players try to bring him or her down. These are all pretty standard multiplayer-style variants, involving either all-out shooting mayhem or goal-oriented, team-based objectives. Not only do Red Faction II's console roots show in its lack of multiplayer support, but its save system, which auto-saves your progress in between short stages, is also held over from the original versions of the game. And while the graphics do look better on the PC than on any of the console counterparts, they aren't exactly state-of-the-art by PC standards. Textures are blurry and plain, and in the instances where the visuals were sharpened up, you'll likely just notice other problems such as the low polygon counts on the characters. The cutscenes still aren't particularly good looking, though the one played when Alias finally catches up to Sopot is memorable. At least the game loads quickly and runs smoothly. The original game's settings mostly consisted of bland tunnels and sterile laboratories, while the sequel's rundown urban environments and sophisticated military installations tend to be a little more colorful. Enemy characters are brought to life using motion-captured animations, and not only do these animations look good, but you also won't notice much repetition in them as you keep shooting down bad guys. The weapon models are diverse and appear appropriately hefty and high tech. The game also sports some pretty nice explosions--as well it should, for a game starring a demolitions expert. Plus, the vehicles are portrayed convincingly. You won't be playing this game for weeks, but it's fun while it lasts. Red Faction II's audio holds up better than the graphics in translation. Though the cries of enemy soldiers repeat a bit too often, and some of their lines are pointlessly profane, the sounds of all your various weapons and explosions are loud, clear, and effective. A high-tempo electronic music score pumps in the background beneath the near-constant roar of your firearms and helps maintain the game's high intensity level. The quality of the voice acting is mostly good, with the highlight being Molov, the squad leader of Alias' unit, who is voiced by Lance Henriksen (Aliens). Red Faction II is a pretty good shooter overall, offering up a short but sweet single-player campaign and a decent botmatch mode for a little extra lasting value. The game's not long on looks or replay value (especially since it has no multiplayer play), but it's got no shortage of action. Then again, you'll take on entire armies on foot, too.
