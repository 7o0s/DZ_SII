You control Flo, a newcomer to the service industry, and you have to help her single-handedly wait on all the tables in her new restaurant. This means you have to seat customers, take their orders, serve them their food, get them their checks, and bus their tables for the next group. All of these activities are driven with a simple point-and-click interface that will send Flo scurrying from table to kitchen to dirty dish bin and back again--hopefully before the customers get mad and leave. As you play through the game, you'll learn how to chain actions together, seat customers according to the color of their clothes for extra multipliers, distract them with music and chitchat, and quell their anger with coffee and tiki drinks. Before too long, you'll also start encountering different types of customers, like college students and senior citizens, who have different levels of patience and generosity. This great-looking game will soon have you obsessed over increasing the efficiency of your restaurant. It's a great purchase all the way around."}
