In Zuma, these masters of the ~match three~ genre have crafted the perfect blend of strategy, action, and precision. Instead of the usual grid of blocks, you're attacking advancing chains of colored balls, which snake all over the Mesoamerican-themed levels toward a sacred gold head. You have to destroy the chains by shooting balls out of a rotating stone frog, which is otherwise stationary. As you eliminate groups of three or more like-colored balls, you can cause the chain to contract and set off chain reactions, producing bonuses and power-ups. There are now many Zuma imitators, but none are as good as the original, which is definitely worth $20."}
