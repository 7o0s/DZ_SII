So why should SNK's portable system be any different? While many of the character graphics here are the same as King of Fighters R-2's, the gameplay and character roster emulate the style and selection of Real Bout Fatal Fury 2.The game tries hard to play like Real Bout 2, and it pulls it off pretty well. The mid-air turnaround move is intact, as is the three-stage power meter. It even has the big, drawn out ~get in the ring~ display between matches. But the character roster has been chopped down quite a bit. Still the character selection is nice, and represents enough of the different Fatal Fury fighters, including Terry, Andy, Rick, and Billy Kane.Unlike King of Fighters R-2, which was a powerhouse of options, Fatal Fury: First Contact has two options - one player and two player link play. A couple of hidden characters give the game some replay value, but the game really falls flat when compared to the extras in KOF R-2 and Samurai Shodown 2.The game has great graphics, and it manages to do a good Real Bout 2 impression, but if you're only going to get one NGPC fighting game with Terry Bogard in it, make it KOF R-2."}
