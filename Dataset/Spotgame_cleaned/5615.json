In fact, other than the obligatory roster update and the inclusion of a link mode, you'd be hard-pressed to notice further improvements.The game offers more than 600 MLB players, all 30 teams, and plenty of accompanying statistics. The rosters are current as of spring training, and they include a few minor league prospects. The batting-pitching interface re-creates every Major League ballpark with immaculate detail, but the fielding viewpoint is limited to a single generic stadium that varies only to the extent of different mottling on the grass. Like the last release, the game features five main gameplay modes: practice, exhibition, season, playoff, and home run derby. A battery backup keeps track of statistics and season progress. In contrast to their console cousins, which are primarily baseball simulators, the GBA ports of High Heat focus more on the action of baseball than the mechanics. A pitching indicator lets you choose various pitches relative to the hurler's actual repertoire, while a moving cursor provides pinpoint aiming. The 2003 version includes bean balls, so you need to be careful while working the inside corner. At the plate, you can only bunt or swing, as there aren't any check swings or adjustments for power cuts or pulling the ball. Fielding can be set to manual or automatic. Despite the lack of micromanagement, the ratio of groundouts to fly balls is remarkably accurate, and minor touches--like outfield-to-infield relays--add to the game's authenticity. The real criticisms that can be leveled at High Heat 2003 involve its visuals. Players in the batting screen are painfully small, making it difficult to time a swing or gauge the arc of a pitch. The on-field viewpoint takes this miniaturization even further, shrinking the character models to the size of army ants. Compared with the graphics of Sega's Baseball Advance--which has large character sprites and colorful stadiums--High Heat Major League Baseball 2003's visuals are severely lacking. Nevertheless, the sheer fluidity of player animation is impossible to ignore. Big names, like Barry Bonds and Ichiro Suzuki, step to the plate with a swagger that is incredibly human. The game's sound fits with its understated approach, as umpire calls and contact hits are sharp, but the stadiums themselves are eerily silent. Finally, the inclusion of a link option also offers something Sega's product doesn't: the ability to challenge your friends to some one-on-one hardball.The High Heat Major League Baseball series is aging fast, but the 2003 GBA iteration--largely due to its two-player mode--is still a decent baseball game."}
