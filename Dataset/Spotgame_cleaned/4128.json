Updated for 3DS, the leisurely pace of Poochy and Yoshis Woolly World feels right at home on a handheld. Its the superior of the two versions and still works best when you're scavenging for collectibles, though it also has the same balance pitfalls.Poochy and Yoshis Woolly World includes all 48 stages from the Wii U version and adds extras, including special Poochy levels and an updated version of the originals easier Mellow Mode. The standard levels still play well, and the lack of a level timer or lives to lose makes more sense on 3DS, where stop-and-start use is more common. Effortlessly (and adorably) hopping through a single level when you only have a few minutes to spare is a little more satisfying than running through several at a time, and of course, stopping to track down even the most hidden of items when you have more time to spare is still just as rewarding.Though some of the platforming may seem basic for veterans, there are levels that really stand out, like an early Egypt-themed level that expands puzzle-solving beyond collectibles and into the platforming. But Woolly World also has its fair share of levels that dont require quick thinking or much work at all.Woolly World isnt boring, though, thanks to its relaxed pace and charm. Its a good source of laid-back fun in the midst of intense stress, and its lovingly executed yarn theme is adorable. Theres something delightful about Yarn Yoshi eating a yarn enemy and turning it into a yarn projectile--which would normally not be a particularly pleasant idea--or being able to gobble up yarn fire and repurpose it. Even though quite a few levels are a breeze, theres at least something cute to zero in on.Many Nintendo games strive for accessibility--providing challenges that the player can opt into, choosing just how difficult or deep they want the experience to be. Woolly World does that to an extent, but theres often a noticeable disparity between casually running through a level and aiming for completion. Theres not really a middle lane of difficulty for more experienced players who want a challenge without having to seek out the most well-hidden items. Some of that is remedied by the move to 3DS, and some of it is made better by an expanded version of the originals optional Mellow Mode.Poochy and Yoshis Woolly World feels right at home on a handheld. Its the superior of the two versions and still works best when you're scavenging for collectibles.Despite the name, Mellow Mode doesnt necessarily make Woolly World unbearably easy--though it does keep it accessible for younger or more inexperienced players. Like in the original, switching to Mellow Mode gives Yoshi wings that allow you to float indefinitely, which of course makes it easier to survive (though its not guaranteed). On 3DS, Mellow Mode also comes with a few Poochy pups to help sniff out secrets. It essentially bridges the difficulty gap, making platforming and collecting more harmonious. And, since it can be switched on and off in the middle of a level, you can use it sparingly if youre looking for just a little bit of an edge.And you shouldnt rely on Poochy too much, because Woolly World really wouldnt be worth playing without the fun of searching for all its collectibles. There are five flowers and five spools of yarn on each level, and some are almost cruelly hidden. If youre dedicated, you could potentially spend a lot more time in Yoshis yarn world, taking half an hour even on earlier levels to find everything. Getting them all unlocks much harder levels, as well as some adorable Yoshi skins--and its rewarding to figure out the tricks and maneuvers you need to find them.For faster-paced platforming, Poochy and Yoshis Woolly World has a new addition starring its namesake. Its an endless runner-style set of bonus levels, and while not punishing, mastering the timing of jumps and Poochys signature slide is a different kind of challenge. Its a welcome change of pace and a valuable addition for the 3DS version, making up for the lack of multiplayer by providing a good single-player diversion.That said, its not a reason to buy the 3DS version if youve already played the Wii U one, and the extras dont really give it much of an edge when the best part of the experience was there all along.Though the gulf between two very different difficulties is not fully fixed by its additions, from the updated Mellow Mode to the extra Poochy levels, Poochy and Yoshis Woolly World gives you what you put in--it can either be almost frustratingly hard for a determined collector or a good fit for someone whos just looking for a fun, relaxing few hours of platforming."}
