While the names may differ depending on location and year, the games have always been easy to pick up and play and hard to put down. Virtua Tennis 3 is a great game that holds true to that winning formula. There are some new minigames, and the career mode has been fleshed out, but it's clear that the developers were focused on refining the gameplay rather than reinventing it. The create-a-player option lets you make some far-out and groovy players. You need a javascript enabled browser to watch videos. Want us to remember this setting for all your devices?

You start by creating a male or female player using the game's character editor, which doesn't hold a candle to the one found in Tiger Woods but still gets the job done. After you select a spot on the globe for your home, it's time to start on your 20-year quest to go from the 300th-ranked player to the top-ranked player in the world. But you can't just rush out and take the top spot; you'll need to start by training your player. This can be done by going to tennis school or by playing minigames. Going to tennis school is a great way to learn the basics while at the same time leveling up your player. Here you're given a task, such as to hit a maximum-power forehand or finish a point with a smash. If you can do the task three times in the given time limit, the skills that you used in the test will be increased. Tennis school is fun, but not as much fun as the minigames, which, as always, are fantastic. Each minigame focuses on one of four aspects of your game: ground stroke, serve, volley, and footwork. A few games return, but most are slight variations or altogether new. Avalanche has you collect fruit and dodge large tennis balls that roll out of the back of a dump truck. In Drum Topple, you try and knock over stacked oil drums by hitting ground strokes. Prize Defender places you in front of a table filled with prizes, and you must protect the items by volleying away shots from the ball machines. In Pin Crusher, you try and knock down bowling pins with your serve. Each of the minigames starts easy, but as you get better, the games get more difficult. They're pretty punishing on the highest levels, but you can always choose a lower difficulty setting. This yields fewer points, but it keeps the game from being frustrating. If you really love the minigames or want to play them with your friends, a handful of them can be played with up to four players on the same console. Once you've got the basics down, it's time to start chipping away at that number-one ranking. You do this by entering the singles and doubles tournaments that are open to newcomers. Tournaments take place in locations such as Spain, China, France, England, USA, Australia, Germany, Italy, and more. You'll play day and night, as well as indoors and out on clay, grass, and hard courts. To win the early matches, you've got to take just two short games, but the matches get longer as the tournaments get more prestigious. One quirk from previous games that holds true here is rather than complementing the roster of real players with fictitious players, you'll be playing the same handful of real-life players over and over again. You might play and beat the tar out of Roger Federer your first match, which kind of takes the mystique out of facing one of the greatest players of all time. Your stamina decreases as you train and play tournaments. If there's a tournament you don't want to miss, you can replenish your stamina with an energy drink and not lose any time, but this increases your risk of injury. To avoid injury, it's important to occasionally take a week off at home, or even go on a three-week vacation every now and then. Injuries are most prevalent when your stamina is low, but they can strike at any time. Unfortunately, there isn't much to injuries. They occur while you're in the main menu--you don't get hurt during matches. The game tells you that you're hurt and for how long, and the game simply skips ahead. You get e-mail from your coach, who will give you tips, read you fan mail, and award you items. Other players will periodically ask you to practice with them or, in a really awkward cutscene, encourage you or talk smack. There's also no money system, and you're awarded items based on your play. This feels like a step back because there isn't much in the way of items, and it was always fun to spend, like, a thousand dollars on some wrist bands. All great players get started by picking up fruit and avoiding giant balls. Tennis school, minigames, and e-mail--it's all secondary to the action on the court, which is excellent in Virtua Tennis 3. The game is fast-paced and arcadelike. It's a breeze to play, thanks to controls that are simple yet allow for a wide variety of shots. You can even tilt the PlayStation 3's Sixaxis controller to move your player around, but playing like this just makes the game more difficult. There are just three shot buttons, but depending on your location on the court, you can hit a top-spin shot, a slice, a drop shot, a volley, a slam, or a lob with ease. The earlier you get into position to hit the ball and press the shot button, the harder your shot will be. Serving is as simple as tapping a button to start the serve and then tapping it again when you've reached the desired level of power. You can aim your serve and your shots by pressing the analog stick or D pad as you hit the ball. Players move quickly and will automatically dive for balls out of their reach, and they rarely hit the ball out of bounds or into the net. Even though the controls are simple, there are many different ways to play. How you play the game is dependent on not only your skill, but also your opponent's skill and the type of court you're playing on. You'll see players stick to the baseline and trade forehand blasts, while some players will employ the serve-and-volley technique. The early matches are typically pretty quick, but as you get further into the game, the points grow longer. Even then, though, there's plenty of action. This may be the most refined version of Virtua Tennis yet, but there are still some minor issues that keep the gameplay from being truly superb. Lobs are almost completely ineffective against CPU-controlled players, who get to nearly any ball lobbed over their head and will slam it right back with ease. This makes anyone who uses serve-and-volley tactics extremely difficult to beat. Volleying is inconsistent, too. Sometimes you're able to volley with authority, but other times you'll be standing at the net ready to put away a ball that's right at your racket, but your player will hit a soft shot that gives your opponent plenty of time to recover. It can also be difficult to position your player properly before a shot. Sometimes you'll hit the ball when it's too low to the ground, and other times you'll be just a hair too far away and hit a weak running shot, or worse, dive for a ball you could have easily gotten to. But these are exceptions to what is, for the most part, outstanding gameplay. The Xbox 360 and PS3 versions are nearly identical, but the Xbox 360 version is easily the better of the two, since the PS3 version doesn't have online play. For the first time in the series, you can bring your created player online or use one of the pros and play ranked or unranked matches, and you can even set up your own online tournaments. The game is a blast to play online, and what's more, it runs smoothly without any significant lag. Using the VT TV feature, you can watch live matches and even view the day's top plays. The achievement points are spread out over tasks such as winning tournaments, running certain distances, achieving the top ranking, and playing online. Virtua Tennis 3 plays as good as it looks, especially in 1080p, which looks crystal clear and doesn't tax the frame rate at all. Player models are very detailed, and despite a few exceptions (like a rough-on-the-eyes Maria Sharapova), look like their real-life counterparts. Players move realistically, as well, and they have different-looking strokes. You'll even notice little things like players sliding a bit when they try to change directions too quickly. The courts are filled with fans and look fantastic, though you'll probably be too busy playing to notice small details like how the ball leaves a mark on clay courts or how ball boys move their heads ever so slightly to follow the path of the ball. One thing that's a bit disappointing is that there's still no user-controlled instant replay; you're at the mercy of the game (and some lousy camera angles) if you want to relive a great shot. It's also curious that you can't always play in the near court and are forced to sometimes play up top, which is slightly more difficult thanks to the camera angle. All of the courts look great. If you've ever played a Virtua Tennis game before, you've got a pretty good idea of how this iteration sounds. Cheesy guitar rock plays during the menus and matches; some people will love it, others will loathe it. Sound effects are spot-on, though some of the player grunting and yelling is a bit obnoxious. The crowds react appropriately to what's happening on the court, and there are PA announcers that give the score in their countries' native tongue, which is a nice touch. Although Virtua Tennis 3 doesn't feel vastly different from its predecessor it has been such a long time since the last release that the tweaks and additions go a long way toward making the game feel fresh. There are many ways to stay occupied, and it's easy to pick up and play. If you're trying to decide between the PS3 and 360 versions of the game, the 360 is easily the better choice thanks to online play."}
