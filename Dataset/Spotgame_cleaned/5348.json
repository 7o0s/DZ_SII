What more is there to say? Tekken 2 rules! The undeniable king of fighting games is here, and it's time to break bones and necks - not to mention the controller after Angel Kazuya toasts you alive with her eye laser. This sequel features a variety of new moves, characters, backgrounds, and other improvements. Characters are more detailed, and Namco has imbued them with new features, like head movement. In addition to having twice as many moves, combos, and throws, most characters also now have at least three different ten-string combos. In addition to the original selection of moves, ~counter throws~ have been added, allowing a few of the characters to grab an inbound punch or kick and perform a defensive throw. The most noticeable enhancement however, is the light sourcing - the Playstation can seemingly make light appear from anywhere during the battle. The game has 25 playable fighters who ALL have endings (when you first begin the game only ten playable fighters are available, but for every time you beat the game you receive a new playable character). If you like fighting games at all, you will love Tekken 2. The graphics and fluid character movement will astound and amaze. The simple control format allows inexperienced players to begin play immediately with minimal effort, and will keep the interest of expert players for months - thanks to the game's complex system of moves and combos. Tekken 2 gives you more than your money's worth."}
