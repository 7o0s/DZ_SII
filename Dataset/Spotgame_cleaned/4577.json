{"ref": "https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/jewel-quest-review/1900-6127233/", "date": "June 30, 2005", "game_name": "Jewel Quest", "text": "If Professor Indiana Jones were to play a mobile puzzle game, it would probably be Jewel Quest, which was originally an Internet game from iWin that has been distributed by many online portals, including Yahoo! This isn't a huge associative leap, because the game is set in an Amazonian temple, and it uses Indy's famous font on its splash screen. Like Elimimatch, Jewel Quest asks players to make groups of three or more of the same shape to clear items from the screen. The twist is that, with Jewel Quest, you must create rows on each space on the grid before time runs out. This variation doesn't meaningfully differentiate Jewel Quest from other games of its type, however. The LG MM-535 could have handled some more sound effects. The game is controlled by a cursor with which players can swap one item for an adjacent item on the grid. Each move must result in the creation of a row of at least three pieces of the same type. The matched icons will disappear and be replaced by an apparently infinite supply above the puzzle screen. Sometimes one move will cause the disappearance of multiple icon groups; however, this is usually an accident. The structure of the game makes planning these chain reactions difficult. Instead, you'll end up playing this much the way you would any Elimimatch-style game. Jewel Quest's jungle-ruins motif is consistent throughout the interface, right down to your carved stone cursor. Graphics aren't all that important to a simple puzzle game, but some cooler block-elimination animations would have been welcome on the LG MM-535. Furthermore, the game's single-group-clearing sound effect is insufficient. Gone are the animal sounds of the Internet version. If you're looking to swap around some blocks, Jewel Quest will suit your needs as well as myriad games of the same type. If you've played an Elimimatch game before, however, there's no reason to try Jewel Quest."}
