After a disappointing showing last year, THQ's long-running SmackDown vs. Raw series has returned to the ring, having spent the year slimming down and focusing on its core strengths. The work has paid off: A lot of extraneous elements have been removed, the creation toolset is better than ever, and there are two new single-player modes that complement the multiplayer fun nicely. Though it's still hampered by a number of lingering issues, WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 manages to recapture some of the glory of its younger years. Hint: Don't let the muscle-bound man with 'The Animal' written across his briefs get on top of you. The most notable improvements are in the single-player realm. The lackluster 24/7 mode has been ditched in favor of a lengthy Career mode and the scripted Road to Wrestlemania. In the Career mode, you choose a superstar (existing or created) and enter a bracket to make a bid for the title belt. Each bracket has five opponents, including the current champion, and you'll have to earn stars by winning matches to get a shot at the title. You win up to five stars for each match by earning points in three areas: match results, technical, and excitement. These categories encourage you to get into the WWE superstar mindset by rewarding you for both pummeling and mocking your opponent. At the end of each match, your attributes will increase, and your health will replenish automatically based on how the match went--no micromanagement here. You'll also earn amusing awards for things such as striking your opponent 35 times or breaking a barbed-wire-wrapped plank over his or her back. It takes only a handful of successful matches to earn you a title shot, which is great because it keeps your career moving along at a good clip. This action-packed Career mode is the perfect complement to the Create a Superstar mode, and winning belt after belt as you bulk up your created character is satisfying and fun. The other single-player mode, Road to Wrestlemania, features six unique story arcs that let you play as various WWE superstars (including Chris Jericho and Triple H) and defeat numerous foes (and a few nemeses) on your quest for Wrestlemania glory. Matches are interspersed with story scenes packed with typical WWE action and voiced by actual WWE superstars, so fans of outrageous melodrama will be pleased. In keeping with traditional SmackDown vs. Raw strengths, the superstar models and entrances are excellent. Although the character animations are good (despite occasional clipping problems), the wrestlers still lack fluidity when maneuvering around the ring. This feels like a result of staying too true to the source material; though WWE wrestlers do often move slowly, it's not very exciting to actually plod around the ring in a video game. The muted audio only further detracts from the excitement factor. It dampens the supposedly hard-hitting action, and though the once-dismal announcers from years past have been improved, the sound design is in serious need of a shot in the arm. Despite how it may sound, the action is indeed hard-hitting. It's easy to perform powerful moves using the analog stick and a few buttons, and the breadth of things you can do in and out of the ring is impressive. From removing the turnbuckle cover to slamming your opponent through a burning table, there's no shortage of satisfying ways to deal damage. Specific match types have their own nasty additions, from rubbing your opponent's face against the elimination chamber to the powerful hot tag, which allows a tag team partner to build up momentum so that, when tagged in, he or she will get the quick-time chance to unleash two unblockable attacks followed by a finisher. Enabling such a wide variety of moves is one of SmackDown vs. Raw 2009's chief strengths. Like previous games in the series, it too relies on relative position to increase your repertoire, and your wrestler is still prone to miscues as a result. However, missing a move because you aren't quite in the correct position is less frustrating than missing one because your opponent is in an uninterruptible animation. This usually crops up in matches with three or more players when one player is performing a move on another. In these realistic-to-a-fault situations, you get a good feeling for just how exciting it is to stand passively aside while other wrestlers battle it out. Six-man matches can get pretty hectic. In addition to the Career and Road to Wrestlemania modes, the competent AI and unique wrestler abilities make playing single-player much more appealing in SmackDown vs. Raw 2009. No longer content to stand around drooling, computer opponents will actively attack you, tag their partners (you included), and use environmental elements reasonably well. Though the Road to Wrestlemania and early stages of the Career mode will seem easy to experienced players, it won't feel like you're playing against brainless apes. Last year's fighting-style system has been removed, and in its place are unique wrestler abilities that existing superstars have and created superstars can earn. The effects range from attribute boosts (the ability to remove your belt in a ladder match more quickly) to enhanced abilities (the ability to regenerate a small amount of health). Although these abilities aren't particularly powerful, they can come in handy during tight matches. Of course, SmackDown vs. Raw wouldn't be SmackDown vs. Raw without the still-impressive Create a Superstar tool. Once again, with a little time and a lot of patience (this mode is hampered by juddering slowdowns), you can create almost anyone you like, from famous celebrities to hideous abominations. You can then customize your character's move set to craft a fighting style, choreograph your ring entrance, and even create a finisher to decide how he or she (or it) will finish off opponents. The Create a Finisher tool lets you choose from a huge list of move parts and chain up to 10 of them together to create a finisher as quick and brutal or as long and painful as you want. You'll get a constantly updating preview of the move while you design it so you can easily tweak it to your liking. It's fun to experiment with all of the different move combinations, and this feature rounds off a formidable suite of customization tools. WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 benefits greatly by restraining its scope. You can still edit rosters in Career mode, but other than that, the menu-heavy GM mode has been fully dropped. The result is a game completely focused on action and on letting you customize and enjoy that action. Although some elements still need improvement, SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 is ultimately successful because it embraces the dramatic fights and outrageous showmanship that are the heart and soul of the WWE."}
