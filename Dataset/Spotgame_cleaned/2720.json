Frogger Advance: The Great Quest for the Game Boy Advance is the latest addition to the family. Yet gamers expecting an updated look at the classic game will probably find themselves a little confused by this game, as it bears virtually no resemblance whatsoever to the game that made ~Frogger~ a household name. In practice, the game has more in common with the Donkey Kong Country series than anything else. This 2D side-scrolling platformer is clearly aimed at a young audience--it features bright, colorful graphics, a control scheme that is easy to pick up, and a cast of characters that would be right at home on any Saturday morning cartoon. Unfortunately, in addition to this, the game offers very little challenge, even for younger gamers. At the same time, however, it manages to be entertaining just because of its lighthearted theme. If you are a fan of this type of game, or looking for a good game for a younger gamer with a GBA, Frogger Advance is a solid choice, although it does end rather quickly. Those looking for the Frogger they grew up with should probably look somewhere else."}
