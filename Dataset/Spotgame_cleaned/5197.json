Although similar to its predecessors in many ways, including story and gameplay elements, Sphinx for mobile has control problems and a long-term lack of gameplay variation, which undermine the value of the entire game. Fans of the franchise might get a kick out of controlling the sphinx and the mummy on their phone, but unless you have a special affinity for the license, your enjoyment of it is not guaranteed. The sphinx and the mummy are cuter than they are effective. During the game, you will control both the sphinx and the recently mummified Tutankhamen. Although the pair work together to cleanse the city of Uruk and defeat the evil lord Set, their methods are different, so as you switch back and forth between them, the gameplay will vary slightly. The sphinx has offensive capabilities, including both sword and dart attacks. The majority of sphinx levels involve killing all of the enemies in a room and making your way over to the exit that opens as a result. The mummy, on the other hand, can't do much at all, but since he's cursed, he's incapable of being physically harmed. This means that you're most often lighting the mummy on fire or electrocuting him, and using the fire or electricity to open up certain level puzzles. The dynamic works quite well, although unfortunately, after you play through the game for some time, the mechanics get tiresome. Ultimately, as either the sphinx or the mummy, you're simply walking around the entire level space, looking to clear it of either puzzles or enemies in order to move on. This would be fine if the controls weren't so uncomfortable. The view is not only isometric but at a 45-degree angle, meaning that the controls are Q-Bert style; pressing up, for instance, moves the character to the northeast. This takes quite a bit of getting used to, especially since the main attack button is on the number pad. Once you've crisscrossed your hands sufficiently and spent some time getting acclimated to the controls, you might be able to work with them, but they really shouldn't be an obstacle that you have to get around in the first place. This is particularly true because of how important movement is to the gameplay. The mummy's sequences are entirely dependent on moving around to solve puzzles since he's incapable of attacking enemies, and the sphinx's sequences involve lots of moving and fighting at the same time. In the end, it's not evident that the gameplay is compelling to the point that it makes putting up with the control scheme worthwhile. Otherwise Sphinx does a good job of maintaining the look and personality of the franchise on the LG VX7000. There's the same sort of cute banter between characters that dictates where you're supposed to be heading and what kind of help you're providing. The game also looks quite a bit like the console version, albeit on a smaller scale. In fact, the graphics are pretty good, although there are a few moments when the graphics, on moving platforms for example, don't seem to line up with the collision perfectly. It doesn't damage the gameplay much, but it does make it seem a little sloppier. The sound effects are sufficient but not that interesting. The sound that the game makes when you dispose of enemies gets quite repetitive after a few bouts in the sphinx portions of the game. The curse of this game's control scheme is truly terrifying. Sphinx is also quite linear. You clear a few levels, and if you get at least 100 collectible scarabs from enemies and breakable objects, then you'll unlock a hidden level after each of the main sections. If you get 200 scarabs (100 as each character), then you'll get bonuses such as an increased life meter and additional lives to work with. In these hidden levels you can find the artifacts necessary to undo the curse of the mummy and set Tutankhamen back to his normal self again. The game definitely has some character in many respects, but the gameplay doesn't have great longevity, and the controls really hamper its accessibility. If you can get past the control scheme and would enjoy a simple little action game, or are a particular fan of the franchise, then you might be the right audience for this game. Otherwise, you'll probably be more frustrated than satisfied by the type of gameplay Sphinx has to offer."}
