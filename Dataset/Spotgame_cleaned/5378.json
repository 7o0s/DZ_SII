Konami has, in fact, added many new features to the game, adding many new courses, a large group of selectable characters, several ~action mode~ races, and a trick system and weapons to wield at the competition. In short, the game offers a multitude of options to choose from, so even after you've bested all the championships, there will still be plenty to do.With all the available modes, Motocross Maniacs Advance has a definite kinship with some of the kart racing games on the Game Boy Advance, such as Mario Kart Advance and Konami Krazy Racers. While the game doesn't share the mascot theme of these games and is played in side-scrolling 2D rather than 3D, gamers who have played these games will be right at home with this one.After taking your lumps with the first couple of races, you can easily get the hang of how the game plays, as well as how to best handle the competition. Each track is designed with multiple paths, so it may take a while to find the fastest route to the finish line. Sadly, the AI is very predictable, so after you've gotten the hang of the game, you'll have no trouble winning almost every race. Thankfully, there are a number of multiplayer options available, so you can always link with friends if the computer becomes too easy. Graphically, the game has colorful, cartoonlike visuals, as well as a fast-paced soundtrack that fits well into the frenetic pace of the game. If you're looking for a new racing game for your GBA, especially after mastering some of the kart racers available for the system, Motocross Maniacs Advance offers just as much depth as the competition and is definitely worth taking a look at."}
