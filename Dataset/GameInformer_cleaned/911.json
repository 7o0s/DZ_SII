Moebius has anintriguing premise, with hero Malachi Rector watching historical patternsrepeat themselves, uncovering conspiracies, and piecing together a connectionbetween history and present events. Unfortunately, the lackluster gameplay anddisappointing story didn't pull me in at all. Let'sget the biggest issue out of the way first. Moebius is campy. Everything playsout so ham-handedly that I couldn't get invested in the world and characters,which is a persistent problem. Did Jensen intend for it to be kitschy? Afterall, plenty of media pokes fun using a B-movie style; Little Shop of Horrors and Ron Gilbert's Maniac Mansion dabble init successfully, but Moebius' problem is how it positions itself as a seriousdrama. Unfortunately, the wooden animations and unrealistic scenarios - likeluring a guard into a cell only to take him out with a karate chop - had merolling my eyes at the absurdity.A goodadventure game has a gripping world and characters, but Moebius' cast and storyare simply subpar. Malachi Rector is a savant antiques appraiser. He'sextremely logical, but he doesn't handle people or emotions well. He tells itto people straight, which gets him into trouble. He reminds me of characterslike Temperance Brennan from Bones orDr. House, except they have redeeming moments and remain likeable despite theirflaws. Malachi, on the other hand, isn't likeable or compelling. This doesn'thelp the story, which lacks momentum and has laughable plot twists. Malachibegins on a mission to appraise antiques, but soon gets involved in a murderinvestigation, leading to a larger conspiracy involving government officials.Becauseof the increasing danger, Malachi hires a bodyguard named David. Throughout thegame, it's teased that David and Malachi might have more-than-friendly feelingsfor one another. Despite plenty of hints, it never goes further than lipservice. I'm fine with a few unanswered questions, but these hints are dangledin front of the player so constantly that the lack of resolution feels like amajor oversight.What Idid enjoy was Moebius' Carmen Sandiego vibe. You travel around locations likeFrance, Italy, and Egypt examining relics, meeting people, and learning abouthistory. The investigations, however, are basic match puzzles. A chest may havea symbol on it, and you just choose from a few images to find the one thatresembles the symbol. As you talk to people, you also need to analyze them. Area person's ripped clothes a fashion statement or do they speak to their financialstatus? If sweat is dripping on a forehead, does that mean the person is hidingsomething or is the room just hot? These scenarios feel like guesswork, and canbe solved by trial-and-error.Moebiusalso has plenty of the basic point-and-click puzzles, where you must findobjects and use them in the right ways. Most, however, use weird adventure-gamelogic. Maybe you find a pole to try to retrieve a potential clue at the bottomof a river - but you also need to combine it with something sticky, and thatitem might be innocuous. Or you might spot something that feels like it'smerely decoration, but then it becomes part of an elaborate puzzle. I alsodidn't care for some of the backtracking required. I would often see an objectand know it would be useful in a potential puzzle, but couldn't pick it upuntil the puzzle presented itself. Whilesome puzzles were enjoyable and challenged me to use my resources, others weremerely tedious roadblocks. At one point, you're investigating a governmentfigure with a knack for cryptography, but entering the solution is atime-consuming chore. Some puzzle sequences also go on too long, like trying tofind a way out of an abandoned cave with various dead ends, then backtrackingthrough it two more times. This isn't fun or challenging - it's busywork.Moebius is missing aspark something that makes you want to keep playing. It has a few shiningmoments with some standout humorous lines, but they're buried in bad dialogue,empty characters, and a dry mystery. Sadly, I don't think people will betalking about Malachi Rector with the esteem they do Gabriel Knight.", "date": "Apr 14, 2014", "grade": "6"}
