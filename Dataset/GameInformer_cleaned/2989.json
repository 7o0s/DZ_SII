{"name": "Avalon Code", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/avalon_code/b/nintendo_ds/archive/2009/09/22/review.aspx", "text": "When you smack someone in the face with a book in real life, everyone gets a good laugh. In Avalon Code, this act allows you to index and rearrange the genetic code of any person, monster, or weapon. The clever mechanic gives you control over many aspects of the world; you can use your book to add an ''ill'' element to a monster's code to make it weaker, or add a ''fire'' element to your sword to give it new powers. While this kind of agency is refreshing, the gameplay isn't nearly as novel. Sluggish combat, unimaginative objectives, and a plodding story are constant roadblocks to enjoying the unique and entertaining aspects of Avalon Code. Collecting codes and manipulating them is engaging, but the rest of the experience is merely functional.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
