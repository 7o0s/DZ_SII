Play itonline and hope that you get reasonable teammates. Play it with buddiesand enjoy the intense 2v2, 3v3, and 5v5 objective-based matches. Playthrough the lame story campaign with a friend if you must. Whatever youdo, though, dont go it alone. The entire point of this game is tobring cooperative real-time strategy to the next level. It accomplishesthat goal quite well, but does so at the expense of everything else.Therock-paper-scissors unit matchups and combat model will be instantlyfamiliar to anyone with a lick of RTS experience. Rockets blow upaircraft, lasers dominate heavy armor, and gunfire owns infantry. A fewspecial abilities like sprinting infantry and burrowing scorpion tankscan give proficient micromanagers an edge. The C&C staples fansexpect are present, with engineers reanimating avatar and mammoth tankhusks and commandos blowing up everything in sight. Here, though, iswhere the familiar comes to an end.Macro strategy is completelydifferent. You dont collect resources or build bases; you simply ordernew units from your mobile construction vehicle. Normal play consistsof competing with the other team to control point-generating nodes.Like a game of Battlefield, the first team to accumulate a set numberof points (which can also be gained by blowing up enemies, though nodecontrol is the primary means) wins. Losing your MCV isnt the end ofthe line, as a limited number of redeploys allows defeated players toget back in the fight.This unique take on RTS is a blast whenyoure in a solid match. Youre constantly scouting and checking theminimap to stay on top of what your opponents are up to whilemicromanaging the current battle(s) as best you can. Juggling unitbuilds and tech upgrades, coordinating macro strategy with yourteammates, and simply watching the gorgeous carnage unfold all add upto an intense, fulfilling strategy experience.Teamwork wins moreskirmishes than anything else. Since each player chooses one of threeclasses  offense, defense, or support  a combined force is far morethan the sum of its parts. Offense provides the beefiest units andunmatched mobility. Defense can set up turrets and bunkers, as well aspump out powerful infantry to take advantage of garrison-ablestructures. Support has a big bag of tricks, from the best air units(which are powerful but cannot capture points of interest) to powerslike instant area-effect repair and scouting bonuses. The briefestconsideration of the classes diverse abilities conjures a plethora oftactical and strategic possibilities, and conceiving them is nearly asmuch fun as executing them with a competent teammate or four.Thishuge investment in cooperative play is both C&C 4s biggeststrength and weakness. Each player is playing basically a third of astandard RTS faction, though you wouldnt guess it from the largestable of units and powers available to each. Offense is short on airsupport. Defense lacks strong tanks. Support has a heck of a time alonein any stand-up fight. If your teammates are lone-wolf idiots or justbad, the entire game breaks down. Accomplishing anything of note byoneself is a frustrating, Sisyphean labor. No amount of micro skill orclever unit balance will make up for fighting an entrenched defenseclass with competent repair and scouting assistance from a supportteammate when your ally is off doing something useless.In thatsame vein, having no teammate is even worse than having a bad player onyour squad. I cannot stress enough the failure of the story campaign insingle-player mode. From baffling, objective-scuttling AI on escortmissions to boring slogs through weak linear defenders, this scriptedgarbage goes nowhere. With a co-op buddy, the campaign improves frommerely horrible to bad. Even the story makes inexcusable missteps,despite my unabashed enjoyment of the live-action camp that the seriesis known for. C&C 4 reaches a level previously reserved for UweBoll, where the quality of everything from writing to set design andacting is so poor that you cant even laugh at it.Some of thereliance on cooperative play could be mitigated by a strong onlinebackend, but C&C 4s is middling at best. There is a friends listand rudimentary matchmaking, but the stat tracking and achievementsleave me cold compared to better solutions like Modern Warfare. Forcingplayers to be online in order to play single player is lame as well.C&C4 is not without redeeming qualities, and in the right situation itoffers something truly unique to the RTS genre. I have no doubt thatthere will be gamers who fall head-over-heels for its tightlyengineered co-op design. The binding dependence on teammates can be apain, though, and legacy issues like bad keyboard shortcuts and unit AIpersist. I can recommend the game, but only to a certain style of gamerand only with a handful of caveats.", "date": "Mar 16, 2010", "grade": "7.75"}
