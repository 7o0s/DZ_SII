With that in mind, Ilooked ahead with curiosity on where the next entry would take Jesse andfriends, and this episode delivers on the promise of a threatening big bad, andthe improved pacing makes Minecraft: Story Mode's aging formula as enjoyable asit's ever been.By now,veteran players of Telltale's episodic adventures know what to expect; eachepisode presents you with a series of scenes that have you complete quick-timeevents, choose dialogue, and solve exploration-based puzzles. Along the way,your choices loosely influence the way the story plays out. Minecraft: StoryMode is no different. Giant Consequences is light on combat, but it makes upfor it with lots of quick-time events to capitalize on big set-pieces and a funshooting-gallery mini-game.Earlyon, you face off against a massive creature controlled by the Admin, aseemingly omnipotent creature who is said to have built the world that Jesseinhabits. The scale of this encounter is reminiscent of the climax of seasonone, and the banter between Jesse and the Admin is entertaining. Hearing theAdmin recite parts of Jesse's adventures from the first season is a soberingreminder of just how powerful he is.ThoughI was unsure of Jesse's new party of adventurers for season two, I warmed up tomost of them throughout this episode. The delusional wannabe-rival characterStella still irks me, but she's supposed to. Characters like the gruff Jack andthe underdog Radar grew on me as their arcs matured and their charm shinedthrough. I liked watching the constantly doubted Radar overcome his fears totry and prove the naysayers wrong. And while I don't want to spoil anything, Ienjoyed a couple of the characters deliver some fun reveals near the end ofthis episode.Thefirst episode of this season introduced improved combat that added new elementslike dodge-rolls and a stamina bar, as well as a new way to craft entirestructures using the resources in your inventory on a grid-based platform. Iwas delighted not only to see the structure I built in the first episodereappear in Giant Consequences, but also the opportunity to build a newstructure that I hope will make an appearance in a future episode. By allowingplayers to flex their creativity in new ways, Telltale is giving its Minecraftseries more of what made the masses fall in love with that property in thefirst place, and helping to further differentiate it from its plethora of otherlicensed series.With a breakneck pace andaction-packed events, the sophomore episode of season two has me hoping thatthe series can carry this momentum forward. Though I'm anticipating the typicalTelltale pattern where all your choices end up not making much of a difference atthe season's conclusion, I'm at least enjoying the ride to that point.", "date": "Aug 16, 2017", "grade": "7.5"}
