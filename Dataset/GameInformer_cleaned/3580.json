{"name": "NASCAR Heat 3", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/review/nascar-heat-3/finding-some-grip", "text": "Theres a good reason why whether win or DNF a driver is always quick to thank the people back at the shop; the people who work their tails off all week so the driver can climb behind the wheel and put it all on the line. Finally, NASCAR Heat 3 gives its earnest due to all thosewho make it happen viaacareer mode with more organizational options. The franchise has desperately needed this step forward since developer Monster Games brought the series back two years ago, but even with this new evolution the game doesnt roll off the hauler a total winner.The games career mode is expanded in two crucial ways: You start out in an abbreviated dirt racing tour, which offers a loose and local racing feel thatother racing series cant offer, and you can start your own racing organization. While you dont have to do this and can simply race on contracts from other teams, managingyour own racing team (youre the only driver, however) creates a reason to spend all the money youre making, which is otherwise a dead end.Theres nothing complex in running your own team its just a matter of hiring employees, training them up, and putting them to work on chassis setups catering to the specific types of track you race on. Its not like F1 2018 where youre making choices on a sprawling R&D tree.Despite the simplicity of Heat 3s franchise setup, one aspect particularly suited to NASCAR shines through: bringing the right car to the right track. Stock car racing may be predominately ovals, but if you dont set up the car specifically for the track youre racing youll never get to victory lane. Thus, you have to grow your organization to the point that you can work in advance to have the right machine when you need it.The rub is that each chassis starts at a 70 rating each week and employees can raise that number by a maximum of 15 points per week. So, if you want to get that car to a 100 or make it competitive, youre going to need at least two weeks. But you sometimes dont have that luxury because the schedule may stack races that require thesame type of chassis three weeks in a row, for instance. So youre always eyeing the schedule and seeing what you can get away with. Can you meet the sponsor objective of a top-five finish with an 80-rated chassis? Do you take the 90-rated one that was originally planned for a super speedway instead and take a ratings penalty on top because its not actually designed for the track youre racing this week? Youre constantly juggling present and future needs. Sometimes you get lucky and sometimes you have to bite the bullet and do the best with what you got.While owning your own team and juggling its demands gives the game a needed NASCAR feel, its lacking in other areas. The rivalries, while letting you interface with drivers through a basic email system, dont really manifest themselves on the track. Despite your organizations chassis setup, you dont have to deal with damage which doesnt even visually show up when youre racing. Its also disappointing that the paint schemes you can create for your teams cars are very basic.In terms of the games racing itself, much remains the same in a good way. I love trying to hook up with partners in different lines to make my way through traffic  even if I know that staying in a line too long could mean three other cars team up and blow by using another part of the track. Going for the block isnt always a sure thing, with getting punted into the outer wall the kind of track justice that makes you mutter, fair nuff. Perhaps more than ever I spent a good amount of time racing just by looking in my side mirror, trying to guess which packs were forming up behind me to try and make a run.In other areas, the gameplay has improved, such as A.I. cars pitting at different times, but other problems occasionally show up such as cars randomly stacking up or not taking good lines, and visually the whole package needs a new coat of paint.Online is similarly much the same. The race countdown automatically starts once a second person joins the lobby, lag can infect races, and there arent options to turn off collisionor turn on qualifying for races. The game has, however, added a weekly tournament structure that leads to a year-end shootout, creatingneeded, optional big-picture goals.The NASCAR Heat series is three years in and is just now hitting its stride. This years addition to the career mode is a solid foundation that pays off in the present and sets itup for the future. I dont think the game has necessarily locked down each of its main components gameplay, online, and career mode but its making its way through the pack.", "date": "Sep 09, 2018", "grade": "7.5"}
