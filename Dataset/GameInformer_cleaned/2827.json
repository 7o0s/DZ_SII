Insteadof a magnetic ball, you play a tornado named Zephyr chosen to save theworld by destroying everything in its path. Each of TornadoOutbreak's levels, which take place everywhere from trailer parks toa Vegas clone, requires multiple passes to continue. Players mustharness the power of the tornado to uncover the hiding places of FireFliers, fire-based creatures that have stolen the orbs of anti-matterhero Omegaton that need to be returned. In two passes across theenvironment, Zephyr must uncover 50 of 100 fliers housed within eachlevel. You start as a small tornado that at first can only destroyplants and tumbleweeds, but can eventually take down entire amusementparks. Tearing through structures and leaving nothing but dust in yourwake is quite enjoyable.As part of the challenge, Zephyr muststay away from harmful solar rays. To aid the Wind Warrior, an objectcalled a L.O.A.D. Starr casts a shadow for a limited time. It isimperative to collect the fliers and return to the shadow caster beforetime runs out, but without any sort of mini map, it can be difficult tofind the location of the Starr in the level before time is up. Fail andyou must restart the level.Once players collect the Fire Fliers,they enter the totem battles. After racing through vortex gates to gainsize and speed for the upcoming encounter, you must cross thebattlefield while staying in shade spots to approach the totems andtake them down with rapid button presses. Each level follows the exactsame progression path, and this dull repetition ultimately makes whatcould have been a great tornado game nothing more than a funnel cloud.", "date": "zalez on Oct 27, 2009", "grade": "6.75"}
