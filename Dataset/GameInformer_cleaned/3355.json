Grid, however, doesnt fully live up to this objective. It simply does not contain enough beyond Codemasters solid racing gameplay to jumpstart the brand in this day and age. The Grid reboot brings the franchise back, but without pushing past its previous incarnations, it feels like its just going around in circles.Grid offers a plethora of races across six types, spanning GT, stock, tuner, and other types of cars. Youre free to move among them (as long as you can afford the requisite car), but Grids career mode is missing structures, like being in charge of a full racing operation that may actually get you emotionally invested in creating your legacy. Only two race types exist: regular race and time attack, and there arent any larger sponsorship incentives that serve as motivating carrots. You dont upgrade your cars parts or performance, and the teammates you hire dont give you a boost on the track or have any personality or anything else to tie them to you in a meaningful way. In short, Grid is a game of numbers. Its a game with a lot of races, but it doesnt give you enough reason to care. It hits the bare minimum of what a racing title should be, but it doesnt try to break out of the mold like the original Grid once tried to.At least Codemasters confidently executes on the racing itself. Grids gameplay is between an arcade and sim-racing title, a fun space that encourages experimentation with the normal, generous range of difficulty and handling options Codemasters is known for. Because of the relatively open structure of Grids available races, it doesnt take long to race some powerful cars, and it similarly wont take long to become comfortable braking hard, throwing the steering wheel into a corner, and holding on for dear life, playing with the throttle to find that sweet spot between skidding and sliding. Even when you go back to cars with stiffer suspensions, theres still joy and skill in finding the limits.While youre in the throes of racing concentration you may spare a moment for the nemesis and teammate systems, but not much more. Nemeses duly give you a bump if they reach your rear quarter panel (their anger resets after each race), but the role teammates play is less obvious. They have different levels of aggression, skill, and loyalty, but most races are only three laps; this doesnt give you time to wait around for a key moment for them to block a specific racer for your benefit, or help you out at all. Your teammates are just other cars to pass on the track, and they dont have any personality off of it, which doesnt leave them with much of a purpose.You may be paying their wages for nothing, but at least its not hard to earn enough gold to buy the cars needed to race across the various silos. Your earnings are also shared between single-player and multiplayer, which is nice. In multiplayer, I like how cars ghost at certain times to prevent huge pileups, like when a player is using the rewind function. But like the career, multiplayer lacks race types. You also cant form teams, nor can you see which public lobby you arejoining, or set up which assists racers can use in private matches.The Grid series offers a fun, gorgeous racing experience, and I can see value in bringing it back. But this incarnation of the game performs the bare minimum of the reboot mandate when it should be doing so much more. We race to be in first place, but unfortunately, Grid seems content to be in the middle of the pack.", "date": "Oct 08, 2019", "grade": "7"}
