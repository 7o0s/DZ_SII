{"name": "NFL Tour", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/nfl_tour/b/ps3/archive/2009/09/28/review.aspx", "text": "Let me start this off with a message to the Miami Dolphins: Believeit or not, you're not the only team that's toiled in futility andtotally embarrassed yourselves on the football field this year. Ithought that in retooling the NFL Street series into NFL Tour EA wouldactually be improving the franchise and learning from its past mistakesin the sub-genre. Unfortunately, I was mistaken, as NFL Tour representsa total regression  one that the company says is aimed at young kidsand football novices who don't play Madden. Even if I take this at facevalue, it's clear that this game is a failure no matter how you try andqualify it.EA should be ashamed that it's trying to bilk some kid out of $50while offering so little in return. I can understand simplifying thecontroller in an otherwise button-heavy sport, but that doesn't meanthe gameplay itself has to become uninspiring and so lacking. NFLTour's version of Gamebreakers only occur on defense, and gone is theshowboating and over-the-top moves that would make plays possiblyexciting. The best Tour does on this front is offer counter moves tobreak or perform tackles. Also, if you're going to simplify thegameplay this much, I think you need to offset that with bells andwhistles like unlockables, an intriguing career structure, footballcards, or whatever to offer people something off the field. And if youwant to go easy on kids, cleaning up the blatant catch-up AI andunresponsive controls is a good way to get into their  or anyone's good graces.Given how badly this reinvention of NFL Street has gone, I'd ask foran overhaul of NFL Tour, but who knows what we'd end up with then.", "date": "Sep 28, 2009", "grade": "5"}
