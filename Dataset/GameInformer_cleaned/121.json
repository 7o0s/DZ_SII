FIFA17's new mode, The Journey, has no shortage of inspirations;every match and season is full of them. But The Journey is in an ambiguousposition: It gives the illusion that you're directing the tale of Alex Hunter,but you're neither in control enough of Hunter to take ownership of him, andthe story of the mode itself can struggle to synch up to his actions. Despitethis, The Journey has memorable moments and is an admirable first step worthexperiencing alongside the series' customary modes and improving gameplay.The Journey is an elaborate wrapper for the traditional Be a Pro mode,using the match rating feature to assess Hunter's performance based on thequality of his passes, shots, and positioning. This increases his abilities(along with his results in training sessions) and determines whether he's amongthe starting 11 each week. Hunter experiences the ups and downs as a youngphenom in the English Premier League, and we get a glimpse of his personallife.The mode is at its best when it captures Hunter's awe of the situation,such as signing with his favorite club from his childhood (which you choose).Like Hunter, I geeked out at seeing current first-teamers in the background andsoaked up the occasion. The solid voice acting and character models add tothese moments, as do settings like Hunter's childhood bedroom. Developer EAVancouver smartly kept the story mainly confined to the world of soccer; ittakes some detours into Hunter's family life, but they are only okay.While the story is solid, I wanted more from FIFA's boasted advantage:licenses. Managers are mute and rarely seen, and you see little flavor from theclub you're at, like its history, status in the standings, the supporters, andthe players around you. It's Hunter's journey through a season with the club,but apart from the kit he's wearing and a few fictitious players he interactswith, it feels isolated from the supposed grandeur of the self-proclaimed bestleague in the world.Part of this incongruity comes from the conversation system and processof training and playing in matches to upgrade Hunter's skills. Some events ofthe story are told no matter what Hunter does, and while I respect that thenarrative needs to take precedence, it's inconsistent and sometimes frustratingto do well in training and in games, for instance, and not be treated accordingto -those-achievements.You can play games in the mode either as the whole team, or locked tojust Hunter. Playing as the team doesn't produce the satisfaction of being thecharacter of Alex Hunter. However, player-locking to Hunter makes you morereliant on your A.I. teammates, whom you can command to pass, shoot, etc. Theydo alright in some situations, but they simply don't have the nous to avoidtactical dead ends, and sometimes even pass on a clear chance on goal. Thegrading system is also inconsistent and unable to understand that even a goodfirst decision can eventually lead to a poor outcome.Apart from The Journey, the series' usual offering of modes has someslight new wrinkles. Squad Building in Ultimate Team is like Madden's sets:Trade in cards to complete collections for payouts. Meeting the prerequisitesis a puzzle that can be solved multiple ways.Career mode includes more season objectives (financial, youth prospects,competitions, etc.), and thankfully not meeting them doesn't always meaninstant termination  an improvement from last year. Unfortunately, oneaspect of FIFA that is too similar to FIFA 16 is the women's national teams.Norway and the Netherlands are now in, but otherwise the popular feature isstatic.FIFA's gameplay is on the ascent, but still has some frustrating momentswhere outcomes are predetermined despite your inputs, as well as occasionallydodgy passes and overpowered keepers. However, the control of your first touchand the increased physical play are assets. The latter is useful whethershielding the ball from an opponent (or vice versa) or trying not to be bossedaround on corners.The Journey isn't thebe-all-end-all of FIFA 17. It's a good start that adds to the game despite itsflaws, while the title is anchored by the overall gameplay and other modes.Solving the riddle of how to blend player agency seamlessly with a well-craftedstory remains a tantalizing prize, one that will pay off handsomely whenattained.This review pertains to the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game. It is also available on PS3, 360, and PC. The Journey is not in the last-gen versions.", "date": "Sep 23, 2016", "grade": "8.75"}
