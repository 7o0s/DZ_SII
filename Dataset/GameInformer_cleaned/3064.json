{"name": "Castlevania: Judgment", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/castlevania_judgment/b/wii/archive/2009/09/22/review.aspx", "text": "Fighting games should be about balance, precision, and skill. If any one of those areas falls short, the whole experience suffers. In Castlevania: Judgment, they all fall short. First of all, the Wii remote control scheme is unfathomably broken; to play this game, you should use a classic or GameCube controller. Even then, you must contend with spastic combat, a terrible camera, and unnatural button combinations you can't remap. I'd like to say there's at least some decent Castlevania fan service, but the character designs are awful -- the Simon Belmont in Captain N: The Game Master was a cooler incarnation of the legendary vampire hunter. The end product fails as a fighter, as a part of the Castlevania series, and as a video game in general.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
