It introduced us to a world full of spirituality, blitzball, and the sacrifices brave souls must make to secure peace. Focusing merely on its narrative isnt enough  Final Fantasy X changed the way we experienced RPGs with its fully voiced cutscenes adding a new layer of storytelling. It pushed boundaries and raised standards; like Final Fantasy VII, it was a cinematic turning point in video games. Square Enix is providing another chance to relive this defining moment with not only a visual upgrade, but also brand-new content previously exclusive to the international versions of Final Fantasy X and X-2.Square Enix didnt just raise the resolution and call it a day; the visual overhaul is noticeable. Barren areas now teem with detail, color, and life. Where blurry, green landscape filled the backdrops, shrubbery now thrives. Structures follow suit with additional detail, making them more realistic. Even the characters faces look more lifelike and expressive. The fresh coat of paint keeps everything on par with what weve seen from other PS3 games. However, telltale signs  like the characters awkward mannerisms  show that these are still PS2 games at their cores.The EdgeThe Vita version is nearly identical to its big brother, but there are some additional jaggies and other minor graphical imperfections. None of these issues impede your experience, but the difference is evident.Sparking some ire from diehard fans, Square Enix rearranged and remastered over 60 tracks from Final Fantasy X. This is most noticeable if youre intimately familiar with the original soundtrack, and the changes arent as jarring as I expected. Some rearrangements, like the infamous Calm Before The Storm, retain their essence with refinements, but its not all changed for the better. Besaid Island Theme, for instance, loses personality by ditching its memorable piano. Still, the arrangements dont rewrite the songs; most of the time, they clean up the melodies and make the tracks more powerful while adding unnecessary instruments. Square Enix obviously wanted to update the music to make the same impact as the enhanced visuals. It doesnt, but I appreciate the attempt to spruce up the collection even more.Both X and X-2 feature content new to North America (but seen in the original international versions). Final Fantasy X adds dark aeons and the expert sphere grid, where not every character is entrenched in a set path. They all start in the middle of the grid, which makes it easier to customize characters. It doesnt drastically change the experience, but having more control over your characters development, like setting Auron up as a healer, is a nice touch. Eternal Calm is also included, a short movie that provides context to how Yuna came to her decision to join up with the Gullwings in Final Fantasy X-2. It fills in some of the blanks and is a much better segue into X-2s plot than Yunas concert.Final Fantasy X-2s international additions include new dresspheres, a creature creator, and fiend arena-battle tournaments. Its biggest offering is the Last Mission, which takes place three months after the end of X-2. Yuna, Paine, and Rikku are brought back together by a strange message urging them to ascend Iutycyr Tower. Last Mission is a roguelike dungeon crawler, where you try to stay alive and ascend as many floors as possible. After a set number of floors, cutscenes provide insight into what the characters have been up to since they were last together. The floors arent exciting, but the dresspheres and leveling system keep it fun. Last Mission is certainly a nice diversion, but not incredibly engaging.Even years later, Final Fantasy X is still an exciting RPG, telling a compelling story with plenty of momentum. While the crazy girls-night-out theatrics of X-2 might still cause you to roll your eyes, the battle system is still fast and fun. For those who want the complete arc of the Final Fantasy X saga, the collection delivers. Even without a nostalgic lens, both games hold up well.More To Final Fantasys Xs Arc?This HD collection features a 30-minute audio drama teasing that the quest to save Spira is hardly over. Set three years after defeating Sin, the scenario introduces two new characters named Chuami and Kurgum. Chuami has an interesting connection to one of Final Fantasy Xs main characters, and Yuna, Tidus, and other cast members reveal what theyve been up to. When a new mystery emerges, it forecasts a great danger is looming again. However, the audio drama leaves it hanging. A hint to Final Fantasy X-3? Time will tell whats in store.", "date": "Mar 18, 2014", "grade": "9"}
