EnterBlade Kitten. At its core, Blade Kitten attempts to take the essence ofold-school 2D platformers and marry it with the bright visuals and gonzostoryline of a Japanese anime. While Krome Studios has certainly attained thelatter, some sketchy mechanics keep Blade Kitten from being as fun as itsforerunners.Blade Kitten stars a pink-haired cat woman named KitBallard, who spends most of the game chasing secondary characters due to simplemisunderstandings. Blade Kitten simply doesn't have a lot of meat on its frame,but the first half's ending (the game is being released as two downloadableepisodes) suggests a deeper plot for part two, and the game's universe has adecent amount of depth in its characters and settings. If you're looking for adeep narrative to go along with the title's ample creativity though, you won'tfind anything to get excited about.The game wastes little time getting you into theaction, which is a characteristic I could appreciate if the gameplay weretighter. Kit's feline DNA gives her the ability to crawl on walls and ceilings,which adds a lot of verticality to levels and gives the platforming a uniquefeeling. However, the climbing feels sluggish, and despite being half cat, Kitis surprisingly slow when it comes to changing directions. The combat moves ata more satisfying pace, but despite having a reasonable number of actions atyour disposal, I rarely encountered an occasion where spamming the basic attackbutton isn't enough.Despite some questionable controls, Blade Kittenoffers a fair amount of content to consume. Each level of the game is huge,offering exploration more along the lines of Super Metroid than Mario. You'llstumble upon a ton of ancillary paths and treasure chests, but you'll bank somuch fictional currency that the extra loot won't really matter. By the halfwaymark of the episode, I had already accrued enough money to buy the game's threeadditional swords (each with different advantages) and a few costumes to boot(which are sure to excite furries). Youcan also purchase items that upgrade your health and stamina, but aside fromthe last annoying boss battle, I breezed through the game without muchdifficulty.Ultimately, I appreciate the vibrant and uniqueworld that Krome Studios creates, and despite the substandard voice work, Ienjoy Blade Kitten's wacky characters as well. However, aside from a fewpuzzles and boss battles, the gameplay fails to leave a lastingimpression.", "date": "Sep 22, 2010", "grade": "6.5"}
