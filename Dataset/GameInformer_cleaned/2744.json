Upstart developer Vigil Games does nothing to disguise the factthat both aforementioned games are channeled to the fullest extent. Thoughit doesnt go so far as to place War in tight green spandex, Darksidersmight as well be set in Hyrule. A subtle nod occurs when Wars healthis nearly depleted, and players are alerted of impending doom by afaint-yet annoying-repeated beep. More obvious homage is paid throughdungeon exploration. Vigil follows Shigeru Miyamotos blueprint down tothe last detail, including maps that reveal all chest locations and theboss room signified with a large red skull. The Zelda observations dipinto the realm of can they really get away with this? through many ofWars gadgets and weapons. A hookshot-like device grants War passageacross large expanses, and a boomerang-like object can chain multipletargets together with a single throw. If youre not sold on thesimilarities yet, War navigates the overworld via horseback, obtainsadditional health containers at the conclusion of each dungeon, and ison a quest to reassemble a rare artifact that will bring peace to theworld. Need I go on?Miyamoto isnt the only one who may demand acut of the take. If Vigil decides to release a Darksiders prequel, mostof the game would likely show War palling around with God of Warsprotagonist Kratos. The horsemans attacks channel the same fieryorange trails and an elegant, yet violent beauty. Defeated foes dontsimply fall to the ground. They stand dazed with a flashing icon overtheir head, alerting War that he can finish them off with a brutal (andvisually satisfying) strike. When the body explodes into blood, War isrewarded with colored souls that regenerate his health and mana, andare also used as currency at stores to purchase new attacks, weapons,and upgrades. As Kratos understudy, War is also overly abusive towardsdoors and chests.For one level, Darksiders doesnt hump God ofWar or Zeldas leg. It instead shifts its admiration of great games tothe most unlikely of candidates: Portal. Yes, War wields the portalgun. And yes, if you fire it once, it makes a blue doorway. Fire itagain to create an orange exit. As strange of a fit as it may be, Vigilmakes it work well with the context of the game. Some of the gamesgreatest moments are tied to this device.All of the familiarmechanics and designs are handled with care, almost making me thinkthat the Zelda, Portal, and God of War teams were involved withDarksiders creation. From the complexity of the dungeon designs to thefinesse of combat, Vigil shows us that it is capable of much more thanimitation  it can twist decade-old ideas into new experiences, andmake every battle a sweat-inducing affair.These elements cometogether to create an engaging adventure that kept me in a state ofwonder most of the way. Exploring the dungeons and solving their manyriddles was the highlight. The combat system, although periodicallybothered by camera tracking issues, controls admirably, and offersdepth in combos, weapon choice, and tactics.While succeeding indesign, Darksiders doesnt keep gamers engaged with the narrative. Warisnt the only character that delivers a transparent performance.Almost every character feels like he or she was assigned a cameo role,as you never can quite grasp their importance to the tale at hand. Theplot bounces around recklessly and doesnt open itself up enough tomake you believe the apocalypse is a worldwide event. From what I couldtell, it happened in a city the size of Baltimore, and affected thelives of 200 people and/or demons. The big players in the story  ifyou can call them that  also go down like chumps through boss fightsconsisting of repetitious tactics that are intended to requireexperimentation to solve, but are telegraphed far too clearly.Evenwithout a clear narrative purpose, Darksiders never wavers from beingan enjoyable adventure. I had a blast playing it, and strangely enough,the obvious nods to other games added to the fun. Despite a lame lastboss fight, the setup planted for the sequel has me counting the daysuntil it arrives.", "date": "Dec 29, 2009", "grade": "8.5"}
