In the meantime, 2K Australia has steppedin to keep the money train rolling with Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, a humorousdetour that takes players to Pandora's moon, Elpis. Despite featuring four new playablecharacters and a few novel features here and there, The Pre-Sequel feels likemore of the same, which is both good and bad for fans of the series.The Pre-Sequel takes place before Borderlands 2, and detailsHandsome Jack's transformation from being a pretentious but well-meaning heroto one gaming's most delightfully detestable villains. 2K Australia weaves anentertaining narrative around what players already know of the characters andtimelines of the previous games, and even though the writing is still moresophomoric and annoying than it is clever, I enjoyed watching Handsome Jack'sflaws bubble up and learning more about the manic and humorous universe.Unfortunately, other aspects of the game don't fare as well.Borderlands' signature visual style has lost some of its luster over the years,which is exacerbated by Elipis' bland and monotonous landscape. The texturepop-in is especially atrocious; the series always struggled to load in hi-restextures fast enough to keep up with the player, but waiting for blobbycharacters to slowly come into focus is a shortcoming I'll be happy to burywith my last-gen consoles.On the gameplay side of things, 2K Australia hasn't made toomany changes to Borderlands' familiar and addictive gameplay loop. You still levelup your character with a variety of upgrades and skills while collecting,using, and selling an endless selection of guns and equipment. However, while otherloot-focused action games have made great strides in streamlining thecollection process, Borderlands suffers from the same old inadequacies. Youstill spend too much time sifting through junk loot, selling off old andunwanted items, and opening countless crates to restore ammo and pick up paltryamounts of cash. Comparing item stats and managing your inventory hasn't gottenany easier, and the quick travel system still requires slogging through longstretches of the environment just to get to the appropriate kiosk. ThePre-Sequel offers up some new enemy types, but they rarely require differenttactics aside from what elemental gun type to use.The biggest gameplay changes revolve (or orbit, as the casemay be) around Elpis' atmosphere. The low gravity makes bounding acrossenvironments and vertical exploration easy and fun. The O2 system, whichrequires players to periodically replenish their air supply, is rarely ahindrance, and adds a welcome layer of control while floating through the air.The best addition is the buttstomp, which rockets you down on top of foes andunleashes an area-of-effect explosion. However, these gameplay tweaks come at thecost of more mobile enemies (who share all your new moves), and targeting foes floatingabove you is as obnoxious as it's always been in first-person shooters. Otheradditions like laser and cryo weapons are nice, but hardly revolutionary.It didn't take me long to get back into the swing of things,and despite the mostly old annoyances, The Pre-Sequel kept me entranced likethe first two games. However, my enjoyment was repeatedly stymied by balancingissues. Sticking to the story missions will quickly leave you under-leveled,and most of the side missions don't dole out enough XP to make them worth yourwhile. The Pre-Sequel's boss battles are especially frustrating, and create apunitive loop for players struggling with the level curve; respawning after youdie costs you money, but because crates don't replenish  and the boss enemy'shealth and shields do  purchasing replacementammo is often your only option to rearm before heading back into the fight. On more than one occasion, thesolution for beating a difficult boss was to leave, grind out a few extralevels with side missions and killing random enemies, then come back and employthe same tactics. Like previous games, The-Presequel isn't just better withfriends, it's balanced for co-op, and playing solo feels like a chore.Ultimately, those who just want more Borderlands are gettingtheir wish. The Pre-Sequel offers plenty of missions, completely new environmentsand playable characters, and one of the more interesting story threads of theseries. If you're looking for more fromBorderlands, however, The Pre-Sequel falls short, and it will take more thanlaser blasters and buttstomps to put the series back at the top of my must-playlist. Note: This review pertains to the Xbox 360 version of the game. Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is also available on PlayStation 3 and PC.", "date": "Oct 13, 2014", "grade": "7.5"}
