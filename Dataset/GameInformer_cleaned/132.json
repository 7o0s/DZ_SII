Unfortunately,any hope of ReCore being the ultimate Mega Man/Metroid hybrid proves asfarfetched as Joule's mechanical companions. While ReCore's gameplay foundationis mostly solid, a host of technical and design issues stand ready to hinderyour progress and your enjoyment.I was pleasantly surprised byReCore's opening hours, mostly thanks to the intriguing sci-fi premise. Youplay as Joule, a colonial engineer who has been awakened from cryo-sleep tofind and fix whatever has stopped the terraforming process on Far Eden. Aidedby your robot dog, you begin exploring the large desert world, sampling its myriaddungeons and fast-paced action, and collecting more mechanical companions alongthe way.Once ReCore starts rampingup, however, the experience starts to unravel. Aggressive auto-targeting makesaiming during combat a non-issue. Instead, Comcept injects excitement intobattles by making enemies so powerful that a few consecutive hits will killyou; you need to use Joule's double-jump and boost abilities to constantly stayon the move (and preferably off the ground). I'd be fine with the fast-pacedand frenetic action if Joule's stagger animation  which is triggered by mostenemy attacks  didn't leave you completely immobilized. The shameless A.I. ismore than happy to capitalize on your vulnerability by whomping you withfollow-up attacks, often ending in a frustrating death while you helplessly struggleto regain control.ReCore's fickle combat iscompounded by positively dreadful load times. Multiple areas take over twominutes to reload, no matter how cheap the death. Platforming sequences arethankfully immune from this problem, but the need to constantly move betweenzones, dungeons, ~fast-travel~ points, and Joule's sand crawler (the only placeyou can apply upgrades) means you're waiting almost as much as you're playing. Thiskind of egregious interruption is practically unheard of in modern gaming, andunacceptable.Far Eden also quickly losesits luster. The open world is massive, but shockingly barren. Entire swaths ofthe map are devoid of anything but white sand and the occasional recycled rock.Outside of the dungeons, you don't have much to do other than collect craftingitems and get into random battles. Some areas of the map are so bland anduneventful that they feel unfinished.Even ReCore's adorablecompanions have their flaws. While each of the four collectible robot frames featuresa unique ability to aid you in traversal or exploration, you can only have twowith you at any time, and must return to a fast-travel location to swap themout. That means all too often when you come across a gated area or secret inthe world, you don't have the proper companion to explore it. Upgrading eachanimal also slows down, as better frames require rare crafting items that youcan't get without copious grinding. Even increasing their stats is perplexinglyflawed  you have to boost each stat by slowly filling up a meter with yourcollected orbs, one level at a time, hundreds of times for each companion.ReCore's biggest annoyance isits constant attempt to pad the length of its campaign by slowing down yourprogress. Each main story mission sports both a level requirement and aprismatic core requirement. You gain these glowing orbs by completing~optional~ side dungeons, but before you can enter them, you first must find ahandful of collectible cellbots hidden in the world. My progress to the finaltower, a five-floor gauntlet of platforming and combat challenges, was stalledfor hours as I scoured the world for these dumb floating batteries, all so thatI could snag a few more orbs.Even worse, each floor of thefinal tower has its own increasing level requirement, yet doesn't offer enoughXP to meet the next one. The result? After each area, I was forced to head backout into the world to grind in repetitive arena battles. This is a real shame, becauseotherwise the tower's devious challenges would have presented a satisfying culminationof your skills and a worthy prelude to the final showdown. Instead, they feelshort and disjointed, and the final boss battle ends abruptly.ReCore is a poster child forwasted potential. At its heart is a good (though not great) game, marred by longload times, technical problems (including frame rates dips and the occasionalcrash), and bad pacing. The infuriating and frivolous road blocks may have doubledthe length of the 20-hour game, but they also halved my fun.", "date": "Sep 14, 2016", "grade": "5.5"}
