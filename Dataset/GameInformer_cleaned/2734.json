{"name": "Dark Void", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/dark_void/b/xbox360/archive/2010/01/20/review.aspx", "text": "When Capcom released Bionic Commando in mid-2009, many praised its unique arm-swinging mechanics while simultaneously berating the linear playground provided. In many ways Capcoms newest IP, Dark Void, echoes the same issues that arose within Nathan Rad Spencers attempted return to fame. Unfortunately, with Dark Voids protagonist having a jetpack strapped to his back, the would-be video game legend has much farther to fall.Dark Voids ludicrous plot twists and dubious narrative hinge on a dimension-warped pilot named Will fighting alien-robots in the Bermuda Triangle. The games weak narrative struggles to keep things even half-interesting. Generic, Nolan North-voiced Will and ex-lover Avas journey through the Void sees them befriending a band of clichd survivors and fighting off a race of oppressive alien-robots. Among the survivors is a throw-away cameo by Nikola Tesla, the one-note creator of the jetpack. Once youve got the jetpack strapped to your shoulders youre free to blast far away from the storys laughable twists and groan-inducing ending.Wills jetpack is the true star of the game. It perfectly augments what would otherwise be a by-the-numbers, cover-and-fire third-person-shooter. Dont expect to be rocketeering through the clouds right away, however, as the game paces you through the learning process of the packs various mechanics at an excruciatingly slow rate. Intense vertical combat firefights requiring you to hop from ledge to ledge are peppered throughout the games early stages, adding variety to the ground-warfare. Here gravity teams up with poorly timed grenades and fallen foes to create new hazards amidst your exciting ascent.Eventually youll gain the useful hover and full-fledged flight abilities. Hovering itself dramatically changes the way firefights are approached, allowing you to blast over and around enemy cover to deliver a perfect grenade toss. Using the jetpack to soar above your clueless enemies heads and pick them off with your explosive machine gun rounds is such an empowering gaming experience that youll feel like youre cheating. Simultaneously floating in the air and riddling enemies with bullets is an absolute riot, and by far the high point of the title. Even better, if you take too much damage youre free to perform a rocket-blasted retreat and regenerate lost health. Keep this exit strategy in mind often, as Dark Voids awful damage indicator consists of too-subtle blurring which results in many surprise deaths. Many spots in the game have you and a band of useless teammates engaging in aerial battles against the persistent Watcher forces. These dogfight segments will frustrate gamers not used to aiming with the left analog stick. Its difficult to feel like a jetpack-equipped badass when youre forced to retreat into a canyon because flying saucers are somehow always behind you. Its steep, but once you conquer the learning curve youre capable of exhilarating take-downs.Becoming proficient with Wills jetpack is a challenging yet rewarding experience, but the game fails to take full advantage of its signature gameplay. Just when Teslas toy begins to feel like a part of you, the game falls back on the old trope of temporarily stripping you of your power. As if this little hiccup werent annoying enough, the game ends rather abruptly and you feel as if you were never able to fully stretch your wings after gaining all your powers. Whats worse, the level design within the game rarely feels like its truly testing your flyboy-mettle. Dark Void is a game that I wanted desperately to love. All the pieces were in place to provide a visceral, freeing, shoot-em-up-and-blast-off experience. Unfortunately, the shining strengths of the game are buried underneath a thick layer of rust that only the thirstiest of air-junkies should bother scrubbing through.", "date": "Jan 20, 2010", "grade": "7"}
