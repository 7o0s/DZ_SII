Still, the titles gameplay, career mode, and online suite are sufficient and compelling, making NASCAR Heat 4 the strongest title in the series to date  even if its flaws make it more admirable than excellent.The best addition to the game is the host of sliders that change both your car and those of any A.I. racers. These cover aspects like tire wear, pack spacing, ability by the A.I. to recover from contact, as well as those addressing the overall difficulty of the experience. The effect on the track is more exciting racing due to a host of factors created by those sliders, from more drafting partners to the overall nerfing of the A.I. drivers, resulting in more interesting currents during the race such as realistic A.I. lap times that create pit strategies during long green flag runs or surprise cautions.NASCAR Heat 4 has better pack spread, whether thats stretching out the overall field or having A.I. cars choosing different lines on the track. That being said, I question the viability of those different lines on the tracks. Its good that some A.I. cars take a high line at times, but either through their setups or driving ability, they arent faster overall and they dont stick with these lines consistently. This means youll still get freight trained from below because thats the default fast line for the A.I.As far as the games A.I. has come, more work is needed. The localized rubber banding causes cars to catch up and pass you, but then settle in and slow down in front of you. Also, the A.I. lap times do indeed reflect tire wear, but they dont drive like they actually have worn tires.Online racing has its own problems. Not only is it missing features like matchmaking, grief protection, or leagues, it still hasnt instituted practice/qualifying sessions. It also doesnt offer settings available in other parts of the game that could aid the experience such as restricting the effects of car collisions.The games career mode is improved, although its not drastically different from last year. It can take longer to save money for your racing organization due to more differentiated contract payouts  but not too much longer. Similarly, I like juggling different cars chassis that are best suited for specific track types as well as employee specialization; resource management is tougher but not excruciating.One of the areas that needs work is the friends and rivalries system. Someone praising or shaking their fist at you often doesnt match up with what actually happened on the track. However, no matter what theres always a draft partner available, which goes to show how surface the whole rivalry system is in general.NASCAR Heat 4s A.I. is a work in progress, the career mode is adequate, and the online suite is behind the times. Nevertheless, its the best offering to date even if its not totally dialed in, forcing you to get up on that steering wheel and dig deep for your spot on the track.", "date": "Sep 10, 2019", "grade": "7.25"}
