{"name": "Rock Revolution", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/rock_revolution/b/xbox360/archive/2009/09/22/review.aspx", "text": "There's a temptation to completely trash Rock Revolution on PS3 and 360 simply because it doesn't meet the high quality bar set by the other two big music franchises. However, in all fairness, Konami's attempt to embrace the full band experience (minus vocals) can be pretty enjoyable at times.There are some stellar songs to play, even if many of the cover versions are awful. The menu reveals occasionally interesting variations on the gameplay, though at least some, like the studio mode, are laughably bare bones. At least you can use your existing music game peripherals, which will likely be a more popular choice than tackling the challenge of Konami's seven-input drum pad. All told, Rock Revolution is exactly what you'd expect from the music game genre, assuming the last three years never happened.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "7"}
