At first I thought it was a shill forMonster Energy  that's just how uninspiring and unmotivated much of this gameis.Mud features 84 real riders and a dozen tracks on thecircuit, but it's the racing itself that reduces its scope and strangles itsambition. The tracks may feature mud, undulating terrain, and hundreds of ccsof bike power, but it looks and feels too stiff to be immersive. Riders don'thave a lot of range in their movement, and the bikes feel like they are almostgliding on the dirt. The effect is that although the game delivers a sense ofspeed and you'll fly through the air off of jumps (as well as gain speed boostsfor kicking out your back wheel in mid-air), as you're racing you don't feellike you're sliding the bike through the dirt, bouncing the shocks, andfinessing the bike around the course.Another disappointing aspect of the game is that althoughthe game modes are all-encompassing, they definitely leave you wanting more.You can pick the races you want to comprise the FIM championship, but it lacks anyfanfare. The Mud World Tour mode lets you race as different ~heroes~; upgradingtheir stats and doing different types of races like checkpoint, trick battles,and head to head, but it's not balanced well. The trick battles can be spammedwith the same basic tricks (negating the need to buy new ones), and althoughthe game encourages you to switch riders in this mode according to their proficiencies,it's not always necessary.I commend the developer forincluding different modes, but their inadequacies reveal a title that doesn'tfully develop any one aspect of itself.", "date": "Feb 26, 2013", "grade": "6"}
