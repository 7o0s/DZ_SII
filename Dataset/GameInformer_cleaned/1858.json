It offers the same engaging characters, deftly designed levels, and memorable score as its console counterparts, with a few additional Vita extras. It is lacking a proper multiplayer mode, however, which is the only real ding against an otherwise excellent launch title.If youve played through the game on consoles, you know what to expect here. The same beautiful levels are here, along with the responsive controls that make navigating them a joy. The world of Rayman Origins is as gorgeous as it is tricky, with areas as diverse as underwater grottos and food-themed paradises offering old-school platforming challenges.Ubisoft added a few extras for the games Vita release, including an all-new hidden collectable. Whenever you hear a bone-rattling sound, thats your cue to scan the backgrounds for the elusive fresco fragment. A simple touch collects it, where its added to a larger painting back in your home base. A new pinch-and-zoom feature makes it easier to pore over the landscape for the hidden objects, while also giving you an excuse to absorb the games exquisitely crafted atmosphere.The only real disappointment with Vitas version of Rayman Origins is the lack of any proper multiplayer mode. Being able to bounce through levels with up to four players was a real treat, and its absence is conspicuous. Ubisoft has added a concession in the form of sharable ghost runs, though I didnt really think racing against a friend was ultimately as compelling as working cooperatively to save the day (and rescuing each other in the process).Ultimately, Rayman Origins is still a fantastic game, with or without multiplayer. If you havent checked it out yet, you now have one more reason to give it a shot.", "date": "Feb 14, 2012", "grade": "8"}
