Apart from one entry onthe Wii, the bulk of the Fatal Frame franchise still remains on the PlayStation2 (watch us play the original Fatal Frame on Replay). The latest title, Fatal Frame: Maiden of the Black Water for the Wii U,turns the Gamepad into your very own Camera Obscura. Despite that new novelty,it still has one foot firmly planted in a PS2-era grave.Maiden of the Black Water eases players in with a promisingstart, beckoning them to explore ruined buildings with sparse ghost encountersthat help build the tension. I love how the game toys with players by draggingout the simple process of opening a door or picking up an item, usually withoutevent (though sometimes a ghostly hand might grab your wrist). All this is enhancedby a masterfully crafted atmosphere, where fog hangs in the air, wisps ofspectral figures linger around corners, and every new hallway presents apossible ambush. The traditional Japanese environments evoke classic Japanesehorror films like Ju-On and Ringuto great effect.However, instead ofmaintaining a more reserved and subtle pace, Fatal Frame piles on the ghostencounters and repeats the same jump-scare tactics that eventually leave yournerves numb from the bombardment. Players ward off the increasing numbers of floating ghostswith their Camera Obscura  a mystical device that rewards good photography bydealing extra damage to specters. This mechanic works similarly to past titles,where players attempt to get as many ghosts in frame at once while timing shotsbetween loading in new film. The Gamepad can be held up, moved, and even tiltedvertically to capture the perfect shot. This begins as a neat implementation ofthe Wii U's underutilized tech, but it comes at the sacrifice of yourperipheral vision and ultimately feels inelegant. Imagine trying to use a telescopelens to take pictures of a hyperactive cat that can run through walls. Additionally,the types of and frequency of ghost encounters are so similar that theyeventually become chores instead of ordeals. Once you switch over to thetraditional control scheme where your camera's view is silhouetted on the bigscreen, you won't want to go back.Maiden of the Black Water is only available via the Wii U eShopSpeaking of going back, Maiden of the Black Water doublesdown on one of the horror series' (and genre's) oldest stumbling blocks:backtracking. Your crew of wooden characters (you take turns playing multipleghost-busting photographers with trivially different cameras) return to thesame inn, forest, and shrine ad nauseum. Sometimes two characters take turnssearching for each other, following the exact same trail over the river andthrough the woods. More than once I was convinced I had accidentally started achapter I already finished. Mushy character movement makes navigating theserepeated, maze-like environments even more of a trial.The initial promise of the mysterious folktales involvingthe suicides of Mount Hikami also suffers from the protracted framework. Thegrainy, found footage-style flashbacks are creepy glimpses into the mountain'shistory of bizarre water rituals, involving painful contortion and drowning. However,the overlarge cast of vapid characters makes discerning everyone's motives andwhereabouts difficult. Maiden of the Black Water also leans too heavily onfound notebook pages to unravel its tale, made worse by its flowery emo-diaryvernacular. Some horror games skillfully wield repetition as a tool,letting players grow accustomed to the familiar to set up scares both subtleand cuss-worthy. Unfortunately, Maiden of the Black Water is waterlogged withrepeated environments and monotonous phantasmagorical photo sessions.", "date": "Oct 19, 2015", "grade": "5.5"}
