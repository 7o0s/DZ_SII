The snarling beasts are much faster than you, and their unwavering determination to chase you down is unsettling. Once the novelty of that encounter wears off, you'll spend the next few skirmishes focusing on headshots - the only actual way to kill them. Eventually you start wondering just how many more of the stupid things are crammed in Pandora's Box.When art thief Charles Deckard opened the mythical container for a shadowy client, he probably had no idea that the legendary item was essentially a clown car full of a handful of repeating enemies. Aside from the disconcertingly bald werewolves, players will blast their way through hordes of the same griffons, minotaurs, and Black Order operatives. Even the few epic boss encounters can't save the otherwise generic gameplay. Legendary has a fairly interesting story, but the by-the-books gameplay is in dire need of some caffeine. Deckard gains a few mysterious abilities at the beginning, including the ability to heal himself and use a feeble Force-push like move that's basically worthless. The levels take place around the world, but they're basically the same crumbled cities with different textures and color palettes. The destruction and chaos at the very beginning of the story is amazing, but everything that follows feels mundane in comparison. If you've cleared one room of werewolves and soldiers, it feels like you've done them all. Legendary is by no means awful - it's just about as vanilla as first-person shooters get. It all wraps up with a completely unsatisfying ''wait for the sequel'' type cliffhanger. We'll see.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "6.5"}
