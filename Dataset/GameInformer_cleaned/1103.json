{"name": "Knack", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/knack/b/playstation4/archive/2013/11/13/bringing-old-school-platforming-to-next-gen.aspx", "text": "Directed by legendary designer MarkCerny - who is also the architect of the PlayStation 4 - Knack is a relativerarity. Firstly, it's a brand-new franchise releasing alongside a new console.Secondly, it's an action/platform game based around a cute (and sometimefearsome) creature with a cartoonish look -a genre that's long past itscommercial prime. While I doubt Knack will ever be the public mascot for PlayStation4, it's a well-crafted game and a quality title in the system's launch lineup.Cerny's background includes work onsuch franchises as Crash Bandicoot, Ratchet & Clank, and Jak and Daxter. He'san expert in this style of game, and that experience shows. While it's notreally innovative, Knack nails the basics of gameplay and design to an extentthat make it a pleasure to play from start to finish.The story revolves around amysterious attack on human civilization by a previously primitive race of trolls,who are now equipped with the latest in military tanks, weapons, and airships.To help thwart the threat, a government scientist and rogue adventurer form aparty to go investigate. They bring along Knack, a being created by the doctor andcomposed of hundreds of relics -the same relics that have been used byhumans as a never-ending source of power.The story relies heavily on somewell-worn sci-fi clichs, but it's well told and populated with some engagingcharacters. The few twists in the final stretch are telegraphed hours earlier,but overall it serves its purpose of moving things along a series of exoticlocales.Like the Crash Bandicoot games,Knack uses a fixed camera that allows the developers to use a range ofperspectives. While this can be problematic in some games, there was rarely amoment when the camera wasn't where I wanted it to be -no small feat. However,don't be fooled by appearances -Knack places an emphasis on the ~action~side of the action/platform formula, dishing out combat that's as challengingas anything I've played this year.The basic mechanics are simple; you have oneattack button, a dodge move on the right analog stick, and three two-buttoncombos that unleash special moves like a shockwave or one that turns Knack intoa deadly tornado of relic shards. It doesn't sound like much, but the myriadenemies you face force you to use this small selection of moves in a widevariety of ways. Even on normal difficulty, you die often. Surprisingly, thetense battles often made me recall the God of War series. Many larger enemiescan deliver one-hit kills, so learning to dodge and counter effectively iscrucial to conquering this game. The basics are handled so well that I wishthey were expanded upon; there are no unlockable moves or specials. There's also a drop-in, drop-out co-op mode that feels completely tacked on; it's literally the bare minimum required to list that feature on the back of the box. While combat is excellent, theplatforming is routine. I enjoyed the handful of memorable sequences, but they arelargely things that fans of the genre have seen dozens of times. While theplatforming control isn't bad, I had the slight feeling that Knack was onlygliding over the levels, not fully connected. It lacks that perfect feel thatthe best in the genre attain. Still, the platforming serves its purpose,balancing out the pace between the hectic bouts of combat.Though it's a launch game for a next-gen system,Knack is almost nostalgic; it's the kind of game they don't make that oftenanymore. As such, it's not the most innovative or the most visually dazzlinggame. This won't be the one you put in to show off your new console to yourfriends. However, when you're done with the prettied-up versions of the bigfranchises, you'll find yourself wanting to return to Knack. It's got charm andheart,and offers a whole lot of good gameplay. Ultimately, that's stillwhat's important -no matter which generation we're in.", "date": "on Nov 13, 2013", "grade": "8.25"}
