Over theyears, the Atelier games have stayed close to their traditional RPG roots  atendency that puts them at risk of becoming banal. However, developer Gusttakes more chances to shake things up with Atelier Sophie: The Alchemist of theMysterious Book, and it pays off. It emphasizes the series best parts (likethe alchemy system) and shores up the weaker aspects of the formula.  Alchemy isthe heart and soul of the Atelier games, and finding ingredients and combiningthem to make new items is still exciting enough to become an obsession. Theengaging loop of foraging, discovering recipes, and crafting gear for battlemade it hard for me to put the game down, giving me a gotta make them allfeeling every time I unlocked a new recipe. AtelierSophie adds a new level of complexity to item synthesis that makes it even moresatisfying thanks to a material placement system, which gives you more controlover the quality of your creations. When you pick your ingredients, you mustplace them into a grid on your cauldron; ingredients have different shapes andtake up a different amount of tiles, making it almost a game of Tetris whereyou try to find the most optimal way possible to place every ingredient.Material placement can make or break how powerful your creations are,especially since overlapping ingredients nullify surrounding bonuses. I had funfiguring out the most efficient method to give my item the best boosts andquality possible, feeling like I had more of a hand in the final product.Creatingitems and traveling took entire days off the calendar in prior installments,but they can now be completed in hours. You can also play at your own pacewithout strict time restrictions on the main quest, which revolves aroundrestoring a talking books recipes. The new time system compelled me to exploremore, since I didnt have to rush to complete any task thrown my way.Exploration is also rewarding as fighting a monster or finding a new area justmight spark Sophie to think up a new alchemy recipe.When yourenot using your alchemy chops or chatting with the locals, youre out in thefield collecting ingredients and fighting monsters. The turn-based battlesystem is focused on offensive and defensive stances. You can see the turnorder on the side to make the best decision. You want to use defensive stancesto avoid extra damage, but when you have the upper hand, especially if youcancel out a turn, the offensive stance wastes enemies in a jiffy.Supportattacks/guards, where teammates do a follow-up move or block an oncoming attackfor you once you chain enough attacks, return. Having characters in the samestance can also trigger more powerful supports. The issue of party members blockingattacks and taking damage for you when theyre low on HP still exists though,which is frustrating. The battle system isnt anything groundbreaking, but itrequires enough strategy that I paid attention to each turn and didnt mash myway to victory. Plus, all characters special attacks are powerful in their ownway, from damaging enemies for consecutive turns to weakening foes attackpower.Anotherdelightful improvement is the progression of getting to know the townspeople.In previous games, I thought events with them came few and far between andrequired way more specific actions to trigger. In Sophie, just visiting them onregular basis unlocked a bevy of events making them feel more consistent. Ienjoyed the steady flow of new scenes with these eclectic individuals, whichinclude a puppeteer and a shrinking lady. This isnt my favorite cast, but alot of the characters are likeable and remain interesting throughout. Thishelps the main storyline, which is more rote than anything. The narrative ispredictable, and the concept of a magical talking book is a tired trope thatfailed to capture my interest. Even so, I still found something charming aboutthe characters, with their humorous interactions and desire to band togetherand help one another. You dont have to be a series veteran to approach thestory, as its self-contained; some characters from past entries show up, buttheir roles are easily understood. Coupled with the gradually introduced newmechanics, this makes Atelier Sophie extremely accessible, and a great place tostart for newcomers.I could go on about more of the refinements Ienjoyed, such as the weather system affecting what items you find and therumors becoming much more useful and easy to track down, but my main takeawayremains the same: Atelier Sophie improves on an already fun and engagingformula. The better progression and deepening of its signature alchemy systemmakes it one of my favorite entries in the long-running series. Just when Ithought things were becoming stale, Gust proves it still has plenty of tricks upits sleeve.", "date": "Jun 07, 2016", "grade": "8"}
