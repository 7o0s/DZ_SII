The game starts with Shaun tagging along as a fewof his schlubby friends drive to the airport, ready to embark on amulti-tiered global competition. However, the second his friends reachtheir gate, Shaun sprints off to polish his medals and make Red Bullads. You play as Shaun late in the game, but most of the time youreriding without him. Its unfortunate, because his friends  and thegame in general  could have benefited from some professional expertise. Upto three friends can join in at any time and co-op progress transfersover to your single-player game, but you might not feel likeprogressing through this skin-deep snowboarding sim. Shauns trick setwas pretty thin last year, and Ubisoft hasnt done much to teach himanything new. The shallow gameplay suffers because trick recovery andrailgrinding are still too forgiving.Ubisoft mixes up the actionwith a variety of half-pipe challenges, timed scoring challenges, andpure speed races. The new streamlined courses seem more conscious ofthe fact that you are using a motion controller, letting youconcentrate on stringing tricks together rather than having to focus onpreventing your player from plowing straight into the course fence.Onenew feature is World Stages create-a-trick mode. If you have a WiiMotionPlus you can design your own moves by having your boardersreplicate the motions you make with the Wii remote. Its a nice conceptbut its hard to translate your trick ideas into the real thing. Theother Wii peripheral World Stage uses is the Wii Balance board, but youshould just stick to using the standard remote. You might as well ridea peanut-butter covered skateboard down an elephants back for howimpractical and testy Shauns controls become on the balance board.Shaun may have walked away with the gold, but his games still cant qualify.", "date": "Nov 16, 2009", "grade": "6"}
