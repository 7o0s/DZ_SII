{"name": "Tenchu Shadow Assassin", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/tenchu_shadow_assassin/b/wii/archive/2009/09/22/review.aspx", "text": "Shadow Assassins continues the tale of Rikimaru and Ayame, two deadly ninjas struggling to keep the peace in feudal Japan. The game puts you in the shoes of a skillful ninja who can perform group stealth kills, run up walls to lay in wait for a passing guard, and bounce silently across the rafters while stalking evil merchants. The Wii's motion controls add an extra dimension to the creative stealth kill animations. However, the clunky controls, frustrating camera, and broken combat all spoil the game's flow. The unintentionally hilarious Hanna-Barbera voice work ruins the mood. Acquire, developer of the original Tenchu, has tried to point this series back in the right direction, and Shadow Assassins provides some fun moments, but you'll have to sneak past all the annoying bits to experience them.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "6.5"}
