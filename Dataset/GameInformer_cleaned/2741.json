After years of players turning the sights oneach other in online multiplayer, developers like Epic Games and Valvebrought gamers together to fend off Locust hordes and zombies.Publishing powerhouse EA joined the co-op revolution with Army of Two,an over-the-top send-up of gratuitous violence starring twofrat-boys-turned-mercenaries. The lure of co-op helped the game sellwell, but its sophomoric brand of humor and lackluster gunplay did itno favors. The sequel, The 40th Day, does little to distinguish itselffrom its predecessor. Wisecracking goons Salem and Rios returnwith their strange masks in tow, but EA thankfully turned down the dialon the heinous attempts at comedy in favor of a more somber setup.While the two are on a routine mission in Shanghai, the city comesunder attack from an unknown private military contractor. Asskyscrapers fall around them and citizens flee in panic, our two mercshave one objective  escape the city by any means necessary. Thoughthis seems a good setup for a harrowing survival story, the plot islargely buried in radio logs players access from the pause screen. Inits place, EA Montreal inserts a series of standalone save thecivilian hostages scenarios and ethical dilemmas where players canmake arbitrary moral choices with no context. Without the necessarybackground to inform your decision, these moments come off as shallow,and the comedic twists in the subsequent cutscenes do little to makeyou care.When the masked mercs arent flexing their pea brainswith ethical decisions, theyre flexing their trigger fingers in aseries of close quarters battles. The Shanghai environments giveplayers just enough room to use the games superfluous and quizzicalAggro system, in which one player fires at enemies to draw theirattention to turn the other player invisible. This makes pulling offflanking maneuvers a breeze, but expect to get flanked yourself byshotgun-wielding super baddies who ruthlessly spawn in areas youthought were already clear.The core combat mechanic performsadmirably, but also suffers from a sketchy contextual cover system anda lack of button customization. The most irksome problem is the poorcontrol mapping. When your partner goes down (which happens frequentlythanks to the uninformative damage indicator), you must run up to himand hold the A button to revive him. Unfortunately, the A button alsohandles the running functionality, which means your character mayaccidentally start running or execute a combat roll when youre tryingto revive your partner in a frantic situation.The hindrancesdont end there. Army of Twos terrible checkpoint system saves far tooinfrequently, forcing you to rewatch cutscenes and re-fight largegroups of enemies before returning you to the situation that was givingyou trouble. It also fails to save after you go into weaponscustomization, which means you have to repurchase all your weapons andupgrades every time you restart after dying.The multiplayerfares better with its four enjoyable game modes  most notably theHorde-like Extraction mode that tasks four players with fending offwaves of enemies. Why EA Montreal failed to integrate player rankings, aprogression system, and weapons customization into the multiplayerexperience is the most puzzling decision the developer made, especiallyconsidering the fantastic arsenal options the single-player campaignoffers. Instead, players are left with a handful of weapon presets.Withso many great co-op experiences available to gamers, its tough torecommend The 40th Day. Lacking a cohesive story, solid controls, keymultiplayer features, and polish, this sequel fails to close the gap ofmediocrity running through its core game design.", "date": "Jan 12, 2010", "grade": "6.5"}
