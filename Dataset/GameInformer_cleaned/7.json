While thestudent-doodle aesthetic is certainly novel, it takes its toll on the gameplay.At best, the on-screen action is muddled by sparsely detailed visuals and uglyHUD. At worst, it's a literal eyesore that leaves you with a headache. Nevertheless,Drawn To Death doubles down on the angsty teen concept with buckets of immature gags andinsults, and from there it's a race to see what makes you stop playing first.I don't want to spend toomuch time harping on Drawn To Death's odious presentation, because it's exactlythe type of attention the game so desperately craves. Everything from theinsult-spewing tutorial toad to the obscenity-shouting announcer is designed totitillate and offend. There's a reason for that: Beneath the constant stream ofaural and visual vulgarities, Drawn To Death is a woefully underwhelming arenashooter. Sophomoric jokes  like a gaping, in-game rectum that houses a healthpower-up  hope to distract you from Drawn To Death's myriad inadequacies.These include a small character roster, by-the-numbers game modes, and a four-playermatch size limit  which the game still has trouble filling despite Sony givingit away free to everyone with a PlayStation Plus account and low expectations.Drawn To Death's multiplayermodes consist of 1v1 brawls, 2v2 team deathmatch, 3- or 4-player free-for-alls,and a mode where you pick up drops from slain enemies and deposit them forpoints. In other words, it offers nothing you haven't played in a hundred othershooters. Which mode you get depends on how many players the matchmaking canwrangle up in the minutes-long wait time before the round begins. Even days after launch, full four-playermatches are rare. Regardless of the player count, the small map sizes keep theaction moving, but the core mechanics aren't fluid or responsive enough to makeit satisfying.Drawn To Death's charactersare a little more memorable, thanks to their unique abilities. Ninjaw (a buxomanime ninja with a shark head) can use her oversized anchor to hookshot her wayaround maps, while Cyborgula (a cyborg gargoyle) can hover over the battlefieldwith a tap of the button. However, the button inputs and techniques for eachcharacter's abilities aren't intuitive or uniform, so you have to rely on rotememorization to learn everyone's move sets. The same is true for eachcharacter's pros and cons, which make them strong/weak against other specific individuals.Devoted players may find some depth and strategy in these nuances, but withsuch underwhelming modes and gameplay, there's no reason to become devoted inthe first place. After a few matches, most players will be ready to move on toa bigger, better game.If not, Drawn To Death has some innovative newways for punishing your decision to stick with it. Beyond the insult-slinging announcerand characters, players are plied with a wide variety of unlockable taunts to spamother players with. These animated images pop up on player avatars and killscreens, and emulate the dankest of internet memes. For example, I unlocked atombstone with the witty slogan ~R.I.P. Your Ass.~ To drive the joke home, thetombstone itself is also shaped like a butt. I can't think of a better metaphorical representation of what Drawn to Death is, or why you can skip it.", "date": "Apr 07, 2017", "grade": "5"}
