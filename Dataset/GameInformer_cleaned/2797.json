{"name": "Need for Speed: Nitro", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/need_for_speed_nitro/b/wii/archive/2009/11/11/review.aspx", "text": "When EA split off the Need for Speed franchises into differentstreams, with Nitro being the more fun, arcadey title as opposed toShifts more realistic focus, it made sense. I didnt agree with thedecision, but at a minimum I could see how it might imbue the serieswith a clear focus that it seemed to have lost in recent years  albeitin two seperate titles. Given that mandate, I expected Nitro to comeout screaming with a vengeance, but this is far from the distilledessence of NFSs cops-and-cars.Need for Speed: Nitro takes placeon a series of confined tracks. Not only will you repeatedly visit themthroughout the game, but the lack of freedom they give you makesbattling the cops no fun at all. In fact, not having freeform copchases seems like an anathema to the series. Furthermore, a scant twokinds of power-ups (one for repairing your car and the other to sic thecops on other racers) dont do much to invigorate the moment-to-momentracing. The car customization features (which carry over into yourgraphics being imposed upon the tracks as you race) also arentanything to hang your hat on.The games bronze, silver, and goldcups take you to the same five cities through the game, so the varietycomes more in the race types such as elimination (last place car isknocked out per lap), drift challenge, drag racing, time attack,circuit, and speed trap. The latter was perhaps the most interesting,as you have to carry as much speed as you can through certain sectionsof the track in order to clock the highest total speeds. Drifting wasalso fun, and doing it in all types of races is beneficial since itgets you an extra star towards your career progression.Make nomistake about it: Need for Speed: Nitros competitive advantageshouldnt be the motion controls  it should be the series penchantfor arcade racing, supercharged cop chases, and edge-of-your-seatracing. Unfortunately It doesnt even come close to delivering on thesefronts. But, by all means, have some motion controls.", "date": "Nov 11, 2009", "grade": "6.5"}
