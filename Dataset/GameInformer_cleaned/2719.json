Yes, it did  back in 2009 on the Xbox 360.  But wait! This is the international version  where the term international means The exact same game with a few more language options. The only substantial difference between the two iterations is the platform; now PlayStation 3 owners can dive into this disappointingly average adventure.Starring a doofus named Edge Maverick, The Last Hope is a game with high ambitions and middling execution. The real-time battle system is fast-paced and cool  my favorite aspect being the ability to accrue various bonuses in combat that impact your end-battle rewards. Unfortunately, repetitive encounters and the storys grueling pace put the fun parts too far apart, sapping away most of the entertainment. Plus, the awkward dialogue makes it practically impossible to care about any of the characters, so key story moments dont pack much of a punch.Unless listening to Japanese voiceovers or reading German subtitles infinitely enhances your RPG experience, there isnt much of a draw here. The Last Hope wasnt a terrible game when it first released, and it still isnt. But even PS3 gamers who would be playing it for the first time should be wary about a purchase  especially with the release of Final Fantasy XIII nearly upon us.", "date": "Feb 09, 2010", "grade": "7"}
