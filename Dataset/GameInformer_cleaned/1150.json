It found its hook nearly 20 years ago and has held on firm for better and worse. In this way, changing things in Pokmon presents a certain degree of uncomfortable risk. X & Y offer no significant changes in direction to the Pokmon series, but this is the most drastic step the series has ever taken.Pokmon X & Y looks far different from previous Pokmon games. Pokmon are no longer restricted to 2D sprites, and participate in combat as fully modeled creatures. Instead of making a couple of two-dimensional images butt heads, you now see creatures with their own idle animations and combat moves come to life on screen. It may be a clich to say they, come to life, but the new models make a difference. The Pokmon now feel more real than they ever have. The polygonal models also allow the camera to move around the combat arena making every battle more engrossing.The Difference Between X & YX & Y are identical in most regards, but there are a few things that separate the two and will influence your purchasing decision. As is the case with almost every Pokmon release, there is a different legendary Pokemon exclusive to each version. The other big separation are the types of Mega Evolutions for Charizard and Mewtwo. Those Pokmon have different Mega Evolution forms in each game, and its up to you to decide which one you find the most aesthetically pleasing. There are other minor differences between the two, but Nintendo wants to keep those a secret.The world itself also benefits from the new dimension. This isnt the first time weve walked around in a modeled, non-flat Pokmon world, but this is the first time that the full game has been presented this way. In previous Pokmon games, only certain parts of the world were 3D, creating a disconnect between the landscapes. With every building, plant, character, and signpost modeled in 3D, theres no separation and the world feels more fluid, consistent, and explorable.The path through the game and its interconnected cities and towns is more rigid in X & Y, with fewer branches and opportunities to get lost. Pokmon fans who love exploring dense maze-like regions are going to be disappointed by the lack of opportunities to veer off the beaten path, but it helps the pacing tremendously. It also makes the world more inviting to new players and those who have stepped away for a few years and are interested in returning. The streamlined world meant that I always had a good sense of where I was, and never felt like I was venturing into areas that I shouldnt have.Despite the smartly implemented world constrictions, walking around and tracking down wild Pokmon in the tall grass is still exciting. That exciting feeling of coming across a brand-new Pokmon youve never seen before, or finally catching that one that has been eluding you still comes through, and is aided by the games new look. And watching them evolve into new forms continues to be the ultimate reward for leveling your team.As you explore the Kalos region, you meet hundreds of trainers who like to stop you for no particular reason, and politely fight with you. My favorite was a young girl in pink dress in the middle of a rainy swamp who made me stop everything I was doing to ask me, Do you like fairy tales or reality more? Then we battled. These bizarre interactions are often entertaining, and sometimes worth a chuckle.Many familiar pocket monsters return in X & Y, which is exciting as you get to see them in their new 3D models. Some of the new Pokmon are laughably bad, like Spewpa, who looks like a bugs head wrapped in a blanket. However, the new Pokmon who are meant to be cute (like Bunnelby) are exactly that, and the cool and ferocious Pokmon like (Tyrantrum) are worth adding to your team. Even the bad ones are fun to discover and show off.Mega Evolutions are one of Pokmon X & Ys most publicized new features and while they are cool, they dont drastically change combat. Once you find the appropriate item and attach it to the appropriate Pokmon, mega evolving can be performed during battle, and does not eliminate a turn. Its a free move to make your fighter stronger, and seeing the additional evolutions are exciting. The one downside to the Mega Evolutions is the necessity of sitting through their animations each time you use them  which is often.Online MultiplayerAt the time of review, online functionality was not active for Pokmon X & Y. Nintendo and Game Freak wont be turning on the servers until the game launches on October 12. However, we played with local multiplayer, and were impressed by its implementation. You can easily send nearby players friendly pre-determined messages, battle, trade Pokmon with them, or add them to your friends list with their permission. This multiplayer functionality can be accessed without the need to visit a Pokmon Center.When the game launches worldwide, we will play with X & Ys online functionality and update our review if necessary. If it does not significantly impact the experience, consider this the definitive review.Other new features add less to the game, but are welcome changes regardless. I liked being able to change my trainers clothing, but I wish the options were more diverse. Pokmon-Amie lets you interact with your Pokmon like you would in Nintendogs, but is thankfully not necessary for progression. Taking time out of my busy training schedule to pet my Pokmon and feed them chocolate was something I was happy to ignore. Super Training allows you to passively train your Pokmons attributes, which is great. As you explore and battle, your Pokmon practices on a punching bag on the lower screen without your interaction. There are forgettable minigames that you can choose to play to speed Super Training up, but thankfully they are optional.Pokmon X & Y does not break the mold of what we expect when we play a Pokmon game. It goes down the checklist of important Pokmon features, neatly ticking them off one by one. It still feels like a Pokmon game, but the ease of player control, the updated art direction, 3D graphics, and the scaling of the world make everything more inviting, attractive, and fun. Its a great stepping-on point for new trainers, and a worthwhile continuing adventure for those who know what to expect.", "date": "Oct 12, 2013", "grade": "8.75"}
