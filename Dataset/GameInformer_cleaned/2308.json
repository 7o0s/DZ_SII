Though the basic mechanics of the franchise have been effective, Pokmon fanatics have been clamoring for the series to evolve for years. While the latest franchise entries, Black and White, dont necessarily make any major leaps in innovation, they do take steps in the right direction.Professor Juniper kicks off the action by sending our matured protagonist on a lengthy adventure to complete the Pokdex, battle trainers across the expansive Unova region, earn gym badges, and ultimately become the Pokmon champion  pretty much standard fare. While veteran trainers might be put off by some of the explanations on how to catch and train Pokmon early on, the action quickly picks up with the introduction of Team Plasma, a group bent on the liberation of Pokmon and releasing them from the selfish demands of their trainers. Regular encounters with the team while exploring Unova unveil that their intentions of freeing Pokmon are not as benevolent as they seem.Unova is home to memorable hot spots such as the business district of Castelia and the center of entertainment, Nimbasa City. Upon entering each location, you see how far the series has come from a technical standpoint as sweeping camera angles show off each citys amazing detail and scale. Towns scattered across the massive world map are home to a number of fun diversions such as Pokmon musicals, arena battles, and the occasional NPC who lost a Pokmon and needs your help. These tasks break up the hours spent scouring patches of grass for new captures.Just like in any other Pokmon title, youll spend a large amount of time engaged in battle. With the new Pokmon introduced in Black and White, finding a fresh face and developing new strategies based on the unfamiliar opponents strengths and weaknesses is part of the fun. To mix things up, 3v3 battles are introduced for the first time in the series, requiring a new level of strategy by determining which Pokmon to send out while being mindful of the elemental properties of your opponents. This addition injects a much-needed dose of variety, but you still spend the bulk of your experience in single and double battles, since 3v3 doesnt make an appearance until much later. Still, once you put together a winning team, battles of any size are just as addicting as ever, and only get more satisfying as your Pokmon evolve.Pokmon Black and White do a great job building upon already solid features and taking them to the next level. With new Pokmon, fun characters, unforgettable locations, and changes to the battle system, Game Freak has given true fans a reason to become a trainer again.", "date": "zalez on Mar 04, 2011", "grade": "8.75"}
