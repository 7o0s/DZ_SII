Some have family lineages that spangenerations, and others hone their building skills to create iconic landmarks.These dedicated players have worked hard building their worlds, so asking themto start over with new iteration isn't a small request. To justify thetransition, a sequel needs to provide compelling new content while building onthe innovations it has already made. This is where The Sims 4 fails. It hassome interesting tweaks, but doesn't do enough to entice players to upgrade. The Sims 4 introduces some promising changes. I love thatsims now multitask and naturally converse in groups. Seeing parents take theirdinner upstairs to chat while kids do homework is just one example of realisticbehavior. Sims are also more expressive thanks to the new emotion system. Newdialogue options and extra activities appear based on your sims' emotionalstate; if my sim is confident, she can write a motivational book. Some activitiestied to emotions are just stupid, though. Maxis has always had a sense ofhumor, but being able to ~pee like a champion~ and ~take a angry poop~ doesn'tadd anything. Emotions also fluctuate too quickly during group conversations;going through three disparate moods in a flash doesn't give you time tocapitalize on any benefits (and makes you question a sim's sanity). Your basic needs bars are still present, but they take abackseat to the emotion system and drain slower. This gives you plenty ofopportunities to socialize and build up your skills. The career system has beenrevamped, and professions eventually branch into more specific aspirations, likebecoming an eSports competitor or a start-up entrepreneur. I like that the newcareer system rewards you with items when you're promoted, and how reachingcertain career levels unlocks special items to purchase. The Sims 4's greatest achievement is the small progressionthroughout your activities. If your sim is a gamer, expect access to more gamesas you enhance that skill. Eventually, you can even unlock the option tolivestream. These clever changes don't turn the experience on its head, but Ienjoyed seeing new things open up even after I'd been playing for 20 hours.Unfortunately, familiar problems plague The Sims 4. Whilethe A.I. pathing has been improved, it still has issues. For instance, if yousend sims to the refrigerator too close together, one of them abandons the taskeven if they're still far away. Dish-clearing is apparently too complicated forthem, as well. I had numerous times where my sims simply couldn't stackmultiple dishes and would just put them down instead of washing them. I felt prettyconfident leaving the A.I. sims to their own devices, but they still need to bemonitored. Still, just letting my sims free and watching the dramaunfold remains one of my favorite things. I like that a game focused on controlcan still have unpredictability. My housekeeper actually dropped dead forunknown reasons while cleaning my sink. I had to mourn his death, watch theGrim Reaper take him away, and then deal with the urn. Afterward, Death hungout and watched TV with my sims. Fun stories like this are what make The Sims 4thrive. That being said, The Sims 3 innovated on making the worldfeel alive, and one of The Sims 4's biggest disappointments is that a lot ofthose enhancements are gone. Simple things, like not being able to walk aroundthe neighborhood, broke the immersion for me. The absence of the toddler stagemakes it feel like your kids grow up too fast. The recreational lots are themost affected; you can travel between different neighborhoods, but these barrenlocales don't have much to do in them. You can fish and take your kids on thenew playground equipment, but most of the activities can be done from your home,like grilling or playing chess. This doesn't give you much reason to leave thehouse except to socialize, which makes the world feel smaller.The Sims has always been about making your options seemendless, but here they are limited. Even when making your sim with the improvedcreator, the outfits only have a few color variations. Builders are evenaffected, as basements ceased to exist and there aren't many options forcarpets or wallpapers. I like that the building tools are more accessible and provideless room for failure, but the minimal options restrict how far you can takeyour creativity. I have no doubt that, like every other Simstitle, this one will continue to grow with future expansions, but that doesn'tdo players any good right now. The Sims 4 needs to stand on its own. With allof the steps back from the baseline established by The Sims 3, it doesn't. Ifeel like I'm playing a game that's half-baked. The core formula is still fun, butThe Sims 4 isn't an improvement. The Gallerys LureThe Gallery is a great implementation. Inside the game, you can download other peoples creations and place them into your world. The Gallery is great for players like me, who arent the best builders. I found the process easy and smooth, and it looks like Maxis is doing a great job by having featured households and even challenges. I just hope the interface gets less cluttered. Right now, you can sort houses and people by most recent, most favorites, and most downloads, but cutting through the clutter is still difficult.", "date": "Sep 05, 2014", "grade": "6.75"}
