Just ask LarryDavid. The problem is that they aren't always good. You try many out,only to find that most of them don't improve your game. EA has madesome slight tweaks this year to what I think was the best Tiger ever --Tiger 08 -- but, like those golf tips, they don't improve the game.Luckily, this title still knows how to stroke the ball. My main beef with Tiger 09 is the altered skill system. The fourskill categories (Power, Accuracy, Short Game, and Putting) rise andfall automatically according to your performance. While this isn't newfor Tiger (see last year's Confidence system), all this happens becauseof Tiger's coach, Hank Haney. EA incorporated his digital likeness, andwhile it's great that Hank got paid (I'm sure golf teachers are likereal teachers -- underpaid), there's no payoff for us players. I missapplying my hard-won attribute points over a large variety ofcategories, as well as meeting and exceeding my potential by beatingTiger Challenge pros. It's like EA changed it just to call it new, whenit's actually pared down and less interesting. What really stinks aboutthis new way of rising through the ranks is that Hank's boring skilldrills didn't keep my attention nearly as long as last year's drills,which at least gave you some variety. On a similar note, it seems theimportance of your equipment has decreased, which was always one of themore fun things about Tiger.Despite these changes, Tiger is still a well-made game. The additionof a real-time swing indicator is very helpful. No longer are yousimply told you sliced the ball after the fact (no duh, I didn't intendit to veer sharply to the right). Now, you can see your shot is offercenter while you practicing your backswing. In conjunction with clubtuning (see sidebar), this mechanic allows you to optimize your swing.EA has also made small but meaningful changes to the career structure,online play (which allows you to see where your opponents' balls aregoing in real time), and the amazing GamerNet feature. Each refinesTiger in useful ways -- unlike Hank.I'm not sure why EA stripped away features that already workedbeautifully. I wish this year's five new courses were just thebeginning of the additions instead of one of the highlights, but it'llhave to do while we wait for a course creator. I guess that's just theway golf is. One day your swing is near perfection -- until it isn't.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "8.5"}
