His clothes are disheveled, hespoorly groomed, and he is clearly lost to the world. Lynch, on theother hand, while still in dire need of a shampooing, isuncharacteristically calm, almost beaming with life. Were led tobelieve that hes found his lot in life in Shanghai, the setting forKane & Lynch 2: Dog Days.The reunion of these twotrigger-happy maniacs is sharp of tongue, as expected, yet has a senseof sincerity. Kane and Lynch have changed in their time apart, yet itsclear that neither is comfortable in their new skin.Before Kanecan check in to his hotel, Lynch asks if he can run an errand first.This errand begins with Lynch kicking in a door and ends with thegames credits rolling. Any notion that the characters have evolved isstripped away once the bullets start flying.Kane & Lynch 2:Dog Days is a relentless yet faceless shooter. The protagonistspersonalities  which were prominently on display in the first game are muffled under the constant rattle of machine guns. The entire gameis one long firefight, giving little time for the player or plot tobreathe. The interesting personality flaws of Kane and Lynch rarelybleeds into the action, but we know that in their time apart, theyveboth learned how to shoot a gun properly.Most of the firefightsare intense tests of skill that nicely mix up the weapons and ranges.Your foes, which are either poorly dressed gangsters or Shanghaipolice, are intelligent enough to flank in the larger environments, andrecognize the fastest and safest route to cover. However, they haveproblems reading player movements in cooperative play (eithersplit-screen or online). On occasion, when my teammate and I wouldshift position, enemies would run into the middle of the fray or wouldtry to position themselves in the same cover location as another enemy.Rather than moving to a different spot, their body joins with theirteammate, creating a glitch-tastic visual. This problem also occurswith your teammate in single-player.Kane and Lynch: Dog Daysearns the right to be a called a respectable shooter. It doesnt earnthe right to be called a respectable game. The lack of face time withthe characters isnt the only bewildering omission. None of the levelshave a pulse. Outside of one exciting helicopter-based moment, everyfight can be classified as a by-the-numbers shootout. The result is agame that feels more like a carnival shooting gallery than a grittyadventure.I hate to say it, but the true star of this game isthe camerawork. Designed to mimic a poorly recorded YouTube video, thecamera is intentionally imperfect. Shots are framed poorly, off-screenlight sources bleach the image quality, and artifacting and distortionoccur when the camera is jostled. As odd as this is going to sound, thegrungy effect is beautifully realized.If your interest liesoutside of single-player or co-op, Dog Days offers a much deepermultiplayer experience than the first game. Fragile Alliance, the modethat starts with players working a heist together then possibly turningagainst each other, is heightened by a better selection of maps, not tomention gunplay that actually works. A variation on Fragile Alliancecalled Undercover Cop also delivers a thrilling experience, as playersknow one of their own will surely turn on them. Enjoyable deathmatchingis also offered in the new Cops & Robbers mode, although it doesnthave much in terms of progression outside of achievements and trophies.Ifyour preference is single-player or co-op, Dog Days lack ofpersonality (both in the characters and on the battlefield) results inone of the blandest shooters out there. Given how little the storymatters, Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck could have been swapped in as theprotagonists and I probably wouldnt have noticed. Corners are even cuton the ending, leaving the story wide open with no hint of resolution.", "date": "Aug 17, 2010", "grade": "6"}
