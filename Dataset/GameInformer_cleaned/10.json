Aside from their world-saving skills, Nintendo'scast of characters set aside time for friendly competition in things like life-sizeboard games, go-karting, and sports. With Mario Sports Superstars, Nintendolumps five activities together into one package. Unfortunately, while they areall fun to play, none of them offer depth or compelling reasons to continueplaying after the whistle sounds.The game bundles soccer, baseball, tennis, golf, and horseracing together. They all provide pick-up-and-play gameplay that makes them accessibleto players of any skill level. I enjoyed how quickly I was able to jump into agame and play competently against the beginner-level A.I. opponents, evenpulling off special shots in my first soccer match. However, the novelty wearsoff fast, as you can only play essentially the same match so many times beforecraving more.Each sport features solid mechanics that makes competing initiallyexciting. Golf and soccer are great to jump into, but my favorite sports weretennis and baseball. Those two sports not only feature the soundest mechanics,but they easily lend themselves to arcade-style action. Sadly, even those sportsend up being little more than diversions. After just a few matches, theaddictive loop of improvement slows dramatically as your skills plateau.With minimal stat-tracking, a lack of a progression system,and no long-term play options like seasons or tours, I don't feel compelled toreturn to any of the modes outside of the allure of the simplistic gameplay andworking to find the best characters for my playstyle. Luckily, that aspect doesadd some interesting wrinkles into the mix.When selecting your characters, you must take into accounttheir individual attributes. A balanced character like Yoshi might be a goodfoundation for your team, but you probably want to include a power hitter likeDonkey Kong in your batting order in baseball, or a speed-demon like Baby Luigias a forward in soccer. For baseball and soccer, you fill in the rest of yourteam with generic characters including Toads, Shy Guys, or Magikoopas. Ienjoyed being able to draft a baseball team full of characters, each withdifferent strengths to craft the perfect lineup. I wish that the other sports supporteda similar layer of strategy, but they don't.Horse racing stands out as the oddball of the group. Withdouble jumps, boost pads, and obstacle-laden courses, horse racing is by farthe most arcade-focused of an already loose and casual collection. Despite itswacky approach and dissonance with the other sports, I was surprised by howmuch I like horse racing thanks to its fast-paced loop of avoiding trees andhedges while collecting stars and carrots for energy. There is even an offshootStable mode where you can bond with your horse. I wasn't particularly drawn toStable, but between caring for your horse, customizing it, and searching foritems on walks, it's strange that this sub-mode of horse racing has more layersto it than any one sport included in Mario Sports Superstars.You can play each of the five sports in exhibition ortournament. Exhibition allows you to customize your experience by tweaking someof the rules to your liking for one-off matches, while tournament lines you upagainst three consecutive opponents in a bracket-style tournament withstandardized rules. You can also take the competition online, which works wellif you can find players - splitting the player-base between five modes withcustom search parameters seems to have hindered the pool of competitors inmatchmaking. As you play though the different modes in Mario SportsSuperstars, you earn coins, which are used to purchase packs of cards. Thesecards unlock hidden characters and courses, but they mostly serve to fill outyour fairly inconsequential collection. Also hidden beneath the menus is a Breakout-clone that usesAmiibo cards called Road to Superstar. In this mode, you lay out up to three paddlesspawned from Amiibo cards - regular Amiibos do not work - that return balls todestroy bricks and take out enemies. The mode is surprisingly challenging, butif you've played the classic Breakout game, it's nothing new.Mario Sports Superstars delivers five fun, surface-levelsports experiences in one package. Individually, these sports would be unableto stand on their own. However, as a compilation, the variety helps compensatefor the lack of depth. Still, the more I played, the more this package feltlike a collection of minigames than a value-packed compilation.", "date": "Mar 31, 2017", "grade": "6.5"}
