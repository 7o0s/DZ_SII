Whilemost Alien games take the James Cameron ~shoot everything that moves~ approachto the iconic sci-fi horror series, The Creative Assembly instead focuses onthe original film's claustrophobic intensity and the feeling of beingrelentlessly stalked by a far superior predator. The result is a game you mustlearn and play the way it wants you to, but the cat-and-mouse chases provide anexperience that's finally worthy of the Alien moniker.Players take on the role of Amanda Ripley, whose desire to learn the fate ofher missing mother brings her to a space station that has descended into chaosthanks to the appearance of a single, deadly xenomorph. Ripley must explore,fight, and  more often than not  run and hide to survive and find a way offthe Sevastopol, while simultaneously trying to ensure that her extraterrestrialhunter doesn't reach civilization. If that sounds familiar, most of Isolation'splot points and twists will, as the script all too often parallels memorablescenes from the films. I had fun reliving these iconic moments, but would'vepreferred some more novel surprises along the way. Amanda exhibits little growthor personality, other than concern for her fellow humans and a desire to notdie gruesomely, which  spoiler!  is going to happen to you all the time. Isolation's gameplay is far more engaging than the story, albeit in its ownmethodical and unforgiving way. Your encounters with the xenomorph areimpossibly lopsided, as the vicious extraterrestrial is leagues faster thanyou, impervious to damage, and kills with a single hit. As such, caution isparamount; whereas many games try to accommodate as many styles of play aspossible, your options in Isolation are to be quiet and smart or dead. Theoccasional mad sprint to your objective may be a viable choice, but most ofyour time is spent under desks, in lockers, and peeking over railings. While somuch hiding might sound boring, the constant threat of your unseen predatorkeeps you engrossed in the action, and every narrow escape and successfuldistraction instills a genuine sense of accomplishment. You unlock a variety ofcraftable items to help you in this regard, and while these new gadgets areempowering, they're not foolproof. No matter how safe you are, you'll stillneed patience for trial-and-error gameplay to fully enjoy the game.When you're not running from the alien, you have two more enemy types to dealwith. Armed human survivors will shoot you on sight, and are best avoided whenpossible (or used as a tasty diversion if the alien is lurking nearby). WorkerJoes, on the other hand, are cheap synthetic androids that require a jolt froma stun baton or EMP before they can be taken down, and aren't on the alien'smenu. Each enemy type sports its own traits and A.I. behaviors, and figuringthem out and adapting your tactics keeps the action fresh. The Creative Assemblydoes a good job of mixing up the enemies and adding new wrinkles throughout thegame, though on the whole the 25-hour campaign still feels too long. Most areasrequire sneaking through a maze of long, winding corridors and air ducts, onlyto trigger an objective and then make the long trek back. Exploring a new levelis exciting the first time, but you return to most areas multiple times. By theend of the game Ripley has crisscrossed the station so many times she couldprobably draw the blueprints from memory, despite the fact that most of theareas share the same sterile, ~what-the-hell-happened-here~ aesthetic.While players must contend with an unhelpful map system and some annoyingquick-time event sequences, the biggest source of frustration comes from thecheckpoint system, which requires players to manually save at designatedstations. While this structure necessitates even more backtracking, reaching asave station always provides a much-needed sense of relief, and I grew toappreciate the old-school mechanic. That said, the save system elicited morethan a few curses. Losing a bunch of progress when the xenomorph pops out ofnowhere and kills you with a single, unforeseen tail stab isn't scary, justfrustrating.In fact, despite the setting and source material, very little in Alien: Isolation is actually scary. Tense, certainly, and I jumped at more than a few surprise xenomorphencounters, but the environments and action fail to instill the sense of dreadthat the movies or other horror games have inflicted on fans. Despite takingmore than its share of inspiration from the Alien series, I found Dead Space tobe scarier than Isolation, even if playing through the genuine article is farmore appealing.Unlike its titular organism, Alien: Isolation is decidedly imperfect. The storyfalls flat, your objectives lack a sense of accomplishment, and the campaigndrags on longer than it should. When the gameplay is at its best, however,Isolation delivers the thrill of being in the Alien universe, something fanslike me have waited a long time to properly experience.", "date": "Oct 03, 2014", "grade": "7.75"}
