Previous games from Halfbrick demonstrate how this approach can turn a game into a sensation; Fruit Ninja and Jetpack Joyride are easy to play, but difficult to put down. The studios latest title, Fish Out Of Water, doesnt have the same success. Wading into this experience is certainly easy, but the shallow waters didnt reel me in. Your goal is to throw a collection of unique fish over the ocean, making them travel as far and skip as much as possible along the way. This is where Id normally say something like The concept sounds basic, but except there is no but this time. Thats pretty much the entirety of the game.You get assigned a score from a panel of judges after three throws, and then you start a new round. Appealing to certain judges is the only layer of strategy; one scores higher for distance, but another prefers more skips. Each of the six fish has different properties, leaning toward distance, skips, or a balance. This means you can tailor your selection to make up for lost ground in one area, but luck is ultimately more important than skill.Once you launch your fish by swiping the screen, events are largely out of your hands. A boost meter (which carries over between throws in each round) gives you a little bit of control over how each fish performs, but the crucial factor is the weather. Depending on what time of day you play the game, the waters can vary from calm to turbulent. High scores are easier to get during fair weather, since an errant wave or obstacle can throw off a fishs trajectory. Leaving this important aspect of the game to chance is frustrating, though you can see what the weather looks like for the coming hours if you want to plan ahead for clear skies.Like Jetpack Joyride, Fish Out Of Water has secondary goals to accomplish, but you only get one at a time. If you dont like one (or its too difficult), youre stuck with it, which is annoying. Completing these goals leads to leveling up, which in turn leads to you earning crystals. Along with boost, crystals are the other way you can influence your score. They might add some points to your final score, or automatically increase the distance of the next fish you throw. However, gems are also scarce, which is how Fish Out Of Water makes its money. If you dont want to complete the one secondary goal on the table to level up, you can pay real money for packs of crystals to augment your game.Making players pay for crystals might have worked, but the game doesnt do anything to get them invested. You dont get different stages with varying objectives; youre always throwing the same six fish on the same beach and trying to maximize distance and skips. You dont earn new abilities, you cant customize anything (unless you want to pay $1 to change the color of your name), and you dont make any tangible progress. You can shoot for achievements or join a league to compete with other players, but with no real advantage or reward beyond bragging rights, it feels pointless.I respect Halfbrick as one of the developers responsible for shaping the current state of mobile gaming, but Fish Out Of Water is a barebones offering that sinks rather than swims.", "date": "May 03, 2013", "grade": "6"}
