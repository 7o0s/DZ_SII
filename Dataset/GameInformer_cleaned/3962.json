Frantic pacing, weird characters, and over-the-top situations somehow coalesce and triumph through pure pulp craziness.Telltales Guardians of the Galaxy lives in its own universe, but if the first episode is any indication, its too eager to echo what has come before, especially aping the movie interpretation (minus much of the wit and comedic timing). A couple surprise events and some excellent voice acting keep things moving, and give me hope that the full season may emerge as a worthwhileadventure. Peter Quill takes center stage in this first episode, and Telltales glossy art style falls short of capturing his roguish charm. To the storys credit, the opening hour throws down the gauntlet with a particularly big baddie, helping to establish the high stakes of what lies ahead. The plot that follows is mostly about setting up chess pieces Rockets growing disdain for life on the road, Peters memories of Mom, a will they/wont they friendship with Gamora but its hard to know how or if anything will pay off. I enjoyed several of the character moments between the leads, even though those interactions held few surprises. We spend most of our time here getting to know the team and their relationships with each other; it might slow down the pace for this episode, but its probably a good foundation for futureinstallments.Guardians of the Galaxy is clearly aiming for a higher-octane thrill ride than some of Telltales other properties, with a focus on battle scenes, flying sequences, and frantic trigger-pulls to blast away with futuristic guns. I applaud the effort, but many of these scenes feel stilted, and lack the explosive effects and animation to feel truly cinematic. They also dont have meaningful control inputs that lead to engaging gameplay. New mechanics, like flight-driven exploration and a time scanner attempt to inject variety into the flow, but both are so dramatically underused that theyre barely worth mentioning. Humor is also a major push this time, but the jokes dont land, with the possible exception of a chuckle-worthy gag about activating a piece of ancientmachinery.Telltale has made its name touting narrative choice in its games, but episode one of the Guardians series feels too linear in structure to allow real investment in guiding the outcome of the story. I like that one important scene can unfold differently based on your choice, and another event brings one or another major character along for the ride. But the actual conclusions of multiple playthroughs emerge largely undifferentiated one from another. I hope the later episodes prove me wrong, and I begin to see my decisions shape the state of galactic affairs but weve been down this road many times before with Telltale, and usually end updisappointed.Guardians of the Galaxy has always evinced a slapdash weirdness. It is so bonkers it shouldnt really hold together, and thats exactly why it works. Judging by this first episode, Telltales interpretation lacks that sense of risk; it safely treads familiar territory for admittedly fun characters. Im not sure that is enough to hold up five playable episodes, but chapter one shows glimmers of potential.", "date": "Apr 17, 2017", "grade": "7.25"}
