After taking the ice with a polished game like EAs NHL 10, going to Visual Concepts latest hockey game feels like switching the channel between a pro hockey game and a high school hockey tournament.  The new skating system falls flat on the ice, with cumbersome, rigid movement that lacks agility and stubbornly relies on speed burst and backpedal buttons. These feel like antiquated holdovers from previous eras, considering real hockey players skate all out on every shift and switch effortlessly between skating forwards and backwards. Coupled with wooden animations, limited pro stick controls, a bare bones franchise mode, and inferior online team play compared to the EASHL, NHL 2K10 sails too many shots over the crossbar. With so many red flags, we recommend passing this prospect over.", "date": "Sep 28, 2009", "grade": "5.5"}
