The episodic adventure series  which has taken us into three separate decades and what feels like an innumerable number of alternate timelines  was beginning to grow stale, but it finishes with a clever cliffhanger that ties the whole series back to the original film. While Im happy to have followed Telltale down this wistful road, I cant shake the feeling that there were a few missed opportunities along the way.Episode recaps would have benefited this series greatly. Its only been a month since the last episode, but my memory was a little fuzzy on some of the secondary plot points. For the record, after Marty travels back to the 1930s to rescue Doc Brown from false imprisonment, the duo becomes entangled in a complicated narrative that alters the future. In order to correct the time stream, Marty has to ensure that a young Emmett Browns science exhibit goes off without a hitch, reconcile the young scientists relationship with his father, and track down Emmetts ex-girlfriend after she runs off with the DeLorean. If you havent played some of the series earlier entries, you dont want to start here. After all, its not like Telltale has altered any of the series mechanics or changed its formula in any significant way. Like in previous installments, Marty still blunders around the environment and many puzzles boil down to touching one of your inventory items to an object within the environment. Since your inventory usually only contains about three items anyway, these kinds of puzzles arent that hard to decipher.Despite Back to the Futures lack of diversity, Outatime still contains a few clever moments that made me smile. One moment in particular  a sequence in which Doc and Marty have to reenact a series of events for a delusional old woman  stands as one of my favorite moments in the series.Outatime is also significant as it is the first entry in which Michael J. Fox joins the cast, jumping into the role of one of Martys ancestors. While I found Foxs involvement exciting, the actors character seemed out of place during these sequences (as if the role was written late just so Telltale could slide him in), and Fox himself uses a goofy southern accent that does little to disguise his aging voice. Its sad, but the most authentic sounding McFly in the game is a Michael J. Fox impersonator. Like this voice acting oddity, everything great about Telltales Back to the Future series seems to have some accompanying disappointment. The series narrative offers a fun, lighthearted adventure, but at this point it has more holes in it than a Siberian mud road. Telltales environments are ripe with in-jokes and Back to the Future references, but when youre not sure what to do next, jumping straight to the hints system is often more entertaining than exploring the world. Sadly, you cant recreate the phenomenon that the original trilogy sparked, but that doesnt mean someone shouldnt try. For all its faults, Telltales Back to the Future series was a noble attempt to capture the magic of the films.If you want to know more about Telltales Back to the Future series, check out my reviews of Episode 1, 2, 3, and 4.", "date": "Jun 29, 2011", "grade": "7"}
