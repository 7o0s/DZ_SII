Sure, the parties can be fantastic and the furnishings are exquisite, but being in command of a kingdom is more of a royal pain than anything else.When you first start Fable III, you dont get that impression. As the youngest child of a legendary hero, youve heard the vague rumblings from the rabble that your brother, King Logan, is a tyrannical maniac. Maybe its the random executions. Perhaps the high taxes and child labor have left negative impressions on the citizenry. Regardless, those kinds of complaints are beneath your station in life  but that changes quickly after a tragic turn of events. Soon youre scrambling to assemble an army. Enough is enough! Its time for a revolution, baby!As the prince or princess, you travel the lands of Albion with your mentor, Walter Beck. As luck (or fate) would have it, Walter just so happens to be friendly with a variety of assorted riffraff, rebels, and revolutionaries. Those factions have one important thing in common: They cannot stand King Logan, and they will do whatever it takes to overthrow him. Since youre a member of the royal family, though, you have to win over each of those leaders by performing acts of heroism and doing a few favors.Most of those missions are variations of the typical go here, kill this, retrieve that formula that were accustomed to in our adventure games. Fortunately, Fable III has more than a few tricks up its sleeves.Fable III is the latest example of Lionheads battle against cluttered interfaces. Much of the HUD has been stripped away, and combat is similarly bare. At least, thats how it seems at first. There are three main types of attacks in the game  melee, firearm, magic  and each is performed by pressing the button thats permanently attached to it. You could conceivably get away with mashing away, but players who time the attacks to correspond to the action and charge attacks at the right time are treated to devastating finishers that show you flattening your opponents head or perforating their backs in a dramatic slow-motion closeup. I had fun with it, but combat isnt a wildly different experience from Fable II; you press a button, swing your sword or cast your spell, and move on.Other genre mainstays are tweaked significantly, though sometimes it feels as though Lionhead is tinkering with things simply because it can. Character progression eschews a traditional leveling system in favor of a more literal experience system dubbed the Road to Rule. In the beginning, the hero faces down a winding path that ends at the castle. Gates block your progression, and are unlocked one by one after completing important story-based tasks. As players work their way through the path, they can spend Guild Seals (essentially XP) to open chests. Those chests contain things like combat upgrades, emotion packs, dyes for clothing, and new spells. Its a nice way to present leveling up, though it doesnt fundamentally change the mechanics beneath such systems. The same can be said for the players home base, called the Sanctuary. Staffed by Jasper the butler (voiced by John Cleese), its an all-in-one visual replacement for the various menus players usually zip through to equip gear, fast travel, and change appearance.Lionheads efforts to replace abstract gaming concepts with more literal interpretations is interesting, but the overall effect is one of getting a flashy paint job instead of an arguably unnecessary overhaul. Sure, menus are weird gamey things, but theres a reason they work  theyre faster than walking into a virtual closet. The interface doesnt take anything away, but it doesnt add anything extra to the experience, either.Fable IIIs focus on simplicity sometimes comes at a cost. Previously, players could choose from a variety of different actions when interacting with the townsfolk. Now, youre limited to random selections that represent good, evil, and rude actions. Not being able to choose means that my prince had to do a lot of pelvic-grinding dance moves and games of patty cake with other men in order to become friends with them. It certainly doesnt break the game, but I was disappointed that a game trumpeting player choice takes a significant step backward from Fable IIs level of NPC interaction.The story is grim at times, but thats not to say that it isnt also one of the funniest games of the year. The writing is top notch, and there are at least three or four quests that rank among my favorite missions Ive ever played. One highlight has the hero joining in a bickering trios Dungeons & Dragons-type game, complete with hoary descriptions and every RPG clich you can imagine. Other times you might be asked to break up a doomed marriage or even try your hand at acting. Youll find plenty of variety and choices to make.Eventually, after working through the games storyline (and Road to Rule), the revolution is at hand. After assembling an army, making a promise or two, and saving the day dozens of times, you think that would be the end of things  you know, pop on the crown, sit on the throne, and call it a day. Thats where youd be wrong.Before you take a seat on the kings chair and doze off, Logan fills you in on a few key things. Albion is facing a horrible threat, and the nations defense is in peril. As he tells it, thats why he had to make the tough decisions he had to make  and be branded a tyrant because of them.As king, players have an accelerated year to establish a strong defense before the invasion comes. Thankfully, youre a hands-on leader, and youll occasionally exit the stuffy confines of your castle to discover valuable artifacts and mingle with the riffraff. Other times, youll have to sort out the worst kinds of problems: other peoples problems. Remember those promises? Well, people expect you to keep them. As you hold court, a parade of familiar faces comes in and asks for your help  which most often comes in the form of money. A lot of time is spent in your court, though I found the situations that arose every bit as riveting as beating back highwaymen or slaughtering groups of hobbes.The Fable series has always focused on morality, and Fable III is no different. This time, however, the choices are far beyond the typical kiss the baby or kick the baby extremes that weve faced in the past. My first playthrough I was as evil as evil could be, and I broke my word at every opportunity. Every decision I made was born from greed, and I lined by bank account and bought up every square inch of available property. When the time of reckoning came, the kingdom suffered because of my greed.On my second attempt, I decided I would be daddys lil angel. I went out of my way to be good to everyone, and I kept every promise. My advisor warned me that popularity would be fleeting if everyone died because of the kingdoms insolvency, but I didnt care. People cheered when I entered the throne room, and it felt great (particularly compared to my earlier reception). And wouldnt you know it? Just about everyone died.You cant be everything to everyone in Albion. Some people are going to be disappointed in you. No easy answers exist, and there arent any last-second saviors to bail you out from your poor planning. After playing through the game twice, I know more than ever that Im not cut out for public office.Even after you beat the game, new quests, locations, and characters open up. And those decisions you made as king? Theyll affect the way the world looks and behaves, too. Without spoiling anything, lets just say that when I said just about everybody died, I wasnt kidding. From raising a family, becoming a land baron, and even partnering up with friends locally or online, this is the most fully realized version of Albion yet. Its a must-play for fans of adventure or anyone who thinks they can run things better than those bums in Washington. Good luck.", "date": "Oct 25, 2010", "grade": "9"}
