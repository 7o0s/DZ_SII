The half-baked launch of Battlefield 4 and the myriadtechnical problems that followed consumed DICE's full attention, leavingVisceral to fill the void with a new, unnumbered entry in the series. Hardlinebranches off the tried-and-true Battlefield formula with the kind of differentideas that you might expect a new developer to bring to the plate. However, somethings about war never change: Like other recent entries, the single-playercampaign falls flat while the multiplayer shines.Despite Visceral's best attempts to tell a good story,Hardline's single-player campaign is a mess. The military shooter's transitionto a cops-and-robbers theme has shifted the gameplay focus from open warfare tosneaking up on and arresting people; stealth sequences make up the majority ofthe campaign, and despite taking obvious cues from the Far Cry series, theyfail to deliver the same highs or tactical variety. Shootouts are stillfrequent, but your limited arsenal (you can only have one firearm and a handgunat a time) and the superhuman accuracy of your enemies make them morefrustrating than exciting. The driving sequences are so slow, dumbed down, andscripted that they almost feel like on-rail segments. Aside from an explosivestandoff at an abandoned airstrip, most of the set-piece moments areforgettable.The story of wronged-cop-turned-renegade Nicholas Mendozastarts rough and ends with a facepalm-worthy final revelation. Downtime aboundsas characters frequently and clumsily reflect on their own backstories, and anumber of nonsensical plot twists undermine the personalities and motives ofmost of the cast. Everyone ends up being bad, but unlike The Wire where flawed characters get mired down in shades of grey the cast of Hardline constantly contradicts themselves with sociopathicbehavior. If Hardline was only its single-player campaign, it would be one ofthe biggest flops of the year.Thankfully, Hardline isn't just a solo cop drama gone wrong,and the heart of the franchise beats on  albeit at a different tempo.Hardline's multiplayer scales down the maps and vehicular combat for a morecondensed and faster-paced experience that's still worthy of the Battlefieldname.Even Hardline's biggest maps, like the desert town of DustBowl and the industrial depots of Derailed, pale in comparison to the sprawlingwarzones of previous Battlefield games, but each one still serves up plenty ofinteresting and dynamic locations to fight over. The shift to mostly transportvehicles (tanks and jets are MIA) also limits the scale of combat, but Iappreciate the focus on infantry, which is what most players spend their timeon anyway.Some diehard fans will dismiss Hardline as the further COD-ificationof Battlefield, but the gunplay isn't any twitchier than previous iterations. Thesmaller maps simply mean you have less downtime before getting into the action.This can make it harder to get your bearings (especially when spawning on asquad member), but the players who come out on top are still the ones whounderstand the pros and cons of their chosen weapon, make smart use of theiritems, and coordinate with their teammates.The downsized maps mean that smaller player counts arebetter; 32-player Conquest delivers the thrills you know and love about thetimeless mode, while the 64-player matches can devolve into total chaos.Thankfully, most of Hardline's new modes are geared toward smaller playercounts. Hotwire's mobile take on Conquest delivers plenty of thrills, whileHeist and Blood Money both offer interesting twists on capture the flag  and youwon't think twice about them all capping out at 32 players. Crosshair andRescue evolve the one-life, five-on-five formula of Battlefield 4's Defusemode, and are entertaining diversions as well. Visceral also changed up player progression with a new cash-basedsystem, and after a week of multiplayer, I don't think I can ever go back to alinear unlocking scheme. Buying the guns and items you actually want with themoney you earn from matches just makes sense, and eliminates the annoyance ofgrinding XP to get past an unlock you know you're never going to use. Itemsthat aren't class-specific are universal unlocks, so you're not starting fromscratch when you switch roles. At the same time, weapon attachments and somespecial firearms do have requirements before you can purchase them, so youcan't just buy the best gear possible from the get-go. The ability to savemultiple loadouts for each class is an obvious yet very welcome addition to thegame as well.Perhaps the best praise I can heap on Hardline is for whatnowadays constitutes a miraculously smooth launch; aside from a single isolatedDDoS attack on Xbox One, the servers have been rock solid since release day,and the server browser has offered up endless lists of near-full matches tojoin. I have yet to be disconnected from a single match, and lag has beenalmost nonexistent as well. I'd like to see a few more options for gettingtogether and playing with friends, but squads are functional and performedflawlessly during my playtime, suggesting EA learned its lessons fromBattlefield 4's failures. It's a commendable and necessary achievement for thefuture of the franchise.Some fans of the series have been quick to declare that Hardlineisn't a ~true~ Battlefield game due to the changes it presents. In truth, Isometimes miss the larger scale, slower pace, and heavy ordnance (not to mention theold killcam) of Battlefield 4's multiplayer, but they don't have to be mutuallyexclusive. Both experiences are appealing in their own way, and I don't plan ontaking Hardline out of my rotation anytime soon. Just do yourself a favor andskip the single-player campaign.", "date": "Mar 20, 2015", "grade": "8"}
