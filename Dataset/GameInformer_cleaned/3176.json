If you like the SimCity series, the game is borderline sacrilegious. If you don't...well, I'm starting to understand why. This title starts with the framework of the classic '90s SimCity games, then falls face-first down the evolutionary ladder.Players assume the position as mayor to create zones, build roads, and generally tend to the populace. You might think such an uncomplicated formula would be hard to screw up, but wait until you try it with motion controls. Placing roads is hopelessly broken, especially since the tiles don't snap to a grid. Sure, it lets you make curved roads (who cares?!), but at the expense of turning your little town into an ugly and asymmetrical aberration.The rest of the game is equally uncooperative. With a terrible menu system and finicky camera controls, the game makes practically no effort to draw you in. If it controlled well, it might feel like a nostalgic homage to the old days  but it doesn't. The inclusion of features like hero buildings and various advisors can't reclaim any lost ground when the core gameplay is so cluttered and cumbersome. It's just pathetic  and that's coming from someone who enjoyed SimCity Societies!Some games run into problems trying to be everything to everyone, but SimCity Creator suffers from the opposite affliction. It doesn't try to be anything to anyone. Well, that's one thing it does right.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "5"}
