It tackles complex themes in relatable ways, like betrayal,revenge, and how pain brings out the worst in us. This makes it shine, and is astep in a right direction after coming off the disappointing Zestiria. However,Berseria still has its missteps when it comes to pacing and dungeon design.Even so, I liked the shift to a more somber tale that gave me plenty to thinkabout during - and even after - the journey.Berseria focuses on Velvet, a woman who has seen hershare of tragedy. One devastating event sends her over the edge, beginning adeadly quest for revenge. The opening is powerful and grim, illustrating whyVelvet turned into the hardened person that she is. She's not your typicalTales protagonist full of good deeds; she just wants vengeance, and most of thetime she's downright cruel and cold in the process. I found this refreshing,because even when Velvet is at her worst, I still felt for her due to how wellthe game set up her backstory. Berseria has a lot of twists that I won't spoil,but Velvet meets other misfits and they uncover corruption as their world isoverrun by demons.While a revenge tale isn't new ground forstorytelling, it still works for building up to key moments and making themrelatable. Berseria is at its best when it shows the reasoning behind yourallies' actions and developing them in interesting ways. For instance, watchingone character who didn't have free will slowly turn into his own person is ahighlight. You have a lot scenes and dialogue to shift through, and it's a slowburn, but it's worth it for how it all comes together. I wasn't even sure how Ifelt about the cast for the first 10 hours of the game, but the payoff is inhow they grow and change.When you're not bonding with your party, you're out onthe battlefield. The action-based battle system has a lot of depth, and newwrinkles continue to be introduced well into the journey. Combat is all aboutexploiting enemy weaknesses and chaining combos. Everything revolves around asoul gauge, which depletes as you attack. I enjoyed strategizing around thisbecause it forced me to make the most out of my every move. If your soul gaugeis low, your attacks do less damage, are more easily defended, and leave youopen to counterattacks. This means spamming the attack button is not in yourbest interest. You can restore the gauge by idling, or you can steal souls fromenemies to refill it by stunning them, inflicting status effects, or defeatingthem, but beware your enemies can do the same.This doesn't even factor in special attacks likepowerful mystic artes or break souls, which have the power to extend combos andtheir power even when your gauge is running low. The battle system is all aboutmaking the most out of your soul gauge, and rewards you for doing so in howfast you can annihilate foes and in your loot drops. It took me a while to wrapmy head around all its intricacies, but once I did, I had a blast pushing itslimits. I also appreciated how easy all the special moves are to execute, andit helps that all your artes are on the face buttons.Dungeons are still a struggle, filled with lots ofboring busywork. You flip a lot of switches, break obstacles, and backtrackconstantly. The environments themselves leave much to be desired, and sometimesyou revisit dungeons and areas, which getstiresome. The backtracking got on my nerves the most. You eventually get ahoverboard to quickly traverse areas, but this makes it harder to pick up itemsvital for crafting. In addition, you can purchase items to fast travel, but theyonly allow you go to certain points, which doesn't fix the problem.About halfway through the game, you also get your ownheadquarters. At first, this seems cool, but Berseria doesn't do many excitingthings with it. After every mission, you come back and chat with your party toplan your next move, but it settles into a boring rhythm quickly. Theheadquarters' layout is awful, making it inconvenient, and you're oftenrequired to go from one end to the other. You also have to battle through thisarea repeatedly.As for bonus content, you have your own pirate ship,but you don't ever get to sail it yourself; you send your crew on expeditionsto collect extra goodies for you like ingredients for cooking. The game alsohas its share of minigames and things to collect. I most enjoyed the bountyhunts and the side quests involving characters, such as one trying to get hercomedy show off the ground.Tales of Berseria does some interesting things,and is the most captivating Tales storyline in some time. I like the majorityof its ideas, but the execution often feels half-realized. It still feels likethe franchise isn't making big enough leaps, and is just content to bring its fansmore of the same. By now, you probably know if you're okay with that. Nothingever made me stop playing, but the flaws are impossible to ignore.", "date": "Jan 23, 2017", "grade": "7.5"}
