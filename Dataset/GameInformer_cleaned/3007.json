{"name": "Terminator: Salvation", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/terminator_salvation/b/ps3/archive/2009/09/22/review.aspx", "text": "In the early '90s, I played a crappy Terminator game for the Sega CD. It started in a decayed future and featured a host of tired gameplay mechanics. It's funny that the Terminator franchise deals with time paradoxes, because history seems to have repeated itself. Based on the new movie, Salvation has you filling John Conner's shoes and battling the nigh-omnipotent forces of Skynet as the machines start taking the guise of humans. If robots ever do take over, I hope the human race doesn't succumb to a force this stupid. Most encounters have you jumping between cover while the machines stand in the middle of an open field. While the cover system is kind of cool and the co-op option is nice, the rest of this title is a mess of long loads and low production values. If only we could send a death machine back in time to kill this game before it was born.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "5.5"}
