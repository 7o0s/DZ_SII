Second Evolution feels like an anonymous and formulaic RPG most of the time, but extraordinary moments occasionally rise to the surface. The involved skill system provides interesting character progression, and lots of unique camera angles frame the non-action segments in cool ways. Other than that, you can expect a stable of cliches to carry you through the story and real-time combat. Despite my usual affinity for developer Tri-Ace, I wouldn't have called this game a classic when the original version released on PSone. Time hasn't changed my mind.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "7"}
