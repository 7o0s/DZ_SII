This version is a completely faithful transfer, and a great way for PS3 owners to experience this gaming masterpiece. Unfortunately, there is really no incentive to re-purchase for anyone who played the 360 or PC versions. A super-hard difficulty mode has been added for fanatics, but the most notable new features are the mandatory installation and the ability to pay for exclusive downloadable challenge rooms when they release on the PlayStation Network. BioShock was undoubtedly the best game of 2007, but after a year with so little extra polish, its luster has diminished slightly.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
