Normally, such production woes are a bad omen for the fate of agame, but Until Dawn doesn't just limp to release like a bloodied survivor; itemerges as an excellently penned teen horror tale that sets a new standard forthe adventure genre.Like Telltale's myriad series, Until Dawn is more story thangame. You control a rotating cast of eight endangered teens trying to survive anill-fated night at a secluded mountain lodge. There are no puzzles or inventorymanagement in this adventure  gameplay is comprised entirely of exploring eerielocales, timing your way through action sequences, and making an endless seriesof choices that shape the story. However, thanks to topnotch production values,Supermassive has polished the formula to a triple-A sheen. Outstanding visuals,commendable performances from a cast of professional actors, and a mood-settingdynamic score all bring the characters and environments to life.But Supermassive's improvements aren't just superficial;Until Dawn redefines the importance of player choice in story-driven adventuregames. Gone are the closed-loop decisions showing you the immediaterepercussions of your choice before funneling you back onto the main path with everyoneelse. Instead, your decisions in Until Dawn continue to reverberate, impactinglater events in complex and unforeseen ways; alienate a friend with yourdialogue choices or actions, for instance, and they may not be there to saveyou hours down the road. Numerous feedback techniques highlight the importance ofyour decisions (including the Butterfly Effect menu that tracks various choicesand their consequences), but none are more effective than the swiftdecapitation of your character, or any number of equally brutal death sequences.It's not just smoke and mirrors; while certain characters prove more resilientthan others, every member of the main cast is capable of living or dying basedon how you play, and you can't go back and fix mistakes  the story continuallyauto-saves, pushing towards its climatic finale without the chance for checkpointsor retries. Who lives to see it depends entirely on you.Your choices wouldn't be particularly meaningful without acompelling story, but Supermassive excels here as well. Until Dawn lovinglyserves up a multitude of successful horror film locales and motifs, while stilladding a few fun and novel twists to its three-pronged mystery of who istormenting our stranded gang and the surrounding area of Blackwood Pines. Thejourney is riddled with jump scares throughout; some are well-designed andexpertly paced, while others are of the cheap haunted-house variety, but they equallyhad me cringing and uttering obscenities. Later environments like a dilapidatedmine and deserted sanatorium build genuine tension with their creepyatmospheres.The cast of dumb teens is also rooted in horror clichs(expect a good helping of groan-worthy sexual innuendos and catty arguments),but the characters evolve during the game based on how you play them and offerup chances for redemption (or revenge). Certain character traits are more baked-inthan others (Mike is always going to be a bit of a jerk no matter how noble youplay him) and a few dialogue exchanges feel disjointed, but overall the storyflows remarkably well.Until Dawn's narrative is augmented by collectibles thatactually matter. Curious players will uncover dozens of clues hidden in theenvironments providing insight into the underlying mysteries and themotivations of key characters. You also find totems that offer tantalizingglimpses of what may happen to your protagonists, such as Death totems thatforetell a character's demise or Fortune totems that can guide you towards abeneficial situation. These visions are so quick that I only figured out someof them in hindsight, but they are engrossing nonetheless and help reinforcethe variety of possible outcomes. By including meaningful collectibles, UntilDawn also does a nice job of getting you to make the same kind of risky decisionsthat foolish teens do in horror films  my curiosity got the better of me onmore than one occasion, and would've had the audience yelling at the screen ifit was a movie.Until Dawn's mysteries lead you through three-fourths of theadventure  the home stretch is all about trying to keep your remainingcharacters alive. Thankfully, Supermassive implements the best use ofquick-time events I've seen in a game to create nerve-racking action sequences.I normally loathe quick-time events, but Supermassive eschews pointless buttonmashing for timed presses, precision aiming, and on-the-spot decision making,all of which keep you rooted in the moment. Don't Move prompts are also aninteresting addition, tasking you with holding the controller as still as possibleto hide from stalking predators. Like the branching choices, these sequenceswork because your fear of death is genuine; watching a character that you'veplayed as for hours die because you flubbed an escape sequence is brutal. Deathisn't quite as ever-present as it may seem on a first playthrough, but there'senough danger to constantly keep you on your toes.The beginning of Until Dawn boasts that the decisions youmake during the game will craft a unique and personal story. By the time thecredits rolled, I was a believer. Sure, every player follows the same narrativeskeleton, and a few of the more ~expendable~ characters aren't instrumental tothe ending (I'd also kill for a way to fast-forward scenes on subsequentplaythroughs). However, the script kept me entertained and feeling like mydecisions mattered throughout my 10-hour playthrough. Thanks to some goodtwists, a few fake-outs, and limitless jump scares, Until Dawn would make asolid horror film. As a piece of interactive fiction, however, it's aremarkable experience that horror fans shouldn't miss.", "date": "Aug 24, 2015", "grade": "9"}
