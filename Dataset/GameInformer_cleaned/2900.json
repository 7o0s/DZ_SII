Look Sega, I don't want to play asSonic's annoying animal friends. I don't want to wander around towntalking to people about ice cream or hand puppets. And I don't want toplay as some howling bestial, slower version of Sonic. I play Sonicgames because I like to go fast.Sonic is certainly good at going fast. Sega's tech is impressive, asSonic's sprawling levels speed by without a hitch. Occasionally you'llhave to dial in a button-pressing event or quickly jump over to abranching path, but for the most part Sonic's speedy levels arerollercoaster rides you cruise through. If these traditional Soniclevels were the only gameplay in this disc, I might have walked awayamused. Sadly, they only make up about a third of the overallexperience.After Dr. Eggman uses the Chaos emeralds to split open the Earth'scrust, thereby releasing a horde of evil spirits, Sonic becomesinfected with some strange disease.This disease turns him into a super stretchy Werehog monsterwhenever the moon is out. These Werehog segments play like a poor man'sGod of War. You fight hordes of enemies and level up his Werehogattacks, but many of the enemies look the same, Sonic's pace isplodding, and the platforming is frustrating. Even worse are Unleashed's hub world areas, which have Sonic holdinginane conversations with random pedestrians in tedious adventure-stylequests. As much as I disliked lumbering through levels as Sonic's hulkyWerehog, I disliked hunting through the hub worlds looking for coinseven more. Sega, if you really want to fix Sonic, the first thing youshould do is stop trying to fix him.", "date": "Sep 28, 2009", "grade": "6"}
