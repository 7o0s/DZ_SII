I lovethat Dontnod is attempting to confront these sensitive topics, but they're alsovery hard to portray accurately and responsibly. The second episode bites offmore than it can chew, putting you on an emotional rollercoaster exposing youto all kinds of traumatic events. While some scenes end up raw and honest, alot more are frustrating due to the extremism of the world and the mixedmessages sent about how to handle these complicated subjects.The episode gets off to strong start, exploring more aboutMaxine's mysterious power to rewind time. Weird occurrences have surfaced, likea snowfall in the middle of eighty-degree weather, and Maxine is investigatingit with the help of her friends. My favorite parts are when they break intotheories, pointing to quantum physics. Maxine is also finding out her powershave some limitations, which becomes even more interesting later in the story.Her ability can't always save her from harsh circumstances, and these momentsare the most interesting in the episode.When not trying to figure out what's at the root of herpower, Maxine handles the cruel and corrupt world before her. She seesbullying, extortion, and violence in her day-to-day life. A social group calledthe Vortex Club has become all the rage, but secrets about drugs and sex lurkbelow the surface, and Maxine is determined to get the root of it. The wholeset-up is absurd. At times, I felt like I was watching a poorly written teenagedrama on The CW. Everything functions to increase the melodrama, even if it'soutlandishly unrealistic. The first episode had some clichs, but the second goesso far that it's difficult to take seriously.The extremism of the circumstances and characters is themost frustrating part. Authority figures don't respond to situations as theyshould, ignoring the obvious in front of them. This can happen in reality, butalmost every adult in Life is Strange does this. It gets so bad that I declinedto report something important to an adult or professional, because I knew howthey would react. This sends a horrible message to those dealing with hardsituations such as abuse or suicidal thoughts. Maybe some of the ~supernatural~occurrences will come to explain the adults' ignorance, but it feels like Maxineis the only rational person in the game. Even her good friend Chloe has oddreactions, like getting mad at Max for not resorting to violence.Life is Strange is best in its small moments. For instance,some great dialogue occurs between Maxine and Chloe's mom over the loss ofChloe's dad and how it impacted her. Maxine also shines in dealing with afriend who's on the brink of having a complete breakdown. That being said,Maxine sometimes comes across as too wise for her years; adults are talking tothe 18-year-old like she's on their level of life experience. Dontnod is making a great effort to have choices mean somethingand carry over between episodes. I enjoyed how the little things, like erasingmean messages on an acquaintance's whiteboard, mattered in a laterconversation. Small decisions also factor into sweeping choices like whether ornot you save someone's life. The choices aren't easy; sometimes they even makeyou choose between friendships. However, I also experienced someinconsistencies in how characters reacted, which seemed like a result ofDontnod having difficulty keeping up with all the story threads. For instance,in one scene, a character notes I care about her and that she's going to joinme, but then the next line of dialogue has her doing the opposite, sayingnobody cares about her. Outside of building relationships and making choices, the basicpoint-and-click exploration and puzzles provide the bulk of the gameplay. Ienjoy how looking at typical objects often provides new insights into eventslike how Chloe's dad died. Small puzzles also occur, but they aren't anythingmind blowing. They make sense in the context of the story, like proving yourpowers to Chloe with basic memory games. However, one puzzle drove me nuts:locating five bottles in a large junkyard. Looking for a needle in a haystackis rarely fun, and that's the case here. The do-or-die involving rerouting atrain was much better, since the time pressure keeps the situation intense andexciting. Even with everything that bothered me in thisepisode, I'm still entrenched in where Maxine's story is headed. Life isStrange has plenty of potential left, and Dontnod is making choices matter.However, characters and circumstances need be more natural and plausible for meto buy into this world. So much is too overblown. Life is Strange is at itsbest when it dials it down and just focuses on the simple things, like copingthrough the hard times or repairing a broken friendship. These are the momentsthat keep me invested.", "date": "Mar 23, 2015", "grade": "6.5"}
