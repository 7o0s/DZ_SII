Last years X & Y marked one of the biggest steps forward for the series, but this years follow-up returns to the process of making small, iterative updates. Thankfully, the changes in Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire are quite good, and these titles (remade from their original Game Boy Advance versions) also bring forward many of the best lessons learned from X & Y.The basic Pokmon structure is in place. You make your way through a saccharine story about balance and nature while collecting creatures to battle with others who share your hobby. Building your army and watching them grow and evolve continues to be rewarding, and the addition of new and returning Mega Evolutions offers extra incentive to explore.You dont endure much training or dialogue before youre able to steal Pokmon from their natural habitats and collect badges. I was even allowed to capture Pokmon before being formally instructed, showing Game Freak recognizes many players picking up these remakes are already familiar with the basics. That attention to pacing continues throughout; I never felt slowed down by text or unsure about where to go next. I even got automatically transported to the next story section on a few occasions to avoid excessive backtracking.The PokNav Plus (all the stuff happening on the lower screen) offers some of the biggest changes from X & Y. Forgettable distractions like Pokmon-Amie and Super Training also return, and are best left ignored. New additions include the DexNav, the AreaNav, and the BuzzNav, and these are what set this iteration apart.The BuzzNav is basically a 24-hour Pokmon news network, which you can keep open on the bottom screen. It is surprisingly successful at making the Hoenn region feel alive with updates happening in the world. I laughed out loud when I saw quotes I had written for a pair of newscasters (who I had battled earlier) appear on the channel. They asked what I thought of my starter Pokmon, and I wrote, Hes dumb. In the broadcast, they treated that quote from the great up-and-coming trainer Kyle with great reverence and status.The DexNav and AreaNav are less peripheral, as they offer details about the world and its features in the form of an overhead map and a scanner looking for nearby Pokmon. Using these tools, you have a much easier time finding specific Pokmon you want. It also lets you know if youve captured all the available Pokmon types of each area on the map  a feature I have wanted for years. Its a handy tool for completionists, and a delightfully dangerous one for aspiring completionists who were never quite able to go all the way.One of this entrys most publicized additions, soaring, takes a long time to unlock. You have most of your badges by the time you finally get to take off and fly above Hoenn, but its worth the wait. It gives players of the original Ruby and Sapphire a new perspective on the world (alongside the 3D upgrade), but even for those visiting Hoenn for the first time, seeing and controlling Pokmon in the air is exciting.Some features from X & Y didnt make the cut (like character customization), but I dont miss them. Instead of customizing your avatar, you customize a secret base. It scratches the Animal Crossing itch of organizing a home, but in the middle of an RPG about collecting and fighting monsters, I didnt feel particularly compelled to inspect and re-organize my room every time I found a new piece of furniture. Another new addition, Pokmon Contests, lets you show off your Pokmon in something akin to a fashion show, but there wasnt enough inherent incentive to make me interested in exploring its intricacies. Thankfully, the contests can be ignored entirely if you so choose. The new PokNav Plus elements are Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphires biggest and best new additions. They change the way you participate in Pokmons most attractive mechanic  collecting Pokmon. Its what separates Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire from X & Y, and ultimately makes them superior games. Having a better sense of which creatures I still need and where to get them is something Ive been craving, and it makes this iteration in the series my personal favorite.The Difference Between Omega Ruby & Alpha SapphireAs is the case with all dual Pokmon releases, the two titles dont feature many radical differences. The legendary Pokmon featured on the box art is the one you will have the opportunity to grab  Groudon in Omega Ruby and Kyogre in Alpha Sapphire. The Pokmon capable of soaring in the former is Latios, while the latter is Latias. The antagonists are also different in the two games  Team Magma in Omega Ruby and Team Aqua in Alpha Sapphire, though it doesnt change the storyline. There are also some Pokmon you will only find in one game and not the other to encourage trading.OnlineOnline functions identically to last years X & Y, and even allows for interactivity between the four games with some restrictions. New Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire Mega Evolutions and certain items cannot be traded or used in battles with X & Y players. The online performs well and the similarity to last years systems is a good thing as it brings back the enjoyable Wonder and Global Trade systems.", "date": "Nov 21, 2014", "grade": "8.75"}
