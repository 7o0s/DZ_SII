It was a massive success and follow up entries have mostly stayed the course: Capture monsters, collect badges, and share your collection with friends. Sun & Moon is not a radical reinvention of Pokmon, but it does re-examine some ingrained mechanics and the result is a better, more diverse Pokmon experience that feels different from past games, even if it does have a familiar core.The first thing I noticed is human character models and their animations have been dramatically improved. The Pokmon feel mostly unchanged, but the way your character and other NPCs move is significantly better. Grid movement is finally dead, and I couldnt be happier. Animation improvements even help in storytelling. The narrative delivers familiar messages of kinship and working with your Pokmon friends, but it does hide a few surprises, as well as mysteries extending beyond the credits that are worth exploring.Walking around in Alola feels better, and its layout is much friendlier. Tall grass is still unavoidable in some instances, but you can often take a path around it if you need to avoid combat. Alolas islands are more open, and while it is in your best interest to explore the grass, fight, and collect, I was happy to discover the safe routes when I was just trying to go from point A to B. Even the trainers who cant help but stop you in the road to battle offer more signs theyre prepared to pounce. You wont make much progress if you avoid them all, but I like having a way out.Mechanically, fighting is mostly unchanged. Z-Moves are the big twist this time around, replacing the Mega Evolutions of recent entries. Z-Moves act like a guaranteed critical hit, and each is accompanied by a dance. Maybe performing a dance to pull off an ultra move sounds dumb, but the excellent animation makes the dances fun to watch. The Pokmon-specific Z-Moves are also entertaining, as it gets your pocket monster involved in the often-absurd display. They function as a give-it-all-you-got attack to finish off a powerful foe, give yourself a strong lead, or to get you out of a tough situation. Using one is always an important decision and its a fun tactical play to use it against the right enemy at the right time in a difficult fight.The rock-paper-scissors nature of fighting is still here, but now it remembers what attacks work best against which enemies for you. Ive always struggled remembering the breakdown of strengths and weaknesses when it comes to Pokmon types, especially as new ones have been added over the years, so this reminder was invaluable to me. In the past, I would keep a document nearby listing all of the types strengths and weaknesses, and I am happy to leave it behind. Anything that keeps me playing the game and not putting it down to do research is a good thing.Battling and collecting Pokmon feels the same, but finding Gym Badges is different. You complete Trials instead of taking on Gyms, and thats more than just a change in terminology. Combat is still crucial to completing each Trial, but additional tasks make them all unpredictable. One has you listening to sound cues and identifying what they represent, while another tasks you with collecting ingredients to summon a powerful Totem Pokmon. I didnt know what to expect going into each of these trials, and as a player who has collected his fair share of Gym Badges throughout his life, I enjoyed not knowing what was next. The non-combat parts of these Trials are never hard and usually played for laughs. The nature of the Trials also gives what would have been forgettable gym leaders in the past an opportunity to show some character and be more memorable. The Trial structure made me eager to go after each one, especially since they all award new Z-Moves (instead of just an icon attached to your save file).HMs (hidden machines), which allow you to do things like learn to fly for fast travel, or break rocks for expanded exploration, are gone for Sun & Moon. Instead, you have a device that lets you call in Pokmon you can mount. You can ride Taurus, for example, to travel faster and break through rocks. I prefer this over the HM system, since it means you no longer have to sacrifice one of your Pokmons attack slots in order to perform special environmental moves. Plus, seeing your trainer ride around on assorted Pokmon as you control them is fun, and sometimes very dumb.Your Pokdex offers more visual reward for collecting Pokmon, though the act of catching the creatures is unchanged. You can tell immediately if a Pokmon has an evolution when you catch it, and when you collect a full set, the background color of that Pokmons entry changes. Its a small flair, but it makes filling out your Pokdex enticing, and it is easier to see what entries are missing.Much of the clutter from the previous games has been removed for a U.I. with fewer distractions and mini-games. Pokmon-Amie has been renamed to Pokmon Refresh and while it continues to serve the same ignorable functions of the previous games like petting and feeding your team, it now also allows you to remove status ailments between fights. You can still go the standard route of using items to cure things like poison and paralysis, but I like having a free option that gives you a close-up look at the Pokmon models.Pok Pelago can be accessed any time, and lets you periodically do something with the Pokmon living in your PC. The rewards are small, but I like even the idea that my Pokmon are not just languishing away in my PC. Festival Plaza is a physical place where you and your friends can socialize, trade, and battle. It does a good job limiting the menu-heavy interaction typically associated with playing Pokmon with friends. Sun & Moons Photo Mode is fairly shallow and is not the return of Pokmon Snap some hoped it would be. As an additional distraction to explore in Alola, however, its a welcome bonus. Strangely, it also represents the only element of the game in stereoscopic 3D. I did not miss stereoscopic 3D in the rest of the game, but I admit surprise at its near total absence.Sun & Moon feels significantly different from previous Pokmon games. X & Y may have marked the series biggest visual change, but Sun & Moon shows Game Freak is willing to re-examine Pokmons tenured mechanics in order to improve the game. Sun & Moon is still Pokmon, but it showcases some of the biggest changes the series has ever seen  and thats a good thing.The Difference Between Sun & MoonThe differences between Pokmon versions are generally small and relate to which Pokmon are more prevalent in which versions. That continues to be the case here, as some Pokmon only appear in one version, or appear more frequently in one version over another. Beyond the monsters, the Sun and Moon versions are different in another way: The day/night cycle. If youre playing Sun, the in-game time of day corresponds to the real-life time of day. In Moon, the times are reversed; when you play during the day, it is night in the game. The difference is mostly an aesthetic one, and thankfully never impedes your plot progress.", "date": "Nov 15, 2016", "grade": "8.5"}
