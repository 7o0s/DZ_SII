It's neitherthe officially licensed WRC title nor a title from racing luminariesCodemasters. Regardless, it has a style all its own; while this game is not supremelysatisfying from a pure racing perspective, its journey through Loeb's career,along with the amount of content, give it something to call its own.The way the game handles Loeb's career isn't unique. Players can play through agauntlet of greatest moments from the legend's life in racing in variousscenarios. A tier of the titular events also unlocks when you reach a certainranking in the career mode's internal leaderboard. What impresses me  assomeone who's not familiar with Loeb and his many accomplishments  is thevideo footage with Loeb himself. He walks through the different eras, races,manufacturers, and situations from his life (complete with archival footage ofthe races themselves), giving insight into what he was going through at thetime. It may sound strange that I'm taken by this non-interactive part of thegame, but Loeb is engaging and informative. His commentary gives weight to thechallenges, making me want to tackle them and see how I measure up.A traditional career track allows you to race in rallies to earncredits to buy cars, which in turn unlock other racing tiers with their ownentry requirements. This structure gives you enough to do without having togrind, and plenty of tracks and the occasional non-rally stage-based event(elimination on a rallycross track, sector battle, rally drift, etc.) mixthings up.You race in locations around the world  Italy, Australia, Sweden,Finland, Wales, Monte Carlo, and others  each with their own stages andfactors such as day/night and weather. Similar to the Sebastien Loeb careerchallenges and videos, context makes the career mode's feature set notable.Currently, it constitutes more content than the other rally titles on themarket, and while the career mode's collection of races isn't revelatory in andof itself, it's good to see that Milestone didn't skimp.Multiplayer adds to the docket, consisting of simultaneous racingagainst other players, but the real-time ghost cars representing them aredistracting when you've got two or three competitors piled up in the samecorner. These races have a range of day/night options, but they are alsorestricted to being single-stage rally races and rally cross.The racing itself is not as robust as the quantity of content. Thegame tries to be more sim-orientated than arcade-inspired, but the vehiclephysics can be unsatisfying. Your car can bounce around the track too muchafter striking some roadside objects (some you expect to be able to plowthrough, while others you can't), and it flips and spins wildly when doing soat higher speeds. When you crash you can use a limited number of rewinds toallow yourself a second chance, but the feature became inexplicably unavailableat times. Finally, I found the default handling similarly touchy. I adjustedthis in the car settings by introducing more understeer, but I was rarelysatisfied with how the car felt.I half expected this game to be a shallow vanity project, but it's gotmore substance than that. The number of tracks and the career structure exposeyou to more content than most rally titles, even if the racing itself isn'ttight enough to compete with the top dogs.", "date": "Mar 02, 2016", "grade": "7.5"}
