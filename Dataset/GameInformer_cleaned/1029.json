ThisTim Burton-esque romp through the nightmare dreamscapes of the Edgewood Homefor Lost Children is almost everything a player looking for a modern roguelitecould desire. Featuring achievements that matter, high difficulty, randomizeddungeon crawls and some elements of choice thrown in, this darkly beautifultitle feels like the perfect evolution of the style of game that Binding of Isaacbrought into the spotlight.Budget constraints in manyKickstarter and Greenlight games can become apparent in bare visuals and sounddesign, but that isnt the case with this one. The strange gothic environments,bizarre enemies, and charming-yet-haunting soundtrack complement the gameperfectly. It has a Nightmare Before Christmasfeel going for it that dulls the sting of continual deaths.Death is permanent andfrequent, but all is not lost. Crystals obtained from each level are used topurchase various upgrades. Some are permanent character boosts that make thingsa little easier, but the best and most interesting improvements come from theunique achievement system. Forget unlocking a meaningless amount of points or agold trophy; you actually need to complete achievements in order to unlock andaccess various courses. These courses add various powers and abilities, andonly a certain number can be equipped. The majority of achievements need to beearned by completing various boss encounters in specific and often difficultways, like defeating the Ice Dragon with his own ice shards or staying withinthe Candelabras light radius during the entire duration of the fight.The game also features aleveling system that is reset upon each respawn. Defeating enemies givesexperience points, and at each level up players can pick one of two options.Most of the time these are simple things like some additional attack damage,speed, health, and some more interesting bonuses tacked on to base stats  likeadditional damage to bosses or bonus chances to find special rooms. Theseoptions combined with courses allow a player some serious customization optionsto complement the random power-ups acquired through a characters life. Playerscan also choose their route through Edgewood, often having the option ofpicking two to three different floors to explore. These options give playerssome additional choices before venturing forth.The level of difficultyis high. While some bosses and enemies can be better handled through rotememorization and practice, the random dungeons are often lethal. Step into a cloudof confusion chalk and youre likely to get killed and find yourself back atthe starting line. While the villains start off rather slow and easy to walkaround, you find this quickly changes as you delve deeper into Edgewoodsmysteries. This challenge is perfect for the player that can take a beating andcome back inspired to take on new challenges, occasionally becoming just a bitstronger through crystal upgrades and coursework.Our Darker Purpose is fast-pacedlife-and-death frolic and provides many hours of delightfully difficultgameplay. An unforgiving game is nothing new, but the clever setting combinedwith the challenge and customization makes this title shine within its ownniche category.", "date": "Jan 30, 2014", "grade": "8.75"}
