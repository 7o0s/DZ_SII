Despite the skulking creatures success on the silver screen, its video game adaptations have been less consistent. For instance, Colonial Marines tired shooting mechanics and bug-riddled environments created a lackluster experience, while Isolation emulated the gripping unease of the franchises best movies. Aliens: Fireteam Elite tries and often fails to establish itself in the middle ground. The environments  dimly lit corridors and abandoned caverns  sell the atmosphere, but uninspired A.I. and repetitive mission design ultimately do more harm than your average chestburster.From the jump, you create an avatar, choose your favorite class, assemble an alien-slaying loadout, and set out alongside two players (or bots when playing solo) to take down some Xenomorph menaces. Fireteam Elites unremarkable plot takes place throughout four consecutive campaigns. Evil conglomerate Weyland-Yutani is unsurprisingly back at their nefarious antics, sacrificing innocent human lives for unethical alien research. Your task force is sent to the outer colonies to deal with the fallout. Sadly, there are no exciting twists or turns. If youre a fan of the series, youve come across the illegal-experiment-gone-wrong trope more times than youd care to remember.In every firefight, numerous Xenomorphs or rogue synthetics fill the screen, clambering over one another  from pesky facehuggers and tool-wielding working Joes to 7-foot tall, bipedal Praetorians and heavy-infantry androids. Staff sergeant Herrera, the aggressive voice in your ear, oversees your progress through each campaign, but her directives and each missions overall level design, never change. Sure, you might traverse the awe-inspiring remnants of Prometheus ancient humanoid civilization (a nice break from the first missions dull storage bays and metallic hulls). However, your orders remain to advance upon a point of interest, activatea console or place a scanner, and hunkerdown amid incoming swarms while navigating linear maps. Rinse and repeat. Setting fortifications like sentry turrets and mines help alleviatethe repetition, but Fireteam Elite has no intention of surprising its players or experimenting with its typical shoot-from-cover mechanics.Your marines personality is disappointingly nonexistent, and character customization is a cosmetic tag-on. Thankfully, classes add an important strategic component to the action. Each class comes equipped with two abilities andweapon specializations that can alter the flow of combat. Additionally, you can swap onto different roles during mission prep. The Docs Trauma Station heals the entire squad in a small radius and works like a charm in narrow passageways while the Demolishers assortment of heavy weapons, like the smart gun and flamethrower, dole out serious punishment and are helpful when things get dicey. I enjoyed leveling up my favorite classes to unlock rare perks like extended ability durations, which came in handy when selecting harder difficulties.Managing abilities and securing different angles while also watching teammates backs created moments of thick tension. Its too bad that those moments are few and far between. While enemies come from many different directions, each gunfight plays the same way. This is indicative of Fireteam Elites larger issue: monotony.After reaching a checkpoint, you can return to your base of operations  an empty hangar, save for a smattering of forgettable, lore-dump NPCs  to purchase new weapons, attachments, perks, consumables (like elemental bullets), and other gear. You can also buy challenge cards that make missions harder for the added benefit of amassing a more significant fortune. When nearing the end of the campaign, I appreciated those challenge cards and used the funds to buy better mods and perks to meet the higher combat rating requirements of the final assault. On the other hand, this also meant that I spent time grinding through previously beaten sections. And with no variances in the gameplay, this got old quickly. Theres no avoiding this grind; youll have to backtrack more than once to complete the entire campaign since experience pointsand money don'tgrow on trees.Weekly objectives called Tactical Opportunities dish out some extra currency for completing miscellaneous tasks like running a certain class or eliminating enemies with specific weapon types. Still, the payout isnt worth replaying carbon-copy missions. Whats more, once the campaign is over, horde mode is finally unlocked, which  you guessed it!  reuses the locales and mission goals that youve already cycled through multiple times.Aliens: Fireteam Elite occasionally fires on all cylinders, especially during battles. Xenomorph and synthetic limbs tear at you as you buffet them with high-energy bullets. The carnage produces pools of acid blood that dealextra damage if you dont watch your step. Even Austin Wintorys dissonant score and the array of nostalgic sound effects  particularly the whirring pulse rifle and thudding footsteps of approaching drones  help immerse you in the Alien universe. Unfortunately, theres not enough interesting or entertaining content to parse through, and the grind gets tedious. Developer Cold Iron Studios promised a year of post-launch content, but unless substantial changes are made to the loop, youre better off steering clear of this messy infestation.The troubles of flying soloAliens: Fireteam Elites A.I. co-op partners, Alpha and Beta, are significantly inferior to human allies. On casual, your numbskull allies pack a punch, but as you ramp up the difficulty, their stopping power plummets. Certain Xenomorph/synthetic variants are nearly impossible to defeat alone, so you'llneed to rely on your companions. To make matters worse, Alpha and Beta are limited to grenades, so dont expect them to activate any buffs or heal you when youre in the red. Those robotic jerks also tend to ignore you when youre downed, bringing all that campaign progress to a blistering and heart-wrenching halt.", "date": "Guisao on Aug 23, 2021", "grade": "6.5"}
