The continuation of BioWares blockbuster sci-fi franchise was one of the most acclaimed games of 2010. With its release on PlayStation 3, the Mass Effect universe reaches out to a new audience and proves that its still a must-play title a year later. If you need a refresher on what made this game so successful, you can read our review of the Xbox 360 version here, but I wont waste any more time reiterating what everyone already knows: Mass Effect 2 is awesome. That hasnt changed for the PlayStation 3 version, but not everything about the experience is the same.Since the first Mass Effect remains an Xbox 360 exclusive, PS3 owners need a way to get caught up on the story before beginning the sequel. BioWares answer to that dilemma is the inclusion of a digital comic book that summarizes the plot and prompts you to make a handful of choices that affect the state of the galaxy in Mass Effect 2. While its better than nothing, the comic is totally lame. It omits all of the events of the Feros mission (a large section of the game), the art doesnt do the story justice, and the moments of decision have practically no context. Whats the point of selecting Save Wrex if you have no idea what a great character he is?One of the thrills of Mass Effect 2 on 360 was seeing how your smaller choices carried over, and thats another area where youll miss out on PS3. I know EAs hands are tied in this respect (playing the original and then the sequel just wont happen on PS3), but the lack of that connection and ownership makes it feel like youre playing with someone elses Shepard. It doesnt significantly diminish the narrative or the action, but its enough to make me recommend the game on 360 to anyone who has the option.Not all of the differences between the consoles come out in the 360s favor. You get more for your money on PS3, since all three of the major downloadable missions  Kasumi, Overlord, and Lair of the Shadow Broker  are already on the disc and seamlessly integrated into the experience. Plus, you can still connect to the Cerberus Network and download free add-ons like Zaeed and the Normandy crash site. You dont need to worry about paying for extra missions; you get everything worth playing for the price of admission.On the technical front, BioWare has said that this version of the game has graphical improvements, supposedly making it more than a simple port. While the PS3 version has subtle differences that become apparent in a side-by-side comparison, calling them improvements is a stretch. That isnt a knock against the game; it still looks fantastic, but as someone who played through the 360 version multiple times, the changes dont seem like drastic leaps forward.Despite a few differences between the two consoles, you ultimately cant go wrong if youre playing Mass Effect 2. The characters, the story, and the gameplay come together to deliver a jaw-dropping adventure unlike anything else. Yes, reliving the choices of the first Mass Effect as an interactive comic book pales in comparison to importing your own Commander Shepard. However, aside from losing that consistency in the universe, Mass Effect 2 is just as good on PS3 as it on 360.", "date": "Jan 18, 2011", "grade": "9.5"}
