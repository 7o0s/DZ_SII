While the settings and scenarios may bedifferent, most titles use similar gameplay vocabularies to immerse andentertain us. Concepts like shooting the bad guys, leveling up yourcharacter, and acquiring new items are so pervasive that they have beeninextricably woven into most players definition of what it means to bea video game. Heavy Rain forces you to reconsider that definition. Itis barely a game in the popular sense of the word, but Quantic Dreamsmasterpiece makes groundbreaking strides in storytelling and characterdevelopment, demonstrating that interactive entertainment still has adeep well of untapped potential. Heavy Rain is a game aboutchoice  but not the kind of black-and-white moral decisions upon whichgames typically rely. Its about choices that send ripples through theentire experience, changing what you see and coloring your perceptionof the characters. On a basic level, you watch the mystery of theOrigami Killer unfold. Beyond that, how the plot and characters developis up to you. Fight or flee? Surrender or suffer? Kill or be killed?Your decisions arent just brief forks in the road before the pathsre-converge. Two players could follow unique arcs through the story,see different characters live and die, and come away with an entirelydifferent idea of what happened and why.Playing out like thechapters of a book, your control alternates between four protagonists,each gathering clues and driven by their own agenda. The order you playthe characters and the direction of their stories vary depending on howyou interact with the world during freeform exploration andcontext-sensitive button presses and motions, which comprise theentirety of what Heavy Rain offers in terms of traditional gameplay.Simply pressing a button may not sound compelling at first, but whenyour characters finger in on the trigger, or when a childs life restsin your hands, that single motion is just as intense as any boss fight.When you can read the conflict and pain right on the charactersexpressions (thanks to the games amazing facial models), the choicesare even more powerful. During one particularly rough sequence, I wasliterally cringing as I pressed down, forced to decide between twoequally reprehensible options.While these harrowing decisionsgive the story its edge, the quiet and subtle moments are just asintegral to shaping your vision of the characters. Allowing the dad tolose a toy sword fight with his son, deciding what the insomniacjournalist does at two in the morning, or making the gruff privateinvestigator close his desk drawer without taking a swig of whiskey these are the incidental events that slowly uncover complex emotionslike trust, grief, and love. The characters are defined through thesecasual choices, building a foundation to work from when youre facedwith dictating their actions in the high-stakes scenarios.Yourlittle choices and big ones fuse in a single, seamless narrative. Nomatter how you perform during the timed button presses, the story goeson, and the chapters flow from one to the other so brilliantly thatyoull have trouble imagining how things could have happened any otherway. I strongly recommend you avoid the temptation to replay chaptersif things dont go as you hope; there is no success or failure, and byretrying until you win, all youll end up with is a more disjointedview of the events.Not all of the stumbling blocks in HeavyRains story spring from replaying chapters. While the plot isremarkably cohesive given the games ambitions, cracks appear in a fewareas. One seemingly major thread is unceremoniously dropped abouthalfway through, and several of the side characters feel more likestock archetypes than believable people. The voice acting can be toughto bear at times, too  especially when no one can consistentlypronounce origami. But for every instance where the gamescomposition falters, there are dozens where it gracefully glides onuninterrupted.Taking the right lessons away from its previoustitle, Indigo Prophecy, developer Quantic Dream has shorn away mosttraditional video game trappings from Heavy Rain. What remains is aninnovative journey through an engrossing and well-paced mystery. Youregiven just enough gameplay to forge a connection to the world and itscharacters, but not so much that it interferes with the gamescinematic sensibilities. Heavy Rain is a truly pioneering title, andhopefully the vanguard for a new genre of interactive narratives.", "date": "Feb 10, 2010", "grade": "9.5"}
