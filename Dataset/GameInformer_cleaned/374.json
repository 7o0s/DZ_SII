WRC 5 may feature pure rallyracing, but its singular focus does not produce exemplary results. One of the things that initially intrigued mewas the inclusion of contracts with different race teams in the career mode.While these teams have different stats such as mentality, confidence, andefficiency, I didn't find a big difference between the teams that valued speedversus bringing the car home largely undamaged, for example. I took a contractwith the latter for a season, and found they were happy as long as I wasposting good results regardless of how much they had to keep fixing my carbetween days. At the end of each season you can take on a new contract as youclimb the ranks of three racing tiers (J-WRC, WRC-2, and WRC), but ultimatelythe contracts offer little impetus to spur you forward.This unremarkable approach ripples throughoutthe game. WRC 5's main features don't deviate from basic expectations; it has arally school tutorial section, online ghosts of player times to race against,developer-created online challenge times, and the option to rewind to thebeginning of a stage section if you mess up your run. WRC 5 also fails to distinguish itself behindthe wheel. For me, rally racing is about holding my breath while hurtling downtoo-narrow roads and living life one corner at a time. The courses feature somedangerous situations, such as jagged rocks waiting to shred the side of yourcar, chicane barriers in the middle of roads, and plenty of corners you don'twant to cut, but either because the sense of speed isn't overwhelming orbecause the cars feel a little too deliberate in their control, I didn't getthat rush I usually do in a rally title.I'll give developer Kylotonn Games credit: Asmuch as I think the cars (particularly the ones in the first two tiers) feel alittle stiff, the game doesn't artificially help you into your slides or relyoverly on the handbrake. I often liked riding the brake and throttlesimultaneously into turns to get around them.A rally game focused solely on the sport is a rare thing, and it's anopportunity to dive into this type of racing and concentrate on what makes itspecial. While WRC 5 offers a decent experience, it lacks bite or anydistinguishing characteristics.This review pertains to the PlayStation 4 version. It also appears on Xbox One, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Vita, and PC.", "date": "Nov 12, 2015", "grade": "6"}
