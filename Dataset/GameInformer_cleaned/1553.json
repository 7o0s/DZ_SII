The object of your affection is a beautiful-yet-helpless maiden whom you guide through a monster-infested castle.  Dokuro does it all in the name of love, but the princess doesnt show much reciprocation. This is a tale about unrequited love, alright. Our princess is so dependent that she cant go down one step without assistance. Thats not the most disheartening part; a puzzle game should engage and challenge with its design, but Dokuro puzzles just arent all that fun to solve.Weve seen helpless characters before, such as Marios Princess Peach and Icos Yorda, but this princess takes the cake due to her stupidity. She moves whenever theres a path in front of her, but she doesnt recognize imminent danger. Her reactions to these situations are inconsistent. If you clear a path too early, she walks straight into hazards (like spikes and fire), but attempts to run away from enemies. Does she care about her survival or not? Her inability to exercise any rational caution makes her a frustrating companion. I wish she served some purpose, like having a special ability that made her an asset in some way, because her incomprehensible actions only make her a burden.The dungeons cause similar frustrations with their inconsistencies. Some I cleared in 30 seconds or less, but others took me hours to figure out. If a puzzle is too difficult, you can skip it and return later, but you can only do that 10 times during the whole game. That isnt a problem with the easy levels, but the uneven difficulty progression means that you never know when a tough challenge will interrupt the cakewalk. The longer puzzles, usually consisting of moving items around the environment, are unforgiving. Plenty require experimenting to uncover their solutions, but certain actions are irreversible. Without rewind or checkpoint features, a misstep costs significant time  and it stings even more since you need to reposition items, nail platforming jumps, and defeat annoying enemies all over again. I cant tell you how many times I had to completely restart a level just as I figured out how to solve the puzzle.Dokuro does have some variety, with many different skills for puzzle-solving. For instance, Dokuro has the power to turn into a handsome prince, who can deal more damage to enemies, and most importantly carry the princess down that one step she cant hop down herself. As the game progresses, Dokuro receives more intricate powers, such as special chalk enabled by the touchscreen that lights bomb fuses and repairs ropes. The chalk mechanics add a fun layer of creativity to puzzles.Unfortunately, not all of the touchscreen implementation is exciting. For instance, enemies emit screen-filling fog you must wipe away. When youre trying to solve a puzzle and figure out your next move, its not exactly a fun obstacle, especially since the fog returns almost immediately until you defeat the enemy.Between its unforgiving nature, unbalanced difficulty, and humdrum puzzles, I wouldnt have pressed on through Dokuro if I wasnt reviewing it. Rarely did I feel that fun a-ha moment that makes puzzle games exciting; instead I found tedium and frustration. I surely wasnt as devoted to this game as Dokuro was to the princess. Add me to the list of Dokuros unrequited loves.", "date": "Oct 16, 2012", "grade": "6"}
