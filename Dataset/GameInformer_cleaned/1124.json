What originally started as a multiplayer-only hardcorePC shooter has steadily evolved over the last decade to achieve masssuccess. Along the way, developer DICE has built on its solidfoundation of team-focused air, land, and sea battles with impressivenew features like destructible environments and deeper progressionsystems. At the same time, the studio has struggled to branch outwith engrossing cooperative or single-player experiences. As ifacting off muscle memory, Battlefield 4 follows this same pattern,with another strong dose of large-scale multiplayer and a forgettablestory campaign. Battlefield 4's multiplayer largelytakes its cues from the pre-existing playbook, mixing some long-lostideas with a few innovations that enhance teamwork. To help consoleplayers better communicate with one another without the need of aheadset, DICE carried over the commarose from PC to consoles. Byholding the right bumper (which handles spotting as well) players canrequest ammo, health packs, and repairs. To encourage soldiers toplay the objectives in team-based games, DICE also tweaked the pointsystem. Flag captures and M-Com arming aren't all-or-nothingpropositions anymore, so players earn points incrementally. If youget capped at the last second when trying to disarm an M-Com station,at least you get rewarded for trying to save your team.The 10 new maps deliver a nice varietyof environments. During any given mission, you wind through urbanstreets, roll through fields in a tank, and make amphibious assaultsvia boats. Each level features a ~Levolution moment,~ which isessentially an opportunity for DICE to showcase its technicalprowess. The quality of these experiences wavers from impressive togimmicky. When the tsunami kicks up in Paracel Storm it makesshooting from boats much more challenging, testing the skills of thebest machine gunners. In other levels, I wish DICE had left the mapsalone. Watching a skyscraper fall is cool the first time, but as youplay more matches in Siege of Shanghai, you realize the map is somuch better with the tower standing tall. Some of these fallenbuildings are also tough to navigate, as your soldier often getscaught on the awkward geometry.While the best maps, like HainanResort, work no matter which of the seven modes you are playing, somemaps were clearly designed with one style of play in mind. If youlike Team Deathmatch or Domination,you may enjoy Operation Locker, but the corridor design makes it aterrible option for the new Obliteration mode.Perhaps the best new mode to beintroduced to Battlefield since Rush, Obliteration places a bomb inthe middle of the map. From here, teams must vie for possession andthen try to detonate it at one of the opponents' three objectives.The first team to detonate all three wins. The best way to win thistug-of-war is to coordinate with teammates, picking up the bombcarrier in a vehicle and rushing across the map in a convoy. Thesematches have a great sense of urgency and almost give you thesensation of participating in a team sport.The second new mode, Defuse, is aCounter-Strike style, five-on-five competition where each player onlyspawns once. You can win by either eliminating the other team or bydetonating a bomb. This game mode goes quickly, so it's a greatchange of pace from the lengthy conquest and rush modes.The infantry-focused modes like teamdeathmatch and domination aren't nearly as compelling. Simply put,not many of these maps stand up to the offerings from competing gameslike Call of Duty, and they also mitigate the value of splittingplayers into different classes. The engineer class is hardly usefulin these battles, and the game doesn't have the same attractionwhen you remove vehicles from the mix.One of the big problems previousBattlefield games faced was the steep learning curve of morecomplicated vehicles like helicopters and jets. To help soldiers whowould rather learn how to operate vehicles without the threat ofconstant fire, DICE added a test range for practice. This should cutdown on the amount of battles where a soldier hops into a helicopterand crashes it immediately. However, since you can't have more thanone person in the test range at a time, players still need to joinlive-fire battles to master subtleties like knowing when to firecountermeasures.No matter what mode or class you areplaying, you continually earn rewards thanks to the deep and variedprogression system featured in Battlefield 4. The variety isstaggering, with more types of sights, grips, knives, rocketlaunchers, and camo than any previous Battlefield game. Some areunlocked by ranking up your class or weapon, and others can beacquired at random in a Battlepack, which you receive roughly everythree levels. Battlepacks offer the chance to get a great attachmentearly on, but the randomness comes with a price. Since the itemscontained in a Battlepack are determined by pure chance, you mayreceive attachments for several weapons you haven't unlocked yet.Ever since it was abandoned followingBattlefield 2, a subset of hardcore fans has lamented the loss ofCommander mode. DICE resurrected the mode for Battlefield 4, withseveral significant alterations. As a commander you don't spawninto the world like a normal soldier. Instead, you make all of yourdecisions from a tactical map, which makes it an attractive optionfor players using tablets. From here you can launch UAVs to revealenemy locations on the map, create EMP blasts to neutralize the UAVsof the opposing team, and direct squads to attack or defend specificlocations. Your other options are controlled by how well your team isperforming. If they lock down several control points in conquest,then you are given access to powerful ordinance like cruise missilesand AC-130s that can turn the tide of battle. Not many commanderswere present in the majority of my matches, so it's tough to gaugehow impactful they are in a match's outcome.Commander or no, the deep multiplayerstands in stark contrast to the forgettable single-player campaign.DICE promised an emotional connection with its star characters, butnot even the magnetic Michael K. Williams (Boardwalk Empire,The Wire) could find success with this B-movie-level script.The story follows a squad of Americansoldiers caught in the middle of the action when a civil war eruptsin China. On a mission to extract a couple VIPs from Shanghai in themidst of the madness, the crew shoots its way back to its fleet, onlyto find the U.S. aircraft carrier stationed off the coast completelydecimated. From here, they shoot their way through Chinese airfields,prisons, and remote outposts. The story culminates with achoice-driven ending, but given my lack of attachment to thecharacters I hardly felt engaged enough to weigh my optionsseriously.The combat is improved from Battlefield3 thanks to the removal of quicktime events and the inclusion ofCrysis style micro-sandboxes that let you choose how you want toengage the enemy. You can give the squad at your side basic attackcommands, but in most cases you can wipe out an entire brigade alonebefore your allies can take one enemy out, so I often left them totheir own devices. The bullet-fodder AI hardly presents a challenge,and often pop in out of thin air right in front of you. I wouldexpect an army that has that kind of technology to be much moreformidable. Thankfully, the campaign is short, clocking in at roughlyfive hours.Battlefield 4 doesn't advance theseries in any significant way, but the subtle improvements provideenough incentive for multiplayer fans to invest heavily in the land,air, and sea battles. Given the underwhelming performance of yetanother story campaign, maybe DICE was on to something in ignoringsingle-player altogether in Battlefield 1942. Imagine what the studiocould do if it invested all that manpower into making its alreadygood multiplayer experience even better.Review note: Battlefield4 is also releasing on PlayStation 4 (November 15) and Xbox One(November 22). Though we played these versions, we were notable to fully test all features to the point that they could beincluded in this review. As a result, this text pertains only to theplatforms listed.The Edge If your PC can handle the considerable workload demanded by Battlefield 4, playing on that platform is a no brainer. The PC version looks drastically better, supports 64-player conquest battles, and has a much better Battlelog implementation. The current-gen console versions suffer from muddy shadow textures, frequent environmental pop-up, and caps out at 24 players. In addition, DICE failed to give gamers the option to squad up before joining a server, and no option exists to tweak your loadout in the main menu or in between matches.", "date": "Oct 28, 2013", "grade": "8.75"}
