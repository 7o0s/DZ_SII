{"name": "Watchmen: The End is Nigh Part 1 & 2", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/watchmen_the_end_is_nigh_part_1__2/b/xbox360/archive/2009/09/22/review.aspx", "text": "Remember that terrible overpriced download-only Watchmen beat 'em up that came out around the time the movie hit theaters? Now it's packaged with new levels and released at retail in a box. The PS3 version is $50 and includes the movie, and the 360 edition just has the crappy game for $30. The previously released ''Part 1'' follows Rorschach and Nite Owl's pre-film timeline fight against waves of reskinned identical enemies in boring and repetitive locations. Combos are an option, but you can beat anyone by spamming throws and counters and kicking them while they're down. Part 2 is just as bad, only half as long, and takes place mainly in a strip joint and flophouse devoid of any nudity. If you enjoy making fun of bad movies with friends, the co-op mode might provide you a gaming equivalent, but that's all it's good for.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "5.5"}
