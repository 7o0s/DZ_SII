I have fond memories of both theclassic arcade units and the port that was released for Dreamcast. Newstudio Vector Unit, which includes members of the Blood Wake team,clearly shares this feeling, and has taken a lot of care to recreatethe fast aquatic racing gameplay the franchise was known for.HydroThunder Hurricane is remarkably full-featured for a downloadable game.There are eight tracks, each featuring numerous alternate paths. Thenine boats are a mix of new watercrafts and retooled vehicles from theoriginal (though Id be lying if I told you I actually remembered everyboat from the old game). Aside from the straightforward races, thereare some (not especially creative) modes like Ring Master (where you,obviously, race through rings against a timer) and Gauntlet (where thewater courses are littered with exploding barrels). There aremulti-tiered Championships which string all three event types together,awarding points for placement in each event. In addition, there iseight-player online and four-player offline splitscreen play. Imespecially grateful for the inclusion of split-screen, which fits inperfectly with the era of casual, arcade racing that the game harksback to.Technically, Hydro Thunder impresses. This is a greatlooking game, chock full of bright, compelling visuals. The waterphysics are both visually compelling and crucial to the gameplay learning to draft in a competitors wake is essentially, allowing youto get a boost of speed without wasting valuable boost. Aside from afew camera issues, I cant find fault in the overall presentation andexecution.Though there arent a large number of courses, theeight tracks are well designed and place an emphasis on testing yournerve at every turn. This game isnt about thoughtfully timing yourbraking and approach to each turn; its about blindly mashing the boostbutton and hoping like hell you can catch that next ramp to refill yourtank. Many times youll have the feeling of just squeaking out avictory at the last second, flying by (or over) an opponent just beforethe finish line. Its even more challenging given some of the epiccreatures that will appear to wreak havoc on the course, like hugewater serpents or giant Norse statutes who swing Thor hammers into thewater, creating huge waves and swells you must avoid. Youll also haveto take the time to learn the numerous hidden paths and shortcuts,which become extremely important for victory in the later stages.HydroThunder Hurricane is clearly a work of nostalgia, there arent reallyany new ideas here, just a fervent desire to return video game racingto a time when speed and fun meant more than complex career modes andcustomizable liveries. Its all the more charming for the fact that, inthese declining days of the racing genre, there arent many pure arcaderacers anymore. Perhaps services like Live Arcade can be a new startfor a style of game that deserves a second chance.", "date": "on Oct 04, 2010", "grade": "8"}
