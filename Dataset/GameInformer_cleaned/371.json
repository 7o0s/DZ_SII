If you've ever wondered what Han Solomight have been up to before he met Luke and Obi-Wan in a certain Mos Eisleycantina, Rebel Galaxy does its best to deliver that fantasy but suffers fromstretches of repetition.Your story begins as a wannabe space trader trying to trackdown your legendary aunt who has mysteriously vanished, leaving behind a humblespacecraft for you. Rebel Galaxy's light narrative isn't the driving reason toplay the game, despite some conversations with multiple choices that play outsimilar to the KOTOR titles. Some fun characters populate your adventure, likeHutt-soundalike aliens and shady bartenders, but the whole story seems to existonly as a path to ensure players experience a variety of mission types ofincreasing difficulty. The progression is open-ended from the start, andremains that way after the main story wraps up, so the tale of lost Aunt Junonever seems like the point.Most of your time is spent trolling through thepurplish-black abyss of space and navigating menus in space stations. You cancustomize your ship's laser turrets, hull, cargo hold, and more. Ship-outfittingoptions are plentiful if you have the credits, but the options feel restrictivelylow at the outset given the scarcity of credits. Once you're outfitted, completingmissions earns you more credits for taking down specific targets, deliveringcargo to far-off space stations, or picking up resources from a dead droplocation. The dead drop mission type routinely ends in a protracted shootoutwith competing ships, which always seems to surprise the characters despite thefrequency.Space combat and navigation in Rebel Galaxy have more incommon with naval warfare than the high-speed dogfights some sci-fi fans mightexpect. All cruising and combat takes place on a 2D plane, with no y-axis tocomplicate matters. This design makes navigating asteroid fields andpositioning your ship during combat feel more accessible than more hardcore simslike Elite: Dangerous, which is a great way to let players focus on gettingused to their ship's controls and their place in the galaxy.Since your big spaceship controls more like a battleshipthan a fighter jet, the focus is on broadside combat. Holding down the firebutton displays the transparent aiming trajectory of your laser canonsextending from the side of your ship (imagine naval combat from Assassin'sCreed IV: Black Flag). It's a simplistic-yet-effective way to punish enemyfrigates, but trying to peg more agile enemy fighters who can fly up and down onthe y-axis is frustrating. Thankfully, your weaker laser turrets can lock on totargets for some mindless blasting. Hiring reliable mercenaries who pilot their own fighter jethelps take some of the heat off your huge ship, and perusing hired guns andtheir varying personalities at intergalactic pubs is a nice touch. Stayingalive during Rebel Galaxy's space battles (I was often confronting continuouswaves of five or more enemies at once) feels like a real-time version of FTL,forcing me to manage shields, thrusters, and positioning. Gradually equippingyour ship with tons of lasers and buying progressively larger ships is empowering,but the bread and butter of combat begins to feel repetitive after theintroductory hours.When you're not blasting enemies to bits in beautifullystylized explosions or running supply errands, you can fill time and earn moneya variety of other ways. Asteroids hosting precious metals and other resourcescan be blown into harvestable chunks and stored in your ship (assuming you'vegot the cargo space). You can also track down distress beacons found litteredacross the solar systems as you're traveling at light speed from one side ofthe galactic map to the other. These missions don't vary meaningfully from theones I've highlighted, but they can offer a nice change of pace during extendedjourneys. You can also play the numbers game by trading rare resources on astock market-type exchange, but pouring time into that never felt as fun orworth of my time as simply accepting missions to earn coin.Rebel Galaxy appears complicated out of the gate, but ithits a steady pace after some acclimating to the ship controls and menu-basedfeatures like upgrade shops and the commodity market. The progression loop ofgrinding out missions, earning credits to beef up your ship, then taking itback out again is fun, but the mission design felt too familiar to keep mehooked for the long haul.", "date": "Nov 16, 2015", "grade": "7.5"}
