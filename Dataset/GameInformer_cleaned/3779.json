Not only does Pinball FX 3 unify all ofZen's platforms under one umbrella, it offers a host of new modes andprogression systems to keep players busy. While I have quibbles with how thecompetitive side of Pinball FX 3 is handled, it is still an easy upgrade torecommend to pinball fans.Like Zen's previous offerings, Pinball FX 3 isn't so much a standalonegame as it is a platform. Aside from the one free table included in thedownload (Sorcerer's Lair), players build up their collection by purchasing DLCpacks of tables based on various themes and licenses. Whichever ones youchoose, Zen still reigns supreme in the pinball sim space, offering uprealistic physics, superb visuals, and intricate table designs that can takehours to master. It's an admittedly niche itch that Zen has been scratching foryears, and Pinball FX 3 makes it all the more satisfying.To say that Zen Studios has gone above and beyond to do right byits returning fanbase is an understatement. Not only is the base game a freedownload, but Zen is also allowing players to transfer their Pinball FX 2/ZenPinball 2 tables over to Pinball FX 3 free of charge. While a few tables havehit the cutting room floor due to licensing issues (most notably the recent South Park and Plants vs. Zombiestables), returning players won't have to spend a dime to get their existing collectionsup and running in Pinball FX 3 and reap the improvements. That said, you shouldplan to set aside of good chunk of time for the clunky import process, whichqueues up all of your tables as individual downloads through your console'sdigital store, but all in all it's a small price to pay. The massive library oftables may be daunting to newcomers, but they all offer free demos, so you knowwhat you're getting before you break out your credit card.Pinball FX 3 features numerous quality-of-life improvements likebetter collection sorting and visual upgrades to your existing tables, but thebiggest and most exciting shake-up is the new progression-based challenge mode.This allows players to tackle single-ball, five-minute, and escalating score-attackchallenges, all of which are designed to keep play sessions brisk andbite-sized. Achieving milestones in these challenges unlocks and upgrades threewizard powers that can be used to slow down time, rewind ball drains, ordrastically boost scoring for a short period. You also unlock a variety ofpassive perks just by playing, like bumper-score bonuses and increased combotimers. Challenge mode is an exciting new way to revisit your collection,offering a string of quick-but-demanding goals to shoot for, while alsomitigating the tedium of full-length matches and the frustration of drains (becausethe five-minute and score-attack challenges have unlimited balls). Pinballpurists can always stick to classic mode for their ongoing score rivalries, butthe sense of long-term progress that challenge mode offers is hard to say noto.Pinball FX 3 also offers a couple of new avenues for competitiveplay. Players can now create custom tournaments on their table of choice for friendsor the greater public. The result is a long list of ongoing tournaments at anygiven time. Players can also participate in leagues, which provide more specificseasonal challenges as well as another seemingly endless ladder to climb. The XPrewards for both tournaments and leagues are unfortunately underwhelming, but overtakingsomeone else's high score always offers a satisfying payoff.That brings me to my biggest knock against Pinball FX 3: Thefriendly rivalries that Zen's pinball games have fueled for years aren't aspronounced as in previous games. Sure, each table still offers up a host ofleaderboards, but the automated messaging system that taunts your friends is gone,and the game doesn't notify you which tables you've lost top honors on. As suchyou have to manually check the leaderboards of every table to find out, thencontact your friends through your console's messaging system if you want to fanthe flames of competition. Pinball FX 3 still pops up a notification whenyou're approaching a friend's score during play, but it shows up so close tothe goal that you probably have already beaten it by the time it registers. Thepost-match screen also no longer lauds your victories over your friends, whichdiminishes the sense of achievement. These omissions are a surprising andconfusing step backward compared to Zen's previous games, where your competingscores and rivalries were always front and center. The rivalries are certainlystill there, but the game does not encourage them enough.Pinball FX 3's table guides are also due for a redesign. A newgeneral tutorial does a good job coaching players on a few basic pinballprinciples on an actual table. However, the table guides are still relegated tothe pause menu, and remain text-heavy and tedious to parse. As such learningthe ins and outs of a table is still a time-consuming process, as is refreshingyour memory of how to score big on old favorites. I'd love to see future tableguides take the teaching to the table like the general tutorial.All in all, Pinball FX 3 contains a number of welcome additionsand improvements, and gives pinball fans what they need most: an excuse toreturn to and keep replaying all of their favorite tables. Hopefully the studiocan also shore up and heighten the sense of rivalries again, but either way,it's a great time for pinball wizards to dive back in.", "date": "Nov 02, 2017", "grade": "8"}
