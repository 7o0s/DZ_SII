Anything can happen during a match, includingstealthy shootouts from behind crates, getting shot in the back while trying tocross an open field, and snagging a risky airdrop for some potent weapons andarmor. Variety is the spice of life, and its also the cornerstone of H1Z1 thatkeeps you coming back for more.The core mode can be played solo, with a friend, or with ateam of five, so you can enjoy the bloody melee without having to worry howmany friends you have around. Making it down to the final circle of play whiledodging airstrikes, bullets, and poison gas is often a thrilling experience, andyou can go from hero to zero with the single crack of a shotgun. Whatever yourskill level, making it to the last moments of a match is fun and frantic, and snack-sizedstories often happen along the way. A player who gives away their location withproximity voice chat by accident when his mom calls him downstairs for chickentenders, the player who just does donuts in a cop car around a warehousewaiting for someone to come pick a fight, or the jaded sniper waiting for youon top of the final hill. These are all memorable moments that make a matchinteresting and engaging.The one-life, last-person standing structure creates a high-tensionslaughterhouse that is is the bedrock of H1Z1, but it has other neat modes thatdifferentiate it from battle royale competitors. One is Combat Zone which landsplayers in a small playing field, forcing tons of immediate action for allparticipants, and everyone starts fully loaded with a rack of weapons ready torock. More importantly, it also allows players to immediately respawn and getright back into the endless battle. Combat Zone is an excellent way to get a handle on howweapons fire, combat tactics, and more in a zero-stress environment. It is theperfect aperitif if youre a seasoned player looking to practice with certainweapons, or if youre a new player who wants extra trigger time before steppinginto a mode where the stakes are higher.Getting behind the wheel in the standard game is a powerfulway to zip around the ever-shifting field of play, but vehicular gameplay istaken to a new level in the Auto Royale mode where teams are stacked into carsat the beginning of the game. You cant get out of the vehicles, so your driverhad better be adept at slamming on the nitro boosts, hitting the jump pads, andplunking down land mines while the rest of the team unloads buckets of ammo atsupply crates and opposing vehicles. If your car goes up in smoke, thats theend of the match for you. The novelty of Auto Royale is fun for a few roundsand a nice palate cleanser, but it lacks the compelling gameplay loop of thecore mode and ultimately feels like a tacked-on diversion.H1Z1 has some cool modes that give it some extra oomph, butthe field of battle royales already has some excellent choices. H1Z1 has asolid foundation of scavenging, shooting, and surviving, but it needs a littlemore vim and vigor to really compete in the battle royale free-for-all.", "date": "Mar 07, 2018", "grade": "8"}
