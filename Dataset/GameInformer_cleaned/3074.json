Mostly, you'd be right.  However, Vicarious Visions deserves praise for improving this game in a couple of areas. Firstly, the soundtrack is much more appealing to fans of the ''big boy'' version, featuring some dynamic rock songs new and old. Secondly, the new song-sharing feature allows you to stream songs off a friend's copy of the original (and vice versa) for multiplayer. However, the sad fact remains that I don't think there's really anything that the developers can do to fix the game's true problems: the frustratingly inexact touchscreen strumming and the fact that playing this game is an ergonomic nightmare, especially for those with larger hands. Ultimately, what I remember most about this game is the wrist and neck pain.", "date": "on Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
