{"name": "Republique  Episode 1: Exordium", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/republique__episode_1_exordium/b/ios/archive/2013/12/24/republique-exordium-review.aspx", "text": "Mobile gaming is undeniably a big part of the gaming industry at this point, but many titles lack the polish and depth of console and PC offerings. With Rpublique, Ryan Payton and the teams at Camoflaj and Logan are hoping to bring a genuine triple-A experience to mobile devices. In some ways, the attempt succeeds. Its production value and visuals are among the best on the App Store and it features an interesting, 1984-inspired setting, but some awkward stealth mechanics and AI issues keep it from reaching its full potential.This first episode introduces us to Hope, a sentient AI whos in danger of having her memory erased by the authorities at Metamorphosis, a containment facility. Her background and the details of the overall universe of Rpublique are almost entirely a mystery in this first episode, which manages to plant some intriguing seeds for future installments. Story is one of the driving focuses of Rpublique, and fans of Metal Gear Solid (which Payton previously worked on) will certainly see that series influence.Like that long-running stealth series, your objective in Rpublique has far more to do with staying away from guards lines of sights than with confronting them directly. Hope can use tasers and pepper spray as defensive mechanisms, but your best bet is to stay as far away from the baddies as possible.Unfortunately, the focus on stealth leads to some of the main frustrations. Without a direct control option like consoles offer, youre forced to lead Hope around with taps of the screen. Tap a box to duck behind it, tap a door to enter it, double-tap the screen to make her run, etc. It works most of the time, but it can be aggravating to be captured by a guard because Hopes AI caused her to get to a hiding spot in a way you didnt intend. Her AI isnt the only downside, as the guards operate on very strict, predictable paths that feel more mechanical than organic.All of the action is viewed from behind a Big Brother-like series of security cameras, which the player controls. Hope occasionally looks directly at you through the lens and talks to you, but your communication with her is mostly relegated to hacking doors open and telling her where to go. Its pretty cool to view the entirety of a game through a security system, but I occasionally got tired of constantly having to pause and switch perspectives to a new camera.Rpublique is an ambitious title that plays better on a tablet than a phone, but youre bound to run into a few control hiccups regardless of the device. This first episode doesnt clear up much of whats happening in the world of Rpublique, but its presented with a level of production value that I've only seen rivaled by Infinity Blade on iOS. If you can forgive some frustrating control and AI issues, Rpubliques first episode is an intriguing start to this ambitious episodic title.", "date": "Dec 24, 2013", "grade": "7.5"}
