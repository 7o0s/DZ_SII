The racing itself iscertainly the foundation, but the modes give the games a larger context.Recently, however, they haven't been good for F1. Whether underserved or absentaltogether, the only thing carrying the franchise has been nothing but a set offour tires. But having modes is only the first step; building them is another.Going from zero-to-sixty and beyond in a hurry, F1 2016 not only brings backits career mode, but builds it out in impressive fashion.The basics of the career mode aren't unique. Theyinvolve signing with and pleasing your racing team and its sponsors via youron-track performance. Rivalries also pop up between your team's other driverand those from other teams. The ultimate goal is to be the number-one driver onyour team so that you can earn more resource points for your R&D program.What I really like about F1 2016's career mode isthe way it ties your R&D program to the larger race-weekend structure.Usually multiple practice sessions and qualifying before the race are tediousaffairs that I put up with simply because it's standings suicide to not atleast have a few laps of familiarity with the track before race day. F1 2016,however, incentivizes the practice sessions by offering R&D resource pointsfor completing activities called Practice Programs that are also designed tohelp you gain potentially valuable information about the track and your car'sperformance on it.The track-acclimatization program tasks you withgoing through gates that mimic the ideal race line. Tire managementdemonstrates that you can go fast without burning up your tires, and thequalifying-pace program is like a time attack based around your expectedqualifying position.While these same programs are used before everyrace, I was better at some than others, depending on the track and the weatherconditions at the time (I'm so bad at wet weather driving that I cringedwhenever the forecast called for rain on qualifying or race day). If I was particularly good at a program at agiven track, I could always aim for higher objectives for more points.The better teams and drivers will always pushtheir R&D programs and get better results, but the game is balanced well.Through the driver rivalries and programs there are plenty of ways to earnresearch points. Even if I finished in the middle of the pack or didn't do wellduring practice, there was always a way to earn points to keep the R&Dprogram humming in order to keep up with what the other teams were doing.The game strikes a similar balance for novice andseasoned drivers alike with the variety of gameplay customization options. Iappreciate that apart from the usual driving assists, you can choose thevarious race, practice, and qualifying lengths before each race. I mixed andmatched the assists, becoming more comfortable with the car's ferocioushorsepower, and as ever, developer Codemasters makes racing the car a joy, nomatter the setup.The revitalized career mode isn't the onlyaddition this year. The 22-player multiplayer is a bump up from last year, andwhile the ability to play through a full championship season with your friendsis nice, the online portion on a whole needs more structure. A larger profilesystem detailing your accomplishments as a racer is needed to make the modethan about racing a collection of random races. The championship provides somestructure, but this is more about being a hub for your friends to race togetherthan it is about being an online version of the career mode, and it doesn'tallow you to create and join public championships.F12016 has gained a lot of the ground the series has lost over the years, andhopefully Codemasters keeps building upon this excellent foundation. Having theofficial F1 license is a big responsibility that this title finally lives upto.", "date": "Aug 19, 2016", "grade": "8"}
