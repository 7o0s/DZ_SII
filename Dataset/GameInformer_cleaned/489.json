An evil military force has taken over, and its up to this peace-loving pachyderm to come out of retirement and stomp them out  permanently. After applying some Rambo-style face paint and getting airlifted to the front lines, the giant is ready to flatten the bad guys while providing safe passage for rescued hostages on his mighty back. Tembo the Badass Elephants flimsy story is right at home with the rest of this character-driven platformer, which harkens back to the genres roots.Tembo the Badass Elephant isnt quite as badass as its title may enthuse. It ticks off most of the classic platforming tropes  conveyor belts, disappearing platforms, and crushing pistons appear in bulk  but doesnt seem to add much of its own. Aside from a few satisfying moments that involve pushing enormous bowling balls, Ive experienced nearly everything that Tembo offers before.Our hero is a self-sufficient creature, power ups be damned. He can do a running dash that, thanks to his tusks and boundless enthusiasm, allows him to crash through all but the hardiest objects. His trunk can spray out fires with water, but its more often used as a powerful melee attack. And when Tembo encounters sizeable gaps, he can extend his already impressive leaps with a gravity-stretching hover move. Hes no Dumbo, but hes agile enough to work his way through the intense platforming sections. So much of a platforming games success rides on the characters controls, and Tembo generally handles well. I plummeted to my death a few times accidentally because the same button is used for running and activating his mid-air roll attack, but that was on me. He is a bit slow to recover from failed sprinting-jump attempts, which can be frustrating, and occasionally fatal.The levels are reminiscent of early Sonic games, with large areas featuring plenty of vertical exploration. I enjoyed trying to move off the beaten path to rescue hostages, 10 of which are hidden in each level. You get little medals for finding em all and scouring each level of enemies, but those didnt provide much of an incentive for me to replay the levels.The first few stages set Tembo up as a slightly more lumbering Sonic type, but he doesnt keep that tempo up for long. Once your armed opponents pose more of a threat than the environments, you have to slow down and take a more tactical approach to your movement. I found the transition jarring at first; once I was conditioned to barge into areas and stampede my way through as quickly as possible, it was tough to put on the brakes.Tembos health bar is generously long, but hes all too mortal. In later sections, youre required to clear enemies from gated sections to proceed. If youre foolish and try to blast through these areas, youre going to become quite familiar with the Elephant down screen. Instead, you have to inch along, carefully waiting for the various tanks, choppers, and foot soldiers to fire off their shots, assess the safe spots, and clear out enemies when you can. Once its start-stop-start rhythm clicked, I had a good time knocking the baddies out like tiny dolls and flipping tanks over like card tables.Game Freak is pretty generous with lives and checkpoints, but dont expect to breeze through without a challenge. Auto-scrolling sections are unforgiving, and they drag on for entirely too long. The last boss is, appropriately enough, a particular pain. He was fair in retrospect, but that didnt reduce the fury I felt after each failed attempt. If only my skin were as thick as Tembos.They say an elephant never forgets, but that doesnt mean you cant forget an elephant. Tembo the Badass Elephant is charming and fun while it lasts, but its by-the-numbers gameplay makes me doubt that it will leave a lasting impression on anyone.", "date": "Jul 22, 2015", "grade": "7"}
