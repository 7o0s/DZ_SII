While a single final shot accomplishes the latter, the formeris conspicuously absent from the fourth episode of season two. Throughoutmuch of season two, the stakes have remained high as Jesse and friends havefought directly against the all-powerful Admin in climactic battles that feelincreasingly personal. Rather than continuing to build that tension en route tothe finale, this episode has Jesse wading through the past by exploring asubterranean world where The Admin once lived and thrived in with his friends.Now, it's been left to become a wasteland as the season's big bad eyes biggerprizes.I dolike how this episode features a larger focus on my two favorite parts ofMinecraft: Story Mode's gameplay mechanics: free builds and action scenes.Though the novelty is beginning to fade, I still enjoy being able to placeblocks on a grid however I see fit to accomplish what I'm supposed to do. Thisepisode features two such sequences: one where I'm asked to build a structurethat looks like a specific character, and another that's supposed to lookscary. Unfortunately, these prompts only highlight how limited the buildingtools are, but I still have fun each time these moments present themselves inan episode.The actionsequences are also fun. One scene in particular sticks out as perhaps the mostinvolved the series has seen to date. Sadly, even as I'm guiding Jesse forward,avoiding fireballs as I try and bait a massive creature to hit a switch andbring about its own destruction, I can't help but think that this standout momentin the series would be nothing more than a standard action scene in nearly anyother franchise. The rest of the action is fun, but with my success or failuredetermined by easy-to-hit quick-time events, the excitement is capped.Whilethe final shot does give me a sense of intrigue about the finale, the rest ofthe episode does very little to excite me. Telltale addressed its main issueswith the last episode by doubling down on action and providing more meaningfulinteractions, but with such a detour from the main conflict right before thefinal episode, much of the tension was let out of the balloon. I'm stillcurious to see how this all plays out, but Below the Bedrock did little to fuelmy interest.", "date": "Nov 10, 2017", "grade": "6.5"}
