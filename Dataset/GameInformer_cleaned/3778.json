That wealth of content continueswith Call of Duty: WWII, which features a historically-focused campaign, azombie mode designed to puzzle and scare, and classic multiplayer combat rootedin class-based playstyles and a brand new social hub. Of the many features ondeck, only the campaign falters. The rest of the package is as solid as ever,and for old-school fans of the franchise tired of laser beams and jetpacks, thetitle provides an epic return to form to classic warfare.Through the eyes of a Texan kid out for glory,you land on the beaches of Normandy, battle through occupied France, andeventually bring the fight into the heart of Germany. While the experiences youface are huge WWII battles captured with appropriate grandiose backdrops, theonly chapter that truly stands out is one where you dont fire your weapon atall  an infiltration mission that takes you deep into the heart of Gestapo HQ.The characters in your squad are forgettable cardboard cutouts, a throwawaycast that seems like a slipshod assemblage of Saving Private Ryan, Bandof Brothers, and Platoon. The people you meet from British andFrench factions are far more interesting, and steal the show when they arearound.The campaign captures Call of Dutys signatureexplosive feel through various adrenaline-fueled moments like chases, a tank vstank segment, and firing AA guns. However, the standard gunplay and endlesskilling fields often feel like a slog, taking down hundreds of enemies andmoving to the next defensive position. Counting on your squad for ammo, enemypositions, health packs, grenades, and strikes offers some novelty near thebeginning of the game, but once you settle in, these elements display no importantdifferentiation from classic hide-until-your-health-returns gameplay.Traditional multiplayer is the shining star ofthe three modes. The new objective-oriented War mode includes all kinds ofvarious activities such as moving a tank, building a bridge, and capturingpoint after point, so traditional gunning for a big kill-death-assist ratio is athing of the past. If youre looking forsomething that has established front lines and rewards for working as a team (andwhere you wont get gunned down in the back less than a second after you spawn)War is worth a look.The class-centric division system combined with20th century weaponry feels wonderful. Selecting your division and its focus onvarious weapons and playstyles is meaningful and enjoyable to explore. Whileperks are gone, you still have tons of customization available, and the slowerspeeds make the gameplay more compelling than attempting to abuse wall-runningand power-sliding. Sneaking and sniping with the Lee-Enfield in the Mountaindivision or unloading a bucket of incendiary shotgun shells into the enemy asExpeditionary is exhilarating. If you just want to get those crisp shots offwith the Garand and execute an occasional bayonet charge on an opportunetarget, you can.By eliminating the standard lobby and giving youa place to play in between games, Headquarters is a fun and lightweight experience.You can watch 1v1s, test guns at the shooting range, prestige, and pick upmissions. You can even go play a fairly extensive list of ancient Activisiongames like Pitfall II. This social space is an awesome inclusion that makesyour downtime interesting, and I cant see going away now that the door is open.Supply drops earned through gameplay are opened in this social space, hookingup any onlookers with bonuses from time to time. All drops are cosmetic andits a lot of fun cracking crates and outfitting your character with newuniforms, emotes, pistol grips, and more.Nazi Zombies is the scariest iteration of themode that has graced a Call of Duty title, boasting some jump scares and anabsolutely occult vision of the Final Reich. Casual players coming over fromother modes should have no problem surviving for much longer than they have inprevious entries. However, the focus remains on discovery; players must do muchmore than slaughter legions of zombies, such as enabling an escape-tubenetwork, powering up generators, unlocking a weapon power-up station, findingclues hidden in paintings, and more. Nazi Zombies plays more like a structuredstory than previous versions, with themed encounters hitting alongside thestandard wave-based fare. Permanent progression aspects give a continuing senseof advancement as they unlock tokens from playthrough to playthrough, which youcan spend on new mods to enhance your characters and loadouts, giving meaningto even the most bitter defeats. Discovering just a bit more each time headingunderneath the snow-packed earth of Mittelburg is a grisly, enjoyableexperience.While the campaign fails to provide a compellingtale and is often bogged down in uninteresting large-scale slaughter, Call ofDuty:WWII nails its multiplayer, new social hub, and zombie modes to providethe back to boot-on-the-ground experience fans have clamored for since thefirst foray into space.This review pertains to the PlayStation 4 version of the game. Call of Duty: WWII is also available on Xbox One and PC.", "date": "Nov 02, 2017", "grade": "8.75"}
