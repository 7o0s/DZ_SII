They dont even exist, so you have thatworking against your budget from the get-go. Dont worry  Capcom hasyour back. You dont need to time-travel back to the NES era to playthe newest 8-bit Mega Man game; the tenth entry in the Blue Bombersclassic series has arrived on the downloadable market, and its packedwith even more old-school goodness than its predecessor.Ifyouve played any Mega Man game in last two decades, then you alreadyknow the basics. Eight robot masters are up to no good, spreading havocand corrupting mechanical minions across their themed levels. Thebosses of Mega Man 10 are some of the best in the series, featuringtight, rhythmic battles; the likes of Sheep Man and Nitro Man make forsome gripping fights, though Dr. Wilys final forms leave a lot to bedesired. Diehard Mega Man fans will be disappointed by the ease withwhich the mad scientists ultimate weapons are destroyed, but abusedgamers may find the softened finale a nice break.The EdgeWeapon selection in Mega Man games has traditionally been performed inmenus or by using the shoulder buttons of modern controllers. Mega Man10 plays well across the board, but if you use the Wii remote, bewarethat the A and B buttons have been mapped to on-the-fly weaponselection. The game is hard enough without having to worry about yourfinger slipping and firing Rush Jet at your enemy. Be sure to play witha classic controller or nothing at all on Wii. To compensate the 360sterrible d-pad, I recommend snagging a Genesis-esque controllerdesigned for fighting games. As usual, the PS3 controller is perfectfor Mega Man. Choose your weapon wisely.Each level of Mega Man 10 is polished to perfection. Capcom had8-bit game development nearly mastered back in the 80s and 90s, butits skills have somehow gotten better with time. In Commando Mansstage, youll intentionally sink into quicksand to destroy entrenchedenemies. Navigating the fragile platforms of Chill Mans glacial leveladds an interesting dont-break-the-ice suspense. Additionally, Dr.Wilys fortress is among the best in the series, containing the mostsatisfying mini-bosses Ive ever dismantled. Even the infamous bossrematches are a blast, as you finally get to deduce all of theirweaknesses.If Mega Man 9s unrelenting difficulty held you backfrom enjoying the game, this is the perfect entry to try again. MegaMan 10 incorporates a straightforward easy mode; tricky spike pits haveconvenient platforms floating above them, enemy numbers are reduced,and robot masters pull a few punches. The real beauty of the reduceddifficulty is it curbs the frustration while preparing you for normaland hard mode playthroughs.The core game of Mega Man 10 is easily worth the price of admissionby itself, but theres even more to sweeten the deal. Proto Man returnsas a playable character, but this time hes selectable immediatelyinstead of as DLC. Mega Mans older brother adds diversity to thesimple gameplay mechanics; he can charge shots, slide, and blockprojectiles with his shield, but at the cost of receiving double damageand shooting fewer bullets. His unique attributes require you torethink how you approach the game, and his vulnerability instills aconstant fear of death. Powering through Mega Man 10 with Proto Man isas harrowing as it is rewarding. Mega Man 10 marks the debutof challenge mode, a new feature to the series. Within, you cancomplete tons of various skill-testing objectives, each entertainingexercise emphasizing a different key gameplay mechanic. The simple yetfulfilling tasks range from navigating perilous platforms to destroyinga set of air-themed enemies. I found challenge mode to be a fun andrefreshing distraction when I got stuck on tough parts of the maingame. After being pounded into the dirt by Chill Man, completing simplechallenges renewed my morale before attempting another assault.Speaking of Chill Man, after reaching (but not necessarily beating) arobot master, you unlock them in challenge mode for practice. Nothaving to trek through long stages to try your hand at brutal bosses isa welcome time-saver.Overall, Mega Man 10 offers all the nutsand bolts a diehard blue bomber fan could want in a retro sequel, whileboasting even more content than Mega Man 9 with all its DLC combined.The game's technical ambitions are modest and it's not a life-changingexperience, but it delivers nostalgic fun in truckloads. Franchisenewcomers who crumbled at Wilys merciless hand in the past shouldntshy away from this great downloadable title.", "date": "Mar 01, 2010", "grade": "8.75"}
