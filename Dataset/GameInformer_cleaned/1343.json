Most seem content to re-useconvenient crutches like pushing half-baked side stories that offer no newnarrative insight or simple aesthetic enhancements like costumes. Recently,Ubisoft has instead offered splinter content that leverages the resources ofthe original game to create a unique experience that has no integral ties tothe base game. One Assassin's Creed III standalone DLC tells the story of an alternate historywhere George Washington turns into a tyrannical ruler. For Far Cry 3: BloodDragon, Ubisoft Montreal leverages the high technology of its forefather tochannel the spirit of the era when Arnold Schwarzenegger dominated box offices. Blood Dragon pays homage to the action films, cartoons, andgames of the '80s and '90s with its paper-thin plot, explosive action, andunapologetically sophomoric humor. Weapons are named after action icons likeRoboCop. The 8-bit inspired cutscenes conjure memories of the NES era. Even theDrew Struzan-style box art would be right at home on a VHS tape. Each subtleflourish demonstrates an admiration for a time when entertainment productsweren't overly concerned with political correctness or insightful thematic messages.This game starts and ends with cyborg armies, cheesy dialogue, and lasers.In this alternate reality 2007, the Cold War is stillraging, Canada and Australia have been nuked, and women still style their hair like Rocky IVactress Brigitte Nielsen. When his former Omega Force commanding officer goesrogue to raise an army of android killing machines, cocky cyber commando SergeantRex Power Colt (voiced by Terminator actor Michael Biehn) sets his blasters to~annihilate.~ Clearly inspired by Duke Nukem and the action heroes who camebefore him, this half man, half machine spits out one liners like a gatling gunspits bullets and celebrates high body counts by throwing up the devil's hornswith his cybernetic fingers. Andriods aren't the only threat facing Rex; mutantanimals and dinosaur looking menaces known as blood dragons also roam thisisolated island.Blood Dragon's neon veneer and synth-heavy soundtrack maycall to mind B action movies, but this retro aesthetic is slapped on top of thestate-of-the-art Far Cry 3 engine. The tight gunplay, open-world exploration,animal hunting, and wealth of side activities all return with slightmodifications to fit the totally radical motif. Only a handful of storymissions chronicle Sgt. Rex Power Colt's revenge tale (including a hilariousand explosive finale), so players spend the majority of the time capturinggarrisons, completing rote side missions, and finding the collectablesscattered across the island.The island houses 13 garrisons, each with slight architecturalvariations. Nearly all of them have high walls, so picking off enemies fromafar isn't always an option. Your best bet is often infiltrating the base, deactivating the alarms, and stealthily picking guys off one by one. If a blood dragon is nearby, I recommend turning off the base shields and chucking a cyborg heart toward one of the doors to lure it in. These beasts are more than capable of doing the dirty work for you.Once liberated, the garrisons open up a few differentside mission types (rescuing hostage scientists, hunting rare animals, orassassinating elite cyborgs). A couple of these side missions break from thepack (including one inspired by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), but the repetitivenessof most is disappointing. The tedious collect-a-thons are alsodeflating to the point where Rex himself utters, ~Yep, another one. What the f---am I doing?~ Unfortunately, scouring the wilderness for TV sets and VHS tapesis a necessary evil if you want to unleash the fury of the amazing end-gameweapons.As you check these tiresome tasks off your list, you getcloser to attaining a few weapons destined for the first-person shooter hall offame. Explosive sniper rifle rounds can take out a jeep and all nearby soldiersin one shot. The quadruple-barrel shotgun makes short work of theextremely dangerous blood dragons. The best weapon of all, however, is theKillstar, a Krull-like glaive thatallows Rex to shoot a devastating laser beam from his hand. As much as I grewbored with freeing nerds from captivity, earning weapons capable ofeviscerating entire legions in a matter of seconds is highly recommended.Likemany of the '80s action flicks it mimics, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon has thepotential to alienate people with its crass sense of humor and repetitiveone-liners. But if you long for an era whensmart-mouthed badasses were more concerned with making things go boom thancatering to your social sensitivities, Rex Power Colt is your man, and Blood Dragonis your game.", "date": "Apr 30, 2013", "grade": "8.5"}
