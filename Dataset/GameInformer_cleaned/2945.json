Seems premature, but welive in an accelerated culture, and video games move fast. Here we are,only four years after the release of Harmonix's original PlayStation 2Guitar Hero title, facing Smash Hits. As the name suggests, it's agreatest hits compilation of tracks from earlier GH titles, nowfeaturing the full band play introduced in World Tour. The title is designed with one thing in mind: creating for revenuefor Activision. This is especially odd in light of the fact that itfeels like something that could be addressed through downloadablecontent, as Harmonix has done so well with Rock Band. While my instinctis to be a curmudgeon, once I dug in, I got caught up again in playingthe songs that taught me what music gaming was all about, like ''KillerQueen'' or ''Bark at the Moon.'' It's especially edifying to find outhow much fun it is to play old favorites like ''Freya'' by The Sword ondrums. In addition, some of the GH I and II songs that were covers arenow straight from the original masters. While some of the note chartshave been altered (and not always for the better), for the most partit's great fun.Smash Hits does absolutely nothing to advance the GH brand in anyway, but if you've long since packed up your PS2 it's a great way toget your hands on some old-school favorites. You're basically paying$1.25 per song, which is lower than DLC pricing. Not a bad deal if youcan handle jamming yet another Guitar Hero box into your racks.", "date": "on Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "8"}
