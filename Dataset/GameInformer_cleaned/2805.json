Justbecause a handheld system is less powerful and features a lessfavorable control scheme than a console doesnt mean that theentertainment it provides should be watered down. If a company tailorsits games for handhelds, there is no reason portable games should feelsecond rate.Which brings us to Elite Squadron. The PSP cantdeliver the same Battlefront experience that you find on PC orconsoles, but LucasArts tries to cram as much of that experience ontothe system anyway. In the process, it sacrifices much of what makes theseries fun.The story in Battlefront has always been a joke.Elite Squadron is no different, except now the punchline is longer.Elite Squadrons more elaborate story has you taking control of X2, aClone Trooper spawned from the DNA of a Jedi Master. Most of the gamefollows his shenanigans as he follows his brothers coattails throughevery major battle in the six Star Wars films.If youre playingthis game by yourself, youre missing the point; Battlefront is meantto be played online. From a technical standpoint, Elite Squadron getsthe job done. Battles feel more expansive this time around because eachlevel now features land and space combat. After ticking off a few fragson the ground, you can hop in an X-wing, fly into space, take down someTIE Fighters, and/or dock with a Star Destroyer and dismantle themothership from the inside.Elite Squadrons big problem is itscontrols. The game has a couple control schemes, but I couldnt findone that didnt feel both clunky and inaccurate. Moving your characterthrough battle is as trouble-free as sending the Millennium Falcon intohyperspace. Even the Jedi hero characters  which should be awesome are frustrating to play with because melee combat is as slow and choppyas Comcasts cable signal. I know Star Wars fans usually eat thesegames up, but maybe its time to rebel against this Empire. We deservebetter than this.", "date": "Nov 03, 2009", "grade": "6.75"}
