For a developer other than Naughty Dog to continue the gamesnarrative seemed silly and unnecessary. Though I was not impressed bydemos of this PSP continuation of the series, developer High ImpactGames has turned my opinion around entirely with the full game. Aswith Jak 2 and 3, The Lost Frontier features a large open world toexplore. Unlike those titles, though, the open part largely takes placein the sky. Early in the game, Jak gains access to a large airship thathe can steer toward five different zones. Once in a zone, he can taketo the sky in a handful of smaller vehicles that allow him to exploreand land on different islands.The air combat portions aresuitable  like Ratchet & Clanks take on battling in space, itsnothing special, but it gets the job done  but fans are probably mostinterested in the ground missions. Though High Impacts level designsarent quite up to Naughty Dogs hyper-polished standards, they emulatethe latters mix of platforming and gun combat extremely well.Jakhas four different guns at his disposal, and he also gains variousmagical Eco abilities throughout the game that can be used both forpuzzle solving and combat. For example, the red Eco ability releases aball of energy that blows up when shot. This explosion can exposehidden pathways or open sealed doors in the environment, or it can beused to deal extra damage to a particularly tough baddie. Its easyenough to breeze through the game just using your guns for combat, butthe abilities provide room for experimenting with more interestingstrategies.The combat would be the highlight of the game if notfor some annoying camera control and aiming problems. Because theshoulder buttons are devoted to spinning the camera, theres no way tolock on to enemies or strafe, so expect to run in circles a lot hopingfor your auto-aim to catch nearby bad guys when you have a chance tostand still and fire. Its also frustratingly difficult to switch Ecoabilities or guns using the d-pad in the midst of an intense battle.Jaksexploration and combat sequences are split up by the occasional Daxterlevel. In the Lost Frontier, these come in the form of Dark Daxterstages, where Jaks cute sidekick transforms into a giant furrymonster. In his new form, Daxter must bash waves of enemies and solveenvironmental puzzles. These portions of the game had the mostpotential to suck, but I was shocked to find myself enjoying them. HighImpact uses these levels just sparingly enough and implements smartenough puzzle designs that theyre more a breath of fresh air than afrustrating annoyance, even if Dark Daxter is a dumb idea.Themost surprising aspect of The Lost Frontier is how much customizationHigh Impact has crammed into the game. You purchase new modificationsand upgrades for your hangar full of ships with scrap metal earnedduring dogfights. You buy new Eco powers from four separate upgradechains. You gain gun mods and better armor through chests scatteredaround the world. Add in tons of sidequests that can be completed orignored at your leisure, and this seven-hour journey has a lot of extradepth.As you might expect from a new developers take on aseries with such history, The Lost Frontier doesnt feel essential. Ifyou miss this game, youre not going to be missing any major plotmovements or character development in the Jak universe (and dont evenget me started on the snoozer of a bad guy). But if youve beenjonesing for the gameplay that made you fall in love with the series inthe first place, The Lost Frontier more or less delivers.", "date": "Nov 05, 2009", "grade": "7.75"}
