Moncage dumps players right into the action with a few quick notes on how to manipulate this multi-faceted object. It tasks you with connecting similar objects found on the boxs different planes by spinning the cube and looking at things from unique perspectives. At first, the challenge seems simple. However, as the game progresses, puzzles grow more sophisticated, and the seemingly unconnected scenes reflected on the cubes sides begin to weave into a narrative. I only wish that narrative had more substance.Each side of Moncages six-sided cube displays a distinct vignette  like a window into various environments. Objects in one scene align with objects from another if the player rotates the cube to the right perspective. My first goal in Moncage is to open a suitcase displayed on one side. Inside is a teddy bear, toy truck, and various childs playthings. The minimalistic aesthetic presents the shape of each object, but not the fine details, which sets a dreamlike tone that compliments the surreal gameplay. The simplistic appearance is also crucial in allowing the optical illusions players need to piece things together andprogress through the experience.With nothing left to do in the first panel, I rotate the box to the left, finding a broken dump truck stalled in front of a factory. Since the trucks in both panels havethe same coloring and lines,I twistthe cube so that the front half of the childs toy in the first scene linesup with the vehicles back half on the other side of the cube. That doesthe trick, and the newly fixed truck movesdown the road.Even though this initial solution isnt difficult, it leavesme feeling accomplished. Moncage replicates this feeling over and over again in new and imaginative ways, making it a really rewarding puzzle game. For instance, in my favorite section, I haveto move from one side of the cube to the next, quickly matching upbits of benches, water containers, tanks, and moreinto a Rube Goldberg machine to allow a tiny object to roll through every vignette without stopping. Stringing this all together and getting the timing correct was gratifying in a vein similar to beating a giant boss from an action game.However, some answers are not apparent. Like many puzzle games, overlooking some small detailoccasionally left me beating my head against the wall. For example, in one level, I could tell a radio antenna fit perfectly with an electrical post, but I didnt realize for some time that I had to light up one scene for the objects to be the same color before they could match up. Thankfully, there's a creative, effective, and robust hintsystem. At any point during the game, you can hit a button to make important objects glow. The guidance is subtle and feels more like a nudge in the right direction than a direct line to the solution. If that isnt enough, the next hints offer written clues, and once you burn through those, the game offers a short video clip showing the puzzles solution. This was very helpful in situations where I had the right idea but wasn't precise enough to register the solution. I find this hintsystem really appealing. It effectively combats the frustrations of typical puzzle games but doesnt make asking for help feel likedefeat.As I make my way through the game, I find that what had, at first, seemed like random, unrelated tableaus, were actually bits and pieces taken from a bigger, overarching story. Typically, this kind of storytelling fascinates me, but Moncages narrative didnt capture my attention. Overall, the story is too nebulous to be impactful. It doesn't helpthat much of the narrative is told through photographs carefully hidden throughout the game, meaningplayers can easily miss significant plot elements. There are undoubtedly evocative moments  several pictures are dedicated to the subjects wartime experiences, both good and bad. One image, for example, capturesa fun outing to the fair seemingly marred by the veterans traumatic reaction to fireworks. There arealso some interesting moments when the pictures allowme to understand something new about a location I visited as part of an earlier puzzle, especially at the end. However, I walked away from the game wishing I knew a little more about the underlining storyand didnt have to piece together the ambiguous events myself.Moncage is an intelligent puzzle game, and its perspective-based riddles stretched my imagination as each scene flowed beautifully into the next. The narrative could have hit harder, and it sometimes felt like I had to align things perfectly for the game to accept the correct answer, but Optillusions title is a challenge worth picking up.", "date": "Nov 15, 2021", "grade": "7.5"}
