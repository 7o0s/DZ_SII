The talentedteam at The Creative Assembly would be wise to heed the words of theirlatest games namesake. Like the European conqueror, The CreativeAssemblys signature blend of turn-based conquest and real-time battleranks among the elite in its field, but as Napoleon: Total Wardemonstrates, persistent legacy issues have started to weaken thegames standing. The centerpiece to the latest chapter in theTotal War series is the Napoleonic campaign, in which you assume therole of the French conqueror as he develops an influence throughtheaters of war in Italy, Africa, and Europe proper. In addition tomanaging armed forces, players must juggle diplomacy, buildingconstruction, trade, and technology research in classic Total Warfashion. Much like the Road to Independence campaign in Empire: TotalWar, each scenario takes place on a smaller tract of land withoutsacrificing the map scale players are used to with the series famedglobal theaters. Concentrating on smaller segments of land is a smartmove, as it allows the developers to deliver much more varied terrainfor battles and stress the importance of maintaining supply lines forfrontline armies. If your platoons stray too far from home or marchthrough uninhabitable land, units wont replenish and attrition willcompromise their effectiveness.The challenge of meeting theobjectives in each campaign is heightened by the strict timeframe inwhich Napoleon must triumph and the variation in tools at his disposal.The African map, for instance, robs you of all diplomacy as an invaderin a foreign land, tasking you to make your way from Cairo up to theheart of the Middle East under the constant barrage of insurgentresistance. These enjoyable twists forced me to leave my comfort zoneand employ new strategies to accomplish the goals laid out before me.Thecampaigns pice de rsistance is the European theater, where everyprominent nation is gunning for your head as you stretch the Frenchinfluence across the continent by adopting protectorate nations,pillaging fallen cities, and threatening those who oppose yourexpansionist goals. Managing a large empire is a delicate proposition,and unfortunately the diplomacy options arent up to the task. As inpast Total War games, negotiations with opposing and allied factionsstill dont offer meaningful feedback, leaving you to guess infrustration as to why your cease-fire agreement or request for militaryaccess is being rejected.The campaign culminates in the nearimpossible finale at Waterloo, which challenges you to succeed whereNapoleon failed in a battle tilted heavily in Britains favor. Its noteasy. After a dozen unsuccessful tries, I sullenly resigned myself toNapoleons fate in the face of the overwhelming odds.Anothergame mode features 10 historical battles that let players relive someof Napoleons biggest triumphs. Players can attempt to matchBonapartes military process by mimicking his tactics, or strive forpersonal glory with more unconventional strategies. These battles weresculpted with real-world tactics, and they feel more rewarding andrealistic than the more spontaneous skirmishes found in the campaignsthat are sometimes plagued by dumbfounding AI. In a couple campaignbattles I watched in disbelief as the opposing general ran for thehills toward my army before the infantry even clashed, makingit extremely easy to cut the head off the opposition and break theirmorale before the cannonballs started flying. None of these flawsreared their head in the historical battles.If the questionableenemy AI drives to you auto-resolve almost every battle like me,Napoleon offers another solution. The new drop-in battles now allow ahuman opponent to take the reins of an opposing army in your campaignprovided the number of troops is relatively even. Players interested inpick-up matches can join the queue through a multiplayer menu, but beforewarned. The matchmaking doesnt convey any information about yourarmys composition or the battle terrain beforehand, so you wont knowwhat youre getting into until you accept the match.Perhaps thebiggest addition to Napoleon: Total War is the multiplayer campaign, aRisk-like mode that pits two players against one another in theEuropean theater, each vying for unquestioned reign over the continent.The mode thankfully includes customizable settings that allow you toturn on or off real-time battles and adjust the difficulty for bothplayers before the match starts, which helps to speed up the turns andeven the playing field, respectively. Since one turn in a game thisdetailed can take a player a considerable amount of time, CreativeAssembly smartly allows the other player to peruse the map, check outbuilding queues, and even schedule more construction while wait theirturn. Our campaign ran relatively lag free, though the game hiccuppedand froze a few times in between player turns.Napoleon: TotalWar may not rewrite history, but its subtle gameplay refinements,tactical variety, and new multiplayer campaign do more than enough tooffset the litany of legacy issues hindering this otherwise impressivestrategy game. If Creative Assembly wants to match the strategic legacyof the famed French general, however, its time to address battle AIand diplomacy feedback before they compromise the franchises integrity.", "date": "Feb 23, 2010", "grade": "8.75"}
