Almost three years after the original release, PS3 owners are gettingan extended cut with better graphics and two additional levels. While theupgraded visuals and extended campaign are certainly appreciated, the sellingpoint remains the same as its Wii counterpart: a fresh take on the light gungenre complemented by hilarious writing and non-stop action make Overkill one ofthe few titles worth owning a PlayStation Move for.Despite having an appreciation for the genre that harkensback to the arcades of yesteryear, recent light gun games haven't had theimpact on me they once did. I enjoy mindlessly shooting a screen full ofzombies or soldiers (or zombie soldiers) as much as the next gamer, butinnovations in on-rails shooters have been few and far between. Overkill'sgrindhouse presentation is exactly the kind of twist the genre needed to pullme back in. From the cheesy new FMV intro to the hilarious narration andobscene one-liners, Overkill is a game that doesn't take itself seriously andis all the better for it.At the heart of Extended Cut's extra content are two newlevels, which take place in a strip club and meat packing plant. These twolevels are spliced into the main campaign, but follow the exploits of the lateJasper Guns' sister Varla, and his stripper girlfriend, Candy Stryper. Some oftheir dialogue is groan-worthy even for Overkill, and the duo doesn't live upto the hostile banter of Isaac Washington and Agent G, but the narration hitsits mark, as do the grotesque boss battles. The levels are equally memorable,and add a little more length to what is still a pretty short game. There arealso some added collectibles and extras, but the experience is largely the same:Shoot zombies with a buddy and laugh at the stupid and outrageous dialogue. I canthink of worse ways to spend a Saturday afternoon.If you played the original Overkill on the Wii, I'm notconvinced the extended cut is worth paying for again, even with its forgiving$40 price tag. Despite being by far the superior version of the game, theupgraded HD visuals don't overcome Overkill's age and wouldn't have beenimpressive back in 2009. The two new chapters are solid additions to the action,but you'll still see pretty much everything Overkill has to offer in anafternoon of gaming. If you didn't play the original, or you just want a reasonto justify last year's Move purchase, Overkill Extended Cut is a greatintroduction to the best light gun game in recent years.", "date": "Oct 25, 2011", "grade": "8"}
