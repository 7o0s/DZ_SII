Longtime Nintendo fans loved the nostalgia value and familiargameplay of the first true 2D entry in the series since 1995s YoshisIsland, and a new generation of gamers discovered why the plumber isthe most iconic character in the industry. With the success of the Wiiand its focus on local multiplayer gameplay, New Super Mario Bros. Wiiis a no-brainer. Take the classic series that gamers young and oldadore, introduce four-player gameplay for the first time, and watch itfly off the shelves.New Super Mario Bros. Wii takes the stellarcore gameplay of the DS version, introduces far more creative andchallenging stages, and includes riotous multiplayer gameplay. Ihesitate to call it co-op gameplay, simply because of the sheer numberof times youll accidentally (or sometimes, intentionally) screw yourfriends over in hilarious fashion. Mario games focus on running andjumping; and coordinating difficult platforming segments with threeother people oftentimes means at least one of them is going to getstomped in mid-air, sending them to their death. Once that unluckyplayer comes back to the action, he or she can easily get revenge bypicking up their killer and throwing him or her directly into a Goomba.Its these chaotic moments that result in punched shoulders or playersgetting banned from future multiplayer sessions.The Wiis latestMario game is far more than just a nostalgia act, as the level ofquality is on par with the best from the NES and SNES days. Some stagesare simple endeavors that give you experience with a new power-up,while others truly test your platforming skill. Later levels fill thescreen with Bullet Bills, cannonballs, angry Crowbers, and parachutingBob-ombs, ensuring that you wont have a moments rest. Even theairships from Super Mario Bros. 3 return, complete with their memorableand ominous background music. Once you reach the end of the game,youll be treated with what might be the best boss fight in any 2DMario title.Playing with a few friends adds a new element to theMario experience, but its not without its frustrations. Accidentallyfalling to your doom is funny when you have a healthy stash of lives,but later stages require precise platforming, and its much harder toperform quick, accurate jumps when there are three others trying to dothe same thing.Some gamers may be concerned about the additionof motion control, but like Super Mario Galaxy the game implements itsparingly and its never too gimmicky. Quick shakes let you pick upitems or spin jump, and tilting the controller manipulates platformsand cannons. My only real complaint with the motion controls is thattheir inclusion means this game cant be played with the ClassicController. Its a shame, as it would have been a perfect fit. Thereare enough buttons on the Classic Controller to handle the gamesvarious actions, and the L and R shoulders could have handled theplatform tilting.It doesnt matter if your first gaming systemwas the NES or DS; New Super Mario Bros. Wii proves that 2D platformersare still a blast. Longtime gamers will love the countless throwbacksto previous titles, and the multiplayer gameplay is fantastic (albeithectic) fun for everyone.", "date": "Nov 13, 2009", "grade": "9.25"}
