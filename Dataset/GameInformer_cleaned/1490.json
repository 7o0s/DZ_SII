{"name": "Lego The Lord of the Rings", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/lego_lord_of_the_rings/b/xbox360/archive/2012/11/20/walking-into-mordor-with-a-smile.aspx", "text": "If youve played one Lego game, you havent played them all. That may seem obvious, but Ive encountered too many people who dismiss new Lego titles based on the faulty assumption that they are all the same. Lego Lord of the Rings is the perfect opportunity to see how far this series has come since its inception; Travellers Tales has crafted a wonderful platformer that stands on its own  though the Lego charm and a great license make it even better. Lego Lord of the Rings is a broad fusion of many elements  exploration, collection, combat, puzzle-solving  and Middle-earth is the ideal environment for these things to come together. Despite the kid-friendly exterior, the important events from the story have not been substantially changed or watered down. Epic moments like the swarming mass of orcs at Helms Deep, the fall of the Witch King at Pelennor Fields, and Gandalfs battle with the Balrog are all wonderfully executed and fun to play. The mix of faithfulness and playfulness with the source material makes Lego Lord of the Rings the best video game adaptation of Tolkiens universe, hands-down.You dont need to be a diehard fan to have a good time here. The gameplay supporting the story (which follows the three movies) is fun regardless of your level of Middle-earth expertise. Whether youre playing in single-player or with a local co-op buddy, the variety is astounding. You still beat up bad guys and collect studs, but that kind of activity occupies a much smaller percentage of the experience. Most of your time is spent exploring the iconic environments, hunting down collectibles, and searching for solutions to puzzles. Combat is still important, but it tends to happen in more impressive ways than enemies mindlessly pouring out of doors. Stomping around as Treebeard, riding into battle as King Thoden, and taking down Oliphaunts are just a few examples of how Travellers Tales keeps the action fresh.Once the War of the Ring is won, your time with Lego Lord of the Rings is just beginning. The (fairly linear) core campaign is an easily digestible eight hours, but the wealth of open-world, post-game content is staggering. With all of Middle-earth available to explore, the most powerful items, best puzzles, and coolest characters are yours to find  including a bonus level where you control two powerful villains. Obsessive players can expect to spend 30 hours or more to hit 100 percent.As fun as this game can be, some technical issues get in the way. Character selection bugs, chugging framerates, and screen tearing provide occasional annoyances. The irregular audio quality (the voices are all sampled directly from the films) sometimes makes it seem like the main characters dialogue is provided by an Internet soundboard, which deflates some otherwise cool moments.A handful of technical stumbles cant keep Lego Lord of the Rings from being the best Lego game so far. Finding a great compromise between the linear installments and the sprawling open world of Lego Batman 2, Travellers tales hits sweet spots in the structure and gameplay, constantly giving players new goals and new places to explore. The steady stream of goofball humor keeps the mood light, but almost every part of the game is entertaining in its own way.An Unlikely AllyHe may seem like a generic orc, but you want to buy the character called Berserker as soon as he is available. Available to use only in Free Play, Berserker is able to pull orange handles and throw bombs that destroy Mithril blockades. These are two obstacles that the characters in standard play cant overcome, so Berserker will be an early MVP for players who want to hunt down all of the hidden items.", "date": "Nov 20, 2012", "grade": "8.5"}
