Its obviously more of the same,being an expansion and all, but its the kind of add-on that fans ofany title hope for.Chaos Risings lengthy co-op enabled campaignfeatures similarly stupid boss battles to the original, but the muchgreater variety of maps and mission objectives is a major improvement.Exploring the decrepit space hulks of the Judgment of Carrion ghostfleet and battling through the Warp-corrupted ice fields of the lostplanet Aurelia are pleasantly novel compared to the endless slogsthrough the same handful of maps that Dawn of War IIs campaign oftendevolved into. The new character, a psyker Librarian, allows forinteresting new strategies with his diverse array of quasi-magicalabilities.Also new to the Chaos Rising campaign is theCorruption mechanic, where failing secondary objectives or usingChaos-tainted equipment corrupts the souls of your Blood Ravens.Penance in the form of accessories that penalize your abilities orcompleting side-missions can bring them back to the path ofrighteousness. The trick is, Chaos grants nifty powers to its disciples for instance, the moderate-cooldown, unlimited-use full force revivalis unbalanced as hell. This is far from a Mass Effect-style moralityplay, but it does add replay value as welcoming or avoiding corruptionnoticeably changes your playstyle during the campaign.New mapsand champions refresh the multiplayer scene. The Chaos Marines are anice addition to the roster, with their daemon-summoning rites andstrong, multi-purpose infantry. I salute Relics decision to give awaythe new maps to all Dawn of War II players in a patch, and for allowingoriginal and expansion players to play together (though Chaos Marinesare only available to expansion owners). Chaos Rising is good news forDoW II multi fans.The fundamental experience isnt noticeablydifferent, but the breadth and variety that Chaos Rising adds are solidimprovements to an already good game.", "date": "Mar 11, 2010", "grade": "8.5"}
