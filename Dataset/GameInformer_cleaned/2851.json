The reimagining of the 1989 NES title had throngs of gamersaflutter upon announcement, conjuring memories of a game shrouded bytime and the mask of childhood. Having finished the hefty remake, I cansafely say that fans and newcomers alike will be impressed. But likeits predecessor, A Boy and His Blob isnt without its frustrations. Thekey elements of the classic version have been left untouched; the newiteration is primarily an avenue for higher production values. Twentyyears later the boy and his newfound friend are still working their wayacross the universe to save blob-kind. No other story elements or plotpoints are needed; after the pairs initial encounter, the ingeniousgameplay takes center stage. Blob can change into 15 unique objects byeating aptly named jelly beans. Some of them become mainstays, such asthe Licorice Ladder or the Tangerine Trampoline. Others offer a breathof fresh air, completely changing the way you approach platforming.WayForwarddid a fantastic job easing players into the ever-evolving skill set,using signs and simple introductory scenarios to challenge the playerand force them to shake up their problem-solving arsenal. In earlierlevels, water is a deadly obstacle for the boy. After obtaining theBubble Gum Bouncer, water no longer poses a threat and new doors opento you. Still, levels are designed to continually challenge; once wateris no longer a problem, new obstacles await. Blob has more,increasingly interesting forms that I wont spoil for you, and eachfeels more of a treat than the last. Nothing stays simple for too long.Youllhave plenty of time to master these new skills (or die trying) becausethe game offers a massive amount of content, spanning 40 levels. To topthings off, each level also harbors three treasure chests, and nabbingthem all will net you access to a challenge level. Find all the hiddenchests in the game and you effectively double your playtime. Thats alot of bang for your buck.Sadly, the stunning graphics, charmingmusic, and endearing characters dont mask the games faults. While thepuzzles are nothing short of ingenious, you are always one treacherousstep away from infuriation. I have no qualms about being stumped fromtime to time. The issue is when that eureka moment finally comes,progression can be halted by a series of obstacles that requireperfectly timed jumps with even more exact trajectories. At times ittakes dozens of attempts to string together a combo of moves to make itacross an extremely short expanse. With a very forgiving save system,this doesnt often become an issue, but in several particularlychallenging areas with falling platforms and walls lined with floatingmines, the frustration was nearly game-ending. The twitchy controls,particularly when flying, compound the problem. After 15 or 20 minutesof repeating a 10-second string of actions, all I could do was stepaway and put the game down for another time and disposition. A clearmind and calm hand is needed at all times.Despite theseproblems, there is something undeniably magnetic about the game. Thelush environments, charming characters, and the infinite power of thehug button make it impossible to stay upset for too long. Like itsnamesake predecessor, a couple of days after setting the controllerdown, its hard not to look back on A Boy and His Blob and smile.", "date": "Oct 13, 2009", "grade": "8"}
