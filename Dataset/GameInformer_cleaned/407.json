Zestiria has flickers ofgreatness, such as a cool battle system and a more mature story, but they'rewasted on frustrating, inexcusable gameplay mechanics. To put it bluntly, thisentry feels dated. It makes you suffer through backtracking, longwindedbattles, and boring dialogue. Editor's Note: This review was originally posted on October 16 at 11:01 AM.Zestiria is supposed to be a return to form,finally taking the series back to a medieval setting. The change makes it feeldifferent than Xillia's futuristic focus, having references to the King Arthurlegend and battles with monsters right out of Greek mythology. I liked thisshift, as it made me look forward to who or what would show up next in thestory.The overall plot has some interesting twists,but ultimately comes off more predictable and hackneyed than exciting. You playas Sorey, a human raised by seraphim, who must unite the human and spirit worldsto prevent catastrophe. Aside from assassin Rose and outlaw Dezel's intriguingpartnership, the characters are vanilla, rarely saying anything compelling. At leastthey aren't as annoying as previous exuberant casts; the clichd writing, whichthe series has struggled with, is also toned down.Zestiria takes the fun action-battle system innew directions thanks to a focus on elemental attacks. As in past entries, fourcharacters can take the battlefield at once, but since Sorey has formed pactswith four different seraphim tied to the basic elements (fire, water, earth,wind), they can help in battle in interesting ways. Seraphim can either fight asregular party members using their elemental magic or merge with humancharacters to combine HP and unleash powerful combos. This adds variety tobattle, giving you more options for your strategy. On one hand, maximizing yourcombos are key to increasing your damage. On the other hand, if Sorey ever getsclose to death, you can transform with a seraph and get a nice HP boost andrestore health. Battles are about using the two different forms intelligentlyand ensuring you take advantage of elemental weaknesses. Even in Sorey's humanform, his different arte types can cancel out an enemy's attack, forcing you toconstantly pay attention on the battlefield.I loved this new wrinkle to the battle system,but it has drawbacks. Movement feels restricted, and regular battles aren't fast-paced.Bosses often have huge health bars and the encounters feel more like you'rejust chipping away at them rather than having an exciting conflict. Fights areespecially long if you can't maintain a rhythm for combos with your partymembers. Your A.I. cohorts aren't awful, but you can't strategize with them exceptfor a few simple commands. I recommend setting strategies for each character assoon as possible. Although, being in the same room with someone makes synchingyour attacks up much easier, so co-op is an even better choice.The longer encounters take a greater toll due tothe terrible dungeons full of annoying busywork. In these uncreative backdrops,you backtrack often and some have ridiculous demands. One dungeon had hiddeneyes in the walls, and if you didn't use a protective bubble at the right time,you're transported back to the beginning. How's that for an obnoxious timesink? Some dungeons offer little direction, forcing you to pick up on crypticclues, like hidden markings. Also, be prepared for plenty of tedious switchpuzzles.To add insult to injury, at times Zestirialeaves you aimless for your next objective. Zestiria (like Xillia) puts a staron the map guiding you to your next location, but not for everything. Sometimesyou're merely given vague clues on how to move forward. This doesn't evenfactor in the frustration that you must pay using the in-game currency to fasttravel and that you can't save everywhere.Tales of Zestiria feelslike a game from another time in many ways, and not in the charming type ofway. It forces you through some the most boring and outdated elements from RPGsof yesteryear. If the series wants to stay relevant it needs to put forth abetter effort than Zestiria.", "date": "Oct 20, 2015", "grade": "6.5"}
