As the Spanish-tinged, classicalguitar intro of ''Battery'' gave way to the pummeling main riff, mylittle mind was blown. With all due respect to the Beatles, thebaroque, epic thrash of classic period Metallica is the stuff for whichthis game was made. Tearing through ''Orion'' on expert bass mode is a dream come true.From ''The Shortest Straw'' to ''Seek & Destroy,'' there is atreasure trove of fan favorites for old-school Metallica fans. Not onlyare they great songs, they represent a tremendous challenge forseasoned players. I expect many veteran Guitar Hero gamers will have todelve into the medium difficulty for the first time in ages. That's noteven counting the insane Expert+ difficulty, which lets you recreateLars Ulrich's machine gun blast beats with a splitter and two pedals.While I knew I'd love playing the songs off the first four albums,the rest of the soundtrack definitely matches the intensity of thevintage stuff. It's clearly been selected by the band, and packed withquirky and fresh choices of tunes. Instead of a Queens of the Stone Agetrack, we get ''Demon Cleaner'' by Josh Homme's first band, Kyuss.Rather than a Danzig or Misfits hit, we get the menacing ''Mother ofMercy'' by Samhain. Black metal pioneer King Diamond shows up as aplayable character and in the track ''Evil'' by his band Mercyful Fate.All in all, it's got perhaps the best hit to miss ratio of any musicgame to date -- although it's not aimed at the casual party crowd.Perhaps inspired by the band they so love, Neversoft hasdramatically improved the visual presentation. Extensive motion capturesessions with the band have yielded a host of realistic animations anddramatic, 360-degree camera work. Stage sets based on the band'sreal-life tours and extensive pyrotechnics displays also help deliver abetter sense of authenticity than Guitar Hero: Aerosmith. Also, theimproved character models are leagues better than any in the series'history. The only misstep is the cheesy cartoon storyline, done in thestyle of the last few games. It seems out of character with Metallica'simage, and I would have preferred more documentary-style footage (I didappreciate the fan-shot videos and visual archive in the extras menu).Still, it's a small quibble with a game that provides a whole lottametal for your $60.", "date": "on Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "8.75"}
