They livedlavish lives of luxury, and their daily whims could reshape nations. Like itspredecessor, Reigns: Her Majesty examines the lives of medieval rulers, and exploreshow their impulses allow nations to flourish or bring them to their knees. However,navigating the chaotic social structure of a medieval kingdom is no easy task, andthe day-to-day life of a queen is not as glorious as it first appears. Her Majesty was built with a mobile interface in mind.Players are presented with a series of decisions, such as sending huntsmen onquests to find exotic animal pelts, bailing local dignitaries out of financialjams, and make the final ruling on legal matters. All of your advisors arepresented as playing cards that pose simple ~yes~ or ~no~ type questions, and youmake your decisions by flipping those cards left or right. This simpleinterface and bite-sized narrative sequences offer a relaxed experience, butthe longer I played, the shallower it felt. Each decision has different effects on your standing in oneof four categories: church, populous, military, and finance. If you make adecision that benefits your army, for example, you might end up emptying thecoffers or losing face among your loyal followers. You don't want any of thesecategories to rise too high or low; a strong army can initiate a revolution, anda neglected church can burn you at the stake. When one queen's reign ends, youjump into the role of her successor with no penalty. All of your influencemeters are reset, but the decisions of previous queen carry forward. In principle, this push-and-pull dynamic is ripe for thoughtfulstrategy. In practice, predicting how your decisions actually impact thekingdom is almost impossible. Why did painting the courtroom with bright colorsnegatively affect my standing with the church? How did hosting a birthday partybenefit my army? Why did encouraging trade negatively affect my economy? I constantlystruggled to guess the consequences of my choices. I seemed to rule just aswell when I based all of my decision on the flip of a coin, which made me feellike my decisions didn't really matter. Over the course of your many lives, while trying to maintainbalance in your kingdom, you are tasked with completing a series of royal deeds.These achievement-like tasks are often vague, asking you to ~host a neighboringkingdom,~ or ~unmask a traitor.~ Unfortunately, you can't proactively hunt downthese quests. Since the entire game is about answering a series of questions,you have to wait until you are presented with most of these opportunities. Forexample, I couldn't ~find a new world~ until an explorer came to me and askedif I'd fund his expedition. This passive approach to storytelling often left mefeeling helpless as I hurriedly flipped through repeating scenarios until thegame finally decided to give me something new. Her Majesty has a couple of interesting moments but largelyfollows the formula of the first game and fails to evolve into somethingspecial. I applaud developer Nerial's drive to innovate with this simplified strategyadventure, but this collection of mildly interesting moments fails to remaincompelling over the long haul. Maybe the life of a queen isn't as exciting aswe think.", "date": "Dec 07, 2017", "grade": "6"}
