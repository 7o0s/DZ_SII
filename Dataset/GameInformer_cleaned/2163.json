However, only two kinds of people are likely attracted to this formula  those who have never played a party fighter, and fans so entrenched in the Cartoon Network that their brains break thinking about Dexter vs. Samurai Jack. Everyone else will likely tune out before you can say, Dont touch that dial.Every non-Adult Swim Cartoon Network star youd expect is here, from Dexter to Ben Tennyson. Instances like the gluttonous Chowder mistaking a Powerpuff Girl for something delicious-sounding are entertaining, but even fans of the animated shows may find the dry story lacking. If youre playing a fighting game for the story, however, youre doing it wrong.Anyone who has played a hectic brawler will likely be disappointed the moment they throw their first punch. Movement is slow and unresponsive, resulting in sloppy brawls with players accidentally rolling off cliffs and facing the wrong direction. As in Smash Bros., players have a percentage that builds as they take damage, increasing the odds of getting knocked off screen. Sometimes I was sent careening off the stage despite my low percentage, leading to repeated frustration. Even worse, when playing multiplayer you can only view the damage of the enemy youre presently fighting, and in single-player you can only see your damage percentage.The single-player campaign spans across every iconic world and incorporates each character. Traditional bouts are mixed in with platforming sections that stretch the games imprecise physics to their limits. I faced off against tired clichs such as rolling barrels, crumbling bridges, and flaming boulders that materialized out of thin air (an annoying bug). You must complete this mode to unlock the games best characters  such as Captain Planet and Dexters dad  for use in the barebones multiplayer, but thats hardly worth the trouble.Punch Time Explosion had a good opportunity to impress 3DS owners hungering for a worthwhile experience following the handhelds weak launch lineup, but it simply falls in line with the other disappointments. Cartoon junkies may love seeing their heroes in action, but those used to Smash Bros. polish will want to pass on this one.", "date": "Jun 07, 2011", "grade": "4.75"}
