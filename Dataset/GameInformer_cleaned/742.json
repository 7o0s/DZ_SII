This included an expansive, visual novel-inspiredstory mode that fleshed out some of the characters and added new mysteries forthe Persona gang to solve. Persona 4 Arena Ultimax stays true to thistradition, adding new character backstories for Persona initiates and morecomplex fighters for hardcore fighters. Atlus and Arc System Works both do whatthey do best and once again the result is a solid fighter that appeals to avariety of skill levels. Even more impressive is that the two have crafted anoutstanding sequel to Persona 4 Arena and not merely an expansion. Story mode has the most new content. It picks up right wherePersona 4 Arena ended, featuring a new adversary along with some fresh faces. Themode isn't a one-time affair, either. You can play through it from theperspective of the Persona 3 or Persona 4 casts, and after that you can do moreto unlock a true ending. This mode is a fan's delight as it showcases howcharacters have grown, what they've been up to, and what problems they're stillfacing. The Persona 4 arc falls a little flat (after all, we just spent thepast game with them), but the Persona 3 branch is way more exciting as it takesthe characters in interesting directions. Who would have thought Yukari wouldbe donning pink attire to star in a show similar to the Power Rangers, or that Ken would actually turn out to be a soccerstud? That being said, those who have little interest in these intricatedetails should avoid this mode. Some chapters are all text, without any fightingat all.Arcade mode lets you get in the ring faster, presenting allthe information without all the longwinded character moments. Golden Arena,another mode, plays off the franchise's RPG roots. Here, you select a partnerand improve your social link with them as you take on a battle during eachfloor of a dungeon. During your trek, you level up, unlock skill points toimprove attributes, and gain new skills - like the ability to heal or unleash astatus effect. This mode is more fun than I expected; the dungeons have atleast 50 battles, and the challenge and character-building kept me hooked. Ofcourse, most people will find longevity in the game by going online for somehuman competition, continually striving to improve their record. With combo-heavy encounters that borrow from the Personaseries' focus on exploiting weaknesses, combat is well-balanced. Weak attacksare fast, but don't pack a punch. Strong attacks are powerful, but leave youvulnerable to counterattacks. Every type of block you can do also has onesetback. For instance, a crouching block can't defend against jumping attacks, andnothing can defend against the powerful ~all-out attack.~ Skills, like adding alightning attack, also up the ante; however, you must pick the most opportunetime to tap into their power.Mastering the more advanced mechanics takes practice, butthose who only want to learn the basics can still have success. Arc SystemWorks crafted a system that is both simple and complex. Advanced players willwant to master detailed combos that require more memorization and buttonpresses. These demand mixing up the weak and strong attacks that combo into a skill.Casual players shouldn't feel left in the dust, though. Ultimax provides theability to form simple auto-combos by pressing a single button repeatedly. The game lets you decide how much you want to invest in it anddoesn't punish those who don't want to get into the nitty gritty. When I firststarted, I wanted to hop right into battle and beat story mode. After, I pickedthree different characters to master and progressively grasped more advancedcombos and movesets. Everything became more natural and second-nature the moreI played, and thanks to the tutorial mode (accessible at any time), progressingat your own pace is easy.Ultimax also delivers with new fighters that have somecreative and fun skills. Junpei (now a little league coach) uses a bat, andevery time he takes a swing that connects with his enemy, he gets a runner onbase. As he scores runs, he gets more powerful. Rise's skills are just asfitting; the pop idol uses a microphone and musical notes to damage enemies,and her super move mimics the Dance Dance Revolution games. I appreciate thesequirks, since they make the characters feel unique - and not like were justshoehorned in to increase the roster size.Atlus and Arc System Works have succeeded in creatinganother solid fighting game. Ultimax makes small tweaks to the fighting system,but it also keeps things fresh with new characters, an intriguing story modethat Persona fans will adore, and plenty of modes to keep you busy. None ofPersona's essence is sacrificed to make a fighting game. It still has a deepermessage, if you're ready to read through it all. If not, you have fun gameplayto master, which is more than enough reason to step back into the ring. Where Should Newcomers Begin?Persona fans who have never touched a fighting game can still join in the melee. The easy story mode accommodates these players best, and also has lengthy character diatribes. The narrative picks up right where the last game left off, throwing the characters in a new fighting tournament. Prior events are re-hashed, so you wont be lost if you didnt play the original.", "date": "Sep 30, 2014", "grade": "8.5"}
