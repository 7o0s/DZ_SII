Having Sephiroth, Kefka, and Golbez take onCloud, Terra, and Cecil in an arena soiree is the stuff fans dream of. However, a dramatic dissonance forms betweenthese neat offerings and the core experience. Dissidia Final Fantasy NT is adisjointed mess of multiplayer meanderings, threadbare single-player options,and puzzling story content that demands you spend time doing non-story activitiesto progress.The cast is divided into broad buckets that give players anidea of their playstyle, though every character has their own feel. Dish outfast and furious attacks with high-damaging assassins like FF XVs Noctis, orassault your enemies from afar with a marksman like FF IVs Golbez. Vanguardslike Sephiroth excel at staying at the forefront of the action in the middle ofbattle, and specialists like Exdeath defy traditional class distinction.Dissidia presents an interesting mix of character roles and a ton of favoritesfrom games old and new (even Final Fantasy Tactics brings Ramza into thefray!). Unfortunately, these awesome characters are thrust into a conflict thatdoesnt give them the opportunity to shine.The main mode of Dissidia (and the one you spend the vastmajority of your time on) is 3v3 battles. These team-oriented battles typicallytake several minutes, with players frantically slinging skills and spells ateach other. To incentivize action and keep players from running around thespacious arenas in circles waiting for a perfect time to strike, summoningstones create critical zones to battle over. If your team successfully summons aniconic Final Fantasy creature into the arena, like a fire-breathing Bahamut ora field-drenching Leviathan, you gain a powerful advantage. These summons oftenare loaded with incredibly powerful skills that topple your opponents outrightor create space for you to bring them down yourself. On paper, this sounds like a freaking blast. In practice,combat is difficult to control and parse, with many characters firing thingsoff at once. Despite a solid tutorial that lays everything out in an easy-to-digestformat, everything goes to hell when several players start ganging up on one,or when you lose sight of your allies. This happens a lot; the camera isawkward at best and devastating at worst, and getting lost in the chaos is tooeasy. Simply put, the 3v3 format is sensory overload. Too much happens at oncein all directions, and its difficult to get actionable information at anygiven moment. The combination of elements from multiple genres like fighters,brawlers, and MOBAs just doesnt work here. Its not fun.The lackluster multiplayer takes the center stage, with meagersingle-player offerings attempting to buoy the ship. The story and associatedcutscenes are fun, but to unlock them, you must dive into multiplayer or grindagainst A.I. controlled teams  and neither are enjoyable.On the plus side, plenty of Final Fantasy loot is waiting tobe acquired and admired. Youre always earning gil even if youre beingdemolished in the arena, and you can spend your hard-earned coins on awesomenew weapon visuals, skins, portrait icons, and classic Final Fantasy musictracks. That these cool Final Fantasy tributes are attached to this particular gameis tragic; it is a great celebration of the series anchored to something no oneshould play.Undeniable Final Fantasy charm flows through Dissidia FinalFantasy NT, and it pains me that the gameplay doesnt justify a delving intoit. The roster from across the series puts on a great show and is fun tocustomize and engage with, but the crux of the experience is the multiplayer,which doesnt hit home. Unless youre a hardcore Final Fantasy fan that reallywants to get Golbez a new outfit, its not worth suffering through the arenafor the perks.", "date": "Feb 08, 2018", "grade": "6"}
