While we wait for the first full-fledged RPG to hit Switch, Pokmon: Lets Go Pikachu and Lets Go Eevee are remakes of the first generation of the series with modern graphics and updated gameplay. Exploring Kanto, building your team, fighting Team Rocket, and challenging gym leaders remains as thrilling as it was 20 years ago, but inconsistent motion controls ensure the transition to Switch isnt seamless.Lets Go pulls you in with the same hooks as every other Pokmon game: You travel the region, collecting Pokmon, battling trainers in fun, turn-based combat, and earning your place in the Pokmon League in a lighthearted adventure. The series mantra of Gotta Catch Em All holds true to this day, as finding a ton of unique monsters remains rewarding as you fill in your Pokdex and build your dream party.Lets Go remains faithful to the first-gen Pokmon games (specifically Yellow). I knew exactly where to go to complete optional quests, and still remembered the solutions to most puzzles. Despite being remakes, the Lets Go games effectively move the Pokmon franchise forward with crisp visuals that recreate the familiar creatures and cities of the Kanto region. Seeing the battles play out how I originally pictured them in my head is a thrill. In addition to upgrading the visuals and sound, Lets Go streamlines many of the more tedious elements of the original games.Despite tasking you with exploring a faithfully recreated version of Kanto, a few surprises and tweaks keep the experience fresh. From riding Pokmon for faster travel to swapping your party on the fly without having to visit a Pokmon Center, myriad modern conveniences make these remakes feel right at home in 2018. Lets Go isnt challenging, but if you need an extra hand, a second player can shake a second Joy-Con to drop in and out of local cooperative multiplayer. This updated approach is further demonstrated in Lets Gos modern evolution of one of Pokmons oldest conventions: wild Pokmon encounters.Not only are random encounters gone (now you see wild Pokmon roaming in the map), but you no longer must battle wild Pokmon to weaken them prior to catching (with a few exceptions). Instead, you simply flick your Joy-Con in their direction to land as accurate of a throw as possible  no battling necessary. Some players may miss having to weaken wild Pokmon you intend to catch, but after the initial shock of the simplification, I appreciated how it kept the pace of the game up. Not only does this separation make wild encounters feel distinct from trainer battles, but it makes the few wild Pokmon you do need to battle first feel special.However, the motion controls for catching Pokmon, whether youre using a Joy-Con or the Pok Ball Plus peripheral, are unreliable. On multiple occasions, I flicked my controller directly at the screen, only to have the ball sail in the wrong direction. Playing in handheld mode tones down the motion controls; you just aim with the gyroscope, then press a button to throw a ball. This makes handheld mode the best way to play Lets Go, effectively deflating the excitement of the series being on consoles for the first time.While you can find rare Pokmon in places you couldnt before, other avenues of collecting uncommon species have been removed. You can now use lures to draw out rare Pokmon, but Im disappointed the Game Corner no longer lets you play for items and Pokmon. My personal favorite, Safari Zone, has been replaced by Go Park, which lets you connect your Lets Go save file with your Pokmon Go account.Using Go Park, you can transfer previously captured Gen 1 creatures from Pokmon Go into Lets Go. I love being able to move Pokmon from the mobile title into the Switch game, allowing me to further fill in my collection. After that, you enter Go Park and encounter these Pokmon as you would normally a wild Pokmon  you still need to toss a few balls at them to add them to your team in Lets Go. While I enjoy this integration, I still miss the surprising nature of Safari Zone encounters, and Im disappointed you cant transfer Pokmon back to Pokmon Go once youre finished. I hated losing my shiny Charizard in Pokmon Go so I could have him in Lets Go. Also, if youre hoping to start your playthrough with a full team of awesome monsters from Pokmon Go, you may be disappointed as you cant use this functionality until youre in Fuchsia City in the latter portion of the story.Even if youre not interested in the Pokmon Go integration, Lets Go adds multiple reasons to keep playing after you finish the story. Throughout the adventure, you encounter coach trainers that put up a stiff challenge and reward you with move-teaching technical machines and stat-boosting items. Once you defeat the Elite Four at the end of the game, master trainers appear to put a specific Pokmon to the test. If you think your Charizard, for example, is better than the master trainers Charizard, they serve as an awesome challenge. While these special types of trainers are among the most difficult in the game and sometimes give you good rewards for beating them, the most meaningful reason to keep playing is to continue filling in the holes of your collection, with Mewtwo serving as the ultimate post-game addition to your collection.Pokmon: Lets Go, Pikachu & Eevee are strong remakes of the original games. The feeling of amassing a giant collection of monsters and customizing your team never gets old, and the timeless turn-based combat is still fun to this day. Shoddy motion controls aside, Let's Go is a great time whether youre a die-hard fan or a newcomer to the series.", "date": "Nov 14, 2018", "grade": "8.5"}
