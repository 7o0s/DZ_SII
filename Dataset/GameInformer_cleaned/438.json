{"name": "Undertale", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/undertale/b/pc/archive/2015/10/01/an-enchanting-exhilarating-journey.aspx", "text": "At first glance, Undertale is a retro RPG that feels similar to the seminal classic Earthbound  but its so much more than that. It is the culmination of many meticulously crafted moving parts that come together to create something magical. The music, dialogue, characters, and combat system make every encounter unique; after finishing the game, I wished I could experience it again for the first time.Undertales retro look doesnt do it any favors in terms of eye candy, but the strong characters and interesting mechanics bring the action to life. The less you know about the specifics, the better. Just be aware that the opening hours are the driest and most traditional, setting up what appears to be a classic journey-to-home RPG story. You dont need to be a RPG connoisseur to enjoy Undertale, but a love of classic SNES-era JRPGs may enhance your time with the title.The combat is incredibly nuanced. Manipulating a hearts movement in the little bullet-hell box to dodge incoming attacks appears rudimentary, but its the crux of Undertales unending wonder. By constantly breaking the rules of the box in every encounter, every fight has its own special signature  whether youre struggling to climb a spiderweb or dodging and blocking spears. Boss battles are the centerpieces of this approach, with varied attacks and rule-breaking happening at every turn. A fight could alter your combat command functionality, expand the minigame box across multiple screens, transform into a platforming challenge, create color-based rules, or take things outside the box completely. I was frequently staring in awe during some of the shifting encounters, saying thats so cool to myself. Undertale isnt afraid to break the fourth wall, and while other games may do this in a humorous fashion, its directly tied to gameplay elements here, and astonishing when it does so. This doesnt have an airy, pretentious vibe. Its clever in a way that matches up perfectly with each adversary. Don't get spoiled  Dont search online for any battle info or secrets. Dont look up any guides. Dont hang out on forums. After youve gone through Undertale once, its okay to do this to find out what youve missed, but your first playthrough is best experienced spoiler-free.  You dont have to battle everything you encounter, but youre always interacting with the 2D shooter minigame. Undertale gives the player the choice of how to deal with each fight. You can use an array of weapons and armor to battle directly as you would in a standard RPG, or you can dive into probing the monsters likes and dislikes to find a solution. You can even devise your own ways to break the rules entirely. Every fight has a non-violent solution, and following this path means you never improve your base stats  but you make more friends. You see echoes of each of these choices hours later, culminating in a variety of endings and special areas that can only be accessed by making specific choices (including the most difficult, exciting bullet-hell encounter in the game).Undertale took me about six hours to complete my first playthrough, but every one of those hours is special, and I immediately dove back in to explore some of the additional content. Undertale may not be the prettiest game at the ball, but it is a fantastic, unique take on a classic genre that defies all expectations.", "date": "Oct 01, 2015", "grade": "9.5"}
