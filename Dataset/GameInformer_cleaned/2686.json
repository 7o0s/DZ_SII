Chat roomparticipants mysteriously get sucked into the ~Mnemonic Abyss,~ acluster of locations where the deceased walk among the living. You'llplay as different characters through multiple episodes to uncover aplot as poorly executed as most straight-to-DVD horror releases. Asthe title implies, Calling involves use of cell phones to communicatewith the dead and travel between three desolate locations within theabyss: an old house, school, and hospital. You'll receive calls fromthe departed where less-than-stellar voice actors deliver eeriemessages through the Wii remote's tinny speaker. Dialing phone numbersyou receive on your journey will transport you to other areas in theabyss.Most of your time is spent navigating dark, repetitivehallways in search of key items. Microscopic items littered acrosslevels are easy to overlook, as they blend into the background's statictextures. A faint glimmer would have been helpful, especially whenroaming without a light source. Once all proper items are collected,events occur that typically involve shaking off a ghost with the Wiiremote, a sequence usually preceded by a load screen that interruptsgameplay flow and eradicates any feeling of suspense. Warding offghosts unsurprisingly requires a few quick shakes of the remote.ExploringCalling's generic locales to interact with countless objects and engagein uneventful set pieces is hardly enjoyable. The game suffers fromslow pacing throughout the eight-plus hour experience, which fittinglyends with an anticlimactic scene.
