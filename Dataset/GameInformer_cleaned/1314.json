Not only does Revelations fill in a gap between those titles, its gameplay more closely resembles them compared to the polarizing Resident Evil 6. This new, graphically enhanced console version allows players to move while shooting without a clunky 3DS peripheral. It also implements a rearranged, tougher campaign mode for fans seeking a stiff challenge.Moving the game over to consoles comes with a suite of graphical improvements. Monsters have a disgusting sheen over their fleshy bodies and characters like Jill and Chris have greater detail. The enhanced lighting makes the infected cruise ships corridors even moodier. Some rough environmental textures remind players this used to be a portable game, like two-dimensional fish littered across a dirty beach.We got our first taste of moving and shooting in Resident Evil with the 3DS Circle Pad Pro attachment, but standard console controllers feel even better. Similar to Resident Evil 4, gunplay has a certain weight to it, requiring players to line up deliberate shots instead of relying on twitch reflexes. Weapons can be upgraded with useful parts that can be swapped between firearms. Revelations weapon customization is the most satisfying the series has seen since Resident Evil 4.Revelations also comes with a punishing new Infernal difficulty mode that tosses obscene numbers of enemies at you and rearranges item locations. Beating the game in normal mode allows you to transfer your upgraded guns over to Infernal mode. Testing your hard-earned arsenal against throngs of enemies is a satisfying challenge. Speaking of enemies, a new foe occasionally pops up in all modes of the game. Dont get too excited, though, because the wallblister is essentially an inconsequential bullet sponge.This former 3DS game doesnt stand toe-to-toe with the best console shooters, but its a faithful port. Revelations has a lot to offer fans of the series and players looking for a more evenly paced, thoughtful shooter. The new content, including an entertaining challenge-based two-player co-op mode, along with dual-analog stick control make this the definitive version of Resident Evil: Revelations.The EdgeThe Wii U version cleans up the HUD by putting menu and map information on the GamePads screen. I like having constant access to a map without shuffling through menus. Revelations also facilitates off-screen play, freeing up your TV for other stuff. Unfortunately, the actual gameplay doesnt feel as natural on the GamePad as it does the PS3 and 360.", "date": "May 19, 2013", "grade": "8.75"}
