{"name": "Wet", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/wet/b/xbox360/archive/2009/09/28/review.aspx", "text": "Wet wears its inspirations on its sleeve. Quentin Tarantinos B-movie tributes Kill Bill and Grindhouse both figure heavily into Wets visual aesthetic  right down to the scratchy film filter that turns your 1080p into a slightly malfunctioning projector (an effect which I had to turn off after about five minutes because it was making me ill). From games, it swipes Max Paynes slow-motion diving, God of Wars cinematic quick time events, Prince of Persias platforming, and The Clubs gonzo, multiplier-heavy arcade shooting. As befitting its gameplay and presentation, Wets plot is a mishmash of hyperactive action clichs. Youve got a hot, badass hero named Rubi, whose sense of style favors leather and dual pistols. From the explosive opening, you guide her through a series of ever more ludicrous plot points involving plane crashes, a variety of evil foreigners, a mysterious suitcase, someone named Rat Boy, and  by my count  two separate characters that control the designer drug trade in Hong Kong. It also features some notable voice talent in Eliza Dushku and Malcolm McDowell, which youll appreciate when they deliver lines like Say goodbye, f---tard.But you know what? The whole mess sort of works for me. Its boneheaded to its spandex-clad little soul, but like a good late night cable flick, the creators seem to be in on the joke. I love how theres no attempt to provide any sense of reality. The developers dont even bother with a reload function on your main pistols and theres no cool-down timer on your bullet time abilities, translating into battles that are somewhere between Jet Li and a gymnastics meet on amphetamines. Its not polished enough to hang with the games that inspired it  the action gets messy to the point of frustration far too often, and the level designs are rudimentary to say the least  but if youre looking for a weekend sugar-rush you could do much worse.", "date": "on Sep 28, 2009", "grade": "7.5"}
