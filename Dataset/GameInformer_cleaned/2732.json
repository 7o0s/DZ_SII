Who are the Collectors? What interest does the mysteriousIllusive Man have in Commander Shepard? Where are the Reapers? Why hasCerberus come out of the shadows? Why is mankind the only species inthe universe being hunted?Lost has teased its viewershipfor years with mystifying answers that lead to even more questions, butin Mass Effect 2, the scribes at BioWare slowly pull the curtain awayto reveal the answers you seek. By the time the credits roll, mostquestions are addressed, Commander Shepards role in the universe iscemented, and the last image that appears on screen makes the wait forMass Effect 3 seem unfair. If you import your save file from thefirst game, the connection you have with this adventure is heightenedto the point that youre doing yourself a disservice if you create anew character. The save transfer retains your character likeness,remembers all of the decisions you made, and ultimately delivers thesensation that you are sculpting the story and are not a passenger on aprescripted ride. The state of the universe is very much how you leftit, and the decisions you make moving forward will carry over into MassEffect 3. If characters died in the first game, they wont return inthis sequel.Mistakes you made in the past could come back tohaunt you. Youll see the aftermath to decisions you thought right atthe time. And dont be surprised if you stop dead in your tracks to geta better look at familiar faces on the streets. These characters may be old acquaintances, and if you talk to them, the conversations willplay out like a chance reunions.With this kind of depth, MassEffect 2 revels in its relationships. The bond created betweenCommander Shepard and his or her crew is much stronger this timearound, with their personal lives sewn tightly into the plot. As theycome to know Shepard, their tormented histories, relationships withloved ones, and ghosts from their pasts are dissected. The cast islikeable, and their stories tug at Shepards soul in myriad ways.Thesituations you are asked to dictate are not as black and white as thefirst game. Doing what you think is right at the time could backfirelater, or lead to a teammate shutting down emotionally.Thenarrative bounces between engaging mysteries and moments that attackyour conscience, all while pulling you deeper into a game universe thanyouve ever been. BioWares scribes have not only created one of videogames greatest stories with Mass Effect 2, they have redefined howstories are is told in this medium.As familiar as this universewill feel for fans of the original game, the majority of the gameplaywill feel alien. Most of the role-playing elements have been removedoutright. Weapon and player customization  two confusing menu-drivendistractions from the first game  have been stripped to the bones.Most of the role-playing content is replaced with modern day shooterconventions, such as regenerating health and limited ammo.In mysoldier class playthrough, I only discovered 14 different firearms.None of the weapons are technically better than the other  they justoffer different functionality. You cannot apply individual upgrades tothe firearms like you could in the first game, either. All upgrades (ofwhich there are few) are automatically applied to every weapon in thesame class. Likewise, the inventory system has been removed in favor ofa similar armor upgrade system. Since this is all automatic, you nolonger have to deal with making sure your team is outfitted with thelatest gear.The shift away from RPG-style customization maysound like a major setback, but the new format keeps the focus on theaction. The combat scenarios deliver more excitement, not to mention awider breadth of enemy types. Teammates no longer mindlessly shootwalls like they did in the first game. Rather than acting likeflashbang victims, they demonstrate intelligence on the battlefield asthey take cover, advance, and unload everything they can on the enemy.BioWarealso rethought the control mapping, allowing players to assign bioticsto buttons and view cool-down meters mid-battle  both of which removethe need to visit the pause screen. From a tactical standpoint, you areno longer shoehorned into relying specifically on Shepards classspecialties. You can snipe from ridges, create biotic and firearmcombos, and even use melee/shotgun-style assaults. All of these optionsfeel great, and are balanced to create exciting battles.With itsamazing storytelling and combat, it may seem BioWare can do no wrong,but this journey is littered with unpleasant minigames tied to planetmining, computer hacking, and lock bypassing. Each of these diversionsare as mind-numbingly dull as they are repetitive in design. Given howheavily they tie into the gameplay, youd think BioWare would havegiven them the same care that clearly went into the rest of the game.Although unwanted, the minigames dont derail the experience. The onlyelement of this finely sculpted game that stands out as a grievouserror is the last boss design  its look screams X-Men more than itdoes Mass Effect.The loss of RPG elements may hit some peoplehard, and the repetition in minigames may lead to yawns and tired eyes,but none of these faults hold Mass Effect 2 back from being a work ofbold ambition, and one of gamings most exciting sequels.", "date": "Jan 26, 2010", "grade": "9.75"}
