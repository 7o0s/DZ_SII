Its only fitting that Rockstar Games ends its latestimpressive run of open world masterpieces at the other end of thespectrum. The Ballad of Gay Tony is Rockstar Norths song of excess,showcasing Liberty Citys drug-addled trust fund elite, promiscuoussocialites, nitro-fueled luxury sportscars, and military-grade weaponry. Newprotagonist Luis Lopez may roll with the elite, but he certainly isntone of them; the Dominican ex-convict grew up pulling off petty crimesin the rough neighborhood of Northwood until legendary nightclub ownerTony Prince took him under his wing. Lopez quickly finds out that atwo-bit corner boy and a personal assistant to the rich and famousarent so different. As Gay Tonys once-powerful nightclub empirespirals out of control due to his excessive drug use and outstandingdebt to shady loansharks, its up to Lopez to do the dirty work andkeep the clubs afloat.Rolling with the rich has its benefitswhen it comes to crime. Forget the slow progression to explosiveweapons most Grand Theft Auto games follow, Lopez has almost immediateaccess to the finest arms dealers have to offer  attack choppers,APCs, explosive shotguns, sticky bombs, and my favorite, the P90assault rifle. The creative new missions Rockstar North crafted putthese destructive new toys to good use; one minute youre sinking aluxury yacht with the missile-launching attack chopper, and the nextyoure parachuting from 10,000 feet to infiltrate the high-rise officesof the crooked Russian owner of the Liberty City Rampage hockey team.The outlandish nature of most of your missions almost always attractsthe attention of the cops, guaranteeing more thrills than your typicalGTA fare.Throughout the story, Luis is torn between hisallegiance to the lavish new lifestyle Tony provides him and the familyand friends hes left behind in Northwood. Players wont feel as badleaving his disgruntled mother and hoodrat friends in their wake. Thedrug war shootouts Lopez gets into with his childhood friends may bemade from traditional GTA bread and butter, but I found myself ignoringthem in favor of the more explosive missions from Gay Tony or spoiledArab playboy Yusuf Amir.Luis may feel conflicted hanging in theold neighborhood, but hes clearly in his element when the drinks areflowing and the dance floor is bumping at the nightclubs. In the clubs,players can remove troublemakers, do shots with bartenders, showerfriends with champagne in the VIP room, and dance with the ladies onthe dancefloor. Show her all the right moves and shell likely show youhers in the bathroom stall. Make sure you work at least one managementshift at the nightclub as well; your office employee in the short skirtwill make it worth your time.When Luis isnt taking orders anddoing favors for his out of control friends, players can indulge in thefantastic base jumping and cagefighting side missions or go on arampage with the attack chopper or APC. The multiplayer also gets newcontent to amp up the action; the frantic GTA races now feature nitroboosts, and the new deathmatch maps focus on close quarters combat.WhileI preferred the tight-knit story of brotherhood and betrayal in TheLost and Damned, The Ballad of Gay Tony delivers more explosiveweapons, death-defying missions, and off-the-wall characters. Dontmiss your chance to close out the GTA IV experience in style.", "date": "Oct 28, 2009", "grade": "9.25"}
