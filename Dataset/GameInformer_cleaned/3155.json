The biggest changes are the incorporation of the Wii balance board and some limited online functionality (leaderboards and a lame dress-up contest similar to the Check Mii Out channel)Using the board, you'll steer a wildebeest with your butt, surf through space on an ironing board, and stomp on it like the pedals of a tractor. This control method works fine, but eventually you'll get sick of the required calibration before every minigame and find that it's much easier to get a better score using the standard remote controls.The solo campaign consists of a herd of Rabbids pestering Rayman with a week's worth of TV programming. Monday starts out with a deluge of minigame options, but as the days wear on you end up burning through the enjoyable modes and are eventually stuck playing junk and repeating songs just to finish up. Star Worse, for example, has you drawing shapes to blast asteroids, which, in concept, sounds cool. But it simply doesn't recognize 60 percent of what you're scrawling with the remote.Throwing this in at a party, however, is a different story. The dancing game has that perfect mix of embarrassment and fun that makes it just as entertaining to watch as it is to play. Seeing four of your friends perform a disco point and butt slap combo is hilarious. Even some of the games that don't work as well get more of a pass in multiplayer since everyone's shared control issues throw a tinge of random luck into otherwise skill-based proceedings.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "7"}
