The protagonist of aseries of 19th-century adventure novels, Quatermain inspired a genre of filmand literature that includes the likes of Indiana Jones, which in turn inspirednumerous game series like Tomb Raider and Uncharted. Deadfall Adventures expandsupon the lore of Quatermain, but tracing the genre back to its source material doesn'thelp this puzzle-infused shooter overcome its myriad, frustrating problems.You play as James Lee Quatermain, Allan Quatermain's greatgrandson, who goes on a globe-hopping quest to find pieces of an ancient artifactcalled the Heart of Atlantis. Along the way you run into Nazis, Russiansoldiers, and Arabian thieves, plus a legion of undead mummies. Quatermain is unwillinglyaccompanied by a sidekick for most of the adventure, the buxom Jennifer Goodwin,who serves as the Elena Fisher to Quatermain's Nathan Drake. Just don't expectany witty repartee between the two, as the wooden character models areincapable of conveying any kind of chemistry, and the writing is horrible. Mostof the dialogue involves Quatermain making derisive cracks about the clichstory and repetitive puzzles, which don't make them any better. At one point,Goodwin quips, ~If only I had a nickel for every bad joke...~ If the player didas well, he or she would be able to buy a better game.Ultimately, the gameplay is what's important, and it doesn'tfare much better than the story. The gunplay proves that not all first-personshooters are created equal, and aside from regenerating health, most of thegameplay mechanics are unforgivably outdated. The game features no aimassistance whatsoever, and the controls aren't tight enough for precisiontargeting. The frame rate is erratic, hanging completely every time acheckpoint is reached. The checkpoints themselves are poorly placed, oftensaving before a big battle but not after, forcing you to repeat boringfirefights should you die from a random booby trap after the action is over.The environmental traps are a lot deadlier than yourenemies, who exhibit some of the worst AI I've seen in a modern shooter (apartfrom their pinpoint accuracy, of course). They stand like statues out in theopen as they plug away at you. When they do take cover, they endlessly pop outin the same location for ineffective potshots. Occasionally, they attempt toshoot through objects, or just sit stationary, as if they forgot you werethere. Undead mummies provide the only change-up to combat, requiring you toshine your flashlight on them before finishing them off with a volley of shotsor a knife swipe.Deadfall Adventure's other gimmick is its plethora ofpuzzles, which could have been a welcome change of pace. Unfortunately, they alternatebetween obvious clichs (matching tiles to symbols or shooting whatever shinyobject needs shooting) and impossibly obscure (like blindly spinning a magiccelestial map until it's oriented the way the game wants it to be). Regardlessof the puzzle, your inexplicably omniscient journal usually tells you what todo. No puzzle is clever or unique; I have solved every one before in bettergames. These puzzles reward you with treasure that unlocks upgrades, butthey're all boring incremental improvements like a little more health andslightly faster reload times. Since dying at the hands of a booby trap oftensets you back to an unforgiving checkpoint, I eventually stopped searching forthe treasures altogether.Quatermain's adventure isn't just boring  it's also buggy.During one shootout, I came across an invincible soldier who was immobile and holdingan invisible gun. Later, I shot a bad guy whose leg flattened out and wrappedaround railing, suspending the rest of his body in the air. At one point, mycharacter reloaded the pistols he was dual-wielding with an inexplicable third hand. Walking too close to any uneven geometrycauses the screen to shake and controller to vibrate  the first time ithappened I thought I had triggered a scripted earthquake.Despite the lack of polish in the single-player campaign,the game features a fairly robust set of multiplayer options, including a co-opsurvival mode and a variety of 12-player competitive and team modes.Unfortunately, I was unable to test them because no one else was playing thegame online, despite it being out for nearly a week. Given the game's shoddyquality and the complete lack of awareness for the title, I don't expect thatto change. Deadfall Adventures tries its best to mix first-personshooting with the puzzle solving of adventure titles. Unfortunately, thegunplay is buggy, the puzzles are hackneyed, and the story is hopelessly bad.If you're expecting anything remotely fun, prepare to be disappointed.", "date": "Nov 21, 2013", "grade": "4"}
