The big question is how the Wii remote controls work in replacement of the old maracas. Sadly, many enthusiasts will be frustrated. While the functionality is okay, the faster movements required on the higher difficulties frequently don't register as you switch between notes  resulting in failures you don't deserve. It cripples what is otherwise a fun return to maraca-shaking goodness. Other music games have stepped light years beyond what's going on in the gameplay here, but the pure insanity on screen and variety of modes should be enough to make even jaded video game rockers crack a smile.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "6.75"}
