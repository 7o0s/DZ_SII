Dont be fooled  Hand of Fate 2 is not a collectible card game, butrather a distinctive take on the core tabletop experience mixed with asmattering of real-time action battles. The conceit of maneuvering around atabletop dungeon crafted by cards is a strong, unique twist on the classicaction/RPG, and this sequel improves upon almost every feature found in thefirst game. Low-impact additions like rolling dice or spinning wheels todetermine the outcome of a story are interesting, but Hand of Fate 2 also makesbig changes, like companion characters that join you in battle and offer theirskills and expertise off the battlefield.Hand of Fate 2 is almost two different games that combine toform a singular experience. In one, youre traveling around a dungeon made upof cards, which could be traps, treasure, tests of character, caves to explore,and more. The other is combat-centric action sequences, which you stumble uponbased on your board-game excursions.Combat is the weakest element in Hand of Fate 2. While itdoesnt stray into rote button-mashing madness, elements are flighty andimprecise at times, and the camera often feels like its working against you. Weaponselection and timing defensive abilities add some nuance, but battle is oftenboring or laborious. The enemy variety also gets stale around halfway through, sobattles take a backseat to the more fun parts, like cobbling together theperfect deck and discovering ways to handle encounters on the card map.The ever-shifting map of cards steals the show. Thesetravels task you with maneuvering dangerous precipices, participating in a townfair, rescuing (or abandoning!) those in need, discovering hidden treasure, or negotiatinga longstanding feud. Myriad scenarios and ways to approach them exist, and tacklingthe mysteries in different ways gives you incentive to replay areas  orsomething else to do if you fail a challenge and need to repeat it severaltimes. Making your own choices and facing the consequences duringthese often-dire decisions is enjoyable and you feel like you are plotting yourown personal course to victory. Perhaps you missed a die roll in trying to picka lock or you decided to get a bit too greedy with a suspicious pile oftreasure; you can make a different choice, pick a different card, or rolldifferently your next time through the area, and maybe even score some newoptions to include in your deck. Hand of Fate 2s tabletop dungeon crawling isimmersive and engaging, and I found myself replaying missions just to check outsome of the choices I may have missed. These Dungeons & Dragons-styleencounters combined with the baubles, trinkets, and clinking pieces strewnabout the card-infused table create a cozy RPG atmosphere thats difficult tomatch.Companion characters are awesome, even if they dontfundamentally change the core gameplay. Tap into the barbarians strength tocrush some foes on the battlefield or manipulate perks to subtly influence yourexperiences during narrative encounters, such as duplicating cards or throwingan extra die to give you an edge against the odds. With four differentcompanions to travel with that range from brute melee assistants to spell-flingingmages, they add plenty of flavor to combat and crawling. You may even find yourstory (or theirs) being altered by the choices you make along the way.Hand of Fate was a hidden gem, a Kickstartersurprise that showed us that there was a cool way to mix up an action-RPG withtabletop conventions. The sequel polishes and preens itself into a much moreefficient and entertaining entity, and if you can handle some less-than-stellarcombat, you find yourself immersed in a spectacular world.", "date": "Nov 13, 2017", "grade": "8.75"}
