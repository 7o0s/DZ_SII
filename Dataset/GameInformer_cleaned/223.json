Afew regime changes later  which include both the series' developer and publisher and Homefront: The Revolution returns with some novel additions including aunique take on the open-world format and on-the-fly weapon customization.Unfortunately, developer Dambuster Studios failed to slay Homefront's trueenemy; an unending litany of glitches, A.I. failings, and performance issues thatdo indeed differentiate Homefront from other shooters, but for all the wrongreasons.Homefront: The Revolutionreboots the series' already dubious premise with an even more absurdexplanation of America's downfall: In the near future, the U.S. government seesfit to start buying all of its military equipment from the technologicalpowerhouse that is North Korea, which then renders our defenses useless bydisabling all of our electronic devices via a hidden backdoor. With the stage hastilythrown together, the first few minutes play out like a greatest hits of lazyCall of Duty plot points, including being forced to witness point-blankexecutions, a brutal interrogation scene, and more close calls for protagonistEthan Brady than you can count. Homefront's shoddy character animations can't conveythe gravitas Dambuster is going for, and neither can the dreadful characters (includingan ally who tortures North Koreans for fun and threatens to cut off yournipples) or clich-ridden dialogue.Once you play through thelackluster intro, you're free to start taking back the city of Philadelphia onedistrict at a time. Unfortunately, it doesn't take long for Homefront: TheRevolution's fundamental problems to arise. A number of games delivercompelling first-person shooting with a controller. Homefront isn't one ofthem. The gunplay is sluggish and inexact, making even perfect headshots unsatisfying.Navigation doesn't fare much better; vaulting over objects feels stilted and breaksyour flow of movement, and the hit detection for grabbing onto ledges isspotty, often requiring multiple hops for your character to recognize aclimbable surface. These basic problems feel like they belong to a bygonegeneration.The same is true for one ofHomefront: The Revolution's biggest stumbling block: the framerate. Despite ahefty day-one patch designed to improve performance, Homefront's frameratefrequently stutters, and on some occasions felt more like a slideshow than avideo game. The best shooters aim for a solid 60 frames per second  Homefrontis lucky to claw its way to 30, and rarely stays there for long. Theperformance issues don't just kill the already shaky gunplay  they also gaveme headaches during prolonged play sessions, something I have never experiencedin my many years playing shooters.These fundamental flaws aredisappointing, because there are some interesting elements at play in Homefront.The shift to an open-world setting was undoubtedly the right call for theseries. The large zones you travel through contain plenty of character and openbuildings to explore, and taking on the KPA forces demands novel hit-and-runtactics. Customizing your guns in the heat of battle also works well, thoughbeing limited to two primary weapons meant I hardly touched a number ofalternate guns. These features instill a sense of gameplay freedom that militaryshooters often lack; I would have enjoyed them if it weren't for the perfectstorm of other problems.All of Homefront'sshortcomings are compounded by a relentless barrage of glitches, which are moreoppressive than the occupying KPA forces. You can't go 30 seconds withoutseeing something downright embarrassing. For starters, the game freezes forseveral seconds every time you complete an objective, acquire a new mission, orexit out of a weapons locker. Getting stuck in the environment is an uncommonbut ever-present threat, as is enemies spawning right in front of you.Some bugs have to be (not)seen to be believed: Once, I witnessed an entire roomful of charactersdisappear into thin air. Another ally stood around brandishing an invisiblerifle. Yet another charged across the battlefield as just a floating head andpair of hands. An unfortunate civilian was forced to the ground and handcuffedby an invisible officer, then stood up and walked off like nothing happened. Thelist is endless, and while some of these bugs are entertaining, I was lessamused by losing an hour of progress when two of the four rotating autosavefiles glitched out and caused the game to load indefinitely. The standalone co-opmode is equally riddled with bugs, on top of being saddled with blind weaponcrates, one-use consumable items, and an overly grind-heavy progression systemthat saps the fun out of casual play.Despite all the technical problems,I still managed to finish Homefront's campaign, but I can't say I had fun. Allof the game's ambitions are undone by its flaws, offering only the rare glimpseof what could have been. Dambuster has already stated they are committed toimproving the game with additional patches, but given everything that's currentlywrong, the studio faces a greater uphill battle than Homefront's desperate underdogs.", "date": "May 25, 2016", "grade": "4"}
