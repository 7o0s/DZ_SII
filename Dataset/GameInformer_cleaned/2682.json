ScrapMetal is a downloadable title that fulfills both criteria, so I went in hoping for something of a~Car Combat Lite~ experience. It may not offer the fully fleshed-out vehicular carnage of a Twisted Metal game, but there's enough fun here to make it worth a look.One thing that immediately separates it fromother car combat titles is mission variety. Whereas series' likeTwisted Metal or Vigilante 8 typically stuck with arena-styledeathmatches, Scrap Metal regularly shifts between different styles of play and new gameplay mechanics. One mission might be a straightforward ~blow upthe other cars~ affair, while the next may be a Burnout-esqueelimination race. You could be participating in a survival gauntletagainst circus freaks, only to be met afterwards by a surprisinglytolerable escort mission. There really aren't any game types that end up being sogroan-inducing that you'll dread playing them.Your vehicles handle well thanks to the easy to pick up controlscheme that has you directing speed and direction simply by aiming the left analog; another more challenging option resembles classic RC Pro-Am controls. Even with solid controls, the camera can be anoccasional issue. Similar to the first two Grand Theft Auto games, the view is perched above the action, making it difficult to take outfar-away opponents in Derby mode or prepare for upcoming turns duringthe races.Vehicle customization plays a large role in ScrapMetal, but there is one major stumbling block. Winning racesearns you points that you can use to upgrade your firepower, armor,speed, and other abilities. You can also claim vehicles from yourdefeated opponents to use as your own. In doing so, you have to place the new vehicle inone of four slots in your garage, which means you'll oftentimes have toreplace vehicles into which you've invested a lot of upgrade points. When you do chooseto replace that Class 3 car that you've fully upgraded, you receive noform of ~resale~ compensation. All of those points that you pumped into your vehicle are gone, and you no longer have access to it.Fans ofthe Twisted Metal series know that a good chunk of its appeal comesfrom its sick sense of humor and colorful characters. Scrap Metal makesno attempt to be particularly edgy, and its characters are generic andwholly uninteresting. Twisted Metal offered up classic characters suchas Sweet Tooth, Mr. Grimm, and Calypso, and Scrap Metal's ~JaneJunktrunk~ just can't compete. Even the stages themselves are dull, offering no zaniness along the lines of blowing up the Eiffel Tower in Twisted Metal 2 or taking the ski lift warps in Vigilante 8. All of Scrap Metal's missions are straightforward affairs - you destroy the other cars or race them, with no real curveballs thrown into the mix.When you're finished with thenumerous single player missions, you can take King of the Hill, Derby,and Race modes online. Gameplay doesn't change significantly when theaction is brought online, but a tense round of KOTH can be a fundistraction if you're done with the missions.If Scrap Metal wasnothing but arena deathmatch missions, it would be much harder torecommend. An awkward camera angle and the lack of creative characterswould keep it from being worth the asking price. However, the varietyof vehicle types and mission objectives should satisfy car combat fanslooking for signs of life in the genre.", "date": "Mar 10, 2010", "grade": "7.25"}
