As the namesuggests, this is a 50/50 mix of Wii Sports and Mario Party, and is just assimplistic and slight as you'd expect.So, yet another minigame collection from Nintendo, whichalready packed Nintendo Land in with the deluxe version of the Wii U. Sadly, itdoes even less to convince me that the Wii U GamePad is ever going to be goodfor anything.It's pretty telling that Wii Party U comes packaged with aWii remote; if you're still bundling your last system's controller with gamesfor your new system, something is wrong. Even an interesting mode that uses theGamePad for tabletop two-player action falls flat.The games themselves are all fairly boring. Use the GamePad tofling life preservers at the other players. Press a button to chop a fallinglog or catch a falling watermelon. Play a variation on ~memory.~ Out of thedozens I played, only a handful are clever. Many are as simple as WarioWaregames, minus that series' manic, absurdist humor. They also fall into theuncomfortable niche of being boring for adults, but too saddled with wonkycontrols and difficult elements to be enjoyed by younger children.You can access many of these a la carte, but to really get thefull effect you have to engage in one of the overly long Mario Party-styleboard games, which are deadly dull and completely down to random chance. Inlast place? Don't worry; the game will find some arbitrary reason to vault youahead of your competitors by the end (or, frustratingly, vice versa). The bestexample revolved around collecting clothes to form outfits (ninja, Mario,cowboy, etc) and then have them judged in a fashion show at the end of theboard.Wii Party U is meant to be played in a group offour, if only to have more people to talk to while you grind through an hour-plusboard game session. Still, that means you need two Wii remotes in addition tothe one in the box and your GamePad -another $60 to $80 dollars down thedrain if you don't already have them. Or you could buy any one of a hundred funcasual games for iOS, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, or Steam. Most ofthem won't be over $5; many will be free. This party's slight amusements aren'tworth the cover charge.", "date": "on Oct 25, 2013", "grade": "6"}
