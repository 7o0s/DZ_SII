My ragtag team of rookieGhostbusters readies their weapons as flaming skulls circle around them and thespirit of the dead captain emerges. Using our primary weapons, we wrestle hishealth down before firing out our proton streams until he's tired enough to catch in our ghost trap.Rather than celebrating with a triumphant fist-pump, I let out a quiet sigh andmove on to the next room where I face the same enemies and follow a nearlyidentical series of events. That'sbecause this twin-stick shooter interpretation of the Ghostbusters license notonly reuses its environments, enemies, and dialogue ad nauseam, but even its encountersare staged in similar ways from beginning to end.Each level in Ghostbusters is a linear path that repeats the sameformula: Four main characters (controlled by humans in local co-op or A.I.otherwise) fight large numbers of smaller apparitions, scan an area with theP.K.E. meter, then battle a mini-boss in a large open area until they captureit. Most missions take around 30 minutes and have you repeat this processseveral times before you finally face off against the stage boss. As if that isn't repetitive enough, you must dothat in 10 missions across six locales (excluding the unlockable ~remix~missions that let you return to alternate versions of previous levels - notthat you would ever want to).The environments possess a colorful art style that would be a lotmore impressive if I didn'tpass through the same recycled hallways and rooms. The enemies are also reused;if you're not fighting hordesof flaming skulls, it'sflocks of flying books. If it'snot the spirits of those buried in the cemetery you're walking in, it's the spirits of patients at the asylumyou're exploring. The boss battles at the end of each stage are the most diverse,but even most of those devolve into simple bullet-sponge encounters with fewsurprises. During many of these encounters, I was able to easily knock offlarge chunks of health by standing still and firing at the boss, or by doingcircles while shooting at it. The boss battles aren't great the first time around, which madethe final level, which has you fight them all again back-to-back in the lead-upto the anticlimactic final boss, all the more annoying.Rather than using the cast of the first two Ghostbusters films oreven the cast of the film this release coincides with, the game introduces fouroriginal characters. Each character represents a different class; you canchoose from a guy wielding an assault rifle proton pack, a girl with dualpistols, a guy with a heavy chain gun, and my personal favorite, a girl with ashotgun. I refer to them like that because while they possess distinctabilities, they are left unnamed by the developer.The characters don'thave names, but they do each have unique personalities, as demonstrated by thehorrible one-liners that are repeatedly spewed throughout each mission. Ghost-relatedpuns like ~I see right through you,~ ~He's sprite this way,~ and ~I've got the spirit~ made me not even want to think about the linesthat were left on the cutting room floor.At the end of each mission, you're awarded experience points to level up your character's stats. While I often poured mypoints into weapon damage or movement speed, you can also increase the range ofyour weapon, the size of your health bar, and more. I enjoyed leveling myfavorite character up, but since experience gained doesn't transfer between characters, you're better off progressing with asingle character, which defeats the point of the diversity offered by thedifferent classes.The overall lack of polish is another issue. Enemies get stuck inthe environments, weapons inconsistently go through periods of being unable tofire when you're revived, andcompanion characters sometimes teleport short distances while you're walking with them. In addition, theunderwhelming sound of the weapons is even further highlighted when the sounddoesn't play properly becauseanother weapon is being fired at the same time. When combined with a chuggingframe rate and other problems, these flaws push Ghostbusters further into therealm of unplayability.The tedium of playing through the same encounters over and overagain makes Ghostbusters impossible to recommend. The awful one-liners, thepoor sound design, and the boring story would be tolerable if it was fun toplay, but it's not.Ghostbusters is a slog from start to finish.", "date": "Jul 15, 2016", "grade": "4"}
