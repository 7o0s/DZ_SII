Tackling the relatively brief career mode is sweat-inducing fun in the harder difficulties, and I enjoyed the retro Power Pad appeal. However, the pad constantly needs to be re-centered in front of your TV and it's not wide enough for two adults to squeeze onto. It's also easy to accidentally hit pause in the middle of gameplay, and there just aren't enough activities for long term exercise interest.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
