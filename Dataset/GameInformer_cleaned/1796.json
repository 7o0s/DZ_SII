Armored Core V is the newest installmentof the series, and while From Software has continued its tradition of meldingonline and offline play in unique ways, the mech-exploding action has a fewglaring issues.While AC V offers a functional offline mode, playing it thatway would be like going solo in an MMO. Apart from a short gameplay tutorial,your first task is to sign up with an online team or create a new one. Eachteam accommodates up to 20 players, and everything you do in the game  fromplaying through story missions to competing for territory in Conquest battles earns your squad Team Points to unlock new missions. The world map displayswhich teams control the dozens of territories and functions as a chatroom foryour team. From Software has added systems for trading parts, money, and mechswith your fellow members. These aspects instill an impressive sense ofcamaraderie with your team, and my attempts to play offline were significantlyless fun.Mech games are known for their customization options, and ACV is no different. In addition to a staggering number of weapons, the mechs(called ACs) can be customized with a variety of armors, boosters, and other items. Customization isn't just a matter of simple stat changeseither; different loadouts have a massive impact on handling, and accommodate avariety of play styles. Unfortunately, the UI is a complete pain. The simpleact of equipping a new weapon is surprisingly confusing, and the game offerslittle explanation. Even after you figure out how to build your mech, shopping,assembly, and testing are all handled in different menus, making customizationa cumbersome and time-consuming affair.The amount of prep time required is made worse by themissions. Missions are divided between story chapters and orders, both of whichallow you to bring a friend along. The story missions, which are the longestmissions in the game, are a confusing mess of disembodied dialogue andunexplained objectives. Difficulty also quickly becomes an issue, since eventhe most agile mechs can't dodge the unavoidable barrage of missiles, bullets,and plasma blasts you'll soon be facing. This leads to a frustrating game of trial anderror, requiring you to restart from the last checkpoint, change up yourloadouts, then fight your way back to the problem area. To make matters worse,you can't buy new parts during missions, so if you don't already own the rightequipment to get you through a tough encounter, be ready to start the missionover from the beginning.Order missions fall on the other side of the spectrum. Devoid of any storyelements, order missions are all about making money and earning Team Points.They're also so short that you spend more time setting up your AC than on thebattlefield. I engaged in numerous one-on-one AC battles that were over in lessthan a minute, while the longer search and destroy order missions took aroundfive. The variety in order missions is far too limited, and I quickly grewtired of having to complete them for points and money.The most interesting mode is Conquest, where you battleother teams for territory control on the world map. Capture missions requireyou to gamble your Team Points, and allow you to bring three teammates with youinto battle (a fifth player can assume the role of operator, who watches combatunfold from an overhead map, marking important tactical areas on the otherplayers' HUD). Since most teams won't be online 24/7 to defend their territory,most invasion squads will go up against a team of NPCs, plus whatever defensiveturrets the team has bought for the map.The main problem with this is that the level of the NPCs ischosen randomly, meaning you might get teamed up against a pack of pushovers,or the mech equivalent of the A-Team. If the defending team is defeated, theysimply lose their territory, and can try to gain it back later. However, if theinvading team goes down, they lose all of their Team Points, and will have togrind their way back to the top by replaying countless story and ordermissions. It's a harsh penalty for not knowing what grouping of enemies you'llbe up against.I appreciate the interesting format AC V employs, andenjoyed the sense of camaraderie I had for my team. However, the story missionsare too confusing and difficult, the order missions are too short andrepetitive, and there is no in-between. I think I spent more time customizingmy mech than I did fighting in it, and the solid multiplayer support can't makeup for the lack of variety. A dedicated team can make the experienceworthwhile, but you should play AC V under those conditions or not at all.", "date": "Mar 20, 2012", "grade": "6.5"}
