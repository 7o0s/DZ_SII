{"name": "Need for Speed: Shift", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/need_for_speed_shift/b/xbox360/archive/2009/09/28/review.aspx", "text": "As gamers, a certain portion of our brain responds positively when we hear a game is going to be more realistic  particularly in racing games, where this can signal gains in the physics models, replication of the real-life tracks, and the car specs. But going down this road has as many liabilities as it does benefits. Up until now, aiming for more realism in your driving game has led to games that are challenging because of their simulation of what happens when velocity, tire grip, and physics collide. Nothing is wrong with sim-based racers, but Need for Speed: Shift ends up plying the same trade as the Forzas and Gran Turismos before it, and not necessarily to dramatically better results. Shifts Driver Profile is one area where the game plots its own course. You are given points during races for either driving aggressively or skillfully. The former includes blocking opponents from passing or sliding through corners, while the latter is for hitting the correct racing line or mastering a corner. You earn points in either category, and its not like youre forced in one direction or another. As such, your Driver Profile serves as little more than a glorified progress indicator that comes with its own medals. Im all for the bells and whistles  as inconsequential as they might be  but I dont think that the Driver Profile adds much, even in the intangibles category. Furthermore, I wish the game didnt splash Driver Profile graphics all over my screen when Im trying to race, especially since the HUD itself is poorly done. I consistently had trouble reading the map, and an even harder time finding out which place I was in.Shifts career structure and driving thankfully serve as better anchors than the Driver Profile. New race types and locations open up freely thanks to the games star system (which opens new racing tiers as you collect more stars), and the five career tiers give you plenty of options from which to choose. Shifts driver duels (particularly online) are the only highlight among the race types, but we can all be thankful that the racing itself is strong enough to carry the game. The cars power, strengths, and weaknesses are apparent, and Shift offers plenty of challenge. The games very forgiving damage system belies the driving realism, but who am I kidding? I like to cross the finish line above all else.This game goes from zero-to-60 fast enough, but that only brings it upon the question of now what? that much more quickly. I dont want to say that being a sim-racer is a dead end, but its hard to know where the Shift branch of Need for Speed can go from here.", "date": "Sep 28, 2009", "grade": "8"}
