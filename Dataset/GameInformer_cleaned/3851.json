Its an adventure with few zones,several bosses, and an interesting combat system that lets you learn skills andabilities from enemies and apply them to your own fighting style. Its filled withother players you can team up with to accomplish your adventuring goals, mentorby forming your own school, or simply pummel into the ground when you see them.While that may sound like fun, thebuilding blocks never coalesce into anything meaningful over the scant hoursoffered. Absolvers strength is its combat, which is formed viacombat decks and is mainly handled with fists, kicks, and body blows. Weaponsare available, but they are limited use items or special activated abilitiesthat only last for a short duration. The concept of tying your core stats tothese skills is cool, like a heavy punch gaining more damage as you increaseyour strength, or a flying kick getting a bonus from more dexterity. Linkingtogether chains of abilities and switching stances to execute powerfulmaneuvers is the best part of the game. Learning new abilities by sparring withenemies and other players is also quite satisfying, and complements the combatsystems nicely. While the excellent combat leaves lots of room for performanceand features a high skill ceiling, you can muddle your way through the entiregame by smashing one button if you really want.Outside of combat, the world is puzzlingly barren and small.Absolver features three core zones that players can explore, and although itcan be tense and interesting to move through these areas with other playerscoming and going at will, the environments feel dull and lifeless.The enemies are incredibly bland, and the mini-bosses andboss encounters are barely different from your average humanoid fighter out inthe overworld. While a few nooks and crannies have neat items, the stages arelinear and generally have only a few encounters in the way of each key battle.Absolver is notably short and conspicuously compact ifyoure looking for a single-player experience, and should only take you ahandful of hours to barrel through even if youre not the fastest adopter ofthe combat systems. You should not play this game for story, but you do have theopportunity to forge your own tale should you decide to go down that rabbithole after completing the game for the first time. As an Absolver, you cantravel the world freely and recruit other players to your cause, take on newgame plus versions of previous encounters, and even start your own combatschool. For players looking for a post-game experience and more things to do,this is a decent reason to keep playing, leveling, and tracking down thosehard-to-find skills. However, I didnt really feel especially drawn to thepost-game PvP-focused content after beating my way through the campaignofferings.Sloclaps first foray shows glimmers of brilliance in thecombat and the somewhat intriguing aesthetic of masked martial artists going atit in strange lands. Even so, Absolver feels like a collection of little piecesfrom something larger that just never happens. Its as if someone has set thetable for a fascinating three-course meal and the appetizer is the only thingthat ever comes out of the kitchen  and by the time you take your first bite,youre being ushered out the door.This review pertains to the PC version of Absolver.
