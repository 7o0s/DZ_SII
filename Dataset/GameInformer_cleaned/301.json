Rather than try to translate Hitman's complex mix of stealth and action to touchscreens, Square Enix Montreal targeted a completely differentgenre and aesthetic for its new mobile spinoff. Surprisingly, the Hitmanformula works well as a tabletop-themed puzzle game, but the underlying puzzlemechanics miss the mark.Each level in Hitman Go provides a snapshot of one of Agent47's exploits, presented in diorama form. 47 and enemy guards have beentransformed into posed figurines, which slide through the environment on setpaths. Other basic models and textures fill out the scenery, and the aestheticsare a clever and stylish way to encapsulate the action. Unfortunately, theequally simple gameplay is less captivating.On each turn, players move Agent 47 one space towards hisgoal. Afterwards, enemies take their turns, with each type exhibiting aspecific behavior. Guards in blue coats stand motionless and stare straight ahead,orange guards walk back and forth in a straight line, and green guards wieldknives and flip directions each turn. Getting spotted one space in front of anenemy gets you captured, while approaching an enemy from any other directiontakes them off the board.This simple formula results in more tedious trial-and-errorthan strategic planning, as you try to discover which combination of moves getsyou and your enemies in the right position. It's kind of like chess, except youonly have a king on your side, every piece can only move one space at a time,and the open board is reduced to a sparse network of interconnecting paths. Somelevels feature items that give you more gameplay options, such as rocks thatcan be thrown to distract guards or sniper rifles to take out distant foes. Often,however, the solution still involves hopping back and forth between two spaces whileyou wait for enemies to line up correctly. Square Enix Montreal does a good jobof steadily introducing new tools and additional enemy types, but they usually just make the subsequent puzzles more complex, not more interesting.Most levels contain three simple objectives to complete,such as picking up a briefcase, completing the level in the fewest movespossible, and killing everyone (or no one). These objectives are often at oddswith one another, and aren't compelling enough to warrant a second playthrough.You end up having to replay levels anyway, however, because subsequent ~boxes~(i.e. sets of levels) require a certain number of completed objectives.Acquiring enough to unlock all the content isn't particularly difficult, just moretime-consuming; I was able to complete all three objectives on most levels in twoplaythroughs. Square Enix Montreal commits the unpardonable sin of chargingreal money for hints, which walk you through completing the selected objective.The puzzles were easy enough that I didn't need to use them, but requiringstuck players to shell out more money to continue is shameful.The entertainment Hitman Go provides is a landscape ofstunted peaks and shallow valleys. Every now and then a level or objectivefeatures a flash of creativity or requires a clever strategy, but theseenjoyable moments are few and far between. At the same time, the solid difficultybalancing and continual introduction of new items and enemy types minimizesfrustration and provides enough of a reason to keep playing. It's not Agent47's best performance, but as always, he gets the job done.Adults Only?Don't be fooled by Hitman Go's confusingly inappropriate 17+ iOS rating. Although themed like the Hitman series, the ~violence~ in the game is as disturbing as knocking pieces off of a chessboard  because that's literally how kills are depicted. Squeamish players shouldn't let the rating scare them away.This review was originally published on May 1, 2014, and pertains to the iOS version of the game. Hitman Go is also available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, PC, and Android platforms.", "date": "Feb 23, 2016", "grade": "7"}
