Mythologies preserves the foundation of its PC forefather - players build towns, gather resources, and recruit soldiers and mythic creatures like minotaurs and sphinx to crush their enemies. Each playable race - the Egyptians, Greeks, and Norse - features varied units with unique strategic advantages, including clever god-granted bonuses that can sway the tide of the battle. With three single-player campaigns and online multiplayer, Mythologies offers tactics fans several hours of rewarding gameplay. The game's unique rewards system with unlockable maps, heroes, and relic powers adds replay value to a solid, if not earth-shattering, strategy title.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
