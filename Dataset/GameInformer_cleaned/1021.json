While JazzPunk certainlyhas no shortage of style and creativity, the robot-infused spy adventure gamehas more in common with a Mel Brooks screwball comedy than anything you would findin the Smithsonian. I'm glad Necrophone Games doesn't take itself tooseriously, but even if you buy the so-bad-it's-good premise, Jazzpunk's productionvalues are a drain on the entertainment.Wackiness pervades the adventure. Even though your spy-basedmission objectives are simple and straightforward (tail a subject, replace atarget's briefcase with a duplicate, etc.), each level is loaded with randomactivities, mini-games, and absurd interactions. Over the course of the game, Ihelped a frog hack a coffee shop's wi-fi signal, played a pizza-themed zombievideo game, threw popcorn at annoyed theater goers, had relations with a sexrobot, photocopied my butt, and called up Satan from inside the Sovietconsulate  and that was just the first level.JazzPunk's sense of humor has all the sophistication of acarnival funhouse, but the sheer oddity on display had me clicking on everyobject and character to see what they would do. Despite all of the bad computerpuns and corny sight gags, Necrophone's kitchen-sink approach throws so manyjokes at you that some are bound to hit. I had my share of chuckles and even abelly laugh or two, but much of the game feels like it's weird for the sake ofbeing weird. I would have liked to see JazzPunk explore some more elaboratecomedic scenarios (like the villain's final series of challenges), but theoverwhelming simplicity of the game design limits the humor to mostly one-offgags, which get old after a time.JazzPunk's production values speed up that process, and aredownright grating. The simplistic visuals have a passable charm, but otheraspects like the barebones animation and public domain sound effects (fans ofthe Wilhelm Scream are in for a surprise!) just feel cheap. The voice work isespecially terrible, and the robot effect applied to characters doesn't hidethe fact that it sounds like dialogue was recorded over a webcam. I get whatJazzPunk is going for  I'm well-versed in B-movies and games that arehilariously awful  but at some point bad just becomes bad again, and the game tiptoesdown that line with the grace of a hippopotamus.Playing through JazzPunk only takes a few hours, but complainingabout this game's length would be like complaining that you only got to spend fourhours in a Spencer Gifts. It's more than enough time to be submerged in JazzPunk'sstyle of humor, and the poor production values ensured I was ready for airby the time credits roll. Play it for the novelty and the rapid-fire assault ofjokes, but don't be surprised if most of them miss the mark.", "date": "Feb 06, 2014", "grade": "6.5"}
