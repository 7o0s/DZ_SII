Developers must contend with all of the normal trials andtribulations, but they also have a host of multiplayer-specific headaches toworry about, including online infrastructures, gameplay balancing, thwartingwould-be cheaters, and managing player retention. From a player's perspective, Fridaythe 13th succeeds at its first and most important goal: creating a fun andunique multiplayer experience that does justice to the storied film series and itsinfamous villain. However, the terrifying list of problems that accompanies theaction kills much of the excitement and threatens the game's long-term outlook.FridayThe 13th's story is as threadbare as the films it's based on. Eachone-versus-seven multiplayer match starts with a clip of the same unlucky chumpgetting stabbed in the back by Jason, causing the rest of the counselors to scatter.You control one of those counselors in most matches; after spawning in at arandom spot on the map, you're on your own to either find a way to escape orwait out the match's lengthy 20-minute limit as another player rampages asJason. On rare occasions, you don the iconic hockey mask (or canvas sack,depending on the version of Jason you select), and set out to kill everyoneelse in the most brutal ways possible. Counselorscan escape by car, boat, or calling the police, but each method is a multi-stepprocess that requires finding randomly placed components (like keys and gasoline)in the open-world campgrounds. Scouring the various cabins also unearths avariety of weapons and items, but if you're thinking of gearing up and goinghead-to-head with Jason, think again. Aside from one convoluted methodentailing a series of hidden objectives, Jason is invincible  the best you canhope for is to knock him down just long enough to make a hasty retreat to anearby building.Acompetitive multiplayer game built around an invincible player may sound like arecipe for disaster, but the formula works thanks to some smartly designedabilities. Just like the films, Jason walks at a sluggish pace, but he can warparound the map and use his sense ability to track and surprise his victims. Whenyou locate counselors, you can kill them with a few swings of your weapon(again dependent on your selected incarnation of Jason), or grab them toperform signature executions or environmental kills that harken back to thefilms, such as punching a counselor's head clean off. At the same time,counselors have a decent chance at evading the lumbering menace thanks tohigher sprint speeds and the ability to hide, as well as jump through cabinwindows, forcing Jason to hunt for the nearest door and break it down. Closecalls are frequent and consistently engaging, regardless of whether you're thepredator or the prey.Thesegrim showdowns of Friday the 13th shine brightest, and every now and then theyperfectly mirror the staple scenarios of the horror-film genre  whether you'rescreaming at your friend to start the car while Jason creeps closer, orcowering under a bed watching Jason's boots clomp by as he stalks from room toroom. Playing with friends make the experience even more magical, as youcoordinate your search for key items and devise escape plans, or simply capitalizeon their deaths by slinking off while Jason is busy dispatching them.Illfonic's love of the film franchise permeates the experience, and only makesthe surprise upsets and gory kills more memorable.Unfortunately,these amazing moments come at a heavy cost. Friday the 13th is plagued by ahost of technical problems, from texture pop-in and clipping issues to clunkycontrols and random disconnects. By far the biggest stumbling block right nowis the lack of dedicated servers on consoles. Instead, after the minutes-long matchmaking process, a player from the groupis randomly chosen to host the match, and if they quit, there is no hostmigration  instead everyone is kicked out to the main screen. There are fewermassive buzzkills than finally getting your chance to play as Jason, only tohave your killing spree cut short by a sore loser.Thatsaid, I have a hard time blaming the quitters. The 20-minute time limit feelsexcruciatingly long if you die or escape early in a match. One lucky player mayget to rejoin the action as a shotgun-toting Tommy Jarvis if the other playerscan locate the radio and call for backup, but everyone else is stuck spectating,and the game holds your biggest XP gains hostage to keep you from quitting. Spectatingcan be fun when you're cheering on friends or watching tense encounters, but notwhen a single counselor insists on running down the clock in a random closetsomewhere. That's a viable strategy, since counselors win if time runs out.Sometimes massive glitches can doom a match to the max limit, like counselors mysteriouslybeing rendered invincible or hovering above the battleground far out of Jason'sreach. Even the most thrilling victory is undermined by 10 minutes of mandatorydowntime as you wait to reap your rewards.Even ifpatches can smooth out Friday the 13th's technical and pacing issues, the gameneeds more content to keep players coming back for the long haul. Character progressionis relegated to acquiring randomly generated perks, but many are virtually useless,like a three-percent speed increase for driving the game's cars (which controllike crap), or the ability to barricade doors quicker, even though the act onlytakes a second anyway. Unlocking custom kills for Jason is more enticing, butaside from some varying stats, all incarnations use the same powers. After someminor experimenting, I felt little desire to try out the different Jasons orcouncilors I had unlocked. Friday the 13th also only features three maps, all ofwhich are similar-looking camps and feature the same methods of escape. Morelocation and objective variety would go a long way toward keeping playersengaged  even Jason branched out beyond Crystal Lake in the subsequent films.At itsbest, Friday the 13th is a compelling multiplayer experience that captures theexcitement and terror of going against one of the most notorious movie monstersand (hopefully) living to tell about it. At its worst, the game is afrustrating trial of patience, whether you're waiting out the clock or dealingwith numerous technical issues. The fact that I want to keep playing is atestament to the strength of its core gameplay, but not an excuse. Friday the13th desperately needs fixes to its visuals, controls, and server problems, andif it wants to survive in the multiplayer space for very long, it needs morecontent. I hope IllFonic can deliver; as with the movies, I'm rooting forJason.This review pertains to thePlayStation 4 version of the game. Friday the 13th is also available on XboxOne and PC.", "date": "Jun 02, 2017", "grade": "6"}
