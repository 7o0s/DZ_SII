The SNES version replaced the gore with sweat, but wasgraphically superior to the bloody Sega Genesis port. Guess which oneeverybody liked? Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 is the SNES version in this case,replacing spraying blood with blue smoke while adding co-op play,streamlining the gameplay, and introducing new chapters and characters.With all these great advances, why did Tecmo give bloodthirsty gamersan excuse to blow off this edition? Its still rated M, so whatsreally gained out of this decision? While the dried pools ofblood may disappoint some, Sigma 2 features many gameplay improvements.The bow and arrow has unlimited ammo so you no longer have to collectarrows, plus the streamlined controls make shooting way more appealing.Its nice not having to track down keys to open locked doors, andtheres a nice path indicator you can bring up if you get lost. Whileit stinks that youre blocked from maxing your weapons completely untillate in the game, at least you dont have to spend orbs on them anymore(you just choose one per level).Rachel, Momiji, and Ayanes newchapters are a fun diversion from Ryus quest and offer a chance toexperiment with different play styles and alternate bosses. It isslightly lame, however, that these environments are mostly backwardversions of Ryus stages. The co-op mode is a large collection ofplotless arena missions featuring waves of enemies and various bosscompilations. Be sure to beat the main game before you delve into thismode or you wont have any weapons or bonus characters. Unfortunately,team play is online only; otherwise youre stuck with an AI bot.Sigma2 is a longer, more action-packed edition of Ninja Gaiden II, and ifyouve never played the original you wont notice the missing gore.", "date": "Sep 30, 2009", "grade": "8.5"}
