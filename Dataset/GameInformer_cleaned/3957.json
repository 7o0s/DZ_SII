Thoughthe PC release relies on mouse and keyboard controls, the game has leapt toXbox One with full gamepad support and a new streamlined menu system. Theresult is the premier city simulation game on consoles.Disregardingthe new controls and revamped menu system, this is largely the game thatgarnered so much acclaim in 2015. Starting with a small, single-road town andbuilding up to a bustling metropolis is just as addictive as ever. I loveselecting the perfect plot of land and trying to plan my roads, electricalinfrastructure, and sewage systems efficiently from the start. Watching yourcity steadily grow as you stave off bankruptcy and other unexpected hardshipsis still as satisfying as gaming accomplishments come.The bigquestion with regards to the transition to Xbox One was with how the controlswould work on a gamepad. The ease with which I built a huge, sprawling city isimpressive, and a testament to how much thought the developers put into thecontrols. On Xbox One, each individual build menu is placed on a hotbar at thebottom of the screen, which is accessible using the d-pad. Once you selectsomething you want to build like a road or firehouse, you easily use the left analogstick to place it.Thanksto the snap-on mechanics that already existed with Cities: Skylines, using theanalog stick to connect roads, electric lines, and water pipes is simple. Ofcourse, as with any snap-on system, the game can sometimes estimate where youare trying to place a piece incorrectly, but with the zoom functionality placedon the gamepad's triggers, it's simple and intuitive to zoom in to get extradetailed with your placement of buildings, zones, and other structures.If youwant to dig deeper into the more detailed menus like economy and policies, aswell as purchase new plots of land, you just hold the Y button and it brings upa wheel menu that allows you to easily select one of those options. Once inthere, you use the bumpers to navigate to the different screens within thatmenu. Because of this, it's simple to bounce between the taxes, budget, loads,and income/expenses screens within the economy menu.Unfortunately,this version is missing a key feature from the original game. You're able toclick the analog stick to pause time, but you cannot speed up the simulation.On several occasions, I stepped away while the game was running to let mypopulation and money accumulate, where in the PC version I could simply speedup time.Thisedition includes the After Dark expansion, which adds new specializations,transportation options, a day/night cycle, and more to the base game.Unfortunately, this package does not include the other expansions that havecome to PC, like Snowfall and Natural Disasters, which is a major missedopportunity for this to be considered the definitive version.Someannoying performance-based bugs hindered the base game, but those have been largelysquashed in the two years leading up to this version's release. Outside of afew minor hiccups in the framerate, my city's rise to prominence and inevitableout-of-control death-spiral played out without any major technical problems.Outsideof the lack of the more recent PC expansions and the simulation speed options,Cities: Skylines - Xbox One Edition is every bit as good as its PC counterpart.The mayoral planning fantasy is still intact with this version, and now easierthan ever to get into. Simply put, if you're an Xbox One owner who is a fan ofcity-building simulation games, you need to check out Cities: Skylines.", "date": "Apr 21, 2017", "grade": "8.5"}
