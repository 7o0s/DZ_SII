With your gaze and efforts focused on the front line, a single zombie slipped through the cracks on your south wall and gained access to your hapless colonists.

In moments, your once-great city lies in ashes. What do you do? Start again, of course! This time, youll be ready.They Are Billions has a challenging, randomized loop that places you as master and commander of a fledgling city in a variety of environments.

The campaigns lack of appeal is mostly forgivable given the vast replayability of the survival mode, but you shouldnt pick this game up in the hopes of a compelling journey.They Are Billions is an interesting mashup of classic RTS, tower defense, and survival that successfully conjures up that one more game feel, assuming you can persevere through countless defeats.Check out our review of the console edition of the game here.", "date": "Jul 23, 2019", "grade": "8"}
