Too bad for them. Not because their gripes aren'tlegitimate  after all, they can't play MW2 the way they'd prefer to  but because the game is outstanding regardless.As expected, PC Modern Warfare 2 is nearly identical to its consolebrothers. The action is brilliant, the presentation is unmatched, and thecontent is extensive. There is no reason to consider this an inferiorport, nor is it better than the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions except in thedelightful precision of mouse aiming.I hate to break it to the angry hordes, but my experience withmultiplayer via IWnet's console-like matchmaking was smooth andlag-free. Host migration ensures that a dropped connection doesn't endthe round for everyone, and I had no trouble finding solid games forany playlist. I never felt like latency was an issue; having a matchesbe player-hosted rather than a dedicated server machine didn't causeany noticeable problems.Established clans are undoubtedly annoyed at not being able to runtheir own servers the way they'd like, but I encountered plenty of clanteams that had no problems owning the hell out of the matches theyjumped into. On the other hand, for a player without a regular group,being able to jump into matchmaking and get a reasonably balanced gamegoing with no hassles is awfully nice.In an ideal world, Infinity Ward would patch in some kind of dedicatedserver support so that everyone can have what they want. I have a hardtime complaining about a game as outstanding as Modern Warfare 2,though, even if its online implementation doesn't please all of itsenormous fanbase.", "date": "Nov 13, 2009", "grade": "9.75"}
