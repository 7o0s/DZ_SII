No,Double Dragon II isn't a sequel to Neon. It's a remake of the original arcadegame in which Billy and Jimmy took a break from their blue and red outfits andinvented the legendary hurricane kick. It's also darker than the first DoubleDragon. Here Marian gets shot dead at the beginning instead of kidnapped.In this new interpretation, players fight as Marian for a fewminutes before she's killed (the second co-op player has to sit and watch), andthen the Lee brothers take over. They look like complete tools and all of theenemies are completely generic with zero personality whatsoever. Instead ofkeeping attacks on a traditional horizontal plane, 8-way fighting makes thecombat feel sloppy and cheap. You may be able to punch at guys in alldirections, but it also leaves you open to attack from all of those angles(instead of just from the left and right).Extremely basic punch and kick combos join an elbow and blockfor the core moveset. Even if you try to work with the mechanics by timing anice block and counter attack on one foe, some other idiot will always bearound to kick you in the head from another angle. Holding down the righttrigger will initiate power attacks, but they sure don't feel all thatdifferent outside of slowing things down briefly. The dodge move doesn't workconsistently, rendering it useless. Why didn't the devs think to put dodging onthe completely unused right stick?Simply turning around in this game is a hassle as yourcharacter does a backstep first before finally performing a 180. This may notsound that bad, but precision is everything in a brawler, and there's nojustification for this clunky choice. Special moves like the spin kick,fireball, and super combo try to bring in a Double Dragon feel, but how manyyou can perform - and how long it'll be until you can do it again - is poorlycommunicated. To top it all off, if you use any of these special moves in thegame, you get the bad ending.The 15 stages are stretched out concepts of the original fourlevels (heliport, lumber warehouse, farm, and hideout). It's a never-endingstring of boring, ugly environments with the same reused character modelsthrown at you over and over. Sometimes the beatings are broken up with suchintriguing tasks like mashing on buttons to keep an elevator moving or tryingto jump over a pit of acid. I thought the core fighting was bad, but anyattempt at reaching outside this comfort zone results in activities even moreuninteresting or infuriating. The new take on the runaway farm equipmentsection will really boil your blood, since it works horribly and also sends youback to a checkpoint instead of resurrecting you on the spot as the game doesat all other times.Outside of the core story mode lies the useless survival andversus modes. Here you can fight more waves of idiot goons or battle yourfriend as the Lee bros, Marian, or some guy named Jeff. The only online elementof the game is leaderboard functionality, so don't get excited about teaming upwith or fighting against players from around the world.There are absolutely no redeeming qualities to Double DragonII. The only people I can recommend this to are gamers that enjoy hate-playingthe worst stuff just to make fun of it or Double Dragon fans who can't help butplay every release no matter how terrible.", "date": "Apr 05, 2013", "grade": "3"}
