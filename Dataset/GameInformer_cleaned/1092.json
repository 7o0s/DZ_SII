You can see it in an owner's mode that changes little of how you run a franchise. It's also evident in the game's second stab at a physics model that produces tackles and hits that you would have never seen before, but which often inexplicably do not accurately take into account the mass of the players involved. These collisions are also at the whim of AI that have a hard time identifying targets to block, angles to take to a tackle, and sometimes even the awareness to trigger a tackle animation when the ball carrier is near.Madden 25 does achieve a modicum of competency  and even excellence. Another year with the Infinity engine has paid noticeable dividends in the kinds of tackles seen, despite the work needed to produce consistent outcomes in player contact. Still, the inconsistency has me pining for an unambiguous step forward such as last year's revamped passing game and the birth of Connected Careers.I hoped the return of owner functionality in Connected Franchises would be that advancement, but its revenue and fan happiness NFL ranking system is confusing (how could my Team Success rating get lower after going deep into the playoffs?) and, in the end, didn't matter. Even with a seemingly toxic combination of a bad stadium, a losing team, and high prices, I still could sign players and renovate my stadium. I like the fact that your team funds correlate directly to how much of a signing bonus you can offer players, the staff you hire, and the state of your stadium, but there are other franchise/money-related features that are still missing. These omissions include being able to offer different contract options to players and restricted free agency.These latter two points may be relatively insignificant, but the franchise mode still hasn't recovered all of the features that were previously purged, and presents limited choices such as not being able to negotiate rookie or in-season free agent contracts. Minute details like this are wrapped in larger-scale oddities such as a menu system that still buries or omits info.Madden's next-gen debut is certainly better than when the series first appeared for the last generation, but there's still plenty of work to be done.THE EDGEMadden NFL 25 on the PS4 is not a carbon copy of the current-gen version, although the game is also not leagues better to warrant buying it a second time.PresentationThe games graphics look pretty good and the play is smooth. Much has been made of the next-gen versions ability to render all the players and camera people on the sidelines, but I didnt find this very additive. Players on the sidelines will nominally move out of the way if a player is steaming out of bounds, but they are still rather stiff and lifeless figures.As good as the player models are, their uniforms surprisingly dont pick up dirt or grass stains. It is cool, however, to see clumps of turf get kicked up by players cleats.OffenseBall carriers showcase some fancy footwork that heightens their foot planting and change of pace, and yet movements still feel smooth. Perhaps the fact that players sometimes anticipate contact and in those moments gamers lose control split-seconds before a tackle is related to this. I also noticed players momentum caused them to drift out of bounds, and as often as they were cognizant enough to plant their feet inbounds on a sideline catch, theyd inexplicably step out of bounds. On the flip side, I felt that tackling was easier in this version of Madden 25.Elsewhere on offense, the blocking on the second level remains suspect, and running backs staying in to help block produces some laughable moments as their bodies fold and flop in unnatural ways.DefensePassing against defenses is tougher, with defenders being more active on the ball than your still too-passive receivers. I even saw some instances where defensive backs suspiciously broke on passes before they had good sight of it.Mid-Game SavingFinally! Although you wont see an option for it in the in-game pause menu, if you hit the PlayStation button on your controller during a game and then turn off the system, when you return the game will let load where you left off  down, distance, and everything.LoadingProgressing your Connected Franchise from week to week takes about the same amount of time as it does in the current-gen version, and scrolling through the stories from around the league is a little better.The PS4 Touchpad ButtonThis doesnt do much. On offense you can swipe your players in motion, but if you think this is cool, youre too easily impressed.PS4 Remote Play With VitaSince the bumper and trigger buttons are mapped to the touchpad on the back of the Vita, this is a less-than-ideal way to play the game. The Vita is not used as a second screen.PlayStation CameraThe game does not support the PlayStation Camera.", "date": "Nov 18, 2013", "grade": "7.75"}
