GrandKingdom is paving its own way, ditching grid-based combat, offering a bevy ofcustomization, and putting more action into the combat. It does a wonderfuljob, and I enjoyed the challenging battles, building up my party, and competingonline. The game hasa single-player campaign that serves as your introduction to the title and allits intricacies. This is a hefty time investment and worth engaging in to buildup your party. The plot is basic, mainly about how the continent of Resonail,which is made up of four nations, has erupted into war. The lure to GrandKingdom isn't its story, however, it's the gameplay and party-building, and thecampaign delivers on those fronts, giving you fun missions and battles.In GrandKingdom, you put together a team of four mercenaries with classes of yourchoosing. Every time you step into a mission or quest, it's set up like a boardgame, where you move your piece around the field. This can trigger battles orrandom events, but treasure and resources are also planted across the field.You have a set amount of steps you can take with each map before it's gameover, but the allotment is generous. The board is littered with obstacles, anddepending on your party selection, certain field skills can help you get aroundthem. For instance, I had a wind skill that could take away any bad weatherinstantly, which normally would take three turns to clear up.Journeyingthe board to find the optimal path has its own interesting dilemmas, but thebattle system is also stellar. In combat, you have three lanes where your partyand enemies can be moved. Character placement can mean life or death; you usuallywant your tanks up front and your ranged members in the back, but you also haveto make decisions in the heat of battle, such as getting them out of the way ifthey're vulnerable to a canon or a charged attack. You can see the turn orderand what's incoming to help you strategize. Deciding which enemies to attack firstcan be make or break. Do you want to focus on deadly mages right in your vicinityor are you better off eliminating the leader to lower the opponent's morale,affecting their action and move gauge?Encountersare a cross between turn-based and action gameplay, forming one of my favoritestrategy/RPG battle systems of recent years. Every character has an actiongauge for movement and attacks. For melee characters, you want to repeatedlypress the corresponding button to combo up attacks when near enemies. Forranged characters, it's all about timing and hitting the attack button as ameter displays on the enemy. In both cases, characters can knock opponents inthe air or hit them into objects (or even each other) for more damage. Usingthe environment to your advantage is fun, and I like the skill involved in howyou execute your attacks. Battles have surprising variety in how they play out,and there's nothing like lining up an attack and having it kill multipleenemies as they fly into each other. But also beware of your own characters'positions, because they can take friendly damage. Sometimes it might meanletting a party member get severely wounded for the greater good.Outside oftaking on missions, some of the most fun I had was building up my party withthe breadth of customization the game offers. The class variety is diverse,featuring everything from a dragon mage to an arcanist, and you choose theirskills, allocating experience points, and equipping them with gear you can buyor create. As a cool feature, all the gear you equip shows up visibly on yourparty, so you can put everything from clown noses to mummy wraps on them.I loved allthe options to consider for my characters. You have four main attacks, pluspassive skills and support skills. How this continues to expand as you level upis exciting, since your team earns skills, but you can also purchase some, suchas healing and poison resistance. A lot of the skills are appealing and can begame-changers, so you're constantly making tough choices of what skill you canlive without.While thebattle system thrives, the backdrops, especially in combat, do nothing to helpit. I noticed the scenery was similar in every encounter, making them lackexcitement. Maps can also take a while to complete, and in the campaign yousometimes have three boss battles in succession. Dying at the end of the mapcan mean losing a lot of progress. No save points exist during the maps, whichmakes sense because you can back yourself into a corner with the resourcemanagement, but these game overs are frustrating nonetheless.Theexperience also gets repetitive in other ways. In and outside of the campaign,you're grinding to improve your party at every turn, though you do havedifferent types of quests to negate some of the tedium. Your level carries overwhen you take your party online, where you form a contract with one of the fournations vying for domination. You can pick a specific number of wars to support,and depending on your choices, shops and trade posts of rival nations won't beavailable to you. However, you do get access to perks in these areas from yournation. Wars play out daily, and you can choose to manually control your troopsor let the A.I. control your party. I did both. When I went to bed at night, Iset the A.I. control, so I'd wake up with extra experience, items, and gold inthe morning. Other times, I wanted to see how I stacked up to the competitionand manually controlled my party for battles, which was exciting because I sawopponents use strategies I never considered. You can also level up your partyby taking on quests against the computer with specific objectives, such asmaking deliveries or defending areas. You can even just explore an area with noobjective to find treasure and gather resources for crafting.Despite allthese options, my engagement drastically declined after a few days of playingfaithfully. Even if the conditions are slightly different, you're still doingthe same thing: battles on repeat and roaming similar maps. Plus, even when Isupported a nation, I felt like a drop in the bucket; my efforts did not havemuch influence in its success or failure, so playing against others lost itsallure after a while. The rewards online are also disappointing; while you getitems and money, nothing I received was grand enough to keep me coming back.Grand Kingdom is a solid strategy/RPG,especially if you've been hankering for something new and different. I aminterested to see where the series goes in the future. It feels like it has asolid foundation, and I'd love to see that expanded with even more reasons tostick around after you polish off the campaign and play some online matches.Even so, the game is entertaining, and strategy fans should appreciate all thedecisions it puts in their hands.", "date": "Jul 02, 2016", "grade": "8"}
