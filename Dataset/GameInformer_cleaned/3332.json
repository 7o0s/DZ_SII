{"name": "Darksiders Genesis", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/review/darksiders-genesis/darksiders-genesis-review-exodus-of-excitement", "text": "Darksiders is a shape-shifting franchise. The original game offered a fun mix of combat andpuzzle dungeons, like a fusion of God of War and The Legend of Zelda. Darksiders II added Diablo-inspired loot into that equation. When Darksiders III released in 2018, it incorporated elements of From Software's Souls games. Darksiders' experimentationcontinues with Genesis, a co-op friendly, top-down action game. For this prequel, Developer Airship Syndicate repackagesmany of Darksiders' signature aspects into a new container just in time for the holidays, but this delivery is filled with more packing peanuts than presents.From the start, Genesis allows up to two players to controlStrife andWar (solo players canfreely switch between the two). Each character feels impressively uniquein combat.War is a slow-moving, close-quarters tank, withmanysword combos reminiscent of his abilities from the original Darksiders. In contrast, Strife darts around the battlefield and rains fire from the barrels of his twin pistols. I enjoythe mix of abilities that both horsemen provide, and Genesis generally succeeds atemulatingDarksiders' fast-paced action from anew camera perspective.The joys of combat quickly turn to anguish as the difficulty escalates. War and Strife level up by equipping creature cores, which boost your horsemens strength and health pools. Cores alsooffer other added bonuses, such as giving your attacks a chance to restore your health. Unfortunately,these enemy cores drop randomly, which means you can fight entire enemy hordes without a guaranteed reward. The problems with this system are exacerbated when you need to grind for cores  and you will need to grind. Each level has a recommended power rank, and thoserequirements quickly outpaced my horsemens' abilities. This forced me to return to old levels (or a repeatable combat area) to tear through endless fodder in the hopes of finding more cores  an incredibly soul-sucking process.Genesis offers some respitewith a handful of environmental puzzles. In co-op, these puzzles ask War and Strife to work together to throw a series of switches, or use their unique skills to send electrical orbs across the room to power ancient artifacts. In single-player, these puzzles require a little more legwork,sinceyou have to use bombs to trigger multiple timed switches or make use of other environmental tricks to navigate a space. Whether solo or with a friend, Genesis puzzles are never mentally taxing, but I was usually thankful for a break in the action.The biggest shift for Darksiders Genesis is its fixedoverhead camera. The view makes it easier for friends to play together, but it also means the action feels distant and less intense. More importantly, large environment objects(like trees andcliffs walls)can come between you and the camera, obscuring your view of the action. The environment itself is also a pain to navigate, sincefew onscreen markers pointyou forward, and the map doesnt display your exact position. At times, I was confused about where to go, andwhen I turned to the map to gain my bearings, I only felt more lost.Genesis narrative also left me disoriented. Most of the events of the Darksiders series have revolved around the war between the kingdoms of heaven and hell, which ultimately lay waste to the planet Earth. However, Genesis is set before the events of the previous games and deals primarily with the political affairs between the horsemen and a few demonic figures, which ultimately adds little to the Darksiders universe. This lackluster story feels like a missed opportunity, especially since its the first chance fans have had to control the horseman Strife. Unfortunately, Strifes constantly jokey demeanor is off-putting, and the dialogue between him and the stoic War feels forced.Overall, Darksiders Genesis fails to take advantage of the series' strengths. Since Darksiders inception, fans have imagined what it might be like to team up as the different horsemen. Darksiders Genesis finally offers aco-op experience, but its offbeat design and forgettable story don't deliver on the fantasy.", "date": "Dec 04, 2019", "grade": "6.5"}
