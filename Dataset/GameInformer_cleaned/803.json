Thanks to the indie-gamerevolution, we're now blessed with myriad studios breaking from the norm. CountMetrico developer Digital Dreams among this group. This puzzle game isbrilliantly realized. Using charts, bar graphs, and line graphs as a basicdesign language, Digital Dreams weaves bewitching and surreal environments.Coupled with a chilly ambient electronic score, the game is triumph ofminimalist design. The levels contain small visual cues, some intended to aidand others to deceive; it's the rare game where every detail feels methodicallyplaced.The gameplaystarts out simply, as the goal is always the same: Advance your onscreencharacter past the various moving platforms and obstacles to get to the nextscreen. The levels can be manipulated with proportional movements or action;jumping might raise one platform and lower another, while another stretches andshrinks as you run from side to side.At its best,Metrico is one of the best puzzle games I've played in ages, forcing you toreexamine your assumptions about how the world works and how you're supposed toapproach a given challenge. If something seems impossible, it's because you'renot looking at it the right way -which generates those ~a-ha!~ momentsthat are the true appeal of the genre.Metrico wasdesigned specifically for the Vita, something that sometimes enhances - butoften hinders - the experience. I like the way the game layers on mechanics asyou progress; I just wish they were more polished. You start being able to dolittle more than jump and move, but eventually gain the ability to shoot smallprojectiles (and aim them with the Vita's back touch panel, which can befrustrating at times). Puzzles that use the Vita's tilt functionality andcamera are shaky at best and aggravating at worst. The tilt puzzles frequentlyhad me twisting my neck to view the game as I rotated the system 90 degrees ormore. Toward the end, a mechanic is added that requires you to use the Vitacamera to move platforms, but it's hard to use and confusing. I believe it hasto do with overall light exposure and red, green, and blue colors. You're goingto have to experiment on your own, because the game often doesn't explain thesenew mechanics. I found a system that worked for me that involved pointing thecamera at combinations of my coffee mug, desktop, and office window -andI still couldn't tell you exactly how it all worked.While I lovethat Metrico doesn't hold your hand, there were times when I felt I could haveused a bit more to hang on to -especially the levels where some of theon-screen ~hints~ are actually obfuscating the true course of action. However,for every moment of frustration, there were greater feelings of pride and thethrill of discovery. Metrico isn't a perfect game, but it's one worth playingfor fans of the puzzle games. The fact that it has one of the most ingeniousart styles of the year is only icing on the cake.", "date": "on Aug 05, 2014", "grade": "7.75"}
