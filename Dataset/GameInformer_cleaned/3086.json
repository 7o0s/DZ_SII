Robocalypse relies on action flags (marks players position on the battlefield to give your troops general orders) to circumvent this problem. It's a workable solution, but not nearly as thrilling since the game ends up doing most of the work for you.Robocalypse's story is penned by the talent behind SpongeBob Squarepants, but the game's slapstick narrative, about World War II veterans possessing robot soldiers, is in no danger of being funny. With smarter AI and more diverse challenges, this title would be worth noting. As it stands, Robocalypse merely exists.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "7"}
