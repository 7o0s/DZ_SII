While Callahan istrying to build his, Grid has one to maintain. The series has been absent foralmost five years, and some of its key elements such as multi-disciplineracing, flashbacks, and a certain slickness and sense of style have been usedby other racing titles. Time may have moved on, but my expectation for the Gridseries to remain at the forefront of the genre has not changed. Grid 2 retainsmuch of what made the first alluring, but falls short of pushing racing gamesforward like the original.The WSR (World Series Racing) league is the wrapper for thesingle-player experience, and your mission is to help it gain prominence byrecruiting different racing clubs (by beating them in races, naturally) fromaround the globe who specialize in various race events to gain theirparticipation in subsequent seasons of the WSR. In turn, these areamalgamations of the different racing types (like elimination, Touge, one-oneFaceoffs, checkpoint, etc.). You progress by earning fans for the WSR, whichare gained through races and special promo events that present other modes likethe fun Overtake races (where you try and pass as many slower trucks on thetrack as you can).The WSR experience may be punctuated by special in-studio ESPN segments,a garage operation that grows with you, and sponsorship requirements, but theactual act of growing the league isn't the strong motivator that it's supposedto be. Racing in the league itself feels repetitive by the time you get throughthe club recruiting process, and when the WSR season racing starts, youropponents' clubs don't really matter. The league is supposed to be aboutdetermining who the best racer on the planet is, but it lacks the storyline andgeneral sports drama to make that search compelling. Perhaps includingsituational races (like going worst to first or nursing a limping car to a winover the last two laps) would have helped.Grid 2's LiveRoutes system  where upcoming junctions arepopulated on the fly to avoid track repetition  helps alleviate the lackof drama, and is where this game shines. Not having a mini map during theseraces elevates the heart rate a few beats and puts your racing abilities to thetest. LiveRoute races make you balance the instinct to be cautious because youdon't know what's around the next corner with the urge to drive as fast as youcan.Further diversity occurs in the multiplayer, which lets yougenerate a playlist of races and includes new matchmaking for racers to tellyou who races naughty versus nice. It also also contains Codemasters' free,account-based RaceNet platform. This generates weekly rivals and challenges,keeps track of stats, and has a browser component. Like in the single-player,vehicles are grouped in four tiers, but these unlock as you attain higherlevels, and the cars themselves can be upgraded (unlike single-player).I like that Grid 2's multiplayer carrot tastes slightlydifferent than the single-player one, but ultimately the game  apart from theLiveRoutes system  isn't the revelation that I was hoping for.Codemasters has proven that it can deliver a compelling racing experience onthe track, but we'll have to keep on waiting for the next big leap forward.", "date": "May 28, 2013", "grade": "8.25"}
