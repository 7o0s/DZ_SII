To celebrate the release of the films sequel, THQ is delivering a wide array of gameplay experiences based on each console's unique offerings for Kung Fu Panda 2. For the Xbox 360 version, the team at Griptonite Games puts players under the instruction of the films protagonist, Po, to master a variety of kung fu techniques with the help of Kinects full body tracking capabilities. Unfortunately as I kicked, punched, and dodged my way through hordes of enemies during Kung Fu Panda 2s combat sequences, I found myself battling the controls and overall tedium above all else. In Kung Fu Panda 2 on Xbox 360, Po and the Furious Five are tasked to save kung fu from a slew of vile creatures and its up to players to learn the art of kung fu to successfully engage in controller-free skirmishes against these goons. As you punch, block, dodge, kick, and punch in front of Kinect, your actions translate onscreen as you watch Po lay the smackdown on enemies. While it works well in training sequences, execution falls to the wayside on the battlefield. There is a noticeable delay between action and execution, which is especially harmful in later combat sequences where timed dodges are key for survival. Kung Fu Panda 2 also makes use of voice commands to call upon members of the Furious Five for special attacks when prompted, and in these scenarios voice detection is equally unreliable. Mix these detection issues with lack of checkpoints in longer combat sequences later on in the game and youve got yourself a recipe for frustration. Unfair deaths due to inconsistent tracking await. Youll be forced to pummel a large group of crocodiles multiple times over despite your exhaustion.To break up the monotony of combat sequences, Kung Fu Panda 2 includes a series of minigames that range from rickshaw races to tossing bowls of food toward hungry villagers. Rickshaw racing is similar to one of the minigames youll find in Kinect Adventures. Youll race against an AI opponent on, you guessed it, a rickshaw while ducking, jumping, and swaying side to side to dodge obstacles. The body detection worked fairly well during this welcome diversion, though I cant say the same about some of the other minigames. For instance in a noodle serving minigame, villagers request noodle bowls in different colors and its up to you to pick up the appropriately colored bowl, mix the ingredients with exaggerated arm movements, and toss the bowl to the patron who ordered it. The sensor was unable to accurately detect arm movements so most of the time Id pick up a bowl of the wrong color, and to make matters worse, there was no way to properly aim, so plenty of bowls never made it to the poor hungry villagers. Kung Fu Panda 2 may win over fans on the cinematic front, but I cant say the same about its Kinect counterpart. Kung Fu Panda 2s charming cast of characters do a great job of moving the Kinect titles story mode along, however lag in full body combat sequences and noticeable lack of polish in minigames do little in making the user feel like the ultimate kung fu master.", "date": "zalez on May 24, 2011", "grade": "5"}
