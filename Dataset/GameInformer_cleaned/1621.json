Lee thought he was headed for a life of cement floors and barred windows, but in the blink of an eye, everything changed. Thats an apt metaphor for the latest entry in Telltales apocalyptic adventure series. Episode Three is a chain of events that irrevocably alters the lives of Lee and his fellow survivors. By the end of Episode Two, Lee and his compatriots have transformed a roadside motel into a home. A family of hicks with a taste for blood temporarily threatens their safety, but after Lee deals with that immediate hazard, a more ominous threat looms silently over this band of survivors. This threat surfaces in Episode Three, but not in a way you would suspect. The Walking Deads cast of characters continues to clash, betray, accuse, and fight one another. This volatile group dynamic is partially what makes this series so engrossing. Walking Dead Episode Three is a well-crafted emotional roller coaster; at points in the game Ill found myself hating one or more of the characters, but 10 minutes later, I couldnt help but sympathize with them. The Walking Deads story also revolves around player choices. I dont feel like any of my choices have drastically altered the overarching direction of the story, but its thrilling to see decisions I made in earlier episodes resurface and add some color to Telltales narrative. The storytelling is so engaging that it almost makes up for The Walking Deads lack of gameplay. This series is story-heavy, and nothing has changed with Episode Three. If anything, this episode has a diminished focus on puzzles and exploration. Episode Three is well-paced; you have time to breathe and appreciate the story before the action picks up again. After a dramatic story sequence youre usually shuffled off to find a certain item or solve a simple puzzle, but I wish these puzzles were a little more involved or creative. You track down clues to uncover who is raiding the camps supplies, or rummage around an abandoned train in order to start its engine, but these moments are little more than item hunts. Once youve found the key item, you unlock the next chapter of the story. Episode Threes biggest problem might be how it handles its action sequences. This episode ramps up the action a bit, and this fits well with its story, but Telltales approach to combat doesnt work during frantic brawls. Zombies shamble forward after the cursor moves over them, so in the split second it took me to move my thumb from the analog stick to the face buttons, my target would sometimes move out from under my crosshairs. This janky combat system resulted in a few cheap restarts.These complaints dont ruin Episode Three, but I hope they are addressed and that Telltale changes its approach to action before the release of Episodes Four and Five. The gameplay has some rough edges, but as an interactive story, this is an experience that shouldnt be missed.[Catch up on what you missed by reading by reviews for Episode One and Episode Two.]", "date": "Aug 31, 2012", "grade": "8.5"}
