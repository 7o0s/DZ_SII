Even so, one universal truth remains: Relationships are hard. Cibeleis an honest look at Internet communication, love, and sex. The tale is highlypersonal, but it evokes an eerie feeling of dj vu. You've probably had asimilar experience or know someone who has formed a bond this way. Cibele is unlike anything I've played. The story unfolds inpieces as you read emails, look at photos, and play games on a personalcomputer in 2009. The narrative is split into three acts (taking around twohours total), allowing you to check the computer for new files to see how therelationship has grown between two characters: Nina and Blake. Each act has you logging in to a fictional MMORPG,mindlessly attacking monsters as you listen to the voice chat. The MMO actionis simple and effective; you click on enemies to auto-attack, and you don'thave a health meter to worry about. This conveys the automatic process that MMOplayers develop without getting bogged down in mechanics. Plus, it lets youfocus on the dialogue between the two main characters. These exchanges getprogressively more flirtatious and revealing, leading to sexy photo exchangesand more innuendo. Watching the relationship unfold is exciting as you'rewondering just how much further it will go - it has a ~will they or won'tthey?~ appeal. Cibele's biggest strengths are that it's raw and honest. Thenarrative is based on a true story, and developers Nina Freeman and EmmettButler play the roles of the main characters in the live-action scenes. Thelive-actions scenes and voice chat conversations play out naturally, making theexperience feel all the more real. This story is Freeman's, and she putsherself out there, showing her class poetry assignments, personal photos, andold website templates. At times, you almost feeling like you're invading herprivacy because it gets so intimate. Freeman lets you get a glimpse into herlife that most people would hide under lock and key, which is admirable - butat the same time, it makes me feel voyeuristic.My favorite moments are when the two converse in the MMO'sprivate chat, discussing everyday topics at first and eventually going deeper. Manypeople form connections playing games together, and Cibele's simulation of thatexperience works well. While playing the MMO and chatting, you get messagesfrom other players and email alerts, putting you in the moment and making itfeel genuine. There's also something to be said about the intimateconversations; the chats start to get more sexual and involved, but you'restill always left wondering just how much these two people revealed about theirreal lives to one another. This mystery kept me hanging on, intrigued to seethe tale through. Unfortunately, the finale doesn't end up as satisfying aswatching the relationship unfold. The ending is abrupt, providing you littleclosure. We see so much of the relationship evolve, but the later part of thearc is missing and left unaddressed. It feels like someone yelled, ~Cut!~ toosoon. I liked how Cibele is set up to explore the digital age andrelationships, but it doesn't let its characters offer much reflection on thesubject matter. In addition, some of the live-action video feels like a missedopportunity to flesh out the characters, since they don't add much to thejourney beyond the growing sexual nature. Games are continuing to evolve. Just like withother media, such as movies and books, various genres are surfacing. Cibeleshows an intriguing direction for games to become representations of theircreators' real lives, almost like confessionals. As we've seen more in recentyears, developers are confronting tougher topics, such as sex, depression, anddeath. This is an enlightening movement that's still in its infancy. Much likeCibele, these early lessons have revealed a few stumbling blocks, but I'm gladthey're happening.", "date": "Nov 02, 2015", "grade": "7.75"}
