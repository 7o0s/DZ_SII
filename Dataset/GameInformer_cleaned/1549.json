Mugen Souls has that potential, but then totally eviscerates it by trying to do too much. From the battle system to the character personalities, everything is dialed up to 11, and not for the better. Multiple personalities are tricky. Just ask main character, Chou Chou, who is set on dominating seven disparate worlds and combining them into one super continent. Shes sassy and she changes her personality on the fly to charm others into being her peons. Obviously, the game doesnt take itself seriously; the characters are kooky, outlandish, and openly talk about their sexual fetishes. If that sounds like your type of party, then Mugen Souls definitely caters to your interests.While seeing characters show some levity is refreshing, the majority of the jokes lack wit, and plenty of the dialogue feels like filler. That being said, characters building a close camaraderie is Mugen Souls most interesting dynamic  theyre a memorable bunch. Unfortunately, theyre so over-the-top, it often leaves them more off-putting than charming.Compile Heart, Mugen Souls developer, is known for creating extremely convoluted battle systems, and Mugen Souls definitely follows suit with its turn-based combat. The game overwhelms by throwing plenty on you from the get-go; in fact, just when you think youve got things figured out, another new aspect is unveiled. If these systems were fun and worthwhile, I wouldnt have a problem. But as it stands, most dont add value to the gameplay. They just tack on unnecessary options that arent deal-breakers for winning, instead of providing fun new additions to battles.Some of these systems are also flat-out broken. Moe kills, where you try to charm the enemy using one of Chou Chous multiple personalities for bonuses, follow an unpredictable pattern. You choose dialogue responses to charm enemies and match Chou Chous personality to the enemys to up your success rate. The issue? Say their personality type is sadist. Youd think being callous would win them over, but if theyre in a bad mood, youre actually supposed to be nice to them. The mismatch doesnt make much sense, but I found it hard to successfully charm enemies even when following their mood as the game instructs you.A similar frustration occurs with ship battles, which are a game of rock, paper, scissors. Here, you must correctly anticipate your enemys next move by their dialogue cues. Initially I loved this mode, but after the third battle, the ship battles stop following a dialogue pattern. Sometimes an enemy would repeat the same dialogue response, but perform a different action. These become matches more about trial-and-error than an opportunity to strategize appropriately. The pill is hard to swallow because these gameplay ideas arent awful. Theyd be fun if they functioned well, but thats far from the case. To add insult to injury, Mugen Souls requires a significant grind, and with the broken battle system this stings tenfold.Some ideas here might have worked well if the developers had honed in on a few systems to perfect. Instead, the game throws so many overwhelming systems at you that many get lost in the shuffle. As much as I like to root for the underdog and want to see niche games catapult to new heights, Mugen Souls needs so much refining that I cant cheer it on.", "date": "Oct 18, 2012", "grade": "5"}
