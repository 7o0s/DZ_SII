Great stories are often defined by what's left to theimagination as much as the events portrayed onscreen. Early on, Naughty Dogconfirmed that Left Behind is a prequel, assuaging my fears that the studio wasgoing to tinker with the perfect, enigmatic ending of the original game.This claim wasmostly true - a large part of the game does take place prior to the events ofThe Last of Us. However, there's also another plotline that hasn't beenrevealed - one that depicts some events that take place during one of theseason changes in the original.The core ofLeft Behind is the fraught relationship between Ellie and Riley, which wasalluded to in the final scene of The Last of Us. Riley, excellently voiced byYaani King, is a great addition to the game's universe, anothertough-but-vulnerable kid like Ellie. As before, some of the best moments arethe quietest; whether taking pictures in a photo booth, dancing in an abandonedbig-box electronics store, or playing an imaginary fighting game at the arcade,Left Behind shows us how life manages to go on even in the worst circumstances.Ellie and Riley are growing up without a net, trying to survive in a hostileworld while dealing with their complex feelings for each other. Once again,Naughty Dog's writing shines, letting our attachment to Riley slowly builduntil the bittersweet conclusion.The other sideof the story is more focused on The Last of Us' frantic combat. Once again,you're pitted against hordes of grotesque ~clickers~ and vicious human cannibals, armedwith a limited arsenal and your wits. For fans of the original, you'll feelright at home -hoarding ammo, sneaking behind cover to strike at yourfoes. The action-oriented parts of Left Behind are engaging, especially the newsequences where you have to battle clickers and humans at the same time. Here,you can use bottles or other distractions to play them against each other; Ifrequently used the enraged clickers to clear the room of the people hunting mebefore using stealth to sneak past.At around twoand a half hours long, it's not an epic experience, but another window intoEllie's life. Instead of blunting the impact as I feared, Riley and Ellie'sstory adds resonance to the original game's ending. For The Last of Us fans,this is a ride well worth taking.", "date": "on Feb 13, 2014", "grade": "8.75"}
