Add Big Bang Mini to that list. Using only the stylus, you move a small globe around the bottom screen, making swiping motions to shoot at the enemies above. The simple mechanics work well, providing an ingratiating twist on the top-down shooter. While it works great for the most part, the more elaborate levels begin to overwhelm the imprecise mechanics, causing confusion and frustration. Still, it's damn fun. Be sure to check the great multiplayer mode.", "date": "on Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
