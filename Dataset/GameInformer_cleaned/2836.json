Tropico 3 is the latest in a string of great titles comingfrom across the pond. This city simulator leverages incredibly detailedpolitical and economic models to create engaging gameplay whilesimultaneously providing a terrific sense of place with its outstandingpresentation. A steep learning curve, limited tutorial, and poordocumentation set a high barrier to entry  which is well worthovercoming in order to experience what Tropico 3 has to offer. Unlikemany city sims, this doesnt worry the player overmuch about creatingcomplex housing districts with access to a set of goods and services inorder to get your citizens to build better, more lucrative dwellings.Tropico concerns you with building an infrastructure that allows yoursubjects to get on with their lives without too much fuss. If yousupply them with jobs and the rudimentary services they need and/orwant, theyll go about their business while you worry about how best tospend their tax dollars. Building the bones of a prosperous society isan entertaining puzzle in itself, but thats only a single gameplayvector.Feeding  The MassesThe campaigns many scenariosoffer varied challenges within Tropicos massively complex set ofinterrelated systems. One mission sees you on an infertile island witha city to feed. You can delay industrialization to build up a fish andlivestock food economy (and very possibly go broke in the process), oraccept an offer of humanitarian aid. Letting those dirty foreigners onyour sovereign soil is a slap in the face to the nationalistic andmilitary factions of your people, though. Plus, a stream of refugees isseeking asylum in your country  more mouths to feed, but youll looklike quite the autocratic *** if you close your borders. Theconstant pressures to make money by exporting goods and to offer betterchurches, schools, and medical care never relent during any of thesecrises.Ruling Tropico requires making a number of big-picturedecisions: what kind of crops to grow, whether to hire trained foreignworkers for specialist jobs or rely on immigration, and the appropriatelevel of kowtowing to U.S. and U.S.S.R. interests are just a fewexamples. A whole slate of edicts that range from mandatory educationto requiring special building permits (which naturally funnel into yourpersonal Swiss bank account) are at your disposal. Shaping domestic andforeign policy via these and other measures is critical to maintaininga stable state. Internal factions like communists, intellectuals, andreligious folks get restive when their interests arent catered to, andgross neglect of your peoples desires will eventually lead to armedrebellion. Its a good thing you thought ahead and kept your generalshappy and guard posts equipped, right?The depth and breadth ofyour options and the systems that they impact goes far beyond thesesimple examples. A well-funded secret police force can identify andmake troublemakers disappear before talk of revolution gets out ofhand. Different crops grow best in certain conditions, and supportdifferent types of industry. Increasing workers wages and improvingtheir working conditions can be a great tool for maintaining order andattracting talent, but comes with a stiff price tag. If you want, youcan even jump into direct control of your avatar and walk among thepeople, put down rebellions firsthand, and give inspiring speeches fromthe palace balcony.This wondrous complexity is not introduced tothe player in a reasonable fashion, though. Expect to restart scenariosoften, as previously unexplained mechanics bite you in the ass. Dontthink that completing the tutorial prepares you for the rigors ofgovernance  youll learn how to read the interface and placebuildings, but thats about it. Tropico 3 is a hard game, evenfor experienced city builders. It never feels unfair, though, andrestarting a level from time to time is hardly the end of the world.Theexpected sandbox mode complements Tropicos excellent campaign, andits exactly what youd expect. All told, one could happily spend asmuch time here as with any top-shelf simulation or strategy game.Anyone who is willing to deal with the games imposing impenetrabilitywill be well rewarded.", "date": "Oct 22, 2009", "grade": "8.75"}
