Gateways is one such game, aptly translating the spatialpuzzles of Valve's hit Portal into a 2D environment. If you think that axingthe third dimension would neuter the challenge of Portal's space-jumping puzzles,fear not; a trio of other portal guns transforms the formula in more mind-blowingways than Valve's own sequel.Gateways gets off to an underwhelming start, in part due toits primitive presentation. The graphics, animations, and sound effects are allbasic, and the story is virtually nonexistent. You play the role of Ed, ascientist who must find a way out of his sprawling laboratory, which is splitup into Metroid-style branches that open up as you gain more powers.Most of the puzzles involve opening doors via a series ofswitches or sensors, and those built for the first gun are easy for Portalveterans. Luckily, each of the three subsequent guns you unlock adds new andunique twists to the formula. The size portal gun allows you to shrink orenlarge your character, the time portal gun lets you travel back in time andcoordinate your actions with your previous self, and the gravity portal gun hasyou flipping the world around.These new abilities have you crisscrossing your laboratoryas you figure out previously impassible puzzles. Remember that pressure plateon the ceiling you couldn't reach? Use the gravity gun to flip your worldupside-down and stroll right up to it. Couldn't figure out how to split a laserto activate two sensors at the same time? Shine it through a time portal, thenjump in after it and use your clone to aim the second beam. Find a door withfour pressure plates? Repeatedly jump back through your time portal until youhave a quartet of clones to hold the door open for you  just make sure youdon't bump into your copies, or you'll rip the fabric of space-time andcollapse the portal.Just when I figured out all of my powers, the game switchedthings up one final time; the last power-up gives you the ability to use multipleportal guns at the same time. Gateways becomes awesomely challenging at thispoint, and the last few puzzles are a mental marathon, requiring you to set upeight different portals simultaneously and orchestrate your movements across anarmy of clones. One puzzle requires you to shrink yourself down, then jumpthrough a gravity portal and run up a wall to trigger a miniature switch  thenenlarge yourself and hightail it back to the time portal before it closes tocreate another clone for the next step in the solution. These are the kinds ofmind-expanding challenges I had hoped to see in Portal 2.As much as I love Gateways, I have a few complaints. I neverreally got used to the disorienting preview effect portals cast, and despite anetwork of shortcuts, I still spent a lot of time backtracking to puzzles Icouldn't complete earlier in the game. Gateways also features only one real enemytype (floating contraptions that you jump on to defeat), and they're rarelyever incorporated into the puzzles. Instead, they're meant to spice up theoccasional platforming sections, but they don't help much. Thankfully,platforming isn't the point.My biggest complaint, however, is that Gateways eventuallyends. While the length of the game is perfectly acceptable (it took me aboutsix hours), I would've gladly stumbled my way through countless more puzzles. Thisaddictive and rewarding gameplay makes recommending Gateways a no-brainer.", "date": "Sep 28, 2012", "grade": "9"}
