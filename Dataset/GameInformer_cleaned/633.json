Whitehills influence is far-reaching, stretching from the Forresters home in Wolfswood to Mira in Kings Landing and across the Narrow Sea to new protagonist Asher in Yunkai. This house is on the brink of collapse, forcing each family member to search feverishly for ways to save it, even if it means crawling into bed with snakes  or worse, the Lannisters. Telltale skillfully pokes and prods at the Forrester bloodline, giving this episode just as much tension and intrigue as the first.Telltale spends most of this episode methodically moving chess pieces across the board to keep the Forresters in a perpetual state of check, despite the family making advantageous moves that show us they are not all just pawns. The plot moves along rapidly, and carries the feeling that every beat of the clock is working against the heroes. Player choice, while not appearing as often as it did the first episode, is used effectively to alter the shape of major moments for the family and its future.This chapter kicks off with our first look at Asher, the exiled son of the late Lord Forrester. Asher appears to be at peace, living life as a sellsword across the sea. We are introduced to him moments before an attack. Asher is cocky and quick-witted, sharing many of the admirable qualities of Jamie Lannister. He has a more colorful personality than most of the prominent characters seen in HBOs television series or George R. R. Martins books. He stands out from the other characters in a good way, delivering more humor and snarky comments than he probably should given the events at hand, but is a likable addition to the roster.The battle we see Asher in, while filled with gore, plays out like a fight sequence in a Pirates of the Caribbean movie, with a little comedy, over-the-top chaos, and timely teamwork between Asher and his partner. The aftermath of the conflict leads Asher and the Forrester family down an interesting path. Like all great episodic series, it leaves you dangling and wanting more.This episode also gives us a look inside House Forrester through a new viewpoint. I wont spoil the surprises that this story brings, but I will say that the choices you are forced to make are wonderfully nerve-wracking, and are crucial to the standing his family has with Lord Whitehill. This character is nicely penned (and voiced) and should make you sweat a little whenever he appears on screen.Miras dangerous dance with the Lannisters continues in this episode, offering plenty of tough decisions to make amid conversations with Tyrion and Margaery that come across a little too manufactured and out-of-character. The final moments of Miras time in this episode are fantastic, giving her story a much-needed direction change that doesnt revolve solely around Lannister mind games.The only character viewpoint that doesnt push the story into interesting new ground is Gareds, the squire who joins the Nights Watch at the Wall. His tale grinds to a halt within seconds of him appearing on screen. You can almost hear Telltales writers saying Hes at the Wall. Now what? as weak conflicts are introduced between Gared and the brothers. Jon Snow makes awkward appearances in this episode, first for a brief Look! Its Jon Snow! celebrity sighting, and then later for a forced conversation with Gared. A tantalizing path is laid out in front of all of the other characters, but Gareds tale seems directionless at this point, even consisting of a moment where he walks over and pets his horse. Im sure Telltale has grand plans for this squire, but they need to get there fast. Gareds sequences muddle an otherwise excellent second chapter, which places the Forresters on even shakier ground than their introduction. Every ray of hope that shines upon them brings a hidden storm cloud that could burst at any given point. The final moments of this episode are beautifully captured, and show us that Telltale is just as skilled at putting heart into sequences as it is stabbing one to death.", "date": "Feb 02, 2015", "grade": "8"}
