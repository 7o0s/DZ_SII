Its easy-to-use toolset forcreating and sharing content has produced over a million user-made tracks,karts, and racers for players to download, putting the offerings of MarioKart's countless iterations to shame. While Road Trip's touchscreen supportmakes fashioning your own creations easier than ever, some old and new misstepsmake playing this handheld version significantly less fun than the original.As with all Vita launch titles, a lot of effort has beenplaced in utilizing the handheld's unique features, primarily the front andback touchscreen panels. A wide range of gestures let you place, resize, androtate objects and decals, lay down and shape roads, and even bank turns withease. You may still want to use the control sticks to fine-tune yourmasterpiece, but the touchscreen lets you work quickly and naturally.The solid controls carry over to gameplay as well. The Vita'ssmall control sticks are responsive, and using the shoulder buttons for the gasand brakes instead of triggers is a non-factor. A number of new weapons (myfavorites being a rockslide that bombards the track with boulders, and theability to transform into a giant snowball and run down your foes) spice upcombat nicely.For every improvement, however, there's a frustrating downside.The developer crafted all-new tracks for Road Trip, but the career mode hasbeen stripped of the cutscenes introducing your rivals and highlighting yourachievements. The announcers also hit the cutting room floor, leaving thecareer mode less of a career, and more of a string of races.After enjoying the first two competitive circuits, theaction quickly takes a turn for the annoying. The later tracks, whileimpressive on a technical and creative level, are packed with so many obstaclesand pitfalls that races devolve into chaos. This pandemonium is compounded bythe worst rubberband AI I've ever seen; I won the overwhelming majority of myraces by just a few tenths of a second, and lost many more at the finish line.There's nothing more frustrating than losing a race at the last moment, thenshaving a dozen-plus seconds off your time - only to be beat at the last secondagain. Having your opponents always on your heels may ratchet up the intensity,but it also requires flawless racing to finish first, which Road Trip'sfrenzied action simply doesn't support. All of this makes racing against thecomputer less fun, which, it turns out, is a big problem.The biggest of Road Trip's drawbacks is inexplicable: There'sno online multiplayer support. You can still create and download user-madecontent - including everything from the PS3 version of the game - but if youwant to race against humans, the best you get is a four-player ad hoc mode, or downloadabletime trial ghosts. Even the PSP version of ModNation Racers has 6-player onlinesupport - what was Sony thinking? Downloading user-made courses is simply notas enjoyable when you can only play them in one-off races against the computer.ModNation Racers remains a bastion for creativity, and I canonly hope its focus on user-made content influences other kart racers and theracing genre as a whole. Road Trip's new touchscreen controls further refinecontent creation, but they aren't a game changer. Unfortunately, the lack of onlinemultiplayer is.Can't decide if you want to purchase Sony's new system? Read our review of the Vita handheld.", "date": "Feb 13, 2012", "grade": "7"}
