Metal Gear,Gradius, Contra, Silent Hill, and Castlevania are the frequent answersto that question, but unless you're a total strategy RPG maniac, it'sunlikely that youll respond with Vandal Hearts. This PlayStationseries debuted in 1996, but has been missing in action since 1999 --and now Konami is resurrecting Vandal Hearts in the form of an XboxLive Arcade and PlayStation Network downloadable game.Vandal Hearts: Flames of Judgment is positioned as a prequel to thePSone games, although the ties are minor at best, buried under thesnooze-inducing weight of a hyper-traditional JRPG plotline. Youcontrol a young band of friends whose idyllic life in a countrysideschool is brought to a halt when -- get this -- bandits attack andpillage their hometown. In a shocking twist, the students set out on ajourney across the land to discover the motivation behind these events,including a betrayal that has them racing to bring down an evilgeneral. If the plot seems on the nose, the combat and leveling system mightas well be smashing players over the head with a club. Though itmaintains the grid-floored, turn-based combat that most strategy RPGsemploy, Flames of Judgment strips down anything that could be mistakenas complex. Unlike the first Vandal Hearts, there are no classes, andyou don't learn new skills by equipping new weapons and armor, as waspossible in the sequel (though you can learn new spells by carryingaround books). Instead, you level up by using whatever skill you want to improve.Want to become better at swordplay? Keep attacking enemies with asword. To be an expert healer, you'll have to cast the Heal spell alot. Even HP increases are gained by taking hits from the enemy withoutdying. You wont have to be hacking away forever, either; the skill-upscome fast, negating the need for the genre norm of grinding throughskirmishes. By the game's halfway mark, one of my most powerfulfighters already had his skill maxed out for hammers, his weapon ofchoice. Such an easy leveling system might bore the hardcore fanbasethat still remembers Vandal Hearts from the old days, but it keeps thegame moving at a swift pace.If battles only consisted of using the small set of abilitiesavailable they'd get tiring fast, but Hijinx Studios smartly focused oncreating interesting scenarios that require you to react in differentways. One map has your party escaping from an endless stream of enemiesin a mine cart, one at a time. Another requires you to get multipleparty members to hit different switches at the same time in order toopen a new path and save an ally who has been separated from the group.The unique twists keep coming, and the story mission objectives rarelyfall back on the ~defeat all enemies~ standard. Not all the innovations work out quite so well. Though I don'texpect top-end graphics from downloadable games, the art design inFlames of Judgment is atrocious. A couple of the kids (including themain character) look okay, but the entire cast shares their short,almost Hobbit-like stance, which comes off as ugly during staticdialogue sequences and downright creepy during the infrequentcutscenes. The disturbingly dwarf-sized characters may serve as an analogy forthe games place among strategy RPGs: Its shorter and uglier than mostthat have come before, but its also unique in a way that some willfind charming.", "date": "Jan 29, 2010", "grade": "7.5"}
