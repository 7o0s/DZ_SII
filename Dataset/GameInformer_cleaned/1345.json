However, when it originally released on Xbox 360 in 2010, the cult hit from the mind of Hidetaka Suehiro (aka Swery) demonstrated that those things arent all that matter. Gamers able to see past its technical shortcomings were treated to a rare and quirky murder mystery set in a haunting town full of strange characters. Deadly Premonition is more about the larger experience than the individual elements, and the directors cut faithfully translates the whole mesmerizing affair to the PS3  with a few improvements. Everything that fans love about the original is intact. Agent York is delightfully odd, the residents of Greenvale are endearing, and aTwin Peaksvibe runs through everything. The only new piece of story content is a series of cutscenes framing the narrative, in which an old man is telling his granddaughter the events of the game. Even though these scenes dont alter the core plot, the last one adds a new angle to the tales conclusion that fans will appreciate. I can't say any more without spoiling the biggest reason fans have to return to Greenvale; it's a nice reward if youve been wanting to replay Deadly Premonition anyway, but it doesnt justify buying the game a second time.Beyond the extra scenes, you wont find any new quests or major gameplay features. The controls are the biggest improvement; they are intuitive instead of clunky in this version, falling in line with traditional third-person controls that gamers expect. Possible additions discussed prior to the games release  like York buying a house, and extra quests  did not make the final cut. However, other changes make Greenvale a more hospitable place for newcomers. The graphics have improved slightly, and a minimap reduces the amount of time you need to spend pausing the game to reorient yourself. These tweaks dont magically make Deadly Premonition a different game; the visuals are still conspicuously outdated, and navigation remains problematic since you cant place waypoints or even zoom out to see the whole map. I also noticed some audio glitches and graphical hiccups that seem unique to this version, but they aren't severe enough to poison the experience.Deadly Premonition has its faults, but the quirky dialogue, self-directed exploration, and perfect pacing form an addictive and fascinating mystery unlike anything else in gaming. If youre a newcomer to Agent Yorks adventures in Greenvale (or found the controls too awful to tolerate on Xbox 360), you should definitely try Deadly Premonition: The Directors Cut. It asks players to overlook a lot of problems, but if you can do that, it pays even greater rewards.That Made The Cut?The addition of 3D support and Move controls are exactly the stupid bullet points they appear to be and dont add anything noteworthy to the experience. Thankfully, they are both optional, so they dont do any damage, either.", "date": "Apr 29, 2013", "grade": "7.75"}
