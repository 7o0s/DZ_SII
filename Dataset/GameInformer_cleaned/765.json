Square Enix capitalized onthis treasure trove of excellent music with Theatrythm Final Fantasy, a musicgame that lets players tap along to the tunes on their 3DS' touchscreen. Thisnew entry, Curtain Call, preserves the essence of the original while injectingnew gameplay options and a load of songs with varying quality.If you played the previous Theatrythm, the core of that gameremains intact. Notes scroll along the screen that you must tap in time. Thestylus still works well for tapping, holding, and swiping in specificdirections, but Curtain Call also introduces conventional button inputs. Beingable to tap face buttons and slide the circle pad in time feels more natural tome for the fast-paced battle tunes, while the stylus works better for thetranquil, slower exploration tracks. Being able to switch between these twomodes is a welcome addition to the already simple, yet solid, gameplay.Another improvement is the huge amount of great tracks addedto the set list. The classic tunes of the core, numbered Final Fantasy gamesare joined by the majority of the DLC added to Theatrythm's previous release.It also includes tracks from titles like Final Fantasy Tactics, Mystic Quest,and more. I love being able to play everything from FF VII's NativeAmerican-inspired ~Cosmo Canyon~ to the gentle, contemplative tracks ofTactics. It's a thorough catalogue, but the lack of distillation means you'realso more likely to stumble upon tracks you don't care for.Each of the 200-plus songs can be played a la carte from thestart, complete with a new medium difficulty mode that strikes a wonderfulbalance between the breezy Basic difficulty and brutal Ultimate difficulty. Ifyou'd rather play a shuffled arrangement of random songs, the new Quest Medleymode allows you to progress along a simplified world map and face off with aboss at the end. The presentation is cute, but the leveling system, earneditems, and gradually acquired Rythmia currency feel like extraneous, uselesstrappings.Players can also compete online or locally in a head-to-headVersus Mode, which is unlocked after trying all the other modes. Two songsters simultaneouslybattle a variety of monsters, duking it out for the high score to win uselesscollectable cards. Performing well fires random status effects at your enemies(similar to boss battles in Guitar Hero III), like a faster highway, strictertiming windows, etc. It's a simple, fun way to enjoy the game with yourfriends, even if the collectable cards aren't the greatest motivator. For those who already tapped through the 70-plus immortaltunes of the original and felt satisfied, this expanded song selection and the extramodes may not be enough to justify a return visit. However, Curtain Call is agood choice for those diehard Final Fantasy fans that couldn't get enough ofthe original.", "date": "Sep 11, 2014", "grade": "8"}
