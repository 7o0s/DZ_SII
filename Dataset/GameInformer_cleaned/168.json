The most recent episode, A Portal toMystery, placed The Order of the Stone into an entertaining whodunit. WithAccess Denied, Telltale explores yet another direction as it takes a step intopost-apocalyptic science-fiction in my favorite episode since the conclusion ofthe Wither Storm saga. The episode hits the ground running, immediately presenting a funopening montage of the group jumping from world to world. This collection ofscenes gives us an idea of how long the team has been wandering through thehall of portals, trying to find the one that takes them home. I enjoyedwatching a quick look at all of the adventures the team has been going on sincethe last episode, and it set the stage for the inevitable frustration that setsin after wandering for so long to no avail.After an argument as a result of this frustration, the teamdecides to take a redstone-lined portal, since that could mean intelligentpeople are on the other side. Unfortunately, when Jesse and friends emerge fromthe portal, they're in adesolate wasteland ruled by a corrupt computer called PAMA. Every livingcreature - from zombies and spiders to humans - is controlled by PAMA throughredstone computer chips embedded in their skulls. This dystopian setting isboth unsettling and unfamiliar to those who have followed Minecraft: Story Modeto this point, and it offers a refreshing change of pace.My favorite moments of this episode were my interactions withPAMA. The charming emoticon expressions on the giant computer monitor were funto watch as I answered his questions in a variety of ways. PAMA's constant curiosity about my adventuremade him both fun and menacing, as his line of questioning quickly turned to adesire to send his slaves to other worlds on conquering missions.The episode revolves around Jesse formulating a plan to fightPAMA, free the world from his digital chains, and find a way back to the hallof portals. The premise may sound simple, but it managed to surprise me on afew occasions. I don't wantto spoil it, but I loved how this episode uses your friends to raise thestakes.PAMA is the most entertaining and threatening antagonist theseries has seen since the daunting Wither Storm. For the first time since theend of that original saga, I felt as though I was leading Jesse againstsimilarly insurmountable odds. With PAMA in Episode 7, I not only felt likeJesse and friends were facing off against an intelligent and capable adversary,but literally the whole world was against them as the A.I. sent those under hiscontrol after them.This situation results in exciting quick-time-events and severalfast-paced sequences as you duck, dive, and dodge the hordes of mindlesslackeys. The series has also gotten better about its puzzles, as they have beenstreamlined and simplified to prevent halting the pacing. One such puzzle hasyou wandering through an underground cave, figuring out which item to place inthe chests of robotic greeters. It'sa simple puzzle that doesn'ttake long to solve, but it still required a bit of thinking to get it to thepoint of being able to progress.The only creature not under PAMA's trance is Harper, who is one of the most interesting peripheralcharacters Telltale has added since the series' start. Discovering her backstory is part of the fun, and I likedlearning all about her and her past as the episode progressed. While the story is enjoyable from start to finish, the sameissues that have been present with Minecraft: Story Mode from the startcontinue with this episode. The biggest issue has always been that I don't feel as though I'm truly shaping the story, and that mydecisions don't have bigconsequences. With the higher-stakes moments that I mentioned before and justone episode remaining, I thought I might actually see one of my decisions comeback to bite me. Unfortunately, I was proven wrong, as the end of the episoderolled around and all was reset back to maintain the status quo with allcharacters involved. The gameplay is also feeling less enthralling with each passingepisode. The quick-time events are still fun, but other action scenes feel asthough I've done them before.Access Denied is a strong episode that tries new things andrelies on familiar elements to mostly good results. I enjoyed going up againstthe massive threat of PAMA and fighting to save the world from his rule, andthe action supports that thrilling premise. This penultimate episode doeseverything it needed to excite me for the final episode in this season ofMinecraft: Story Mode.", "date": "Jul 27, 2016", "grade": "8"}
