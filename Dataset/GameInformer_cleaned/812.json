Can you remain sane insuch a hopeless situation? When do you finally just give up and realize thatsurviving is more trouble than it's worth? Telltale has done a wonderful jobexploring the will to live and still finding hope amidst such a harrowingsituation. Episode 4, Amid the Ruins, reminds me why that's important. Amid the Ruins is slower paced, but the plot still advancesand takes intriguing turns. The last two episodes were high on adrenaline,bombarding you with shocking reveals. This episode still has its surprises, butthey creep on you instead of punch you in the gut. What I liked most is that itgot me contemplating what's best for Clementine and challenged me to see heralliances in a different light.The episode begins right where the previous one left off:You're trying to get through a large zombie horde without being noticed, butthings turn chaotic when one of your group members gets attacked. You witnessthe aftermath of this event while still figuring out a way through the massivedeadly wave. This is where you start to see your alliance start to crack;nothing is going smoothly and you've lost track of about half of the people. Acommon struggle of this episode is fighting between emotion and logic, forcingyou to assess who is an asset and who is a liability to your survival. The storyline does a lot right. It takes characters ininteresting directions, like newcomer Jane. Telltale has a habit of introducingcharacters and not always giving them a place in the story, so I was glad tofinally get some insight into Jane. She is tough, and has learned to survive onher own after losing her sister. She takes Clementine under her wing andteaches plenty of survival skills, like a new way to kill zombies by trippingthem and then stabbing them in the back of the head. Jane also has someemotional baggage she's trying to hide, and you never really know when it'sgoing to surface. She's unpredictable - a ticking time bomb - but the front sheputs up makes her realistic. Despite fleshing out Jane, other characters are beginning tolose their places in the group. Telltale also introduced Mike last episode, butoutside of a few humorous lines, he's merely been an extra body. I can't tellyou much about him. Luke has also lost his place in his plot, even though it originallylooked like he was going to be a big influence on Clementine. Now his role has been diminished to gettinginto arguments with another character. Telltale tries to inject him in the plotthis episode, and he always feels out of place when they do.Part of my concern with the zombie apocalypse setting isthat the environments you see start to get old fast. Camps, roads, and forestsall start to look the same after a while, but Telltale got a bit more creativethis episode. You visit a museum, break into a gift shop, and then the weatherchanges into a snowy blizzard. The gameplay is tenser than in previousepisodes, thanks to certain sequences where you have a limited time to find theright solution in the environment. I like these moments, since the diminishingtime adds the stress you should feel during these situations.Unfortunately, Telltale also goes back to some slowersequences, which have you searching environments for specific objects. Thesearen't as fun, especially since Clementine's walking animation is so slow. Theenvironments aren't even large, but it still takes her too long to get from oneend of the screen to the other. At the very least, Telltale doesn't makeClementine shoulder the burden of every problem this time around. In fact, inthe one instance you can use her, it backfires. I was happy to see the groupnot turn to an 11-year-old to solve every dilemma.Amid the Ruins shines most when Telltale slyly turns thetables on you. Is being nice to people always the best option? For instance,you are a given a choice when you find a lot of painkillers. A few groupmembers are injured and Rebecca is about to have a baby. The decision seemseasy - but you must steal the medicine from someone with a sick sister. Thiswas one of the more effective direct decisions, but I also appreciate how theepisode starts building to bigger dilemmas. How can you trust anyone during theapocalypse? What makes someone else's needs more important than your own? These issues constantly put my emotions to the test. Forinstance, I may like Jane, but her reckless behavior may one day be costly.Playing as Clementine also helps, since you always want to give her the bestodds by making the best decisions for her. For the first time, I looked at thegroup that took her in as potential liabilities. Members of your alliance arestarting to either become dead weight or emotionally unstable, and it might notbe best for Clem to stick with them.From somber deaths to one satisfying slap, Amid the Ruinshas a lot of memorable moments. As you approach the end, you're left in anunexpected place that keeps your head spinning. Telltale was smart to involve playersin this final moment, forcing them to make a knee-jerk reaction to a complexsituation. Season two has been fantastic so far, but this episode makes me evenmore curious and anxious for the finale. It resurfaces the question: CanClementine ever be happy living in this awful world?
