Whether it's poor pacing, tutorial-heavyintroductions, or a repetitious structure, the entry barrier can be difficultto overcome. With Cold Steel, I was eager to jump back into combat andexploration throughout the entire journey. That's what makes it such a delight- every component is so well-done and wonderfully paced that no part outstaysits welcome, making The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel one of the mostabsorbing JRPGs I've encountered since Persona 4. Trails of Cold Steel puts you in the shoes of ReanSchwarzer, a seemingly normal guy starting his first day at Thors MilitaryAcademy. The gameplay capitalizes on its academic setting; you take written andcombat exams, socialize with classmates, and go on field trips to learn moreabout the dangers of the world. All of the school activities fold well into allof the other systems, creating an entertaining loop that makes the game hard toput down. It immerses you in student life, while also giving you worthwhilereasons to engage with it. For instance,socializing with your classmates grants you bonuses in battle and doing extratasks for student council gives you beneficial items. The characters and story start off generic, but learningmore about the different personalities and the world reveal many intriguingthreads. Rean is in the first class to ever to not segregate noble and lowbornstudents, and the tension is palpable from his first day. Whether the studentsare of aristocratic blood or not, they all have interesting backgrounds (somewere adopted into royalty, others have parents who worked their way out ofcommoner status) that add to the already heated social divisions of ErebonianEmpire. The narrative explores the betrayal and sacrifice that comeswith politics, reminiscent of a Suikoden game, and the communication system allowsyou to build relationships, similar to Persona's social links. I always lookedforward to free time because it allowed me to see a different side to myclassmate allies. They all have secrets and personal issues to confront, andexploring these in greater depth was one of my favorite parts of the game. Allthis is wrapped in fantastic dialogue that makes characters come to life. When you're not socializing or running errands, you'refighting through a mysterious schoolhouse or traveling to new lands to confrontbigger baddies. The dungeon-crawling is broken up in a clever way, only makingyou tackle a few floors at once (usually three). Same goes for your field trips;you're only assigned a few quests and usually one or two of them are requiredto proceed in the main story. Even if you hit a difficulty wall, you have anout with an option to start the battle over with weakened enemies.Unfortunately, some of the fetch quests (especially theoptional ones) are a bore and the old school isn't that intriguing to explore,but you're not spending a lot of time on either. Field trips are more excitingbecause they usually take you to one of your classmate's hometowns, allowingyou to see the different life they've lead from others. These usually containthe biggest twists in the story and the most memorable battles. The combat features one of my favorite traditional battlesystems to date. You can have four characters on the field at once, and can subin any of your two supports during any turn. The turn order is listed in thecorner, but randomly certain bonuses (and later penalties) can be granted,guaranteeing a critical attack or restoring health, crafts, or magic. Order canbe influenced by upping your speed, casting time, or canceling opponent attackswith an unbalance move. So much strategy goes into it, which makes everyvictory rewarding.Placement and movement is also important. You can movecombatants out of the area of an oncoming magical attack; placing them in differentareas on the battlefield ensures no enemy attack can target more than one at atime, but limits your ability to cast group buffs. Linking characters to buildrelationships grants bonuses, like them blocking attacks or healing you in atime of need.All of these systems don't even factor in the customization.All classmates have basic skills that they learn as they level up, but you canequip orbs that provide abilities and bonuses on your party members. I reveledin having this much control over building my group and giving them the skills Ifelt benefited them. Trails of Cold Steel may not turn the genre onits head, but it does almost everything well. It is the first game in atrilogy, and Xseed has already confirmed the next game is coming to NorthAmerica. After this delightful entry, I'm on board to see the next move.", "date": "Jan 14, 2016", "grade": "8.5"}
