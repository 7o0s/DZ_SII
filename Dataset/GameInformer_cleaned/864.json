Bigby started on a murder investigation, but thecase has grown even more insidious.Themysterious Crooked Man is extorting down-and-out Fables, and Bigby is in theposition to make things right. Unfortunately, Episode 4 spends too much timetrying to set the stage for a finale, and not enough time making the journeythere interesting. Forget painstaking choices, fun dialogue options, and seeingthe satisfying impact of your decisions; this installment lacks momentum, andis too comfortable doing too little. Story arcs have peaks and valleys,but when a narrative is only five acts, none of them can afford to drag likethis. In Episode 4, Bigby is trying to track down The Crooked Man, discoveringjust how far his power over Fabletown extends. However, this episode nevermoved me, nor made me gasp in disbelief. It merely shows more of the corruptionand social divide, but outside of a fun fight sequence with none other than theJersey Devil, the excitement is missing. The frightening Bloody Mary introducedat the end of the last episode is mostly absent, and big choices aren'tfactoring in yet. Telltale may be saving those for the season finale, but thatleaves this chapter as dead weight that you must trudge through to see the taleunfold.A lot of the Fables we've seen throughout of the season are shoehorned in here, and every arc suffers because of it. Beauty and Beast are the most disenchanting characters, and this episode doesn't make them any more interesting, despite their being crammed into the drama. You could cut them out of the game and I wouldn't miss either one. Colin the pig is also revisited, but he's also a pile of missing potential. In Episode 1, it looked like he would act as Bigby's conscience, but his role evaporated since then. Suddenly he's back, and we're supposed to fight for him?The episode just gets toocomfortable focusing on the same beats; every character blames Bigby for thecorruption. Having it happen once or twice is fine, but it's constant. I feltbeat over the head by the fact that shady dealings are occurring and Fables aremad that the sheriff didn't catch on sooner. Adding insult to injury, thedialogue options are some of the weakest I've seen in the series. Part of whatmakes The Wolf Among Us fun is role-playing as Bigby, but for the first time, Ididn't see many appealing ways to respond, and instead fell back on the silentoption, something I rarely do in Telltale games.The choices also aren't thatconflicting. The only major one that impacts the episode is choosing betweentwo locations to visit first. Some different characters show their facesdepending on your selection, but that's as far as the differences go. Telltaleexperiments more with having two characters wanting disparate things and makingyou pick a side, but these decisions are surprisingly easy - almostinstinctual. The dilemmas focus more on which characters you like and what youthink is fair given the circumstances surrounding The Crooked Man, forcing youto choose whether or not to bend the law for certain characters. They justdon't have the pressure or urgency that distinguished the decisions of previouschapters.Other than seeing more about TheCrooked Man and exactly who is involved with the crime ring, Episode 4 doesn't havemuch oomph. But you're already invested enough in the story that it shouldn'tdeter you from the finale. Hopefully the bigger payoff is approaching, asEpisode 4 ends exactly as it should (which is unfortunately a littlepredictable). You never want to give your audience too much in the lead up tothe finale, but you want to make them as excited as possible for the finalstretch. The overall story is still intriguing, but this disappointing episodewon't be a tough act to follow.", "date": "May 27, 2014", "grade": "6.5"}
