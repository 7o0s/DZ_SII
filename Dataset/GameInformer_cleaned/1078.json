Over thecourse of its struggles, EA continued to express its unwavering commitment tothe NBA, promising a return to the glory years where Live was a formidablesports franchise. Perhaps that dedication was misguided, because even if it'sviewed as a first step in a multi-year rebuilding project, NBA Live 14 is inrough shape. From the unintelligent commentary and overenthusiastic crowdto the inferior player models and awkward movements that lack transitionalanimations, NBA Live 14 feels like a game in arrested development. Thebasketball on display bears more resemblance to a YMCA pickup game than thebest league in the world. Players stand around on offense waiting for somethingto happen instead of ad-libbing with dynamic decision-making. When you do callplays, you have no idea what's supposed to happen unless you memorize the playin the coaching menu. Limbs and balls clip through player bodies consistently.NBA Live 14's signature gameplay enhancement, the BounceTekdribbling system, doesn't feel dramatically different from other basketballgames I've played. It takes a while to get the hang of jump shooting; EAclearly had trouble with it too, because I saw several players shoot with theirbacks to the basket. But since help defense is largely an afterthought, you canconsistently score by driving the lane, taking a Eurostep, and shooting a layupwhether you are playing the CPU or another person online.The game modes are in similar sorry shape. Dynasty operateslike it has been designed by former Timberwolves GM David Kahn, brought down byterrible trade logic, imbalanced rosters, and a league-wide salary cap mess dueto inflated contract extensions for middling players. The Thunder tradedarguably the second-best player in the NBA, Kevin Durant, to the Nets for pointguard Deron Williams, even though the team already had all-star RussellWestbrook manning the position. The simulation logic is equally flawed. In oneseason, the Atlanta Hawks won the NBA championship with a questionable rosterled by perennially injured guard Martell Webster, who was the team's leadingscorer.The EA Sports equivalent to MyCareer, Rising Star, should berenamed First Round Bust. It follows the same trajectory as the 2K mode,starting at a draft showcase and leading into your first year as an NBA player,but your progress is communicated in boring menu boxes instead of cutscenes, andthe punitive rating system is a constant source of frustration. Your performancerating is knocked for every little transgression  failing a steal attempt,missing shots (even if your shot selection was good), or allowing your~matchup~ to score even if you rotated to defend another player a long time ago.Other play options include Live Season events that allow youto relive big moments from the current season every day, Ultimate Team, andhead-to-head online seasons. Each of these is competent, but ultimatelyundermined by the lackluster action on the court. I've always argued thatcompetition breeds innovation in sports games, so I am rooting for EA Sports tosucceed in resurrecting its basketball franchise. But the vast gulf in qualitybetween NBA 2K and NBA Live right now makes this a tough matchup towatch.Like an old player attempting a comeback after multiple kneereconstructions and several years away from the game, NBA Live 14 doesn't haveenough skill or composure to keep up with the competition.", "date": "Nov 20, 2013", "grade": "4"}
