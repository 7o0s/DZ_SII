{"name": "My Sims Party", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/my_sims_party/b/wii/archive/2009/09/22/review.aspx", "text": "The MySims franchise started off well with two games that offered unique building-focused and RPG takes on the Animal Crossing formula. So why does this game feel like they just gave up? If you take away the village overworld, all that's left is a lowest-common-denominator collection of minigames. Even with these lowered expectations, the minigames themselves aren't particularly well done or entertaining. It's odd that a franchise that has been so creative with its game designs would settle for such pedestrian pursuits. Putting toppings on a pizza? Carrying luggage? Watering plants? Sounds more like ''chores'' than a party to me.", "date": "on Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
