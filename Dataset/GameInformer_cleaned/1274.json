With this special episode's brief glimpses into five different lives,it's not a strong attachment like Clementine's that keeps the emotionalinvestment. Instead, it's the plight of the situation and the choices that saysomething about humanity and what people will do to survive. At one point, I felt transported to the actual conundrum:Should I kill and betray my conscience, or run and risk my safety? As the twochoices lingered on the screen, my emotions roiled inside me. The heart-pumpingdecision had no right or wrong answer, as both were unappealing, but itmattered so much that I paused and stared at each choice for a minute. Thedoubt that surmounts in these moments are when 400 Days is at its best, andthankfully, it has enough of them to keep these small slices of story afloat.Expect plenty of grim situations and don't anticipate walking away happy orfeeling secure - that's exactly the way a zombie apocalypse should feel. While Telltale Games preps the second season of last year'sbreakout story, the bridging DLC 400 Days caters to fans by connecting toseason one while alluding to what's in store for the next season. But with fivenew characters and around 20 minutes for their introductory episodes, it'stough getting to know them. That's part of the beauty. All that's revealed areglimpses, yet the writers still provide a strong sense of these characters. Offthe bat, it's clear that Shel would do anything for her younger sister and thatthere's more to Vince's story than being a murderer. No matter how many shadesof gray are evident in each main character, they all remain likeable and keepyou intrigued. Although the stories are small offerings, they still havedepth. One explores how a young girl is hardened by the cruelty of the apocalypse;another has you going up against a man losing his sanity. Interesting enough,the side characters are the main attraction, which is important when you'replaying as the lead character. Dialogue remains natural and witty, and insertssome humor for levity. That said, some of the five stories, like Shel's, hitthe emotional chord harder than others. For instance, in Wyatt's story, the~big choice~ lacks impact; his arc is entirely forgettable. One theme remainsthe same, however: somberness. Most of the final choices echo through you longafter the encounter finishes.Telltale's 400 Days isn't afraid to go to dark places andplays around with deteriorating mental states along the timeline. Noteverything always works, though; racial tension is thrown into the apocalypse,but it feels tacked on. For such brief episodes, it never finds it place orworks for the plot as it should. Still, the bleak atmosphere delivers in mostcases. In one scenario, the fog carries an eeriness; in another, characters usewalkers as their watch dogs. Isolation and oppressive gloom and doom permeatethe world effectively.Gameplay once again is a very minor portion of The WalkingDead, which isn't a bad thing. The effort to create suitable tension is noble;you dodge gunfire, shoot at a moving car, and pull a weapon from the groundwith only seconds before you're found. The speed at which you have to performthese actions is what makes them function well, not the actual execution oraction, which always feels second-rate compared to the plot. The dialogue choices and decisions are the highlight, butit's impossible to escape feeling forced into some choices that bridge togameplay. For instance, in one scene, something sneaked up on my character. Ihesitated at striking because I wanted to make sure it wasn't somebody I knew;I quickly found the ~Game Over~ screen. In my next attempt, I struck, and my previousobservation was correct. Instead of being rewarded for correctly anticipating acircumstance, I was instead forced to play the situation in a wayI normally wouldn't have. The only other shortcoming is the abrupt endings to thestories. Leaving you hanging is The Walking Dead's forte, but it feelsunnatural in 400 Days. At the end of the episode, it tries too hard to wrap upsome lingering questions quickly, and it feels like you're being read a laundrylist. These conclusions are just as sad as some of the outcomes in the stories,and seeing this expanded on screen would reinforce the devastatingconsequences. As rushed as the ultimate ending feels, it does get you thinkingabout The Walking Dead's next move with season two. Ultimately, 400 Days is worth playing for invested fans.Telltale has clearly learned the game works best when it presents you withunattractive choices that pull at your humanity. Some of these stories had mein frenzied thought, while others left me underwhelmed, but either way, 400Days feels like a preparation for what's to come. As this DLC ups the shockfactor, it makes it clear when season two rolls around that Telltale has noboundaries, and you should prepare your emotions accordingly.", "date": "Jul 03, 2013", "grade": "8"}
