The projectwas originally announced by NIS America back in 2011, but the company hasn'tsaid much about it since then. As time went on, a western launch looked bleak,but NIS America announced a release date at the beginning of April, and by theend of the month, Black Rock Shooter was out on the Playstation Store. Was the under-the-radartitle worth the wait? Black Rock Shooter does exactly what a handheld titleshould with its short missions and accessible-yet-deep gameplay, while stillsurprising me with an intriguing and touching narrative. Imageepoch's latestprovided me more than I expected in terms of entertainment, but it's notwithout flaws. The narrative starts off slow and dull, throwing you inbattle and hoping the firearms are engaging enough. The titular character (yes,she's named ~Black Rock Shooter~) has piercing eyes, wears all black, carries agigantic gun, and rides a motorcycle. While she has a tough exterior, there'snot much going on in the personality department, since she's suffering fromamnesia. Black Rock Shooter was created as a weapon, but whether or not she ishuman is a question the game explores.Though the plot is initially disappointing, I was hookedonce the twists started appearing. The tale takes some tragic turns, and makesyou empathize with Black Rock Shooter. Harsh and heartwarming at the same time,the narrative depth is impressive for its short duration (I beat the game in alittle under 10 hours). Combat consists of Black Rock Shooter engaging enemies onthe battlefield that charge straight at her. The action-oriented battlesrevolve around attacking, dodging, and guarding, forcing you to properly manageall three of these abilities. Spamming attack and dodge causes you to overheat,which prevents any actions from being taken, meaning you have to approachcombat judiciously.This balancing act makes combat tense, forcing you to adjuststrategies on the fly. On the other hand, being punished for using defensiveabilities effectively is frustrating, especially considering that some enemiesstrike with multiple attacks that require repeated dodging. Thankfully, theother skills you unlock don't contribute to overheating, but they do operate oncooldown timers. These useful powers prevent battles from becoming drawn-out byletting you do things like negating attacks for a time or hitting multiple enemieswith a powerful strike.Black Rock Shooter features six stages, each consisting ofabout six missions. As a bonus, stages have side missions - mostly killing acertain enemy a set amount of times - which unlock better skills. Some of thesecan be cleared during regular play, though others require backtracking throughthe same dreary stages.The experience gets repetitive fast. Enemies lack variety,and missions revolve around the same objectives - either chasing a character,destroying generators, or blasting through minibosses. You don't even have muchincentive to explore outside of a few stray chests, making the gameplay structurepredictable and tiresome. Even levels where you get to drive a motorcycle losetheir allure.I found regular battles fairly easy, but boss battles gaveme the challenge I was looking for, forcing me to stay a step ahead of my enemyand anticipate their attacks. Dodging at just the right moment before a massiveattack hit and escaping death by milliseconds is thrilling. The frenziedbattles held my attention and I learned quickly that a lack of focus could costyou a victory. Alongside the latecharacter interactions, boss battles are where the game shines. Too bad thesame creativity and unpredictability doesn't extend to the regular battles. Black Rock Shooter is competent at what it does and, for themost part, entertaining to play. However, it could use a bit more polish and imaginationin its design. It doesn't turn the genre on its head, but with my guns blazingthrough the chaos, I found a more meaningful story than I expected.", "date": "May 02, 2013", "grade": "7.25"}
