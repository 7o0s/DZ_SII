While the struggle to survive in thishellish city-turned-zoo is more repetitive and boring than you might hope, thePSN-exclusive title delivers enough quirky fun to keep you going.Unlike virtually every other game on the market, TokyoJungle's story mode is more of a side attraction than a destination. It offersa few peripheral narratives for select animals, including a once-coddledPomeranian who must now fend for himself and a young deer in search of itsmother. These stories are unlocked in the narrative-free survival mode, whichmakes up the vast majority of your playtime. Survival mode contains some annoying eccentricities (forinstance, the game doesn't track your progress towards completing challengesuntil they're activated, and the initial tier doesn't unlock until after thefirst in-game year has passed), but once you figure out the poorly explained mechanics,it offers a fun grind. You pick your animal, prioritize the randomly generatedchallenges, and start working towards them with the larger goal of unlockingthe next playable species. These include everything from baby chicks to lions,and (somehow) even dinosaurs. In a disappointing cash grab, a few of the coolerspecies like pandas and crocodiles can only be purchased separately via thePlayStation Store. Once I unlocked the next species, however, I found littlereason to continue playing. You can complete more objectives and spawnadditional generations of offspring for a higher score, but you've alreadyunlocked the best reward you're going to get.Tokyo Jungle's biggest drawback is repetition. A handful ofenvironments are chained together in a linear order, and while it's technicallyan open world, most areas are narrow avenues, making it feel as though you'rerunning through shallow dioramas. An actual open world (not to mention variedstarting locations) would have gone a long way towards staving off themonotony.Gameplay also lacks variety. Goals, while randomlygenerated, conform to a select few archetypes, and aside from the differenteating habits of carnivores and herbivores, your routine is the same regardlessof what animal you choose; search for food, prey on animals smaller than you,hide from animals bigger than you, mark your territory, and find a mate. Justmake sure you pick a good one: Hooking up with a ~prime~ female results inmore, healthier offspring, whereas a ~desperate~ mate will only give you one ortwo children and probably a bad case of fleas.Don't let adorable Pomeranian puppies and baby chicks foolyou. Beneath the cutesy veneer are the dark realities of survival. Tokyo Jungleis literally a dog-eat-dog world; I cringed when I had to strike down and eat agolden retriever in order to prevent my beagle from starving to death. Combatis bloody and favors the strong. The best that weaker animals, like a deer, cando is sacrifice a littermate to increase their chances of escaping. Don't playthis game around children unless you're aiming to traumatize them.Luckily, surviving is easier (and more fun) with a friend.Tokyo Jungle's same screen co-op mode allows two players to team up and worktowards the same objectives together. Resources are scarcer if your animalsshare the same food source, but you're still better off than going alone, andhaving a co-op partner delays the inevitable onset of boredom.I sank plenty of hours into Tokyo Jungle, and still want toplay more. I'm just not sure why, as the repetitious gameplay limits the amountof fun I've had with it. Still, if you're looking for something off the beatenpath  or just want to see a bunch of animals doing it  Tokyo Jungle providesa modest amount of entertainment.", "date": "Sep 13, 2012", "grade": "7"}
