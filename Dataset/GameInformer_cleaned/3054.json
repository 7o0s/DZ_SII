{"name": "Ultimate Band", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/ultimate_band/b/wii/archive/2009/09/22/review.aspx", "text": "As simple, easy-to-grasp music games go, Ultimate Band deserves a nod of appreciation. Sure, these are simplistic cover versions of pop songs, the story is juvenile, and overly easy gameplay dominates the game. But it also doesn't cost $160, and it plays on a game system nearly every family in America with small children has in their living room. Understanding the game is largely targeted to this audience, the pros and cons are a wash, and families should have a pretty good time. A band creator allows you to deck out some zany musicians, and the straightforward, pick-up-and-play motion controls work successfully. Four-person band play is the way to go (no singer, just an arm-swinging frontman), and every instrument feels unique. Keep expectations in check, and your band should have a good time, even if it's nowhere near the ''ultimate'' music game experience.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
