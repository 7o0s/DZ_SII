A Crooked Milecontinues to expose the issues of Fabletown's community, but also builds on theongoing murder investigation, leaving you piecing together exactly where it'sall headed. Last episode, Smoke & Mirrors, didn't have as muchmomentum as I would have liked, but A Crooked Mile has much better pacing anddevelopment. A Crooked Mile picks up with Bigby adding familiar Fables to thesuspect list and worrying about which Fables are in jeopardy. The second Fabledeath is still lingering, the funeral is under way, and members of thecommunity are even more aggravated and demanding answers. This keeps you hot onthe tail of those responsible for the murders, assessing your leads andfollowing up on the most promising clues.Telltale puts more of the investigation in your hands thisepisode. You have three different places to visit, and you choose where to goand when. Should you look for more dirt on the suspicious Tweedle Dee and Dum,search the belongings of the recently-deceased Fable, or go to the apartment ofthe newest suspect? No matter what, you can only go to two of the threelocations. Depending on your choices, you interact with different Fables and gain insight into various characters and events. Telltale does a good job ofgiving you reasons to pick any of the three locations. Whichever one you don'tvisit will be investigated by another Fable, which presents its own problems.Do you trust your ally not to tamper with evidence? I second-guess who I cantrust constantly. Everyone feels like a suspect, and that's exactly how itshould be when you're investigating a murder.As for the time and place choices, the end result leads youto the same final destination, but seeing different variations on how you reachthis conclusion provides new content, making you feel like your choices meansomething. These impactful choices work well, so I hope Telltale continuesmaking them a part of future episodes. They make you assess what you're aboutto choose without any right or wrong answers. This episode also features adecision with far-reaching consequences; no matter how you choose, the futurewill be immutably affected.Making these choices as sheriff isn't easy. You don'texactly have a fan club as the murders and corruption get worse. You mustdecide how you want to handle and appeal to various Fables. Dialogue choices aretop-tier in this episode, ranging from how the Big Bad Wolf would handle a childto confronting awful circumstances with sincerity. I felt like I wasdetermining what type of man Bigby's going to be in the middle of turmoil. You canplay him as a man doing everything in his power to redeem himself, or as alevel-headed man who prevents his in-the-moment emotions from clouding his judgment.You aren't just picking Bigby's temperament. Telltale oftenpits you against other characters; if you think another Fable is wrong, do yourisk calling them out and potentially put a strain on your relationship, or doyou agree to appease them? The role-playing choices don't stop there. When youfinally give in to Bigby's wolf tendencies, Telltale lets you decide how far totake it. Having a slew of different ways to role-play as Bigby kept me moreinvested in the experience than in previous episodes. A Crooked Mile is a much more balanced episode than itspredecessor. The excellent pacing, the varied choices, and how the writersstill make me guess their next move keeps this episode riveting. Much like agood murder-mystery television show, you see the plot starting to unravel, butyou're never confident that you know exactly where it will end up or who's atthe root of all the problems. The new antagonist introduced in the closingscenes of the episode makes me excited to see where the next entry takes the story. One thing is certain: Something bad is going on in Fabletown, and Bigby istasked with changing the community's fate. Now the real question is: Willunmasking the mastermind be as exciting as the build-up?", "date": "Apr 08, 2014", "grade": "8.5"}
