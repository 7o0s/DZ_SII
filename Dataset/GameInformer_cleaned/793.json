{"name": "Hohokum", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/hohokum/b/ps3/archive/2014/08/12/pretty-empty.aspx", "text": "Many adherentsof the indie gaming scene accuse many modern triple-A games of being all flashand no substance -big budget boondoggles that rely on huge action-flickset pieces and expensive graphics to cover up their lack innovative gameplay.Hohokum isproof that the same can be said for games that wear their indie aesthetics ontheir sleeve. It has it all:oddball, cartoonish graphics that arecolorful and charming, tasteful electronic music by a host of artists on thehip Ghostly International label, and a ~nonlinear~ structure that encouragesplayers to experiment with the environment at their leisure.I love gamesthat stretch the definition of what a video game can be. Whether it's Journeyor Gone Home, the last few years have seen titles that eschewed traditional notionsof gameplay and challenge while delivering profoundly emotional interactiveexperiences. Hohokum, for all its whimsy and often-humorous weirdness, doesn'treally seem to have much to say. In fact, it's much more of a conventional gamethan advertised. Your wormlike creature must solve puzzles (usually as simpleas delivering a little cartoon creature to the right platform or hitting asequence of switches) and complete objectives -there's even a boss battlewith a giant elephant.The gameplayitself is extremely simple -you guide your line-creature around theenvironment and run into objects or give other creatures a lift when they jumpon. There are a number of levels you can complete, but they are all unlockedfrom the outset and there is no set order of progression. In general, it's upto you to enter a new area, and start running into things until you suss outwhat you're supposed to do. The developers clearly see this as a way to createa game that encourages ingenuity while not placing limits like death or a timeron the experience.That's a greatidea. However, I found myself wishing that Hohokum had either been more structured(by giving me better cues and a more solid gameplay structure) or more experimental.As it stands, this art game doesn't have much of a point, aside from its own(admittedly nice) aesthetics. Its vagueness and leisurely pace might bepleasant to some; I was frequently restless and found myself wishing the gamewould just get on with it already. Once you figure out what you're supposed todo, the actual actions or puzzles are usually fairly simple and uncreative. Again, I can'tstress how much I enjoyed the game's art, music, and quirky vibe. Hohokum isone hell of a screensaver. As a game, it lacks depth.", "date": "on Aug 12, 2014", "grade": "6"}
