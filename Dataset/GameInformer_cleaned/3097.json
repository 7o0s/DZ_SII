{"name": "Populous", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/populous/b/nintendo_ds/archive/2009/09/22/review.aspx", "text": "Populous is one of the most revered classics in all of gaming, and this DS remake retains the flavor of the original to a fault. Dropping divine wrath on the heads of your enemies' hapless worshippers and molding the land to better suit your desires--the only interactions you have with the game world--are still great hooks. Additions like the new miracle sets are also nice. Unfortunately, flaws that were non-issues in 1989 are less forgivable now. The erratic, jerky behavior of your worshippers, ultra-simple gameplay mechanics, and complete lack of story or context will be significant barriers for anyone, nostalgia or no.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
