{"name": "Data East Arcade Classics", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/data_east_arcade_classics/b/wii/archive/2010/02/09/review.aspx", "text": "In Data East Arcade Classics, Majesco and G1M2 have compiled several classic coin-op titles from the 80s and 90s originally created by now defunct Data East Corporation for quick hits of nostalgia. This arcade collection offers just over a dozen titles spanning a variety of genres from puzzle to action, and though fun at first, the excitement of playing these dated arcade games quickly wears thin. While there are a handful of games worth playing, the collection is weak at best. Some of the more notable games involve addicting burger assembly in BurgerTime, saving the president from ninjas in Bad Dudes, and no-holds-barred basketball in Street Hoop. Some of the other games, particularly action titles such as Heavy Barrel and Crude Buster expose the quarter guzzling nature of coin-op machines by throwing an unfair amount of enemies on screen at once. In this case you can ask a friend to join in on the action and fight through the hordes of baddies to get through the end. Data Easts action titles take about 15 minutes on a quick run to complete. Even though they can be fun the first time around, theres no real desire to go back for seconds, not even to unlock mediocre music soundtracks and other worthless gallery items. As far as the classic puzzle titles in the collection, with the exception of BurgerTime, the selection is pretty bland. Data East Arcade Classics runs for about $20, which is within range of other arcade collections. The only issue here is because of the genre mixing and limited selection, there may only be one or two games that you truly love that may not be enough to warrant a purchase of the whole disk. Unless youre a hardcore fan of BurgerTime, Peter Peppers Ice Cream Factory or Bad Dudes, youre better off saving your quarters.", "date": "zalez on Feb 09, 2010", "grade": null}
