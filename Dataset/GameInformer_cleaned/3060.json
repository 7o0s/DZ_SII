{"name": "Armored Core: For Answer", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/armored_core_for_answer/b/xbox360/archive/2009/09/22/review.aspx", "text": "For Answer's single-player campaign is a wasteland of poorly constructed levels and brain-dead mechanized adversaries. Playing with a friend in co-op doesn't add to the excitement. For some strange reason, you must wave goodbye to your friend to complete mandatory single-player levels before being able to join up in co-op again. If your interest lies in competitive multiplayer, For Answer's online battles are enthralling tests of twitch reflexes and intelligent engineering. The boost-filled controls are solid, the maps are built with specific mech types in mind, and success is directly tied to players diving into the insanely deep mech customizaton. Basically, play it for the multiplayer, or don't play it at all.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
