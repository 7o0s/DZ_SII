Our job is to snatchfour paintings using whatever means necessary. While the Mastermindand Ghost pick the side door lock and move into the museum,the Enforcer and I go up to the roof to get the lay of the land. Asecurity detail diligently patrols the galleries, while another guardsits behind the desk in the front entryway. We mark the targets sothe other two know where they are. The getaway van is idling aroundthe block, waiting for us to make our move. It doesn't takelong for the heist to head south. The entryways between galleries areguarded by laser detectors, and while doubling back, a security guardspots Ghost. He instinctively headshots the poor sap, and the gunshotechoes down the hallway. So much for stealth. Another guard trips thesecurity alarm and the entire building goes into lockdown. With allthe paintings now protected by metal bars, we need to drill into thesecurity room. The cops will be here soon, and we haven't evengrabbed our first painting.Welcome to the haywire world of Payday2, where almost nothing goes as planned and every job turns into alengthy exchange of bullets with local law enforcement. This sequelreinforces the addictive gameplay experience of the 2011 originalwith 30 mission types (instead of the last game's seven), a deeperskill/upgrade system, and the refined gunplay necessary to keep upwith the incessant waves of coppers gunning for your head.Once they set up shop in a safe housethat features interactive tutorials for teaching players the art ofthe heist, upstart criminals can look for work on Crime.net, aLinkedIn of sorts for people who would rather hold up coffee shopsthan get a free cup of java at a steady 9-to-5 gig. At the beginningof your illegal career, you only have a few jobs to choose from, butas you prove your worth, you gain access to more intricate anddifficult jobs with much higher payouts.After knocking off jewelry stores andbanks, I was soon involved in much more complex dirty work. Duringthe three-day art job, we broke into the museum to steal the preciousartwork, embedded small cameras into the frames to track the buyer (aprominent politician), then broke into his luxury apartment todownload sensitive information from his server. Other freelance gigsincluded stealing an engine prototype from an inventor, cooking abatch of meth during a drug raid, and laying waste to a mall to senda message to its owner. The mission diversity is a much-needed stepforward for the franchise.Completing a heist rewards you with theagreed upon fee (most of which goes into an offshore account youcan't touch), a loot drop, and XP that feeds into your RPG-likelevel progression. Each time you rank up, you gain an ability pointyou can spend on one of the four skill trees. The Mastermind has away with words and can talk a cop into laying down his weapon. TheTechnician brings gear like a faster safe drill and a sentry gun. TheGhost is a vital member if you want to take a stealth approach; hecan disable security cameras and alarm systems. The Enforcer can movefaster while carrying bags and use a portable saw to quickly breakthrough doors.Your ill-gotten gains can be spent on26 weapons, their varying attachments, and new masks. Weapons areunlocked for purchase as you level up, but getting good attachmentsrequires a bit of luck. You receive a new mask material, new maskcolors, or a new attachment during the post-mission loot drop. Youcan only purchase barrels, stocks, or sights after you receive them from this randomized system. These upgrades aren't cheap, either -oneweapon sight costs a shocking $240,000. This convoluted rewardstructure stands in the way of creating your favored loadout; evenafter 20 hours I still didn't have anything close to my ideal gunmodifications. The best way to play Payday 2 is withthree other friends; in my experience the teammate AI isn't savvyenough to keep up on the job. The AI-controlled characters can handlea gun, but oftentimes wander out of a building into compromisingsituations. You can order them to follow you, but they won'thelp drag the loot back to the car. This can double or triple thetime it takes to successfully pull off a job while under constantfire. Since the game punishes failure, offering only a miniscule XPbump for a botched job, dragging the AI into the fray isn't worthit. The enemy AI can be similarly harebrained; I caught several SWAT members cluelessly staring into oblivion in the middle of a police assualt.Payday 2 gives players the tools toattempt stealthy heists (some of which aren't accessible untilyou're well into the game's 100 progression levels), but goingthe Mission Impossible route requires a refined balance ofpatience, coordination, cleverness, and luck beyond that of thenormal player group. I'mcurious to see if anyone can successfully rob a bank or museumwithout resorting to violence, because we rarely made it past two-minutes without having cops arrive on the scene.Pulling off a frictionless heist is theexception to the rule in Payday 2, but the tension is still palpableas you try to orchestrate a robbery without getting caught, and theadrenaline flows steadily as you inevitably repel the barrage ofpolice waves while trying to make your getaway. The overly expensiveupgrade system and lackluster AI could use some work, butthe minute-to-minute action is thrilling enough to overcome thesecomplaints.", "date": "Aug 13, 2013", "grade": "8.25"}
