To some, it may seem brutally unfair and punishing. Toothers, it may be exactly the kind of competitive experience they have alwayswanted. Players must protect their own assets while attempting to steal fromothers to survive and thrive; it feels like a darker player-vs-player versionof 2013s Monaco while making some grim observations about the nature ofsociety. As a strange social experiment and multiplayer playground,The Castle Doctrine provides a genuinely interesting experience for thosewilling to look past the shoestring interface and visuals.The concept is simple:You start with $2,000 to spend on various defensive and offensive tools like walls,guard dogs, traps, guns, saws, wiring, wire cutters, crowbars, and more. Youcreate a lethal maze to protect your family and safe from other players whoinvade your home. You have to navigate your own death trap before moving on, soit must be possible to complete. There is an interesting assortment of items topick from and combine, and players that enjoy mazing and tower/dungeonbuilding games should find construction of the perfect death house enjoyable.With your home protected, you spend the leftover cash on tools to assist withbreaking into your opponents houses.Death is permanent. Onceyour character dies  which can happen as a result of a botched robbery or bybeing out of resources and committing suicide  you respawn with a freshcharacter, family, and $2,000. This concept of permadeath makes each and everychoice have considerable weight, and that weight only gets heavier as you accumulatewealth and growth during a characters life. The longer you last, the more agonizingthe inevitable death becomes. On each attempt, you have the option of seekingrevenge; the security cam lets you check out players as they maneuver throughyour traps, so you can write down the names of those who succeed and delivervengeance.The leaderboards displaythe current reigning champions and the success rates of robbers attempting tobreak into their caches. The closer to the top you are, the bigger a targetyour cache is, especially for hungry thieves with little or nothing to lose. Itsprobably a better choice to feed off the weak at first, and move up to thedangerous mansions after you have some practice and a robust sack of tools.As I became hardened fromeach gruesome death, I was inspired by other players trap factories and plannednew ways to get back at my own intruders. When you rob other players, you maypush them to virtual suicide. Its a good thing that the concepts are somewhatremoved from reality via heavily pixelated graphics, because this game isincredibly dark. Will you become wealthy and powerful on the corpses of fallenvictims? Will you seethe in silence planning the ruin of Jordan Michael Robertsor Hector John Herbert? Will you stop playing after losing everything?The Castle Doctrine is aplayer-driven PvP paradise of well-laid traps, vengeful voyeurs, and desperatethieves. The presentation and traditional aspects like graphics, sound, andinterface are rough around the edges, and it isnt deep enough to stayinteresting for long. Even so, The Castle Doctrine is an intriguing diversionfrom uninspired copycats and clones that often plague the industry. It wontsuit everyone, but I applaud its creativity.", "date": "Jan 29, 2014", "grade": "7"}
