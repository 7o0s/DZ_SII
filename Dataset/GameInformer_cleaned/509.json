We hear different accounts, look for clues, and see the policefollow leads  and we form our own conclusions along the way. The drive to shedlight on a mystery makes us want to search for answers. Silent Hill: ShatteredMemories designer Sam Barlow capitalizes on this in his first independent game,Her Story. Her Story is one of the most engrossing games I've played this year,and that's mainly because Barlow doesn't just hand players anything he forces them to search for it. In Her Story, your only job is to search a crime database bytyping in keywords that bring up archived video clips. Your focus is on thefictional 1994 interrogation of a woman regarding her missing husband, and the videosin the database are from seven different interviews detectives had with her. Keywords aren't hard to uncover. The game gives you afreebie (~murder~) and you go from there. Every keyword you type only brings upthe top five results, so you need to go through different avenues to discoverthem all, either by getting more specific or finding different keywords associatedwith the same event. You're not the detective on the case, but you're investigatingthe details for reasons that eventually become clear. I questioned how fun it would be to just type in words atfirst, but it holds a lot more depth than what appears on the surface. I wasobsessed with finding new phrases and details. During clips, the woman mentionsvarious people, places, and things. Not only does this inch you closer tofiguring out what happened, but they also provide new keywords to test out. WhatI loved the most was making a connection, and then typing it in to see an arrayof new videos to watch. Uncovering this flow of new information is when HerStory is at its best, but it eventually slows to a trickle. Later on, findingnew content becomes trial-and-error; once I exhausted my trail of topics, I hadto do some stabbing in the dark to unearth new leads.To Her Story's strength, the majority of the videos areengaging, making me want to press on even when I had to guess. Some scenes havehumor, while others contain twisted confessions. Not all leave you with greatreveals, and some just contain a single word. The fun is finding out if thatlittle clip means anything in the larger context of the narrative. Also, seeing a real person interrogated instead of apolygonal character makes it easier to connect with the story, helping you buyinto the scenario. The actress, Viva Seifert, nailed the role. It's not onlythe ~what~ and ~how~ she says things, but also her body language that forcesyou to question everything. Barlow did a good job at writing a complex mystery. He givesyou just enough to keep you invested, but he never spells out anything. Infact, the fragmented way the story is delivered works to its benefit. Thesubtlety of Her Story is what I appreciated the most, and drawing your ownconclusions gives you plenty to think about at the end. You get some clearanswers about what happened and why, but much is open to interpretation,casting doubt in my mind about my own deductions. That's how a mystery shouldleave you; even when people are convicted of crimes or proven innocent, wecan't always be sure it's the right outcome. Her Story forces you to pay attention in a waymost games don't. I didn't want to miss one thread. Every word said could be apotential new lead, the dates on the videos are essential for makingconnections, and even certain visual differences in her clothes and appearancehold clues. I reveled in every ~aha~ moment, feeling a sense of achievement forcatching even the smallest threads. For a more compact experience (about two orthree hours), it certainly sticks with you. Her Story is an intriguing experimentationin game narrative. Its vastly different approach to telling a complex story isreason alone to play it.", "date": "Jun 26, 2015", "grade": "8.5"}
