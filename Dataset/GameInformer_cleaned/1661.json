Rainbow Moon doesn'thave the triple-A production values or memorable story of most modernrole-playing games, and it suffers from its share of flaws. But it also hasdeep and enjoyable combat, which drives a campaign that will keep you busy longafter most retail games are collecting dust on your shelf.RainbowMoon gets off to an incredibly slow start, taking hoursto open up your first subturn (which allows you to perform more than one actionper move), gain your first new weapons and skills, and (finally!) recruit asecond party member. A few hours after that you'll realize it isn't justRainbow Moon's introduction that drags its heels. Every system in the gameunravels at a snail's pace, though each new addition to Rainbow Moon'smechanics makes the unending grind more fun. With a full party and a decent library of skills under your belt,combat is a wondrous strategic playground. Annihilating enemies with yourever-improving skills never gets old, and each new enemy type throws a wrenchin your increasingly complex war machine. Evenso, the answer to overcoming a difficult new enemy type is usually grinding.Thankfully, you gain experience at a satisfying rate, withmid-level enemies coughing up hundreds of XP at a time. Leveling up and buyingnew equipment provides sizable boosts to your stats; within an hour or two,those frightening new enemies become XP fodder that drop with just a few hits. Don'tworry, though; another temporarily overpowered foe will soon take its place.Unfortunately, Rainbow Moon's story doesn't evolve as the gameplaydoes. The story begins with your character's rival opening a portal thattransports you and a zoo's worth of enemy monsters to another world. Your goalis to save the peaceful planet from the predatory creatures and find a wayhome. How do you accomplish this noble feat? With endless fetch quests someof which have you running back and forth between NPCs multiple times during asingle mission. The story's light-hearted tone results in few laughs and plentyof forgettable characters and story threads. It's a shame; caring about mycharacters and quests would've have gone a long way toward making the grindmore tolerable. At one point I slogged my way through an endless,monster-filled dungeon just to retrieve an NPC's suitcase so he would join myparty. Tongue-in-cheek humor doesn't replace quality storytelling.In addition to the patronizing story, Rainbow Moon sports a few otherannoyances that grow as the game goes on. A food gauge requires you toconstantly feed your party members (or rest at inns), and serves no purpose otherthan pointless resource management. Torches brighten up dungeons, a simpleconvenience that has you constantly flipping through menus and visitingmerchants. Your multiple inventory systems are all unnecessarily limited,though you can buy more space if you've got the Rainbow Coins.In fact, you buy pretty much everything you need in Rainbow Moon:food to replenish your hunger bar, the services of a healer to replenish yourparty's HP and MP (which is cheaper than buying potions), new weapons, armor,and combat skills. Everything costs an increasing amount of Rainbow Coins. Youeven have to buy a license just to wear amulets, which must be purchasedseparately for each character at exponentially expensive prices. Then you haveto buy the actual amulets.These myriad, unnecessary expenses continually left me feelingpoor. This is probably the point, considering you can buy money packs on PSN(along with XP packs for each individual party member). I don't care if otherplayers want to buy the best gear instead of earning it, but it becomes aproblem when I feel hamstrung for not coughing up extra dough.Still, like all problems in Rainbow Moon, the answer to beingcash-strapped is more grinding, and the turn-based tactical combat remainsenjoyable throughout. There's a lot for old-school RPG fans to love in RainbowMoon, and the price of admission is a bargain. I just wish the story werebetter.", "date": "Jul 20, 2012", "grade": "7.75"}
