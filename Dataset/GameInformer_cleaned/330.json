Some players like knowing what toexpect, completing familiar tasks and fulfilling an explicit list ofobjectives. In Final Fantasy Explorers, you search a vast landscape doingmundane tasks, such as killing specific monster types, but the payoff comes inhow you turn your rewards into building your ideal character. Think of thisquest-based, resource-gathering structure as a less complex version of MonsterHunter with a Final Fantasy skin; the core experience is about striving for thenext big upgrade and reveling in all the Final Fantasy content. If you're a Final Fantasy fan, Explorers was made for you,as it takes iconic parts of the franchise and infuses them in each portion ofthe game. You can find materials to forge new gear, such as Sephiroth's attireto don on your customizable avatar. Classic bosses like Ifrit and Shiva keepyou on your toes. Fast travel is done using an airship, and you can buy itemsfrom Moogles. Exploring Amostra is exciting because you never know what classicmonster from the franchise you'll find roaming the field, such as Chocobos andAdamantoise. Trance mode also allows you to transform into popular characterslike Cloud and Lightning, but it's more a novelty than a super-move. The onlypart Explorers doesn't ape from the main series is an interesting story; thenarrative is bare-bones and inconsequential. The ties to Final Fantasy are a main part of the appeal, andthe quest-driven gameplay loop exists mainly to deliver all of the nostalgia.You select one main expedition to complete at a time, but can also do numeroussub-quests simultaneously. Completing quests earns you points, which can thenbe used to be purchase various abilities for your character and upgradeweapons. The quests themselves are basic, tasking you with taking down bosses,eliminating monsters, and collecting goodies on the field. They also allow youto reach new places in Amostra, from sandy beaches to fiery volcanoes. Beware,though, as Explorers' clunky UI can often get in the way of seeing what's outthere.The quests get repetitive quickly, forcing you into amindless routine with the goal of incrementally upgrading your character. Igrew tired of doing similar tasks over and over, and more variety would havehelped. On the bright side, the quests aren't long, although some require youhave a certain amount of money before taking them on. This can be frustratingwhen you want to spend your money on upgrading weapons and abilities, butinstead have to keep an untouched cash reserve to keep progressing.You have complete control over your avatar; you can changejobs in town and unlock many additional selections (20 in total, including theDark Knight and Samurai) along the way. You also can equip up to eightabilities at once, purchasing and upgrading only the ones you desire. Anyability you desire you can learn regardless of your job, but your customabilities are specific to the weapon you wield. I liked having the ability toexperiment and never being locked out of anything. For instance, I went withthe Knight class at first and constantly upgraded my sword attacks whenever Icould and loved seeing the damage multiply on tougher enemies, but that didn'tprevent me from picking up cure or fire abilities if I desired. That beingsaid, the custom abilities pack the bigger punch, so you're best to focus onthose. Explorers' greatest asset is how it makes you feel likeyou're always progressing. The more you do, the more that opens up. Forinstance, new weaponry becomes available to craft as you advance, and you'reshown the required ingredients to make it, giving you something else to trackdown on your travels. The game even has a monster fusion system, which becomesanother fun element for experimentation. After slaying certain enemies, you canpay to create them as a party member (bring up to three with you in battle). Youcan level up your monster allies and fuse them together for stronger combatants.Unfortunately, until your monsters reach high levels, they die quickly, (thoughthey eventually revive automatically). While the progression loop proves strong, the combat isdisappointing. It relies on more button mashing and spamming special attacksthan actual strategy (outside of running away from enemies before they attack).You have a special ability called crystal surge, which changes things up byadding elemental properties and other perks to your abilities. While battlesget tougher as you advance, don't expect the same level of difficulty ortactics you'd put into a big fight like in Monster Hunter. Through local oronline co-op, you can bring up to three friends in battle to slay beasts withyou, but it's nearly identical to the single-player experience. Playing withfriends is obviously more fun than relying on A.I. monsters, but it's not agame-changer. Final Fantasy Explorers never fully captivated me. Buildingup your character is fun and the Final Fantasy fan in me enjoyed all thecallbacks, but it didn't keep me invested. It gives you plenty to tinker with,but doesn't have the meat to back it up.", "date": "Jan 25, 2016", "grade": "7.75"}
