Following the revival of the Rock Bandfranchise in 2015 with Rock Band 4, the studio turned its eyes toward anothernew piece of hardware: the Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset. After releasingHarmonix Music VR, a collection of music-focused minigames, the developer calledupon its most recognizable IP, Rock Band.Rock Band VR combines familiar conventions with enough newelements to make the experience novel and exciting for fans of the genre.Taking full advantage of the technology, Rock Band VR puts players in thefirst-person perspective with little UI clogging up your view, a departure fromthe view in mainline Rock Band games where the concert video-style presentationis background to the prominent note highway. Instead, you're free to lookaround the stage, with the only UI appearing in a chord guide that floats abovethe crowd, and a combo meter on the head of your guitar. This new approachplays into the strengths of virtual reality, removing the barrier that existswith previous series between the player and the screen. When a song I love likeFoo Fighters' ~Everlong~ or Megadeth's ~Hangar 18~ comes on,it's difficult not to get into it. I found myself tapping my foot, nodding myhead, and even holding the guitar in a more stylish manner during my favoritetracks.I enjoyed being able to look out over the crowd as I playedthrough a set, but unlike the similar concept in Guitar Hero Live, the peopleyou're looking at are rarely interesting. The members of the crowd do thingslike try to take selfies or yell out at the stage, but the concept doesn't go farenough. What's worse is your bandmates, who feel more animatronic than human.Each time I looked over at my fellow instrumentalists, they did little morethan stand at their mic stands and sing along - save for some pre- andpost-song animations, like one where one of them smashes their guitar. One of thethings that made Guitar Hero Live's first-person perspective so much fun wasthe campy-yet-entertaining way that your bandmates and fans reacted to youduring the songs.Setup for Rock Band VR is surprisingly easy. You attach aspecial Oculus Touch holder to the head of a Rock Band 4 guitar controller andsync the controller to your PC. Once that's done, it's just a matter of gettingthe software up and running and learning the basics of gameplay through thetutorials.Despite using the same guitar controller, the core gameplayof Rock Band VR is drastically different from the rest of the series. Ratherthan playing along to specific colored gems on a note highway (that is reservedfor the peripheral classic mode), you improvise what you want to play using ascrolling guide that hovers over the audience. The guide doesn't tell you exactlywhat notes to play, but rather when you should change chords and chord shapes.Within this system, you also rack up points using different establishedcombinations of the various chord shapes. With no note highway, you're insteadscored based on how well you follow the guide.Jumping between bar chords, power chords, arpeggios, andmuted arpeggios is fun, especially when the song breaks those progressions upwith a solo. The guitar-solo mechanics borrow heavily from the mechanics ofRock Band 4's improvisational solo mechanics, so if you've played that mode,you know what to expect. However, players looking for a true challenge likeGuitar Hero and mainline Rock Band games might be disappointed; instead of thesatisfaction of completing a song, the main thrill of Rock Band VR comes withmaking songs sound good through your improvisation (trust me, you can make someclassic songs sound like garbage since the guitar sounds mirror your play).Playing through songs using this system is fun at first, butit falls flat quickly. Unlike the series' classic gameplay, Rock Band VR's coregameplay doesn't feature the same nuance from song to song. This means thatwhile a track like Stone Temple Pilots' ~Plush~ is drasticallydifferent from Dream Theater's ~Pull Me Under~ from both aninstrumentation and a structural perspective, the gameplay does not reflectthat massive gap between those two tracks. You can improvise to make them soundmore distinct, but the act of actually playing those songs does not feel asdifferent as it should.The setlist is made up of a diverse group of songs,featuring classic Rock Band favorites like Bon Jovi's ~Livin' on aPrayer~ and The Who's ~Won't Get Fooled Again~ to new additionsto the franchise like Kaleo's ~Glass House~ and The Pretty Reckless'~Heaven Knows.~ I love that these songs can be played in both the newimprovisation-based gameplay, as well as the classic mode with the notehighway. The modes play completely different from one another, so when I wanteda break from one style, it was great to be able to easily jump to the other. Ijust wish that classic mode had more going on than just a blank background thatdoes nothing to capitalize on the immersive properties of virtual reality.Multiplayer is one of the cornerstones of the Rock Bandfranchise, but Rock Band VR is strictly a single-player experience centered onquickplay and a short, forgettable story mode. I understand why the multiplayeris missing given the format of the VR gameplay, but without being able to playwith friends, the game feels like a half-measure rather than the full-blownRock Band experience that made the series so much fun in the first place.Stepping into the shoes of the lead guitaristadds a new layer of excitement to the Rock Band formula, and the new gameplaymechanics are fun to mess around with, even if it feels completely differentfrom the original gameplay style. Harmonix has always prided itself on givingplayers new ways to experience their music, and Rock Band VR succeeds in thatregard. Though lacking in content, Rock Band VR is a fun, new way for thelong-running series to let you live out the rockstar fantasy.", "date": "Apr 17, 2017", "grade": "6.5"}
