For its follow-up, Supermassive scales back and streamlines theexperience, offering a tense whodunnit mystery that is meant to be completed ina single sitting. As a result, Hidden Agenda doesn't pack the same punch as itspredecessor, but offers interesting innovations and thrills along its malleablenarrative.Hidden Agenda follows the efforts of homicide detectiveRebecca Marney (and a few colleagues) to track down and apprehend The Trapper,a serial killer with a penchant for rigging victims with deadly boobytraps. LikeUntil Dawn, players shape Marney's investigation via difficult choices andquick-time events, the results of which ripple throughout the branchingnarrative. Unlike Until Dawn, however, Supermassive has distilled the experiencedown to just the storytelling. You don't directly control characters or exploreenvironments at your leisure. In fact, you won't even touch your controllerafter the game begins.All of your interactions  and those of up to five friends are handled via Hidden Agenda's free companion app. The simple interface allowsyou to manipulate your own individual cursor on the television screen bydragging a finger across your phone screen to answer questions, activate timedevents, and search for hidden objects at predesignated moments. The app alsooffers up information such as character bios and decision recaps as the storyprogresses. The system works surprisingly well, and provides a satisfyingamount of agency over the story provided your phone battery can handle it; Ihad to plug mine in well before the credits rolled.I don't want to spoil any of Hidden Agenda's plot twists,but I was impressed with how differently my playthroughs turned out. My first onewas abysmal: The killer went free, innocent characters died, and Marney endedup in hot water. Avoiding the same mistakes in my second playthrough led toentirely new scenes and opportunities; not only did I save the day, but I endedup with a better understanding of the killer's background and motive thanks toclues I missed in my first attempt.Unlike the head-lopping antics of Until Dawn, many of HiddenAgenda's choices focus more on character relationships than deadly action, thoughlives are occasionally still on the line. Who you trust (and who trusts you)has a major impact on the ending, as simply identifying the Trapper isn'tenough you also have to build a case against the killer. While HiddenAgenda's narrative ultimately isn't all that grandiose or complex (and myknee-jerk assumption of who the killer was proved correct), I enjoyed the steadystring of minor revelations and risky options I was forced to choose between.Unfortunately, the competitive mode which periodicallygives players their own hidden agendas to complete without getting caught doesn't fare as well. Because the secret objectives are just randomly pulledfrom the regular story choices, they feel arbitrary and pointless, like havingMarney share her feelings with her captain during an innocuous conversation. Theyalso slow down the pace and detract from the plot players are trying to shape, sogroups are far better off sticking to the cooperative story mode.After multiple playthroughs, I still have mixed feelings aboutHidden Agenda's length, which clocks in around two hours. On one hand, Iappreciate being able to play through the story in a single sitting. This isdownright vital when playing with friends, since no one wants to come over tosit through half a mystery. However, the short runtime fundamentally limitsyour investment in the characters and world. The inability to return tocheckpoints or skip cutscenes on repeat playthroughs also hurts; I would loveto see how one or two key decisions might affect the outcome, but not enough toplay through the entire story yet again. Despite being more focused, Hidden Agendasuffers from more technical hiccups than its predecessor. Some characters lookunnatural and downright creepy, and the branching story leads to some rockytransitions in conversations.As someone who has grown increasingly wary of the roteformula most modern adventure games cling to, Hidden Agenda is another freshand worthwhile experience from Supermassive. It may not have the same impact orpolish as its predecessor, but it provides an evening of solid entertainmentand a great alternative to the standard choose-your-own-adventure fare.", "date": "Oct 24, 2017", "grade": "8"}
