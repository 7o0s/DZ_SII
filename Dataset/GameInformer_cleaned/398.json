Despite the weak premise and a few recycled environments, tighterwriting and some absurd scenarios make this the most entertaining episode yet.Escape Plan Bravo is so far my favorite episode so far, butthat isn't saying much. Most of the problems that have sapped my enthusiasm forthe overall experience are still present. Escape Plan Bravo is loaded withuninteresting dialogue options, pointless quick-time events, and inconsequentialchoices that stretch the definition of Telltale's choose-your-own-adventureformula. However, these notable shortcomings are slowly overshadowed by asteady stream of enjoyable moments, ultimately making this a satisfying leg ofthe journey.Escape Plan Bravo once again serves up another stylish opening-creditssequence (set to the synth-heavy '80s homage, ~To the Top~) that more potentlyconveys a mood and the personalities of the characters than any other scene inthe episode. These impromptu music videos have been my favorite moments in pastepisodes, but Escape Plan Bravo keeps on rolling, albeit at a less-than-idealspeed. Tales From The Borderlands is at its best when it subverts Telltale'stired adventure-game formula, and this episode has a wonderfully stupid andplayful shootout delivers the best action sequence of the series yet. Yourdialogue choices with an irate guard  while still meaningless from a branchingnarrative perspective  offer the best laughs. Other jokes (like an extendedface-pizza gag and a surprise Butt Stallion revelation) also hit the mark,making me chuckle more at Escape Plan Bravo than the last three episodescombined.Some genuinely emotional moments effectively punctuate thisepisode, though they are frustratingly void of choice  Telltale proves it canstill tug at your heartstrings from time to time, but it has to write you intoa corner in order to do so. That said, Escape Plan Bravo uncovers nice plot twiststhat got me more interested in the characters, if not their overarching goal tofind the promised vault. Gortys continues to steal the show in most of herscenes, but the Vallory and her henchmen lose much of their bite, and Vaughn isdisappointingly M.I.A. for the entire episode. The few interesting threads of Tales From The Borderlands havelittle to do with Borderlands; the superfluous loot system, action, and eventhe hunt for the mysterious vault hold no meaning to me anymore. However, EscapePlan Bravo contained enough bright moments to see the journey through to theend, and maybe even miss some of the more intriguing, multidimensional characterswhen it's all over.", "date": "Oct 23, 2015", "grade": "7"}
