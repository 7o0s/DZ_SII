Viewing this as the beginning of the franchises decline is an easy narrative to latch on to, but LittleBigPlanet 3 is a solid, infectious game that delivers the basics along with some new twists.Naturally, the very existence of Craftworld is threatened, this time by Newton  a neurotic, power-mad, talking lightbulb in a bowler hat. Like any LBP story, its a trifle fleshed out by charming dialogue and the series giddy, patchwork visual style. The narrative is mainly a device by which we meet the games major new feature: three new playable characters.Each member of the trio has unique abilities. Oddsock, a dog-like creature, is fast and can run up walls. Toggle is able to switch between large and small forms at the press of a shoulder button. Swoop is a bird capable of flight and daring dives. Sackboy also has some new tricks, including the pumpinator (a device that can blow and suck air like the accordion in Tearaway), a hat that can grab onto rails, and boost boots. LittleBigPlanet 3 is at its best when its playing with these new mechanics and characters, especially in two inventive, multi-level challenges towards the end of the game.I thoroughly enjoyed all the new characters. In fact, I wish the main story mode didnt end so soon after I unlocked them all. While you see the credits roll in around six to eight hours, many side-missions and challenges are waiting to be discovered  not to mention the series famously comprehensive creation tools. That said, its not a flawlessly executed experience. At times, the design feels a bit sloppy  am I really performing well, or am I just lucky? The uneven difficulty curve can also be frustrating; the game is fairly easy until the last fourth of the story mode, which ratchets up the action considerably. For all its inventiveness, LittleBigPlanet has never really delivered memorable boss battles, and that trend continues here.Of course, if you think you can do better, you have the chance. LittleBigPlanet 3 expands on the already-staggering creation tools of the first two games, which makes it easier to create isometric games, animate and create devices, and more. Ill be honest: this is the fourth LittleBigPlanet game Ive reviewed, and I remain completely useless at making levels. If you want a minute-long terrible NES-style platformer with four jumps, Im your man.Thats not a knock on the tools; they are easy to grasp  and now taught through a series of well-designed Popit Puzzle levels that strike a balance between tutorial and gameplay. Sony let some talented fans in on the games beta, and already there are some impressive levels, including one based on EAs Dead Space, complete with the opening spaceship crash cutscene. People will do great things with these tools  I just wont be one of them. For the lazy or merely dumb like myself, it guarantees that the game will have legs, with a steady stream of new levels and even new types of user-created games.LittleBigPlanet 3 is a strong showing for Sackboy and company, but one that points to the fact that  unlike Nintendos Mario, whos been reinvented many times over the years  this series future is likely to follow the arc of another Sony platformer, Ratchet & Clank, by settling into a comfortable groove. As a fan of the genre, Im fine with that  though this one doesnt make as many waves as the original did back in 2008.", "date": "on Nov 18, 2014", "grade": "8.5"}
