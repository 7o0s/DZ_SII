In Fabletown, a secret community in New York where famedcharacters conceal their true identities with magic, nothing is as it seems andeveryone has something to hide. Expect alcohol-indulging flying monkeys andformer heroes fallen from grace. The dark interpretations of these fairy talesare gripping and Telltale never forgets that hook. Plenty of merciless fights,foul language, and unfortunate circumstances unfold in the first episode when afellow Fable turns up brutally murdered. As sheriff Bigby (a.k.a. the Big BadWolf), you must solve the case with the strong-willed Snow (White) along forthe ride. The two have blazing chemistry, to say the least. The tale isn't happy, but it is intriguing due to itsmulti-dimensional, outrageous personalities. Characters got under my skin somuch that I thought they could never redeem themselves, but then a new insightwould surface and I'd second-guess why I hated them in the first place. Iwatched the Woodsman fight with the murder victim right before her death, callingher every vulgar name in the book. But when he later found out about her deathhe showed significant emotion, even toward Bigby, their long feud notwithstanding.Fable's biggest lure is controlling Bigby. For a leadcharacter, Bigby is as great as they come. He has plenty of swagger, but healso faces an interesting problem: trying to prove he's past his big bad ways.How do you convince people to trust you when at one point you tried to eatthem? Do you give up and use force, or try to show these Fables a softer sideof Bigby? That's a decision that Telltale allows you to make throughout.The choices don't just extend to dialogue. Telltale takesconsequences a step beyond its efforts with The Walking Dead by forcing youdecide between equally important crises. Telltale places important emphasis onthese, even stopping the action completely and letting you think before youmake your choice. It allows you to really consider the decision you're about tomake and weigh the positives and negatives. For instance, I had to decidebetween two different places to visit. One had Toad, who called to say he wasin trouble; the other place had hot evidence regarding the murder. Consequencescome no matter what decision you make. In another event, two suspects fled inopposite directions, and I had to decide who was more important to the murderinvestigation: The thug who was snooping around the investigation, or theWoodsman, who was last seen with the victim. These big choices are the shiningmoments of the episode. The decisions not only make events unfold differently,but make you second-guess and wonder about the outcome of the other, encouragingmultiple playthroughs. The fights are bigger, faster, and rougher than previousTelltale projects. The controls mirror The Walking Dead, with the face anddirectional buttons driving quick-time events. While the controls feelresponsive and forgiving, the action unfolds quickly, giving you little time toreact. You must dodge objects thrown at you, and at certain points the gamegives you options to pick up your own, like a bottle or pool stick, for viciousand satisfying hits. When you're not fighting, you're investigating. Thisinvolves researching the dead Fable using the magic mirror, tracking downsuspects, and examining various locations. Telltale struggled with making thepoint-and-click portions engaging in The Waking Dead, but it's improved here.Examining objects often allows you to catch characters in lies, giving you areason to explore. My only gripe is that investigation feels overly linear. Notmuch is hidden, and it turns into a click-every-possible-object to advanceplot. At least I was intrigued enough to piece together the clues. While the gameplay is still second-rate compared to thestory, Faith succeeds most because of its unpredictability. Even longtimeFables fans will be shocked by some of the revelations. I read the Fables comics - which aren't requiredfor this prequel - and was still blindsided. The episode ends perfectly,leaving plenty of intrigue on the table to bring you back. I've been agonizingever since, trying to figure out exactly what Telltale is planning after thisstandout opener.The EdgeThe PC version looks and runs better, with little in the way of load times. I also had an annoyance in the 360 version where the game would pause briefly to load some of the high-action fights. The PS3 version doesn't have as many load issues, but still isn't as smooth as the PC.", "date": "Oct 15, 2013", "grade": "9"}
