Entire levels slide and drop into place likestage scenery, a narrator moves the story along from scene to scene, and anunseen crowd gasps, laughs, and applauds throughout Kutaro's lengthy quest tothwart the evil Moon Bear King and save the stolen souls of his adolescent puppetbrethren.Ultimately, Puppeteer's goofy story is less important thanits cast of oddball characters. Armed with the legendary Calibrus (read: magicscissors), Kutaro snips his way through a zoo's worth of memorable boss animalson his way to confronting the Moon Bear King. Each of the evil ruler's dozengenerals is complemented by its own set of creative levels that culminate in a multistageboss battle. Don't be fooled by the wooden-doll character models, either;Puppeteer is a gorgeous game thanks to Japan Studio's exceptional animationwork and a diverse collection of environments that are packed with interactiveobjects. The boss fights are especially impressive, even if they rely onquicktime events too much.As beautiful as the visuals are, Puppeteer would fall flatwithout quality voice acting. The voice cast is more than up to the task,offering up humorous soliloquies, character impressions, and even a surprisemusical number without missing a beat. Stephen Greif steals the show as Puppeteer'soff-screen narrator, providing a level of enthusiasm and gravitas rarely seen(or heard) in video games. Some characters can be a bit hammy and annoying attimes, but their performances mesh with the bombastic onstage theatrics.In addition to its unique presentation, Puppeteer introducesa number of fresh gameplay ideas. After the Moon Bear King steals his woodennoggin, Kutaro must find and collect replacement puppet heads to stay alive.Kutaro can juggle up to three heads at a time and switch between them on thefly. Each head has a custom animation that can trigger helpful environmentalchanges, rewards, or bonus levels when performed in the right place. A few heroheads also imbue Kutaro with permanent abilities, such as a hook that can latchonto enemies and objects in the environment and a projectile-deflecting shield.Kutaro's fairy companion, Pikarina, adds another layer of complexity; youcontrol her with the right analog stick (or Move controller), and can use herto interact with certain objects and uncover secret gems. A second player canalso take over Pikarina, which provides a simpler gaming experience for casualco-op partners.Kutaro's magic scissors fuel Puppeteer's most uniquegameplay mechanics by allowing you to snip through all manner of fabric,webbing, foliage, and pretty much anything else gets in your way. You cancontrol the direction of your scissors, and cutting an object mid-jump causesyou to float for a second and propels you forward. This allows you to snip yourway through the air with ease provided you have a trail of floating paperclouds, falling feathers, or other sliceable objects to sustain your momentum.As neat as Puppeteer's snipping mechanics are, they do getrepetitive. Japan Studio does a good job of introducing new abilitiesthroughout most of the game, but you'll use each one a hundred times before theadventure ends. While the numerous boss fights each have their own uniquetwists, combat against the basic grub enemies is one-dimensional and dull. Ialso ran into a few unforgiving checkpoints, which made some already difficultsections of the game all the more frustrating. Even seasoned gamers will becomeintimately familiar with the continue screen.Despite a few setbacks, Puppeteer features all the entertainmentand creativity I've come to expect from Japan Studio. Sony has anotherexclusive title it can be proud of, and while Puppeteer may not take centerstage in the company's holiday lineup, fans of family-friendly adventures won'twant to miss it.", "date": "Sep 09, 2013", "grade": "8.5"}
