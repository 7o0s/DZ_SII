BravoTeam is one of the first sights to behold in the original Resident Evil. Jill Valentine,Chris Redfield, and the rest of the Alpha Team crew have little time toinvestigate what happened to their lost compatriots before they're forced toflee into a nearby mansion to avoid becoming puppy chow. Resident Evil 0, set aday before the infamous Mansion Incident, explores the journey of S.T.A.R.S.Bravo Team medic Rebecca Chambers and an unlikely ally through Umbrella's nastyfacilities. Capcom has given this prequel the same treatment as last year's HDupdate of the excellent Resident Evil GameCube remake, complete with moreaccessible control options.Resident Evil 0 is the last hardcore survival horror entryin the series, before the juggernaut Resident Evil 4 sparked a dramaticparadigm shift away from the demanding resource management, complex puzzles,and fixed camera angles. Rebecca teams up with fugitive Billy Coen as theyexplore a runaway luxury train, abandoned Umbrella Training Facility, and otherappropriately ominous locales that tie into the early RE games in fun ways. Controllingboth Rebecca and Billy, sometimes simultaneously, is a unique departure fromthe standard formula. The new control scheme - which eschews awkward ~tankcontrols~ in favor of characters moving in the direction of the analog stick -works wonders here, especially when controlling both characters with bothsticks at once. The more agile characters don't break the balance of the game,either, as sloppy play will get you chewed up by zombies or swallowed whole bymutant frogs.The original 1996 Resident Evil kicked off an early seriestradition of magically interconnected storage boxes. Before settling on thatdesign decision, Capcom experimented with not having themconnected, and instead tasking players with lugging all their guns and itemsaround the game with them. Resident Evil 0 returns to that concept, but insteadremoves all the boxes entirely, allowing players to leave items anywhere on themap. While it's initially liberating to quickly toss out your knife or anunwanted ink ribbon, the system can become tedious. Trying to angle yourcharacter just right to pick up an item can be tricky, especially if the new,optional zoomed-in widescreen mode cuts an item you're looking for out of theshot. Additionally, nearly as much time is spent swapping ammo and itemsbetween characters as exploring the creepy environments, which can hurt thepacing.Surviving Rebecca and Billy's journey through Umbrella'streacherous past unlocks Wesker Mode. This new feature, not included in theoriginal GameCube release, allows fans to play through the entire story as thesuper-powered Wesker (circa RE 5) and a mind-controlled Rebecca. Besides herred, glowing eyes and villainous outfit, Rebecca plays the same as in the maingame. Wesker takes Billy's place, including in-engine cutscenes where he syncsup with Billy's original voice acting and animations. Seeing Wesker implementedinto some cutscenes is a goofy bonus, but the real meat is finally controllingthe series' big bad guy in a core storyline. Wesker can dash aroundenvironments at comically high speeds, juking past enemies with ease. Controllingsuch a nimble character within a game designed with cautious, meticulous playin mind is bizarre at first. Wesker's Death Star ability breaks the difficultyin a delightfully absurd way, allowing him to charge up a laser-eye attack thatblasts out enough power to pop off every zombie's head in the entire room.Imagine Tetsuo's bloody hospital hallway scene from Akira and you're on the right track. The absurd new mode is a funpower-trip victory lap for longtime fans.This HD remaster of Resident Evil 0 is an easyrecommendation for anyone who enjoyed the original GameCube release and hasenough patience to navigate the sometimes tedious inventory management. Newfans of the classic survival horror formula that came on board following lastyear's Resident Evil HD Remaster shouldn't expect as tight of an experience,but one that's deserving of its place in the core franchise and fleshes outUmbrella's troubled history with dramatic flair.", "date": "Jan 18, 2016", "grade": "8.5"}
