{"name": "Far Cry 4", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/far_cry_4/b/playstation4/archive/2014/11/18/far-cry-4-review.aspx", "text": "TheFar Cry series, while generally being well regarded over the courseof its three main entries, hasn't stuck to a particular formula whenit comes to story or mechanics. Each game is set in a postcard-worthyopen-world setting, and allows you the freedom to approach objectiveswith tactics of your choosing, but little else carries over fromtitle to title. That boldness of vision stops with Far Cry 4, whichis content to riff off the successes of its direct predecessor. Thesetting and characters may be different, but the rhythms of theexperience stick to a familiar tempo. Replacingthe insufferable dudebro one-percenter protagonist from the last gameis Ajay Ghale, an American who returns to his fictitious home nationof Kyrat to spread his deceased mother's ashes. He doesn't even getacross the border before being drawn into the civil war between theestablished dictator Pagan Min, a silver-tongued maniac who wouldn'tbe out of place hosting ProjectRunwayorstarring in a Tarantino film, and a rebel group known as the GoldenPath, which excels more at in-fighting than it does inciting revolt.Ghale becomes the tip of the spear in this war for the nation's soul,single-handedly turning the tide in favor of the rebellion while itsalleged leaders argue between ideals of progressivism andtraditionalism.Unfortunately,that choice ultimately boils down to bad or worse, since both GoldenPath leadership candidates stubbornly cling to extremist ideals. Thismakes it hard to root for either of them.Ghale'sperspective, on the other hand, is tough to grasp. He thankfullyspares you the groan-inducing one-liners and general unlikability ofhis predecessor, but his personality is vacant - a cipher for theplayer to project onto. This approach fails largely because you haveminimal control over shaping his trajectory. Whether you want to ornot, Ghale spends time with a curious cast of characters, including adopey duo of druggy backpackers, a Bible-verse-spouting gun-runnermany may remember from Far Cry 2, and other unsavory elements thatmake you question what kind of person he is and where his motivationstruly lie.Itsleaders and expats may be hard to stomach, but the faux-Tibetancountry of Kyrat is the true star. This gorgeous and varied openworld mimics the vibrant tapestries of the region, brightly coloredwith mysticism, intrigue, and danger. Venturing into a largelyuncharted territory for open-world games, Far Cry 4 transportsplayers to a Himalayan setting pock-marked with winding roads,treacherous mountain passes, and snaking river lands. A destitutenation with few natural resources outside of its poppy fields,religion and political turmoil have a strong hold over the region,with Royal Army outposts everywhere and gorgeous Leshan-sized Buddhascarved into mountainsides. Thesquare mileage of this open world feels similar to Far Cry 3's RookIsland, but traversing the region is made easier with the inclusionof a gyrocopter and a grappling hook you can use to climb overelevated terrains instead of going around them. The copter became mypreferred method of transportation, largely because the cars aredifficult to handle on the default settings. Narrow roads and drasticelevation changes make driving hard enough; the Halo-like drivingcontrols that give you no independent control for direction or speedof travel make it much harder. If you run into trouble on the road,however, you can turn on the new autodrive feature or switch to amore traditional control scheme in the settings.TheHimalayan setting is breathtaking, but some pervasive cosmetictechnical hiccups can take away from its majesty. Coming over to thenew-gen systems, the Dunia engine developed originally for Far Cry 2is showing its age, especially when it comes to draw distances. Whileyou're flying across the landscape or speeding down a road, expect aheavy dose of pop-up.The countryside is packed with activitiesto pursue, though most of them are familiar to those who played FarCry 3. The major open-world activities revolve around capturingoutposts, gaining control of radio towers, hunting animals to gaincrafting materials, and performing your typical assortment of escort,hijack, and assassination missions. Animals don't just serve asdangerousdeterrentsin the open world; you can also hop onan elephant to wreak havoc on enemy encampments. The variety andvolume makes it easy to get distracted as you make your way to thenext objective. All too frequently I gleefully explored the questionmarks that pop up on the map or had fun using bait to turn a wildanimal onto a nearby enemy patrol instead of speeding to help thecause of the Golden Path. In these moments, the game shinesbrightest.Playerscan call in a friend to help with the side missions, but don't expecta challenge or much depth. With the main missions limited to a singleplayer, the only options duos have are the easy-to-complete sidemissions. Even capturing fortresses, which are essentially souped-upoutposts, is a breeze with two capable guns on your side. Cruisingthrough an open world with a friend is fun - I just wish there wasmore dedicated content or that we could share the entire adventuretogether.Adeeply entrenched progression system lies at the heart of everyaction you perform in Kyrat. Whether you are sticking to storymissions or helping out Kyrati citizens in need, everything feedsback to the skill tree, weapon unlocks, or cold hard cash you can useto buy weapon attachments, pay guns for hire, or upgrade the Ghaleestate with amenities like a helipad. These perks provide just enoughincentive to keep you engaged in the open world.Themulitiplayer tries to preserve the open feel of the campaign withlarge maps, but when only 10 players are sometimes vying for threeobjectives on a big map, the matches can be filled with down timeduring traversal. The concept, which pits the Golden Path armyagainst a band of mystical warriors who can use invisibility andcontrol of animals to compensate for their lack of modern weaponry,would have greatly benefited from a larger player pool, dedicatedservers, and a richer progression loop. Thehalf-baked co-op is disappointing and the game sticks to theconventions of its direct predecessor almost to a fault, but thewondrous Himalayan setting packed with activities still makes Far Cry4 a trip worth punching your passport. Come for the gunfights, andstay for theviscoushoney badger hunts.", "date": "Nov 18, 2014", "grade": "8.75"}
