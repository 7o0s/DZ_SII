The game's core concept - sendingpictures back and forth between your friends and guessing what they represent -is so simple that it's really hard to change it in any meaningful way. To boot,it's not even a new concept; all the original Draw Something did was create amobile and social implementation of the classic board game Pictionary. That'snot to denigrate OMGPOP's work on the original game. It was a clever interfacethat took great advantage of Facebook, the iPhone's touchscreen, andasynchronous multiplayer gameplay. Like millions of people, I was prettyaddicted to Draw Something when it first released. Then, like many, I grewtired of the experience and drifted off to other mobile games.With the release of the sequel,the question is: ~Can Draw Something 2 bring back lapsed players?~ Despite themany new features, the answer to that question is ~No.~ However, avid playerswill find that OMGPOP and Zynga have added some intelligently designedinterface options as well as some interesting social functions.The drawing interface has beenimproved with some nice new tweaks (like a slider than scales your pen or brushsize) and is generally cleaner and more useful than the first game's. Thedevelopers have also targeted more advanced artists with a host of new stamps,brushes, and pens to unlock. Pattern pens lay down stripes or checkerboardpatterns, and you can even buy a pixel pen with in-game currency to create yourown 8-bit style art. Users with the requisite art skills and the will to eithergrind or pay for these new tools will be able to create some impressive art. Unfortunately,people like me, whose art skills peaked in 6th grade, won't be able to takeadvantage of much of the new functionality. Also, both the paid and freeversion of the game nickel-and-dimes players by putting many of the coolertools behind a paywall. Obviously, you could spend the time to grind for thein-game coins, but it's going to take a long time to get everything this gameoffers.The new social functions areinteresting. Your home page is now an Instagram-style feed which shows offartwork done by your friends, other players, and celebrities like Carly RaeJepsen. Seeing the high-quality and elaborate artwork that skilled players canaccomplish with all of the tools unlocked in the game is great. You can alsoeasily share your pictures to your own ~My Drawing~ gallery, or quickly postthem to Facebook or Twitter.One of the big problems withDraw Something was the annoyance of friends who didn't do their part to keepthe match going. Now, there are community-wide daily drawing and guessingchallenges, which provide another way to earn coins when the people you areengaged in matches with aren't being responsive. I also like the addition of arandom match function, which pairs you up with another active mystery playerfrom the game's servers.In many ways, this is a qualitysequel. Despite that much of the new functionality must be unlocked throughgrinding or paying for coins, there is a lot to chew on for dedicated players.The new matchmaking and social functions also add a new level of engagement tothe experience. However, for those who quickly burned out on the first game,I'm not sure this is enough to get them to pick up their virtual art pad again.", "date": "on May 03, 2013", "grade": "7"}
