Even though Horizon'sending answered all the questions surrounding Aloy's past, players still wantmore of the intriguing post-apocalyptic world she inhabits  and Guerrilla isall too happy to oblige. Just in time for winter, The Frozen Wilds adds a largesnowy region, along with new secrets to uncover and mechanical beasts to slay. Whilenot a massive or vital expansion, The Frozen Wilds provides a welcome reason todelve back into the hunt.The Frozen Wilds seamlessly slotsinto Aloy's journey, opening up a sizable new region in the northeast corner ofthe map. This area is home to the Banuk, the isolated and nomadic tribe thatstrikes a balance between hunting the world's robotic animals (like everyoneelse in the game) and revering them. The Banuk didn't get a lot of screen timein the base game, and The Frozen Wilds shines a spotlight on what turns out tobe the most interesting faction in the series.Upon entering the region, Aloy isimmediately ensnared in the Banuk's plight; new breeds of stronger machines areemanating from an ominous mountain known as Thunder's Drum, and the tribe'sattempt to take it back has ended in heavy losses. Aloy takes it upon herselfto find out what's happening inside the mountain (the Banuk don't care much forhelp from outsiders), a quest that also promises more information on her shadybusiness partner, Sylens. While it has some loose ties to the main narrative, TheFrozen Wilds mostly contains its own mysteries and lore. The core storymissions aren't particularly long (you embark on about a half-dozen missions),but they take you on a well-paced narrative, and new acquaintances like thetribal chieftain Aratak and the machine-communing shaman Ourea defy common charactertropes. Aloy's allies are also better integrated into the gameplay, accompanyingher on several missions and evolving with the story.The Frozen Wilds' side missions anderrands are also worth undertaking, and offer better rewards than in the maingame. By helping various Banuk tribe members, you can attain new outfits and weapons,including the flamethrower-like forgefire and electricity-spewing stormslinger.A separate side-quest chain allows you to upgrade these new weapons intoformidable tools of destruction; the forgefire in particular can quickly meltthrough the HP bars of enemies if you're brave enough to stand toe-to-toe withthem, and an alternate attack allows you to lob fireballs from a distance. You'restill limited to four slots on your weapon wheel, but I happily made room for thenew arsenal, even if arrows are still your main attack method. Even without therewards, I was once again compelled to track down and read all the new collectible datafiles that The Frozen Wilds adds, a testament to Guerrilla's expertise in world-building.Guerrilla also succeeds in creatinga visually stunning locale to explore. What The Frozen Wilds lacks in environmentalvariety (I hope you like snow) it makes up for in focus. You can practically feelthe chill of the inhospitable snowscapes Aloy explores, which reverberates inthe Banuk's culture and their struggle for survival. You can also discover afew more geographic landmarks which root Horizon in the real world, another funaspect that drove exploration in the main game.Unfortunately, you mostly facefamiliar foes in The Frozen Wilds' new environment. The expansion only introducestwo new mechanical beasts: the canine-like scorcher and the bearlike frostclaw(plus a fireclaw variant). A new enemy-buffing tower is also added to the mix,along with tougher ~daemonic~ versions of the main creatures. The scorcher andfrostclaw are formidable additions to the food chain, and offer some great,end-game-worthy showdowns during The Frozen Wilds' story missions. In contrast,the other battles in Horizon's new region feel like more of the same.The new skill tree is alsodisappointing. Most of the new abilities are focused on allied machines, whichwere underused in the main game. However, boring abilities like scavengingsupplies while riding a mount and three(!) skills devoted to machine repairaren't going to change that. A few other skills offer quality-of-life upgradeslike more inventory space or the ability to break down mods and resources forcash, but they are all largely inconsequential. Ultimately, The Frozen Wilds is a welcomeaddition to Horizon. The mysteries residing in Thunder's Drum may not reach thesame heights as the main game, but they are a great reminder of how wonderfuland compelling Horizon is. The Frozen Wilds doesn't reinvent Guerrilla's newhit game, but I'll gladly accept the excuse to jump back into Aloy's world.", "date": "Nov 06, 2017", "grade": "8"}
