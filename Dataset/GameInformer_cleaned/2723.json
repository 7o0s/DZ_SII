Its combat,magic system, finishing moves, and various other gameplay mechanicsunapologetically ape God of War to the point where Kratos fans willfeel right at home in Lucifers den. Inferno mimics even the mostmundane and inexplicable tasks, like requiring the player to mash theaction button to open doors, cementing this titles status as abonafide God of War copycat.The result of this imitationhowever, is that by and large the game is fun to play; the combat istight and satisfying, and the finishing moves are brutally graphic.Despite being a poet in the source material, Dante is transformed intoa badass warrior, almost rivaling that of his Greek counterpart. Minoradditions to the formula, such as branching skill trees for learningnew moves, hidden relics that can be equipped to boost various stats,and the ability to condemn/absolve souls give Dantes Inferno someindividuality, even if its never fully realized.While thegameplay is largely unoriginal, Infernos story is unique to say theleast. Tapping a 14th-century poem as inspiration for a hack and slashaction title is enough to make even the most forgiving gamer cringe,but Visceral Games uses Infernos premise to good effect. The game isscandalous and over the top, but as controversial as the topless lustdemons and unbaptized spider babies might be, they are alsoentertaining and more or less justified  this is supposed to be hell,after all. Literature buffs will likely be offended by the manyliberties taken with the source material, but if you can get over thestory compromises made for the sake of gameplay, Infernos creativitymay pleasantly surprise you.The classic work serves as more thana starting point for the game. Your ability to judge characters thatDante meets in the original poem (which are used to independently levelup your Holy and Unholy powers), and Virgils monologues add someauthenticity in light of the sweeping story changes. The poem alsoinspires the games vision of hell, and fortunately the developerspulled no punches in bringing their interpretation to life. Althoughthe level of detail for the character models is oftentimesunderwhelming, the early environments are unique, twisted, andmemorable. The game lacks the brilliant level design of the God of Warseries, but there are times when Dantes Inferno faithfully recreatesdescriptions from the poem, resulting in some remarkable sights.Infernosultimate sin is that the game cant sustain its early pace. Of its ninecircles of hell, the first three  Limbo, Lust, and Gluttony  containthe games best ideas and most impressive creative vision. Latercircles offer memorable sights as well, but for every river of boilingblood or ride on the back of Phlegyas there are a dozen drawn-outbattles against groups of recycled enemies. After the varietyintroduced in the beginning, it was disappointing (and nonsensical) tosee the same enemies popping up again and again in later circles,requiring little in the way of fresh tactics to beat.Thisproblem ironically culminates in the circle of Fraud, which is composedof 10 different challenges in identical arenas. Each challengeintroduces a different element, but most can be beat with either yourheavy attack or projectile combos. Despite the plethora of moves tounlock, these two techniques will get you through the vast majority ofthe battles youll face, making the game feel like more of a grind thanit has to be.Dantes Inferno features some interesting aspects(like its combat), but early innovation loses out to repetition. Thegames biggest strength  Viscerals recreation of hell  wanes duringthe second half. Some entertaining unlockable content adds to thereplayability, but for most gamers, Inferno doesnt have enough newideas to warrant a return trip through hell.", "date": "Feb 03, 2010", "grade": "7"}
