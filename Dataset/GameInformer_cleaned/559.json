Lastyear, Dark Souls II's comparatively softer introductory hours allowed a newsect of fans to learn what makes the series so punishing and rewarding (read our glowing review). TheScholar of the First Sin edition retains the spirit of Dark Souls II, whileupdating the visuals to current hardware standards, rearranging enemies anditems, and packing in the previously released DLC content.At a glance, the dreary world of Drangleic seems the same asit did in the original, but little touches offer surprises of varying degreesto returning players. For example, a once-quiet river now has a deadly giantlumbering through it. A spire that once housed a single knight is now occupiedby a dragon (a beast found much later in the original iteration). One encounterinvolves a big pack of undead soldiers filing out of a doorway like a deadlyclown car - a lethal surprise for both newcomers and foolhardy veterans.One of Scholar's most fiendish surprises is relocating avery important ring. The Ring of Binding, which softens the HP penalty forbeing undead, is a must-get unless you're among the most hardcore Souls players.The trek to the ring's original location is supremely punishing, and then FromSoftware smacks players in the face by relocating the item. The rearrangedenemies and items offer a neat twist, but ultimately feel more like a MasterQuest-style bonus mode rather than a marquee feature. Dark Souls II's originalenemy layout and pacing makes it the better way to play for first-timers,though unfortunately that's not an option in Scholar of the First Sin.You can now be invaded and aided by one more player of either alignment, bringing it up to six total playersPlayers who missed out on Dark Souls II's terrific DLCofferings are in luck, because all three Lost Crown packs are incorporatedhere. I love the enigmatic environmental puzzles, battle with a huge dragon,and other cool elements included with this post-release content. Having theseadd-ons available from the outset is great - even if you have to earn thataccess by fighting your way to them.Dark Souls II looked great on last-gen hardware, but theoccasional muddy texture or slogging framerate slightly detracted from theexperience. The current-gen -iterations of the game give the entire visual sidea re-invigorating shot in the arm. The silky frame-rate smooths out the processof using the camera to pan around the environment or track enemies.Scholar of the First Sin is best suited for two types ofplayer: Complete Souls newcomers that insist on playing with the latesthardware, and returning warriors who soaked up every bit of new game-pluscontent loaded into the original. While I don't think the encounters are quiteup to the level of the original, it's hard to argue with more of one of 2014'sbest games.Editor's note: Thisreview is based on the PlayStation 4 version of the game.", "date": "Apr 07, 2015", "grade": "9"}
