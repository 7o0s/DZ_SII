{"name": "Bayonetta", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/bayonetta/b/ps3/archive/2009/12/22/review.aspx", "text": "All of the ridiculous hijinks reserved for over-the-top cutscenes inmost games are right at your fingertips during every moment ofBayonetta.  Breakdancing and firing off a flurry of bullets,teleport-kicking your enemies from a magic portal, and summoningenormous lethal devices from thin air are just a few of the moves inyour standard arsenal  and thats before things get really crazy.However, dont let all of the games showboating fool you into thinkingthat it is devoid of substance; with a fluid combat system andincredibly responsive controls, Bayonetta delivers improbable actionwith unprecedented style.You may be slightly overwhelmed atfirst. With foes coming at you from all directions and magicallycharged attacks firing off everywhere, it can be challenging to makesense of the chaos. Once you master the intricacies of battle, however,youll be conducting the flow of destruction like a symphony. Perform awell-timed dodge to initiate a few seconds of slo-mo, lay into thenearest creature using your sword and boot-mounted shotguns, thenfinish it off by conjuring a medieval torture device. Not only arethese combos visually stunning and endlessly entertaining, theyre abreeze to execute thanks to the precise controls.The EdgeThere is no contest between the two versions of Bayonetta. If you havethe option, play it on Xbox 360. When compared side-by-side, the PS3release clearly falls short in visuals, framerate, and loading times.These technical hiccups dont degrade the experience so badly that itfeels like a different game, but theres no reason to put up with themif you dont have to.Anyone familiarwith the Devil May Cry series will feel right at home with Bayonettascontrol scheme. That shouldnt be a surprise; Bayonetta director HidekiKamiya created Devil May Cry while working at Capcom. Now with PlatinumGames, Kamiya has refined the genre he helped invent by pushing it tothe limit, giving players a ludicrous amount of power and flexibility,and making each stage a playground to showcase their prowess. Eachenemy type requires different tactics to defeat, which gets especiallyinteresting when they start appearing in mixed groups in enclosedspaces. Most of the bosses  which are amazing in both scale and detail require quick reactions and your undivided attention to take down.Providing you dont set the difficulty to easy automatic mode (whichcan literally be played with one hand), youre in for a satisfyingchallenge, though it certainly isnt as unforgiving as the likes ofNinja Gaiden or Devil May Cry 3.Though you can expect a lot fromthe combat in Bayonetta, the same cannot be said of the story. Thegames nonsense plot is only important insofar as it occasionally pitsBayonetta against her nemesis and fellow witch, Jeanne. Along the way,Bayonetta struts her stuff and spouts various tawdry and suggestivephrases. Thankfully, the sexuality is so comically overblown that itnever takes on the creepy voyeuristic qualities of games like Dead orAlive. This title is conscious of its own silliness, and treats itsleading lady and her exploits with an appropriate tongue-in-cheek tone.Notevery high-heeled step of the way is a right one; the weakest points ofBayonetta are the handful of one-off sequences that replace thenormally taut battles with shoddy and repetitive novelty gameplay.Driving a motorcycle or blasting flying enemies while riding a missilemay change up the routine, but the segments last too long for howpoorly they control. People will play Bayonetta because they want aparticular brand of action, and that doesnt include lame andsimplistic turret gunning. The sequences arent numerous enough to killthe mood, but they are back-loaded; parts of the final chapters  whereyou should be exercising the full extent of your power  are bound tothese mediocre events instead of the combat the game does so well.Whenyoure chaining combos together, switching between weapons, andpunishing otherworldly opponents, Bayonetta is the epitome of itsbreed. It isnt so much an evolution of the genre as a well-tuned andhighly polished culmination of its history. From this point forward,something about stylish action games will need to change, because Ihave trouble imagining how a developer could use the tried-and-trueformula to create anything more delightfully excessive than Bayonetta.", "date": "Dec 22, 2009", "grade": "9"}
