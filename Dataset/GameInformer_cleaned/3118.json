Who thought that building a terrible low-budget strategy/RPG around a toy line that hasn't been relevant for a decade was a good idea?Zoids Assault is a cheaply done paint-by-numbers job, from the awful presentation to the turgid strategic gameplay and the horribly shallow RPG-lite customization options. Even for die-hard Zoids fans who could put up with the lame gameplay (there's probably one, right?), there's very little content beyond the short plot to play through.The overwhelming bulk of gameplay is poorly executed crap that hews tightly to genre conventions, but there is one lone interesting mechanic. The more scanners you have on an enemy unit (more or less meaning how many of your mechs are facing it within weapon range), the more of your units will assist in any attack on that enemy. It's a neat way to push players toward using actual tactics and teamwork rather than simply blasting away with whatever's handy.I am not exaggerating when I say that any of the many Front Mission games will serve your giant robot strategy/RPG needs far better than Zoids Assault ever could. Don't waste your time here.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "5"}
