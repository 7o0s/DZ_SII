By the time the fifth episode starts, weve seen him avoid certain death from a dragon, claim a throne, and lose (then reunite with) a child  and those are just the highlights. These pivotal events have taken place in flashbacks, with Graham retelling the stories to his granddaughter, Gwendolyn. Along the way, weve witnessed the hero transform from a nave youth to a middle-aged ruler. In the final chapter of his story, our hero has to reconcile his determination to go on one last adventure with his fading memory and aging body. Its a bittersweet ending to the series that caps it off on a hopeful note.We knew that King Grahams tale was drawing to a close from the outset. Hes largely bedridden when we reunite with the character, and over the course of each chapter his health has waned further. However, his magic mirror has promised one final adventure, and Grahams determined to see it through.Weve traveled throughout Daventry during the game, and the final chapter sticks close to Grahams kingdom. The locations are familiar, but theyve transformed over the years. Ive grown fond of these places in the hours Ive spent with the game, and the return trip was filled with little surprises. Graham has to navigate a tunnel that previously required a lantern; now its been overhauled with lights as part of a civic-improvement initiative. Old friends also return in various forms, and I was glad to see them again.Grahams always been one for embellishment, which has been one of the funniest parts of the games. Players who tried doing weird things were often rewarded with Christopher Lloyds stammering that, now that he thinks about it, that wasnt how it happened. This time, his retelling is unreliable because of his memory loss. A few puzzles center on his inability to keep his facts straight, and even though these inconsistencies are played for laughs, its sad to see our once-proud hero in this state. Some areas are blanked out, as Graham cant recall the details. And in one panic-stricken moment, he desperately tries to embellish moments from previous chapters so theyre more interesting. Gwendolyn does her best to calm Graham down and get him to tell the stories as they actually happen. The two characters have had great chemistry from the beginning, and their interactions are particularly sweet here. A storytelling handoff happens later that ties things together beautifully.The Odd Gentlemen have done a fine job with its storytelling, though the puzzles and the ways theyve been incorporated in the tale have been inconsistent. I thought the previous chapter leaned too heavily on them, and while theyre still abundant in the conclusion, they fit well overall. Another fun escape-room style section requires careful observation and exploration. The final section is a puzzle-heavy showdown with the villain that is satisfying and interesting. The only real misstep is a retread of an earlier music-box puzzle that I had to brute force my way through, thanks to poor in-game lighting, my TVs color calibration, or something else.This marks the last full episode of the Kings Quest season, and Im relieved that it ends on what actually feels like an ending. There have been some great treats for longtime fans throughout the previous chapters, but The Odd Gentlemen rewards that loyalty. Some players might find a couple of moments on the corny side, but without spoiling anything, I was absolutely delighted by it all.Im sad that this marks the end of this retelling of King Grahams adventures, but Im also excited about the seeds that have been planted. Graham and his successors will live on in our imaginations, and I think thats the kind of legacy that hed want.A King's Quest EpilogueChapter 5 ends on a satisfying note, but Sierra has an epilogue in the works for those who bought the games Complete Edition. Sierra isn't sharing details on where the epilogue is set, how long of an experience it offers, or if it even includes playable content. In the meantime, The Good Knight feels like a conclusion.", "date": "Oct 27, 2016", "grade": "8"}
