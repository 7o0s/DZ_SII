{"name": "Pokmon SoulSilver", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/pokemon_soulsilver/b/nintendo_ds/archive/2010/03/15/review.aspx", "text": "Game Freak has a large portfolio of Pokmon titles that have met tremendous success despite the fact they dont take major leaps in innovation from one entry to the next. If youve played one Pokmon game in the series, youve essentially played them all. Battle across vast expanses of tall grass to beef up your Pokdex. Challenge gym trainers region-wide and pummel their Pokmon to collect precious badges. In SoulSilver, its no different. As a remake of the Game Boy Colors Pokmon Silver, youll tread the same map locations and experience the same storyline. However, even though youre replaying a game that first debuted nearly 10 years ago, watching a Pok Ball rock back and forth on a possible capture will still make you hold your breath until you hear the satisfying click. Nostalgia may not be enough for some players to give SoulSilver a go, thus the addition of the bundled Pokwalker is certainly welcome. The Pokwalker is a fun, hands-on alternative to the in-game Pokmon Day Care that will allow you to level Pokmon who may not be ready to battle in their current state. Similar to the Pokmon Pikachu pedometer that interacted with the Game Boy Color back when Silver was released, the Pokwalker allows you to easily transfer collected Pokmon via infrared to and from the device. Once a Pokmon is stored, the player can earn Watts based on how many footsteps are taken, which is the currency needed to participate in Pokwalker minigames that allow you to collect rare items and capture hard-to-find Pokmon. Once your stored Pokmon is returned to the game cartridge, a cute animated story will be told on the DS screen noting dates and times you went for walks, times you were idle, instances of Pokmon encounters and battle results. Did I mention its really cute? Upon return, your Pokmon will earn a level increase as well. With the ability to gain new items and Pokmon, and opportunities to level-up your existing Pokmon without the usual grind, the Pokwalker is a solid addition to any trainers toolset. Its also a pretty decent pedometer if youre looking to keep track of your activity levels.The standard wi-fi connectivity options that have appeared in some of the more recent Pokmon games are available to interact with trainers around the world and trade Pokmon to boost your collection. The only other notable addition is the inclusion of Pokathlon games, a series of single-player minigames that make complete use of the touch screen. Though a minor inclusion, the Pokathlon is just one more change that separates this game from the original source material.Silvers timeless gameplay combined with the Pokwalker and extra minigames makes the decision to catch them all over again a no-brainer. Even though the classic Pokmon formula still works as evidenced by SoulSilver, I cant help but hope for a new Pokmon title that breaks some new ground.", "date": "zalez on Mar 15, 2010", "grade": "8.5"}
