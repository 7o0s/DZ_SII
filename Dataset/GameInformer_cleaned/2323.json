In Episode 2: Get Tannen, Marty McFly must travel back in time to correct alterations to the time stream, and save his town from an oppressive mob rule. Fortunately, I dont feel a need to travel back in time and stop myself from playing this nostalgic romp. This series sadly lacks episode recaps, so here is the refresher. After Doc Brown gets tied up in a 1930s bootlegging operation and thrown in prison for arson, Marty travels back in time to rescue his friend and mentor. Episode two picks up after Marty has freed Doc from the back of a police wagon and the duo travels back to their own time. Unfortunately, the pairs meddling has resulted in a future that is controlled by the Tannen gang, so Marty and Doc hop back in the DeLorean and travel back to 1931 to prevent the assassination of Martys grandfather and send the notorious gangster Kid Tannen to prison, as has occurred in their original timeline. This time paradox dilemma harkens back to the classic movie trilogy, but the gameplay fails to take full advantage of this crazy scenario. Aside from one puzzle where you hide from your past self, you could almost forget that there is another version of Marty running around this world. Most of that world is constructed from repurposed environments found in the first game, but you do get to scope out a few new sections of town and meet a few odd but lovable Hill Valley characters. Unfortunately, movement within the world still feels a little stilted and Id love to see a more organized inventory system. Most of the games puzzles are fun to solve, and its exciting to watch their solutions play out, but matching your inventory to objects in the environment is rarely a challenge and the game falls back on the same gimmicks all too often. One sequence, involving finding the right mood music to get a depressed police officer to talk with you, felt particularly overdone. While Id love to see this series sparkle with a little more creativity, Telltales Back to the Future adventure series remains a short but sweet tribute, and the games cliffhanger ending ensures that Ill be back for Episode 3. If you want to know more about Telltales Back to the Future series or havent played the first episode, check out my review of Episode 1 here.", "date": "Feb 16, 2011", "grade": "7.5"}
