The first episode ended on a startling cliffhanger, leaving thesecond, Smoke & Mirrors, with some big shoes to fill. While still engaging on its own, without anygroundbreaking decisions or exciting sequences, Smoke & Mirrors feels alittle empty. Smoke & Mirrors slows down the action from the firstepisode to deliver more about Fables' universe and introduce a slew of newcharacters. It gets you out in the world to explore as you resume yourinvestigation to track down the Fable murderer. The transition is engaging,especially seeing how twisted the Fables' world is, with strip clubs and fairytale characters forced into prostitution. Episode 2 also explores more of theclass division between certain Fables - something I'm hoping continues, as itfurther explains how some went down such a dark path.My biggest gripe is that this episode debuts too manycharacters without letting them find their place. For instance, the infamousJack from fairy tales such as Jack &Jill and Jack and the Beanstalkmakes his debut, but is little other than annoying. On the other hand,expansion of characters like Ichabod Crane is a welcome addition, especiallyconsidering his role in the comics. Crane's writing is well-done, keeping youquestioning his motives but wondering if he's just misunderstood at the sametime. I can only assume that the under-developed characters will get moreopportunities to grow in future episodes, but their roles feel half-baked fornow.Smoke & Mirrors' gameplay is more barren than theprevious episode, and it takes a toll. Remember those cool time-stopping, bigdecision moments from the first episode? Episode 2 doesn't feature a singleone. To make things worse, the decisions you did make last time don't seem tomatter; outside of your treatment to certain characters, like Beauty andBeast's dilemma (which isn't particularly exciting), you don't see ripples fromyour previous actions. I hope more hard-hitting consequences appear in futureepisodes because right now the scope of the decisions feels miniscule.Smoke & Mirrors also focuses on relationship-building,which is more about proving yourself to certain characters. This is donethrough interrogation sequences. Can you question a child without being tooforceful? Will you break stuff around a strip club to get answers? As the BigBad Wolf, should you physically harm someone to find what you need? Telltaleplaces these choices in your hands, but sometimes they feel too guided. Forinstance, instead of giving you an option to break one or two things, you havea handful. It starts to make you think the developers want you to behave in acertain way. Being repeatedly offered similar decisions makes the process loseits luster. You're still investigating murder scenes, but it feels asthough connecting clues has been dumbed down. Telltale places the answers rightin front of you. What's going on is obvious, but you need to confirm it throughdialogue and clues numerous times. This was done better in episode one, whereyou were connecting what happened to Toad, but piecing it together wasn't asin-your-face-obvious as it is in this episode's investigations. I was let down by how slow-moving Episode 2 is; it feelsmore like a bridge in the story than a complete chapter. Still, I can't denythat the world and the mature tone are captivating. The latest chapter doesn't tarnishmy enthusiasm for where the story's going, especially with a new cliffhangerthat leaves you just as concerned and stunned as the last one. I still can'twait to see where Telltale goes as it explores more of the seedy world ofFabletown, but Episode 3 needs to cover more ground. This episode hardly fails though; the ~that'smessed up~ reactions that hit during this episode are its strongest offerings,making it worthwhile. I just wish it had a little bit more meat on its bones.The EdgeThe PC still trumps the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions when it comes to visuals and load times. Waiting for new scenes or smaller loads within them was pretty equal between the PS3 and Xbox 360. However, the PS3 still outshines the 360 slightly in the graphics department.", "date": "Feb 05, 2014", "grade": "7.5"}
