A wonderfully diverse selection of job classes and the novelBrave/Default system breathed new life into the turn-based battles, but theadventure was dragged down by its abysmal exposition and a repetitive campaignthat required playing through the main story five times in order to reach asatisfying conclusion. Bravely Second only manages to shore up some of itspredecessor's problems, but the rich combat continues to shine.Bravely Second takes place a few years after the events ofthe first game, in a newly united Luxendarc. Agnes, now pope of the CrystalOrthodoxy, has brokered an alliance with the religious order's long-warringrival, the Duchy of Eternia. Before the treaty can be signed, however, amysterious new villain named Kaiser Oblivion kidnaps Agnes and declares hisintent to destroy the world. Returning heroes Tiz and Edea Lee team up with twonew characters to save the day: Magnolia, a monster-hunting warrior from themoon, and Yew, Agnes' happy-go-lucky bodyguard who failed to protect her thefirst time around.Unfortunately, the opening hours of the new quartet'sjourney are a real drag. Grinding your way through random encounters isrequired almost immediately thanks to a few cheap boss battles, and withoutside missions to earn new jobs at this stage, you're stuck using basic attacksand guzzling potions for health. I enjoyed very little of my first six hours orso with the game, as I burned through tutorials and became reacquainted withthe world and characters.Once Bravely Second started introducing new job classes,however, I quickly fell back in love with the combat. The ability to mix andmatch a primary skill set, a secondary skill set, and a sprinkling of randomsupport skills for each character allows you to design the party of yourdreams, while also experimenting with new builds whenever you see fit.Assembling a crew of beastly warriors and wizards and then steamrolling yourway through fights never gets old, and kept me interested in progressing evenwhen the story did not.Thanks to Bravely Second's victory streak mechanic, thumpingunderpowered foes is also lucrative. This new system allows players to queue upmultiple waves of enemies during random encounters, which doles out massivecash, XP, and job point bonuses at the end of the match. The streak ends if your enemies are alive to take their first turn, and figuring out how to game  or outrightbreak  the system is half the fun (hint: Rangers and red mages go welltogether). The victory streaks drastically hasten the grind for higher levelsand new abilities, alleviating one of the major faults of the first game.Instead, the biggest grind in Bravely Second is the story.Quests still require you to backtrack all over the map only to listen to inaneconversations that drag on for far too long. I don't mind the series'tongue-in-cheek humor, but it constantly undermines the drama. It's hard totake all the betrayal and tragic backstories seriously when Yew is constantlyproclaiming that the next battle will be his ~coup de gravy.~ The side questsare even more absurd. Each one puts you in the middle of a conflict between twocharacters sporting new job classes, then forces you to choose between them.You only receive the job of the character you defeat in battle, which creates adiscord between where you want the story to go and which job you want to addto your roster. I would have loved to help the reformed thief protect the watersupply of his poor, desert-dwelling brethren from an unscrupulous red mage, butI also wanted his Mug ability to relieve bosses of their high-end items, so down he went. After a few side quests, you realize that your decisionsdon't actually matter from a narrative standpoint (everything always works out), so you're free to pursue the jobsthat interest you most.As with Bravely Default, a mid-game event in Bravely Secondresets the world, tasking you with completing all the missions a second time.That you only have to play through everything twice instead of five times mayseem like little consolation, but the return trip is a drastically abbreviatedand slightly enhanced experience. Most side quests allow you to skip past theboring dungeons and get to the boss fights quicker, and the new choice formatallows you to fight a different opponent and gain a new job (unless you makethe same choice again for some reason). You also run into new and tougherenemies during random encounters, and are privy to some new conversations (whichstill aren't really worth your time). The mid-story reset is still a lame wayto extend an already lengthy game, but everything comes together with asatisfying run of final bosses that are challenging without being cheap. Asdumb as the story is, I couldn't help but smile at where all the characters endup.Even with 60+ hours' worth of gameplay, some parts ofBravely Second's skeleton are still surprisingly bare. The dungeons offerlittle more than a few treasure chests and basic switch puzzles, and asurprising number of environments  both dungeons and cities  are recycledfrom the first game. At the same time, the story is bloated with sappy andoften pointless conversations. While trying, these shortcomings did little todampen my enthusiasm for creating the perfect party and charging them intobattle. The Bravely series is still in need of a deft editor, but the combatsystems reign supreme.", "date": "Apr 14, 2016", "grade": "7.5"}
