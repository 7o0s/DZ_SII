Thedungeon crawler/dating sim hybrid has you wooing girls to conceive powerfulchildren to fight evil. Games don't need to take themselves seriously, butConception II doesn't have any endearing goofy charm; it comes off as an otakufantasy rather than a fun RPG. Ignoring the risqu visuals and in-your-face sextalk, Conception II simply isn't entertaining. The dungeons are boring, thecombat is repetitive, and the story and characters are ho-hum. Yourcharacter is kind of a big deal. He attends an academy with the mission oftraining young people to fight the monsters in the world. He quickly earns thenickname ~God's Gift.~ Everyone praises him. Girls flock to him. Guys want tobe him. Players are constantly encouraged to build relationships with otherfemales and ~classmate~ with them to produce new ~star children.~ The gameclaims it's not ~real sex,~ but that doesn't stop developer Chunsoft fromtreating it as such. Your tots refer to you as daddy, and the classmatingscenes simulate an intimate encounter. Your partners arch their backs, and thesilhouettes outlining their body parts don't leave much to the imagination.This can be awkward, going a step further than was necessary for the zanypremise.Growingyour relationships with a few select girls produces high-potential kids withaccess to more job classes, but getting to know these women is awful. UnlikePersona, where you feel like you're helping someone through an important lifestruggle, these problems are laughably superficial. In one path, I had to helpa teacher deal with her growing popularity as a pop star, and doctors notwanting her to visit kids at a hospital. In another, I had to convince a girlthat she was fine just the way she is - small bust and all. Self-esteem is auniversal struggle, but when the scenario revolves solely around chest size, itloses poignancy. Thisisn't an isolated problem. At every possible junction, characters bring up cupsize as the go-to conversation topic. Don't expect to tackle any matureproblems; characters are all teenagers with raging hormones, which is exactlythe problem. They don't have anything interesting to say about themselves orthe situation at hand, so you're constantly just scrolling through a bunch ofboring text. The jokes aren't clever and the characters rarely feel like people- just tools to keep a ridiculous plotline going.Whenyou're not trying to raise your relationship with one of the chosen women, you'redungeon crawling. I enjoyed the battle system at first, which has you movingthe position of your party members to attack enemy weak points. You're pairedwith one of the romantic interests, and direct up to three groups of star children.You have different special abilities depending which cohort you bring with you,and you can arrange your children to focus on different aspects of combat. Ihad one group that was more focused on healing and defense, while I set othersto focus on magic and strength attacks. I may not like the actual creation ofthe baby warriors, but I did enjoy unlocking new classes and composing newbattle groups.Thenovelty wears off quickly due to the drab, randomly generated dungeons. Notonly are they visually unappealing, but the exploration is boring. Sure, youcan find new items or take your chances on opening a chest that is either anenemy or great item, but it's a generic ride. Initially, I fought every enemy Ifound on each floor, but due to boredom, started bypassing some foes.Eventually, I was doing the bare minimum to progress. At least the boss battlestest your wits and make you think more than the standard encounters. Unfortunately,the pacing for all of this is terrible. Dungeon crawling isn't broken up orsupported with great scenes or plot twists, so hours of battle often meannothing.ConceptionII succeeds in making all the systems play off each other. Children can notonly be used in dungeons, but outside of them as well to mend shops. You caneven eventually unlock a daycare to drop off children who share in experiencewhen they aren't in dungeons. The gamegives you more than enough incentive to keep producing children and it doessome pretty weird things to make that happen. I won't spoil much, but yes,tri-mating eventually becomes available. Conceptionwas a series I never thought we'd see localized in North America, and I wascurious to see just how something that sounded so off-the-rails would stack up.I was better off wondering. I could forgive the plot if the game was actuallyexciting, but this is a dull dungeon crawler. Some of the most exciting RPGswork with relationship building, like Persona and Fire Emblem, but this justtakes it in a bizarre direction. Merely giving players a chance to pair upisn't enough; the actual relationship building needs have genuine developmentsand substance, and Conception II hits all the wrong notes.The EdgeThe game looks best on the Vita. The 3DS version is a visual step down, but its not hindered in any other way.", "date": "Apr 14, 2014", "grade": "6"}
