{"name": "Metal Slug XX", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/metal_slug_xx/b/psp/archive/2010/02/23/review-co-op-cant-fix-everything.aspx", "text": "This is nearly an exact port of Metal Slug 7, which released in late 2008 on the DS (read the review here). However, XX corrects the DS versions ultimate sin of lacking Metal Slugs trademark two-player co-op. Sure, its only local, but Ill take it.These screens may make it seem like the game has been reformatted to take advantage of the PSPs widescreen, but the image is simply expanded and stretched. Hardcore Metal Slug players will want to play on clear display mode, which preserves the original aspect ratio and clarity of the DS screen the game was designed for. Unfortunately, this looks like a wimpy postage stamp in the middle of the screen with borders all around it. Id be fine with a hi-res 4:3 mode that at least fills up to the top and bottom of the PSP screen, but even this option degrades the image.The only new character, Leona Heidern from The King of Fighters, should have been included on the UMD. Instead, you have to purchase her from the PlayStation Network Store for a dollar. If youre a Metal Slug fan/PSP owner who hasnt had a way to play this entry in the series before, XX is worth checking out. Its a tough recommendation for everyone else.", "date": "Feb 23, 2010", "grade": null}
