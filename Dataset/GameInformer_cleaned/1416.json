While The Bridge featuresarresting visuals and a few clever gameplay mechanics, some convoluted puzzlesand a sluggish pace detract from the overall experience.Eachlevel in The Bridge is a surreal, hand-drawn landscape reminiscent of theoptical illusions of M.C. Escher. The visual style is the high point of thegame, and complements your reality-breaking abilities. In order to make it tothe exit door of each level, you control both your character and the rotationof the 2D environment, which affects gravity based on the changing orientationof the landscape. Early puzzles such as tilting the world to slide up a steepslope or turn a ceiling into a floor are simple but effective. A few moremechanics, such as inverting your character in the environment or changing thegravitational direction of individual objects, evolve the formula for betterand for worse.Whilethe gameplay mechanics are novel, some of the puzzles are so complicated thatsolving them requires tedious trial and error rather than genuine problemsolving. Rarely did I have that ~Aha!~ moment that great puzzle games like Fezand Antichamber inspire. Instead, solutions often involve trudging back andforth through winding mazes in order to see how the world will react when youflip a switch or alter gravity in a specific way, the effects of which aren'talways immediately apparent. I wouldn't mind having to experiment if it wasn'tso painfully slow; the environment rotates at a sluggish pace, and your character'sspeed maxes out at a brisk walk. The slow speed of your character and objects combinedwith their momentum makes it easy to over-rotate your environment, at whichpoint you watch your character soft-shoe his way down a slope or off a ledgewhile you try in vain to right the ship. Luckily you can rewind time with thepress of a button at any point, but even that can be slow when you have severalminutes of a failed solution to undo. The Bridge also lacks any sort of hintsystem, so if you get stuck on a puzzle, your only option is to continueexperimenting or retreat to the Internet for help.Justwhen I started finding The Bridge's puzzles more frustrating than fun, a mid-gameevent resets the world, requiring you to revisit all of the previous levelswhich sport trickier puzzles the second time around. While it may sound like acheap gimmick to recycle environments, these mirrored levels provide the mostentertaining puzzles in the game, and introduce more variety via a few newmechanics such as controlling two characters at the same time. After gettingfrustrated with the final puzzles of the first half of the game, I waspleasantly drawn back into The Bridge's unique and imaginative world with themore creative challenges of the second half. Eventually these mirrored puzzlesalso ramp up to a slow grind of trial and error, but finally hitting upon thecorrect solution remains satisfying throughout, even when progress comes fromluck rather than strategy.Whileall of the puzzles don't reach the same level of excellence as The Bridge'simpressive visuals, recommending this game to indie fans is still an easy call.Despite some difficulty spikes, patient players will be pleasantly engaged inThe Bridge's surreal, black-and-white world.", "date": "Feb 26, 2013", "grade": "7.5"}
