When it released in the fall of 2008, ValkyriaChronicles real-world plight paralleled that of the fictional nation of Gallia;it was a quirky strategy-RPG beset on all sides by giants of the video game industry.I reviewed Valkyria Chronicles for GI #188, an issue that also contained reviewsfor Fallout 3, Gears of War 2, Fable II, Resistance 2, Mirrors Edge, ChronoTrigger DS, and LittleBigPlanet. Even surrounded by such high-profile titles, ValkyriaChronicles amassed a cult following and was successful enough to spawn a secondinstallment.As a fan of the first game, I was initially disappointed to learn the series wasmoving from PS3 to PSP. Then I played Valkyria Chronicles II, and all was forgiven.Sega makes some sacrifices to make the experience more portable, but it also madeimprovements and added depth, resulting in a follow-up that stands right alongsideits predecessor. The strategic combat system remains remarkably similar to the first game. Aftersurveying the situation from the command map, you take control of individual unitsto move and attack in real time. Putting players in the middle of the action avoidsthe mechanical repetition associated with grid-based strategy titles, while stilldelivering the thrill of a well-executed tactical maneuver. Unfortunately, the mapsand mission objectives lack variety; youll often fight in recycled areas,and the sprawling battlefields of the original have been split up and shrunk downto several bite-sized areas per mission.The smaller maps are one reason the scale of the conflicts has been drasticallyreduced, but there is another problem. Where you could once bring a veritable armyinto battle, you are now limited to six soldiers on the field at once. This is especiallyrestricting when you need to wage war on multiple fronts. This limitation is themost glaring flaw, since it also prevents battles from achieving the epic multi-frontscope of the original.For many battles, your strategy hinges on shuttling allies from one area to another.I found this disappointing at first, but new enemies and unit types ensure thatyou arent constantly reaching into the same bag of tricks. The orders youissue (like passive buffs and mortar strikes) arent nearly as overpoweredas they were in the last entry, forcing you to consider your options more carefullyinstead of pumping up a single super-soldier. If that isnt enough varietyfor you, check out the new versus and co-op challenges. Multiplayer is local-only,but that isnt really a strike against the game, since I found the single-playercampaign far more interesting than the online features.The PSP cant reproduce all of the things that made Valkyria Chronicles afan favorite on PS3. For instance, the cel-shaded sketchbook aesthetic of the originalhas been replaced with a more conventional anime vibe, and the plot isntas sophisticated or compelling. Valkyria Chronicles II compensates by making yourtime with your squad better than ever. The story doesnt just focus on a fewteammates; the entire squad is front and center. The characters each have uniquecutscenes and missions that flesh out their personalities, and I became attachedto several of them  even a few that I didnt like at the beginning.From the new weapon upgrades to the improved tank customization, almost everythingoutside of combat is a step above the last entry. Your allies feel more like individualsthanks to the new XP and advancement system, which rewards a units performance.You still level up each class as a whole, but each unit receives bonuses for accomplishmentslike kills, healing, and base capturing. This means that your personal favoriteunits will excel and eventually take on specialized roles, like sniper or fencer.However, because the base classes still advance as a group, no one is ever leftbehind. The system is a great way to acknowledge and encourage the inevitable favoritismthat will emerge for players as they get to know the squad.Valkyria Chronicles II is the best PSP game Ive played in years. It couldhave been even better if not for the limitations of the hardware, but hopefullySega wises up and puts Valkyria Chronicles III back on home consoles. A game combiningthe large-scale combat of the original with the depth of the sequel would be a powerhouseof the strategy genre. In the meantime, this entry should delight fans of the originaland inspire the uninitiated to pledge their allegiance to Gallia.", "date": "Aug 31, 2010", "grade": "8.5"}
