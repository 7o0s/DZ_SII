While Xbox 360, PS3, and PC owners are enjoying the latest chapter of Brothers in Arms in high definition, you get to relive the glory of the first two games in this buggy, ugly-as-hell port that eliminates the multiplayer and sabotages the single-player campaign with frequent stutters and framerate issues. Controlling your unit through flank and suppress maneuvers is easy enough, but killing Nazis can be an exercise in frustration mostly due to the poor hit detection. With a refined game engine, improved hit detection, and some sorely needed multiplayer modes, this would have had a chance of survival. But in its haggard current state, the only people remembering this soldier's sacrifice will likely be its parents.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
