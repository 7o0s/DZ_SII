{"name": "Prince of Persia: The Fallen King", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/prince_of_persia_the_fallen_king/b/nintendo_ds/archive/2009/09/22/review.aspx", "text": "If you ever wondered how the Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass touch controls would work on a side-scrolling platformer, this is your chance to find out. At its best, you navigate a series of death-defying jumps and wall climbs with a few simple taps. At its worst, you fall instantly to your death. The latter will happen several times a stage and feels oh so cheap. Combat is stale and repetitive outside of boss battles, and several stages are filled with copy and pasted sections and artificially lengthening collect-three-gems-to-open-door setups. Corruption powers earned throughout the game add further layers of challenge and entertainment, but only dedicated PoP fans will put up with The Fallen King's faults to find its few shining moments.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
