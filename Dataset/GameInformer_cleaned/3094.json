{"name": "Alone in the Dark", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/alone_in_the_dark/b/ps3/archive/2009/09/22/review.aspx", "text": "I have to applaud Atari and Eden for fixing so many of the problems present in previous releases of Alone in the Dark. The new camera system feels more natural for the gameplay style, cars drive smoother (and chase scenes are more forgiving), strafing and first-person speeds have increased considerably, and the new 10-minute gameplay sequence will get your blood pumping. Most importantly, the root burning is now incorporated directly into the plot and the requirements for accessing the final area are drastically reduced. Unfortunately, the clumsy story remains the same and I still came across the occasional glitch. But make no mistake, Inferno is the definitive version of Alone in the Dark.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
