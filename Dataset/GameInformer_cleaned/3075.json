This quirky RPG port of a PSone title has a reworked turn-based battle system that makes the already simplistic experience mind-numbingly dull.  You control Cornet, a country girl with a crush on a prince, and her entourage of talking puppets. Every now and then Cornet breaks into some trite, insipid musical number, and then you regain control so you can complete humiliating goals like ~wear a dress that makes you look beautiful.~ Ugh.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "5.5"}
