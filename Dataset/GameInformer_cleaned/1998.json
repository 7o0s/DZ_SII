Not Okabu. From the humorous opening animation tothe countless tasks you'll undertake with your trusty cloud whales, Okabu'scall for environmental conservation rings loud and clear. Luckily, entertaininggameplay and a cutesy presentation that even the grumpiest players can't helpbut smile at make it an altruistic lesson worth learning.Okabu tells the story of Kumulo and Nimbe, two cloud whaleswho are at odds with the diabolical Doza Corporation due to their unbridledpollution. A thick layer of smog causes the mystical creatures to plummet fromthe sky and land in a quaint village of the Yorubo, who face even biggerenvironmental problems. Their water is contaminated, oil puddles stain theirdirt roads, and random Doza bots roam the countryside spewing noxious gasclouds into the air. After listening to the village elder recount their plight,it's time for the whales to roll up their...cloud sleeves...and get to work.And there is plenty of work to be done. Aside from scouringthe environment for collectible fruit and hidden eggs, the cloud whales (whohave the same abilities and can be controlled on the same screen indrop-in/drop-out co-op) can suck up water from ponds and sprinkle it onmalnourished plants or shoot jets at the intruding machines to short out theircircuit boards. You'll also give rides to friendly allies, each of whom sportsa different ability. An old man named Monkfish can use his trusty rope andplunger to drag around objects, flip switches, and free captured tribesmen,while Picolo plays tunes to charm wildlife into doing your bidding, such asmaking a ram-happy goat break down obstructions and demolish waterproofenemies.These simple tasks may sound boring to adult gamers, butOkabu sports an undeniable charm, and tasks are over too quickly to becomeannoying. In fact, most of the game is free of frustration: getting shot downby an enemy Doza brings no penalty other than having to pick up your passengeragain, and the puzzles are so straightforward that even children won't bestumped by them. Instead, the game challenges players with ever-growing chainsof objectives, requiring you to think half a dozen steps in advance. I use theterm ~challenge~ loosely, however.Kumulo and Nimbe's journey is a surprisingly long one. Ithought the adventure was over once I breached the Doza compound and freed theenslaved natives, only to find out that was just the first of four worlds. Newworlds introduce more characters, and with them new gameplay mechanics and puzzleelements. Extra collectibles and time challenges provide more challenge, thoughwhether they're worth going after depends on how much of a completionist youare.Despite feeling like I wasn't in the target audience, I hada lot of fun playing through Okabu's colorful worlds, and found myself grinninglike an idiot at its absurdly upbeat characters and activities. For parents whoare looking for a wholesome game to play with their children, Okabu is ano-brainer. Even without a kid for a sidekick, Okabu's light-hearted romp isworth a look for gamers wanting a break from more serious and demanding titles.", "date": "Oct 18, 2011", "grade": "8"}
