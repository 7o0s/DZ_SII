While the Kickstarter was successfully funded and fans of the obscureseries may be happy with the final result, some design problems make TwistedDreams hard to recommend.BlackForest Games' desire to stay true to its Commodore 64 inspiration is admirable,but results in more annoyances than nostalgia (especially if you've never heardof The Great Giana Sisters). One of the less-than-desirable throwbacks is thevirtually nonexistent story; the minimal opening cutscene is so cryptic that Ineeded to read an online description to figure out what the hell was going on.Another nod to the past is a soundtrack featuring songs from the original game but they are resurrected as god-awful Swedish heavy metal tunes and replayedendlessly.BlackForest Games put its own spin on the series with the ability to switch between~Cute Giana~ and ~Punk Giana~ on the fly, which is easily the most impressiveaspect of Twisted Dreams. This ability is more than just a character swap; the environments,enemies, and music all change depending on which character is in control. Thefact that each environment effectively had to be made twice shows thededication the developer has to the source material, though the darker and lesscolorful palate of the goth worlds that Cute Giana travels through made medefault to Punk Giana's bright and fluffy environment unless a specificobstacle required me to switch back.Switchingbetween characters also grants you different powers. Cute Giana's twirlingdouble jump helps compensate for some loose controls that make it easy toover-jump platforms. Punk Giana's dash move is less helpful. It allows you toshoot across the screen as a fireball, taking out enemies and destructibleblocks in your path. However, the direction you travel is inconsistent, makingit hard to tell whether you're going to snap to an enemy or ricochet off to acheap death. Other mechanics, such as finicky wall-jumping, also fail to liveup to the high standards set by modern platformers.These minor control issues are compounded by thefact that every obstacle results in a one-hit kill  another unwanted throwbackto '80s game design. Besides offering pitch-perfect controls, retro platformerslike Super Meat Boy and Spelunky make their relentlessly difficult levels funby keeping them short and minimizing timed sequences that force you to wait forthings like moving platforms or obstacles. Twisted Dreams' gigantic, sprawlinglevels make no such concessions. They require copious exploration to complete,and the countless ensuing deaths you endure on the way to the exit weighagainst you in your post-level rating. Twisted Dreams contains mostly generouscheckpoints, but I still ran into plenty of situations where they were spacedfrustratingly far apart, and Black Forest Games doesn't pull any punches in itsdemanding level design.Evenwhen things are running smoothly, you spend all your time in Twisted Dreams scouringlevels for gems, often collecting well over 500 gems per stage. Collecting themisn't just a matter of completionism; they factor into your star rating at theend of each level. Fail to acquire enough stars on each stage and you won'tunlock the boss fight at the end of the world, dooming you to repeat levels insearch of more gems.Tomake matters worse, every level is a massive labyrinth of branching paths, someof which can't be revisited. There is no map, which means you can't tell whichfork in the road circles back around and which leads on towards the exit. Onone level, I spent well over 30 minutes scouring my surroundings, but couldn'tget back to an earlier unexplored path and ended up with a two-star rating. I supposethat creates replay value, but not the kind I'm looking for in an already-difficultplatformer.TwistedDreams culminates in a final boss fight that is so maddeningly difficult it hadme laughing and cursing at the same time, and overcoming it delivers no payoff.Neither do the additional modes or the harder difficulty settings (that noteven a masochist would enjoy).Iappreciate the clever abilities and creative level design on display in TwistedDreams, but the one-hit deaths are unforgiving and frustrating given how longeach level is and how imprecise some of the core mechanics are. Even when TwistedDreams is firing on all cylinders, levels inevitably devolve into a tedioushunt for gems. Some platformer fans may enjoy Twisted Dream's unabashedadherence to '80s game design, but even as a fan of old-school platformers, myenjoyment was hampered by some significant shortcomings.", "date": "Apr 03, 2013", "grade": "6"}
