The2002 GameCube remake of 1996's Resident Evil fixed the former, but some stillfound the infamous tank controls cumbersome. This new remastered HD iterationfrees the game from its sluggish shackles like a doberman freed from its winterbooties.The visuals have received an impressive overhaul, from theexquisitely detailed backgrounds to the 3D character models. You can even playas Jill or Chris as they appear in RE 5 - it's a fun treat seeing thesealternate appearances in cutscenes. Some vignettes are still terribly graining,like draining the courtyard pool or the end credits, but for the most part themansion looks appropriately creepy and worn in. I did notice some minorgraphical issues, like limbs or shadows clipping through bookcases or doors,but they're rare enough that they don't distract for long. The new widescreen view is great as well. The zoomed-in 16:9perspective sacrifices some of the vertical screenspace from the original 4:3view, but at the benefit of a wider horizontal axis. The changes, including thesubtle camera panning, are subtle and it's become the way I prefer to play.Speaking of preferred play styles, the biggest changesinvolve the new control scheme and easier difficulty option. The modern controlscheme allows players to move in the direction they point the analog stick,opposed to the classic tank controls. The result is a liberating, intuitive,and immediately satisfying. Unfortunately some of the enemy AI can't compensatefor the S.T.A.R.S. team's newfound agility, trivializing certain battles. Forinstance, I can now safely slash a single zombie to death with a knife and runcircles around the giant snake boss. However, the game still retains itsrewarding difficulty when players are faced with multiple threats. Unfairchallenges sometimes flare up due to quick camera angle transitions where theview wigs out, occasionally leading to a few frustrating zombie chomps. Theseinstances were very rare, however.Watch the producer of RE HD pick apart how the game has been remadeIt's difficult to understate just how initially bizarre itis to play a classic Resident Evil title with this updated control scheme. I'veplayed the 2002 remake and other early entries dozens of times since itsinitial release, and was worried the more hyperactive character motions wouldtaint some of the deliberate combat and trepidatious exploration. The minor hitto those elements of the formula is well worth the exchange. Having a characterthat simply moves in the direction of your analog stick means that's one lessthing to think about, freeing players to enjoy this amazing horror game moredirectly. These new controls, along with a new easy mode that boostsammo and health and makes enemies far weaker, present the perfect jumping-onpoint for RE fans that've been hesitant to try out the classics that solidifiedthe genre's legacy. Purists can stick to the original controls and aspectratio, but I doubt I'll be going back after shedding the clunky mechanics. I'dlove to see Capcom remake the entire catalog of early titles in this style.Note: This review pertains to the PlayStation 4 version of the game. It is also available on Xbox One, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.", "date": "Jan 19, 2015", "grade": "9.5"}
