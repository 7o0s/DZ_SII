Recognizing the game  deserves a better fate, Rockstar promptly ported its handheld gem in hopes of finding a more appreciative audience with the game-starved PSP owners. The PSP version is a pound-for-pound port featuring the same retro top-down GTA action of its DS cousin. Players dive into the Liberty City underground as Huang Lee, the son of a deceased Triad boss who gets involved in the power struggle to take over leadership in his wake. Huang Lees over-the-top sarcasm and the generally unlikable cast do the story no favors, but youll likely be too immersed in the drug trade to take notice. In traditional GTA fashion, much of your time is spent blowing up buildings, killing troublemakers, fetching important items for your higher ups, and running from the cops. For the PSP version, Rockstar also added another set of missions revolving around an independent reporter who is as crazy as the criminals on whom shes reporting. While this mission-based formula still yields a lot of fun, I found myself frequently shunning the narrative in favor of pursuing the almighty unlaundered dollar in the drug trade. Liberty Citys black market drug trading is nuanced, with different gang factions controlling the distribution of certain drugs. The smart dealer can make a killing buying low from one group and selling high to the deviants just dying for a fix. The danger is in acquiring and transporting large amounts of cocaine and heroin across the city  some deals are busted by sting operations, and if you dont want to lose the large sums of cash you invested in the illegal substances you need to avoid arrest at all costs. Making money in the drug trade becomes all the more important considering most missions pay you less than welfare. Kill a rival? Heres $50  dont spend it all in one place. To keep Lee flush with ammo and bulletproof vests, you have to get your nose dirty.The PSPs widescreen display is an asset during police chases, as the broader view makes it easier to see which direction the heat is coming from. The minigames for hotwiring cars, disarming bombs, and making Molotov cocktails also benefit from the transition to Sonys handheld  you no longer have to hold the stylus awkwardly in your hand as you wait to employ it at a moments notice. If you get in a gunfight, however, there is no quick fix for the sketchy targeting that maims both versions of this game. You can still waste most of your enemies in a timely fashion; just dont expect to feel empowered by jamming on a button to shoot. Regardless of the games mechanical simplicity, Rockstar has created an addictive, bite-sized serving of its patented breaking the law gameplay. Chinatown Wars jams an entire metropolis in your handheld thats just begging to be exploited.", "date": "Oct 21, 2009", "grade": "9.25"}
