Despiteputting critical pieces together to deliver tight action and unique play styles,LawBreakers lacks a sense of identity outside of the assortment of variousweapon and ability templates. The maps, modes, and characters just blendtogether to form a lackluster wrapping to the adrenaline-laced kill counts.Like many of the hero shooters in the FPS scene, eachLawBreakers character offers distinct skills to master. From zipping around witha grappling chain and landing lethal blows with blades to spinning up yourchaingun for increased accuracy, each weapon feels unique and special. Unlikeother hero-based arena games, theres no need to form a well-balanced groupwith complementary skill. Everyones goal is dishing out damage, so you dontneed to worry about having tanks, supports, or healing. Everything is designedto kill. You cant just mash buttons; aiming precisely and taking advantage ofyour weapon skills is critical.Mobility is equally important. The game introduces zerogravity spaces in each arena where you can show off your skills, propellingyourself forward and back to dodge fire and snag objectives. These sections ofeach map make you think differently about how your abilities affect your movement,and add an additional layer of precision and mobility skill required to play atthe higher levels. While zero gravity areas may not be the massivegame-identifying changer that makes LawBreakers stand out from other shooters,they are an interesting and worthwhile addition to the classic arena-shootercore.Each kit also contains a super ability that often has asignificant cooldown. These supers can turn the tide of battle, but dont feeltremendously overpowered. You still need careful timing and true aim to reapthe rewards from a channeled laser or slamming drop. On a mechanical level, gameplayis precise, incredibly fast, and fun.However, that fun core ultimately suffers from a lack ofpersonality and differentiation. Even after almost 15 hours of gameplay, Icant really tell the difference between many of the classes at distance (andyoure never in close range for more than a second in most circumstances). Thedialogue never sparks a reaction beyond a meh with witty quips like worsethan jetlag and randomly barked swear words that carry zero weight. Itsunfortunate that the character with the most distinct identity is the Blitzball.Voiced by Justin Roiland of Rick andMorty fame, the talking objective is mind-numbingly annoying with itsconstant cries of Its time for Blitzballlllllll! but at least it hasdefining characteristics. The rest of the cast is soulless husks only asinteresting as their loadouts.The same can be said about the selection of game modes,which feel way too alike. Whether youre charging up a battery, waiting for anuplink to download, or simply trying to hold a location, almost all the modesfocus on defending or attacking a spot. While theres nothing inherently wrongwith that, having similar game modes takes its toll even just after a few hoursof play. Repetition isnt always a bad thing, but combined with maps that lackdepth and flavor and the aforementioned character issues, the game ends upfeeling like one never-ending chain of the same, same, same.You can check out your stats with each character and your overallcareer between matches, and you can also use that time to unlock loot stashesprovided as you level up. The progression is purely cosmetic, allowing you togive your characters with new outfits, gun decals, and more. Thesecustomizations are nice, but as the only real form of current progression,players may want a ladder or ranking system to show off their prowess.As of launch, servers are stable and matchmaking doesnttake long at all, getting into games is painless and easy.LawBreakers delivers in terms of neat weapons,lightning-fast kills, and aspirational skills. Youll look back in awe atperforming feats like landing a triple kill while blasting yourself backwardsinto a zero-g environment. Despite the adrenaline-fueled highs, the title fallsback to earth due to uninteresting environments, generic characters, and a lackof variety. Even with an admirable effort to capture the spirit of the corearena-shooter and offer players a chance to show off their skills, thehero-shooter space is inundated with choices, and LawBreakers doesnt offermuch to stand out amongst the rest of the pack.This review pertainsto the PC version of LawBreakers. The game is also available on PS4.", "date": "Aug 11, 2017", "grade": "7.75"}
