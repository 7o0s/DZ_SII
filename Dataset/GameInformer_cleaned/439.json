Atlus has adapted itscharacters and their stories to these formats in interesting ways. With Persona4: Dancing All Night, the company takes a stab at the rhythm genre, hoping thatthe memorable music and a new storyline about pop stardom can keep playersinvested. While Dancing All Night certainly has its fun moments and coolsurprises, it's far from Atlus' best effort, falling flat with its musicselection and frustrating interface. Dancing All Night doesn't stray far fromtraditional rhythm games: You use the face buttons and directional pad to matchyour timing with the flying notes. Sometimes multiple notes must be struck, ora single note must be held and released. Extra features like hitting rings to increaseyour combo count or activating Fever Time help you win over the crowd add somedepth, giving you more ways to improve your score. The setup, while notdifficult to grasp, takes time getting use to due to the interface. The Vitascreen is large and your eyes have a wide area to cover with notes going incomplete opposite directions. I got better as I progressed, but it felt like myeyes needed to be in two places at once; I often had to depend on my peripheralvision or flat-out guess when to hit or let go of a note.Catchy music has been part of theseries' lifeblood, and a wide range of popular Persona 4 songs are available inDancing All Night. You unlock songs gradually by playing story mode and freemode. This isn't a bad thing, as it gives you a reason to keep playing, butdon't expect to boot up with an extensive library. My favorites to play are ~Heartbreak,Heartbreak~ and ~Pursuing My True Self,~ since both songs have infectious beatsthat are fun to match. While anyone whoplayed Persona 4 will likely recognize most of the tracks, a good portion areremixes. Unfortunately, some of these reimagined version don't lend themselveswell to a rhythm game, making it hard to track the beat. To add insult toinjury, you often must play the same song more than once, just with a differentremix, and this lack of variety hurts the experience.Where Dancing All Night gets itright and crafts its own identity is in its story mode. Yes, the shining starof a rhythm game is actually its story. It took me around eight hours to clear,combining dancing sequences and visual novel storytelling. The narrative occursafter the events of Persona 4 Golden and centers on Rise as she reenters thepop-star scene, but the characters are all brought together by a new threat: Amysterious video on a website starts transporting people to a strange world.Story mode doesn't take itself tooseriously, and incorporates dance and Persona 4's larger themes in a fun way.Dancing is a form of expressing your true self, after all. While the sequencesto get the characters dancing get repetitive (every character you rescue has aset of three songs), the story has some interesting twists and fun callbacks toPersona 4 for longtime fans. I also enjoyed how Nanako and Dojima had asubstantial role in the narrative, and Nanako busting a move to the Junes themesong is my favorite moment in the game. That being said, you're not missing outon any big plot points or character reveals if you don't play Dancing AllNight.After story mode, you can keepplaying on free mode to unlock silly outfits and accessories for yourcharacters, along with more songs and a new difficulty level. You can also buyitems that increase your success. Even with those additional options, I had myfill after completing story mode. I continued to unlock more songs, but DancingAll Night doesn't have that much lasting appeal beyond that. Seeing myimprovement on songs was satisfying, but little else felt rewarding enough tokeep me tapping to the beat. In fact, I was more engrossed in the story than thegameplay.Dancing All Night doesn't offer much outside ofthe delight of reliving some of your favorite songs and seeing characters likeKanji and Teddie go all-out. It's fun and lighthearted and sure to make fanssmile, but Dancing All Night isn't anything special; it's just an averagerhythm game that's begging for a better interface and more song variety.", "date": "Sep 29, 2015", "grade": "7.5"}
