While I liked Edgeworthsjerky side, it makes sense that Capcom transformed him into a relatableprotagonist to carry his first solo adventure.The more drasticchange in this spin-off of the Ace Attorney franchise is a new zoomedout third-person perspective. Character sprites are animated well andactually show people interacting instead of simply describing whathappens. Having direct control over Edgeworths movements in a crimescene feels more natural than tapping all over a room with the stylus.Investigations are contained to smaller areas this time around, whichthankfully fixes the issue of forcing players to hike all over town tofind that one person or piece of evidence needed to move the gameforward.The new logic system finds Edgeworth collecting cluesoutside of traditional physical evidence. For example, youll take noteof a contradiction such as: Why isnt there any broken glass on theground if this object supposedly crashed through the window? Once ahandful of clues are gathered, you can piece two together at a time.While it adds another perspective to investigations, I found the gameslogic a little too easy overall. It ends up being more of a process ofelimination than true deduction.While mechanics are certainlyimportant, many fans of the series judge an Ace Attorney by its castand plot. Without spoiling anything, I can say that the silly toneremains intact, and murder mysteries are just as ridiculous and toughto solve as ever. Myriad cameos and references pay fanservice inspades, however unlikely the setup. The new obligatory teenage girlsidekick, Kay Faraday, provides adequate spunkiness and causesEdgeworth to make his embarrassed face quite often. New rival Shi-LongLang loves talking about wolves, hates prosecutors, and cares a littletoo much about his faithful team of 99 investigators. That said, Ididnt find Lang to be as compelling as previous foes like Godot orFranziska.The overall plot didnt pull me in as much as previousinstallments, either. Nothing is really at stake for Edgeworthpersonally in the final run. Usually, theres a snowballing sense ofurgency to solve the last case, but the end of Investigations justdrags on. I enjoyed my time with Edgeworth, but its the weakest entryin the series", "date": "Feb 16, 2010", "grade": "7.5"}
