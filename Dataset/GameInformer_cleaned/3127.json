Golf has a natural transition to the Wii, but this game's swing mechanic is frustrating; for some odd reason it's not based on the motion of the Wii remote, but rather the controller's internal accelerometer. Likewise, the limited camera system is more hindrance than help. The courses themselves are no great shakes, although I applaud the game for including minigame diversions during the Adventure holes. When minigames not involving golf are the standout parts of a mini golf title, you know you've missed the mark.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
