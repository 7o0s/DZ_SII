Ultimately, the new GoldenEye 007suffered from problems familiar to most FPS Wii titles: clumsy motion controlimplementation, fuzzy graphics, and subpar online support. Activision succeededin fixing these shortcomings with GoldenEye 007: Reloaded, but it onlyhighlights the larger dilemma facing this re-imagining: It's not the GoldenEyeyou loved, and as an unrelated title, it pales in comparison to other shooterson the market.There's a way to update a beloved title for an HD console,and then there's the way Reloaded does it. Most HD remakes port the old gamepeople know and love into a new engine and sprinkle in a healthy dose ofimprovements and fan service. Instead, developer Eurocom tried to create amodern shooter from scratch that remains faithful to GoldenEye's aged story andlevel structure. The result is a game that feels unpleasantly dated, while simultaneouslylacking the nostalgia it tries so hard to cash in on.Like a bad dream based on the events of the previous day,Reloaded only vaguely resembles the GoldenEye you remember. You'll recognizeplot points, character names, and locations in the single-player campaign, butwon't feel like you're reliving precious memories from the N64's glory days.The HD graphics are a welcome improvement over the Wii version, but the leveldesign betrays its original platform, as the environments lack the depth orscale expected from modern shooters.Move SupportThe PlayStation 3 version of GoldenEye 007: Reloaded also supports Move, in case you want to experience the frustration Wii owners felt while trying to control the game with motion controls. Expect to spend a good ten minutes fiddling with the settings before going back to a normal PS3 controller.Multiplayer was a major component to GoldenEye's popularity,but Eurocom's wholesale revision leaves little of the classic formula intact. Afew multiplayer modes, weapons, and levels carry over to Reloaded, but don'texpect your knowledge of the layout of the original Facility and Archives mapsto come in handy.Multiplayer gameplay now feels like a slow take on Call ofDuty, which isn't surprising, considering the adoption of regenerating health(which can be turned off), a perk system, and customized loadouts. Loadoutscreate the biggest schism between the old and new GoldenEye, as players nolonger vie for weapons placed around the map  instead you're relegated towhatever weapon you choose to spawn with or pick up from a dead opponent. Thesedifferences aren't inherently bad, but they won't appease GoldenEye fans, andCoD fans have better alternatives on the market.Eurocom did embrace other aspects of the original GoldenEye,including the use of Bond villains in multiplayer, which now sport unique statboosts and abilities to great effect. The game features a wide array of classicand new multiplayer modes, which you can configure to your liking and applyridiculous modifiers to. I also give props to Eurocom for including 4-playersplitscreen multiplayer, and even if it doesn't fully capture what made the originalGoldenEye so addictive, it's still fun with the right crowd.Considering all of the extras Eurocom added to Reloaded, Ihave no doubt the developer tried to make the definitive version of a modernday GoldenEye. However, I still feel like I would've been happier playing a $10downloadable HD remake of the original game, similar to last year's XBLArelease of Perfect Dark. GoldenEye 007: Reloaded still entertains, but strippedof its nostalgia, it fails to reach the status of an elite agent.", "date": "Nov 01, 2011", "grade": "7"}
