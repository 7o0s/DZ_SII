{"name": "Tekken 6", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/tekken_6/b/ps3/archive/2009/10/27/review.aspx", "text": "Considering the first Tekken was released soon after the PSonesdebut, and Tekken Tag Tournament accompanied the PlayStation 2 at theconsoles launch, its surprising to see the franchise make itscurrent-gen debut so far into the lifecycle. The wait has proved worthit, as this sixth installment is the most refined since the almostuniversally loved Tekken 3.One of the first things youll noticeis the comically huge character select screen. For the standard arcade,versus, and ghost battle modes, players have access to every fighterfrom the very beginning. This includes dozens of returning favorites,as well as some new faces. Apparently theres a rule that every newfighting game has to feature a fat, surprisingly agile blonde American,as Tekkens rotund Bob joins Street Fighter IVs Rufus in this role.Dr. Bosconovitchs creation Alisa appears a polite young girl at first,at least until her chainsaw arms and robot wings pop out (and it onlygets worse when she pulls off her own head and uses it as a weapon).NewcomerLars is the focus of the new Scenario Campaign mode, which is theweakest aspect of the game. Cutscenes are surprisingly long consideringthey make little to no sense and feature (surprise!) a spiky-hairedprotagonist with a case of amnesia. This mode has its own built-inversion of arcade mode, featuring CG endings for characters after a fewshort fights. Going back to the lazy beat em-up levels of ScenarioCampaign is rough after a few traditional one-on-one fights, as thecolorful and interesting locales of the latter are replaced by thecut-and-paste docks and bland environments of the former.Worstof all, your movesets are castrated in the Scenario Campaign, which isa shame considering how robust they are in standard fights. Afterlearning their various tweaks, Tekken veterans will feel right at homewith returning characters. Combat is focused on a heavy dose of combosand juggling, although its still entirely possible for newbies to pullout a win by frantic button mashing. Part of the fun of a fightingsequel is learning the unique styles of the new combatants, and itlltake some time getting used to the snake-like kicks of Zafina orMiguels quick and powerful combos.Online play performsrelatively well compared to other fighters, but lag still rears itsugly head every once in a while. However, the lag isnt exactly choppy;its more of an overall slowdown of the fights. Your inputs stillregister as you intend, albeit a little slower than in single-player.The overall online setup offers a few more features than Street FighterIVs bare-bones approach, but its nothing substantial. Lobbies andmatches connect almost immediately, and you can even upload replays andghosts of your performances for others to download.As afighting game, Tekken 6 proves why its been a consistent success forover a decade. Controls and combos are incredibly tight, and the entirepackage is dripping with polish. Despite the lackluster ScenarioCampaign, its still a solid purchase for fighting fans.", "date": "Oct 27, 2009", "grade": "8.75"}
