From the thrill of stepping into a vast land withendless possibilities to the surge of a hard-fought battle againstlarger-than-life creatures, Xenoblade holds plenty of excitement. Even now,three years after the original release on Wii, the journey is as fun as Iremember. Xenoblade Chronicles 3D is your chance to find out what you missed,or remind yourself why you hold the game in high regard. If you are a returning player, that desire to experience theadventure again has to be your primary motivation for delving into thisversion; don't expect to see an array of new features or additional contenthere. This is a great game, but it remains largely unchanged. The jump to handheldworks well, and the controls feel like a natural fit. The only enhancements areminor, like StreetPass and Amiibo support, helping you earn tokens faster tounlock extra music and 3D models. The lack of ambition in the rerelease mightbe disappointing for some fans, but it doesn't change the fantastic game at thecore.Xenoblade is an imaginative fusion of RPG traditions and newideas. From the combat to the setting, you encounter a mix of the familiar andsurprising at every turn. You're journeying across colonies that rest upon thebacks of warring giants. Grasslands, flowing rivers, and waterfalls surroundyou, and I had fun exploring the map. The world has its own story to uncover,and finding out the history of the warring giants and even the mysteriousMonado is exciting.The cast isn't particularly memorable - Shulk is a typical~boy with a destiny~ - but their interactions can be compelling. I love howharmonious everything feels between your party members; tracking down specialplaces to have heart-to-heart chats levels up your relationship, andencouraging party members or reviving them on the battlefield raises yourfriendship. This builds a sense of connection among your party, and also earnsyou extra skills and permanent buffs that pay off in combat.Xenoblade has one of the best battle systems in recentyears. It's a cross between action and tactical combat, something more akin toan MMORPG. You have characters that fit the tank, helper, and DPS roles, andvictory comes through allies performing their tasks well. You control oneperson in a party of three; your character automatically attacks while youmanage special abilities on cooldowns. Not having to constantly tap a button isa nice change of pace, and keeps you focused on more strategic matters.Positioning is important - land a special attack from behind and reap thedamage rewards. This is all wrapped up in a fun upgrade system that allows youto pick which skills you want to pack the biggest punch.One of my favorite parts of Xenoblade is how it uses a plotdevice to enhance its gameplay. Shulk has the ability to see the future, whichplays into battle. Before an enemy is going to deliver a deadly hit, Shulk isable to see that fatal moment, allowing him to prepare for it by warning histeammates and putting up shields. This mechanic adds tension and urgency; Iloved knowing when a big attack was coming and rushing to thwart it.Xenoblade Chronicles remains a must-play RPG.While this version doesn't do anything special to entice old fans to return, itstill holds the same fun it did the first time around. Don't let it pass you byagain if it did previously; this world captivates and takes hold of you like agreat game should.Only On The New 3DSIf you want to play Xenoblade Chronicles 3D, you must own the New 3DS. Unfortunately, any previous version won't be able to run it. Make sure you own the latest hardware before you purchase this exclusive for the New 3DS.", "date": "Mar 25, 2015", "grade": "9"}
