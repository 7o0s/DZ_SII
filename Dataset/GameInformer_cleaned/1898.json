Its faithful digital recreationsof pinball have earned the developer several fans in the office, and I'm one ofthem. That said, the 3DS was the last platform I wanted to play a pinball gameon  but it didn't take long for Zen Pinball 3D to change my mind.My biggest concern with Zen Pinball's transition to the 3DSwas the smaller screen size. I often have a hard time seeing table features inPinball FX 2 on my TV, so I wasn't looking forward to cozying up to a 3.5-inchscreen. While some visual detail has been lost in the downsizing, the changesare purely superficial, and I didn't have any problem tracking the ball. The 3Deffect is surprisingly helpful for figuring out the layouts of the feature-packedtables, though I preferred turning the effect off during actual play. The ball alwaysseemed tiny regardless of the view, but it didn't affect my timing or overallenjoyment.Zen Pinball 3D also features improved table guides, whichexplain each table's various modes and mechanics. Whereas previous versionsonly featured ambiguous images, instructions are now accompanied by a real-timeview of the corresponding place on the table, with arrows pointing to specificfeatures. The table guides only offer basic information, but overall it's astep in the right direction.While the software has made a solid transition to the 3DS,the handheld itself takes some getting used to. The shoulder buttons areresponsive, but cramped by their proximity to the top screen flap, and unlessyou have the hands of a child, the buttons don't naturally fall underneath yourfingertips. The only comfortable position I could find was to hold the system upwith my thumbs and index fingers like I was snapping a picture with a camera,at which point things went smoothly. You might get some funny looks from yourfriends, but if you're having trouble getting a solid handle on the unit, Isuggest giving it a try.The dual screens also complicate things slightly. ZenStudios moved the LED and scoring updates to the bottom screen, leaving the topscreen all to the table. The extra information doesn't block the view of thetable anymore, but losing your focus and draining a ball is easy when switchingscreens to read directions on the LED.Zen Pinball/Pinball FX fans may be disappointed by the tableselection. All four tables are a couple of years old by this point; El Doradoand Shaman were original Zen Pinball tables from 2009, and Excalibur and EarthDefense were DLC releases from 2010. They're all still a lot of fun (I enjoythem more than the pack-in tables for the original Pinball FX), but pale incomparison to what the company has been releasing on a regular basis forPinball FX 2 over the past two years.I didn't think pinball would work on such a small screen,but I was proven wrong by Zen Pinball 3D. The biggest drawback is the age ofthe tables, but the core mechanics provide fun and addictive pinball on the go.", "date": "Jan 20, 2012", "grade": "7.75"}
