Legacy revolves around wanderer Adol Christin and his search for a legendary Atlantis-like land of Ys. Gamers raised during the Thundercats era of cartoons might remember these Japanese RPGs, but both games have been re-localized with new, albeit still brief, scripts.Many other relics of '80s game design persist as well. You often don't know where to go next, exploring the game's giant entangled world is tiring, and you'll spend much of your time grinding just to beat a boss or buy a new weapon. Legacy is a little too ''classic'' for its own good; it needs more than a facelift to appeal to the modern gamer.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "5"}
