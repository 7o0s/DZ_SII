We hear that phraseall the time. Violent crimes occur, and people say the offenders never gave theslightest indication that they were capable of such brutality. You can't knowwhat somebody else is thinking, and that fact is what makes Danganronpa:Trigger Happy Havoc so engaging. You aren't certain what other characters areplanning, making you powerless to prevent the next move and leaving youblindsided when it occurs. Though lives are eventually at stake, Danganronpa beginsupbeat by introducing an all-star roster of the best students in Japan. They'reequipped with exceptional talents, including the top martial artist,programmer, and baseball player. Everything looks like a typical first day ofschool, until a sadistic bear takes over and announces he's locked everyone in the school and theonly way out is murder. If you kill another student and can get away with yourcrime, you escape. The premise is intriguing and harkens back to the conceptsexplored in Battle Royale and The Hunger Games. This dilemma combines withunpredictable plot twists to create great psychological tension. Essentially,you're waiting for death, passing time by forming connections with eccentricclassmates that include a fan fiction writer, a goth lolita, and a manicdepressive writing prodigy. Then you stumble on a dead body and wrestle withthe fact that a character you know was willing to take a life and forsakefriends in exchange for freedom. You're always wondering who's going to breaknext, knowing you can't prevent it - and the how, who, and why is alwaysshocking.Once a killer strikes, you have to face it immediately,investigating the murder scene and dead body using point-and-click controls.The betrayals start to get into your head as more friends meet their demise.Not only are you losing innocent people, but must accept that someone you've befriendedis a cold-blood killer. That's hardlythe worst part though; after all murder investigations, a trial begins tocorrectly select the culprit. The stakes are high, because everyone else diesif the killer gets away. If you identify the killer, you must watch theelaborate and harsh execution. Even when you win, it feels like a loss.Although the trials create the tone the game is going for,they also hold some of the weakest parts. During these trials, minigames, likea rhythm game to break down someone's defenses and shooting letters out of theair to fill out a phrase, progress the trial. Providing evidence, PhoenixWright-style, is also necessary for advancement and far superior to theminigames. The gameplay is at its best when when you're spotting acontradiction and presenting evidence that refutes it, rather than dealing withobstacles that only give you answers you already know. While the gameplay sometimes falters, the pacing istop-notch. After trials, more portionsof the school are unlocked, making your experience always fresh. Explorationisn't the only option; during free time, you interact with the other studentsto learn more about their intricacies. The majority of these characters areunlike any I've experienced before. Danganronpa's murder mysteries are just that -mysterious. I found myself constantly second-guessing what the solution to eachinvestigation was until the verdict was passed.Few games keep the wool over your eyes as effectively as this dark tale.Making a story so gripping is tough in a video game, but it's Danganronpa'sbest attribute. I was surprised, captivated, and challenged by the culprit inevery case. Danganronpa proves why having an interactive experience can makestories more thrilling, even in the context of such a bleak scenario.", "date": "Feb 11, 2014", "grade": "8.5"}
