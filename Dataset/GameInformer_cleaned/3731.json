Floor Kids enables players to improvise dance movesalongside catchy DJ tracks to connect with the songs in unique ways. Players charttheir own approaches to each song, performing routines on the fly like realbreakdancers. Unfortunately, with each song consisting of the same basicformula, the experience becomes rote long before you reach the final venue -hardly the experience you want from a game about this exciting form of artisticexpression.Dancingthrough a song is as simple as tapping a face button to the beat of the track.Each button performs a different move depending your dancer's stance, whileholding and rotating the joystick triggers freezes and spins respectively. Theintuitive controls let you easily put together a combo of standing moves,perform a flip, then seamlessly hit the ground for some bottom-rock movesbefore doing a power spin and ending on a freeze pose. Chaining together combosis immediately enjoyable as your character fluidly transitions from one moveinto the next, and the improvisation aspect gives an experience unlike mosttraditional rhythm games. You'regraded on how on-rhythm your taps are, the originality of your moves, thefluidity of your combos, and more. This scoring system encourages you to chaintogether long combos of unique moves, but you eventually learn how to game thescore system and develop a blueprint to get a high score. This means theimprovisation that should feel fluid is mechanical as you work to get the scoreboosts for spins, freezes, and new moves. Though I can still hear many of thesongs in my head after I turn my system off, the gameplay behind those songsall blend together, as the two-minute jams all consist of the same gameplay.Thesole respite from the repetition are the breakdowns where you tap buttons oncertain notes for a couple measures, followed by a couple measures of franticallytapping as fast as you can. These sections, which occur two times per song atthe same point in each song, serve as nice breaks in the repetitive action. Thesections add some variety to individual songs, but by appearing in the samespots, they only make the gameplay of the 24 tracks feel even more formulaic.FloorKids' track list is strong, with bass-heavy, original beats from renowned DJand producer Koala Kid. The delight I have in listening to the tracks is onlyelevated once the crowd starts chanting ~Go! Go! Go!~ to the beat, making theperformance and setting feel more alive. Unfortunately, the illusion of thelive performance crumbles when the experience of the song is filtered throughrepetitive mechanics. Inaddition to the single-player story mode, Floor Kids includes local multiplayerwhere two dancers take turns in the circle. The scoring is the same assingle-player, but a battle mechanic is introduced with the sidelined player tappingalong to the beat to build up a meter and unleash a fireball that can knock thedancing player over and disrupt their combo. The dancing player can defend bytapping the shoulder buttons at the right time, adding another gameplay element.I like the inclusion of multiplayer, and the unpredictability of the otherplayer's interference somewhat helps with the monotony of single-player dances.However, underneath the new move, it's still the same unvaried gameplay.Despite repetitive gameplay,Floor Kids presents a distinct approach to the rhythm genre and allows you to enjoythe music in unique ways. I had a good time in small chunks, but the gameplayof every track just blends together during extended gameplay.", "date": "Jan 10, 2018", "grade": "6"}
