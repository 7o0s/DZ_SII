Over this impressivespan, the Wolfenstein franchise has experienced highs - namely Return to CastleWolfenstein and Enemy Territory - and a few lows, like the hollow 2009re-imagining. To reinvigorate the brand, Bethesda tapped Machine Games, a newstudio led by former members of Starbreeze Studios - the developer best knownfor its criminally under-celebrated The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape FromButcher Bay. Wolfenstein: The New Order is an amalgamated reimaginationfeaturing a few familiar characters and a new central premise. After a failedattempt to assassinate General Deathshead in 1946, B.J. Blazkowicz suffers a headtrauma and spends the next 14 years as a vegetable. During his absence, theNazi Wehrmacht conquers the world. Only after his caretakers are shot andkilled does Blazkowicz snap out of his vegetative state and start a new rampageagainst the totalitarian regime.Along the 20-hour campaign he joins a colorful resistancegroup hiding within Berlin, infiltrates a prison to save some old friends,steals some valuable vehicles, and even journeys to the moon to retrieve thenuclear launch codes necessary to wipe the Nazi regime off the map. The variedenvironments do an effective job of keeping things fresh, and the varied castis much more memorable that most first-person shooter campaigns.In building its own vision for the brand, Machine Games ishardly forgetting the series' past. Many homages exist to The New Order'sprecursors, including the muscular character model for Blazkowicz, using Nazihelmets as icons for armor pickups, secret rooms hidden in each level, and evena ~nightmare~ dream sequence that lets you play the first level of Wolfenstein3D.Traces of Machine Games' DNA are also evident throughout thegame. From the surprisingly varied and satisfyingly brutal close-quarters meleetakedowns to the quiet moments interspersed between action sequences, The NewOrder shares many similarities with the Riddick title. The studio also endowsBlazkowicz with an internal dialogue to give the character more depth, butthese monotone, philosophical ponderings feel at odds with the wanton brutalityhe projects through the rest of the game.The combat is a mash-up of both lineages. You can dual-wieldand decapitate enemies with headshots, or take a more measured approach tocombat. Most levels have Nazi commanders stationed throughout. Sneaking up andperforming a stealth takedown prevents them from pulling the alarm once thebullets inevitably start flying, giving cautious players a tactical option. Youcan also fire from cover, but the cumbersome mechanic makes this the leastvaluable tool in your arsenal.The RPG-lite perks system offers some incentive forexperimenting with your approach. Meeting certain requirements, like completinga certain amount of stealth takedowns or racking up a set body count fromcover, unlocks useful upgrades that give you an edge in combat that isn'tnecessarily needed thanks to the stunted A.I.The New Order offers a wide array of enemies, fromtraditional soldiers and panzer hounds to monstrous mechs and heavily armoredsuper troops. None of them are very smart. Their casual approach to patrolsmakes it easy to run through levels carelessly making stealth takedowns(including on the hounds, which seems highly implausible), and they have theunfortunate habit of running for the furthest cover away from them in themiddle of live fire, giving you ample time to line up kill shots. The finalboss fight is the only exceptional challenge, but this battle essentially boilsdown to classic trial-and-error. If you're looking for a challenge, I stronglysuggest you up the difficulty.With no multiplayer modes on offer, Machine Games addsreplayability by littering levels with collectibles and introducing an earlychoice that changes the trajectory of the narrative. Deciding which of twofellow soldiers lives changes who participates in the resistance, and gives youdifferent alternate navigation routes in levels, but otherwise the game is essentiallythe same. Scavenging for enigma codes and cracking them also unlocks new challengesto give seasoned players a run for their money.Wolfenstein: The New Order is a positive step forward forthe series after the last dud. Machine Games presents a competent shooter withmore polish and a better array of characters, but ultimately the game feelsmore comfortable recompiling established conventions than it does striving forinnovation.", "date": "May 19, 2014", "grade": "8"}
