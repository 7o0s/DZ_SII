{"name": "Kids", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/review/kids/standing-out-by-blending-in", "text": "Kids doesnt tell a story so much as it explores the concept of groupthink. As you manage larger and larger crowds of hand-drawn, faceless young people, you probably wont piece together a coherent plot. However, its theme isnt subtle; going along with others can be inviting, dangerous, and sometimes your only option. The way Kids uses interactivity to get across its themes is amusing while it lasts, even if it doesnt hit any particular high points along the way.During its extremely short runtime (15-30 minutes), you click your way through a series of scenes with groups of children, such as one in which a single child is pointing in a certain direction, and your goal is to get everyone else to follow suit. Another has you dragging your cursor through a massive crowd to get them into a clapping posture, then clicking to create an enormous clap-wave.I wouldnt exactly call these segments puzzles, since they arent very involved, but theyre satisfying to work through. Some of them, such as one in which youre guiding kids through an esophagus-like tunnel by stroking it with your cursor (its as strange as it sounds) have a fun physicality to them.More importantly, they effectively communicate the ideas Kids wants to convey. The concepts arent too complex;click among a group of kids to create a chorus, and the joys of working with others to create something larger than yourself comes across. Control a single kid the rest of the crowd is repelled by, and you feel ostracized. The narrative thread that binds these segments is pretty loose, however, and there isnt a single moment that elevates the experience above its premise. I related to the feelings and ideas Kids deals with, but it focuses merely on presenting them; it doesnt explore them with any revelatory twists or insights.Kids is a fascinating example of conveying ideas through game mechanics. You wont get much out of it if youre trying to put together its disparate pieces beyond vague notions. But its undeniably clever in places, which makes it a curious look into how people can both uplift and hurt each other just by grouping up.", "date": "May 30, 2019", "grade": "6.75"}
