But it suffers from the same repetitive minigames, spotty control, and lack of depth. Most people garden to relax, but the game's time limits, seed scattering winds, and wildly moving pots ensure the exact opposite. The wilting mechanic forces you on a linear rotation through a collection of flowers, fruits, and veggies instead of letting you branch out and experiment with the new plants you've unlocked. Gardening Mama could use more of a Harvest Moon crop economy instead of rewarding players with lawn decorations and new slacks. But if you like Cooking Mama, this is certainly on par.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
