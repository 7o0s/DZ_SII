Developed by a lone auteur (Michael Hicks),filled with vague and nonlinear storytelling, and based on the Myers Briggspersonality assessment test, it's clearly in the lineage of critical darlingslike Braid. However, nailing the aesthetics of an arthouse indie game andmaking a well-crafted one aren't the same thing.It's one ofthose games I almost feel bad for not enjoying. It's a labor of love, so whydon't I love it? As usual, it comes down to the gameplay. While Pillar has avariety of unique mechanics (each divided up by personality type - ~distant,~~focused,~ etc.) they are all based on elements of game design that I'm happyto leave in the past. Whether using a laborious trial-and-error method to studythe sentry patterns of guards or plotting out the best path to collect a seriesof orbs to open the gate to the next level, Pillar's core gameplay is moretiresome than enjoyable. For a time, I found the switch puzzles intriguing, butthey overstayed their welcome. Pillar doesn't offer much in the way of explicittutorials, so there are fun moments of discovery; unfortunately, what's leftafter you figure out what you're expected to do is less than meets the eye.As for theplot, I'm sure one exists, though I was not able to divine what it was. At somepoint, ~enigmatic~ and ~nonlinear~ become plain ~confusing,~ and most of Pillartakes places past that threshold. I found an interview in which Hicks cited thefilm Magnolia as inspiration,specifically its weaving together of seemingly disconnected characters'storylines into a whole. After playingthe game, I can see what was attempted here, but the dots are not sufficiently connectedto convey anything meaningful. It has allusions to aging, regret, and - in someinteresting post-death sequences - the suggestion of an afterlife. I like toconsider myself an intelligent person. I graduated from college. I've read Infinite Jest. I cannot tell you what'sgoing on in Pillar.I didn't likethe game, but I want to take a moment to praise the soundtrack. Composed andperformed by Hicks, Pillar has a chance of becoming one of my favorite gamesoundtracks of all time. Filled with gently cycling synth motifs and luminousswells of guitar, the score is transporting in a way the game itself neverquite achieves. If you're fan of the ambient works of artists like Brian Enoand Robert Fripp, you should investigate (it's available for purchase onBandcamp).Hicks isclearly talented; Pillar has a lot of interesting concepts that, sadly, don'tcome together in satisfying way. I have no doubt that he'll make a great gamesomeday. This isn't it.", "date": "on Mar 03, 2015", "grade": "6"}
