The birth of 3D gaming? Haveyou ever tried going back and playing games from that time? Aside froma few classics like Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie, a lot of early 3Dtitles dont hold up, held back by an era where developers hadnt yetlearned how to handle camera placement or the added glitches that comewith the addition of a full 3D environment. Flips Twisted World feelslike a game trapped in that era.At the outset, young wizardsapprentice Flip is sucked into a magical book and introduced to a groupof cubes that follow him around and give him powers. The first and mostimportant of these powers is Pivot, the ability to twist the world byholding in the B button and turning the Wii remote in the directionthat you want to flip everything.Turning the world makes forsome great puzzles, but the execution is flawed because the Wii remotedoesnt correctly sense which direction youre turning it consistently.In later levels and boss encounters, as you need to flip the worldfaster, this unresponsiveness frequently leads to accidentally flippingyour character into a bottomless pit. Add on enemies who take multiplehits from your limited and slow arsenal of powers, and youre in for afrustrating experience just trying to get anywhere.Flipssketchy design goes beyond the controls. Though the worlds areunimaginative (ice world, fire world, jungle world, etc.), individuallevels have a lot of detail and character. Sadly, these nice touchesget lost in confusing and unclear level design. Even when I figured outwhere to go, I ran into several game-breaking bugs -- a door notopening, a cutscene not starting, and more -- that forced me to resetthe game multiple times before I could progress. And even though Flipcan buy and unlock new costumes that give him different powers, thegame will randomly unequip the costumes when you die or enter a newarea, forcing constant fumbling with the clumsy menus.Back onthe N64, the world-twisting gimmick may have been enough to make FlipsTwisted World stand out. These days, though, it feels like a one-offidea that Super Mario Galaxy 2 might have used on a single level beforeabandoning for even wilder gameplay tricks. In fact, being in suchincredible company on the Wii is possibly the games biggest mistake;on a console flooded with platformers, Flips Twisted World is amongthe worst.", "date": "Nov 11, 2010", "grade": "3.5"}
