Anyone interestedin dominating the Octagon in THQ's new UFC 2009 Undisputed will need asimilar prizefighting spirit if they want to master the complexities ofthe combat system.Like most good wrestling titles, UFC has a full-featured career modethat will have you training and sparring to climb the championshipranks. The game's AI is pretty easy to exploit early on, but this modeis a good way to learn Undisputed's complicated fundamentals. Retiredcareer fighters can be taken online in a series of exhibition matches,but if you want the real deal, you can step into the skin of masterslike Georges St-Pierre or Forrest Griffin in the Classic Fights mode a collection of scenarios that let you reenact some of the UFC's morehistoric rumbles. The game's wealth of combos and grapples are made even moreimpressive by Undisputed's nearly flawless collision detection andanimation. These brawlers move convincingly like the real thing. Itdoesn't hurt that this is one of the best looking wrestling titles todate; I never thought I'd be drooling over a bunch of half-naked menjumping on top of each other, but THQ has proven me wrong.The meat of the game is its deep  though not easily mastered grappling ground combat. After you take your opponents to the mat,you'll be in a constant battle for the best position to hook them in asubmission hold. The mechanics for this portion of the game feel alittle awkward at first, but you'll eventually get the hang of how todeliver the pain. Once you start to go up against more skilledopponents, the ground combat becomes a strategic battle of blocks,reversals, and escapes.Given that the standing combat and the ground game play outdifferently, this is kind of like two fighting games in one. You'llhave to master them both if you want to be the ultimate fighter. IfTHQ's history with the WWE is any indication, Undisputed is likely thefirst entry in what will be a yearly franchise. Thankfully, the serieshas started off with a solid foundation.", "date": "Sep 26, 2009", "grade": "8"}
