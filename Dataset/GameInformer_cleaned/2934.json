Most levels serve as their own game type, and are rarely repeated. One level is reminiscent of Gradius. Another channels Crash Bandicoot's epic chase sequences, while others draw inspiration from Marble Madness, Star Fox, and Ratchet & Clank. All of the game types are backed by solid controls and level designs that play to the strengths of each presented genre. Most of the challenges are enjoyable (albeit lax on difficulty), but hardly any are in satisfying doses. I was left wanting more, and wondering why solid gameplay sections were only used once.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "6.5"}
