While weapons reach their max level too quickly, the new strategies and RPG-inspired systems make this tired, old series interesting and fun again. That is until you step on the battlefield. Even with a wide array of enemies (ranging from archers to wolves) the wars are flavorless grindfests against foes who rarely do anything other than stare deep into your blood-covered soul. Mowing down wave after wave of comatose fodder kills any chance of this game's strategies having any meaning. An overhaul on the battlefield is sorely needed.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
