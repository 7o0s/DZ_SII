Judging by DeusEx: The Fall, that reality may get here sooner than many people expected. Instead of jumping straight to a console sequel for thewell-received Deus Ex reboot Human Revolution, developer Eidos Montreal teamedup with N-Fusion to craft a spin-off game for iOS that retains most of the corefeatures of its predecessors. The graphics suffer a hit in the migration to themobile platform (most notably with recycled environments and ugly charactermodels), but otherwise this is a full-featured Deus Ex game with the same weapons,hacking, augmentation, and conversation systems as Human Revolution. The Fall takes place after the events of the Deus Ex: Icarus Effect, a book thatlaunched concurrently with Human Revolution. Protagonists Ben Saxon and AnnaKelso have gone dark in an effort to unravel a complex conspiracy involvingprivate military contractors, medical companies involved in the augmentationmarket, and the government bodies responsible for overseeing these trades and practices.Their pursuits take them across the globe, from Moscow to Panama City.The majority of the game takes place in Panama City, whichfeels sparser than the urban areas in Human Revolution. The South Americanresidents of this city share many peculiar habits with their Detroit andMontreal counterparts, leaving pocket secretaries unattended on city benches orledges and throwing perfectly good energy bars and money into trash bins.In the Deus Ex tradition, you can choose one of severalapproaches in infiltrating a new environment. You can go in with guns blazing,stealthily traverse ventilation systems and take down enemies one-by-one, oruse your hacking skills to turn the turrets and robot sentries against them. Isuggest the stealth route, because the combat system needs to go back to bootcamp.As with most mobile first-person shooters, The Fall struggleswith the touch interface. Rather than offering virtual analog sticks or tap-basedgameplay, N-Fusion decided to include both. Players can move and aim withvirtual along sticks, awkwardly taking their fingers off either stick to hit ashoot button. Or you can double-tap the environment to move and then use theright virtual analog stick to aim and while on the move.The combat is competent enough for popping in and out ofcover in smaller firefights against the brutally unaware enemy AI, but lacksthe responsiveness necessary to take on larger groups of enemies. The stickinessof the cover system can get you in a jam if a soldier flanks you, and theaiming system is too convoluted to make shooting from the hip a viablealternative when you get in a jam. Given these shortcomings, I chose to largelyavoid skirmishes in favor of navigating ventilation shafts.Troublesome combat wasn't the only issue I encounteredplaying The Fall. The game crashed several times on the iPad Mini, mostfrequently when entering new zones or hacking doors.The abrupt ending of DeusEx: The Fall, which comes well before you even get to the meat of the story, begs elaboration. If Square Enix hopes to grow this brand furtheron mobile devices, it needs to find a suitable first-person control scheme orbite the bullet and support a gamepad. The technical feat of getting a game ofthis pedigree up and running on iOS is impressive. Without competent combat,however, all that work is for naught.", "date": "Jul 18, 2013", "grade": "6.75"}
