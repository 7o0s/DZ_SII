To say the multiplayer-shooter spinoff is a huge departure for thecasual game developer is an understatement, but the aesthetics and lightheartedtone are a wonderful change of pace for the violence-obsessed genre. Digbeneath the surface, though, and you find some fundamental flaws that hold backthis family-friendly shooter.PopCap is known for making highly polished games thatvirtually anyone can pick up and play. Unfortunately, that equation only ringshalf true for Garden Warfare. The developer's simplified approach to the genre doesaway with basic concepts like sprinting, melee attacks, and limited ammo,making it easy for anyone to get into the swing of battle. However, thegameplay is uncharacteristically buggy; players get hung up on other charactersand geometry, corpses twitch on the ground, and even the slightest bit ofnetwork lag renders some abilities (like the all-star zombie's dash attack)ineffective. A variety of classes and unlockable characters add some nuance tothe simple fun, but PopCap's limited mode offerings hamstring replayability.Garden Warfare only features two main competitive modes:Team Vanquish and Gardens & Graveyards. Team Vanquish is yourrun-of-the-mill team deathmatch. Gardens & Graveyards tasks zombies withassaulting a series of consecutive capture points in a map, similar to Battlefield'srush mode. A classic variant of each mode disables upgrades and unlockablecharacters (making them less interesting), and the beginner mode gives you morehealth the more you die, but you're still playing one of two basic formulas.Gardens & Graveyards is clearly the main attraction. Mapshave unique themes, and capture points are built around interesting locationsthat facilitate large-scale confrontations. Every map features an interestingfinal objective, such as sneaking five zombies into Crazy Dave's mansion ordestroying the roots of a giant sunflower growing inside of a lighthouse. Gardens& Graveyards provides hours of fun, but eventually you get tired ofassaulting or defending the same points on the same handful of maps, and TeamVanquish does little to alleviate the boredom.Garden Warfare's co-op offerings are equally uninspired.Garden Ops is a four-player horde mode, which tasks players with defending agarden against ten increasingly difficult waves of zombies. Aside from theoccasional zombie boss or special wave, you don't have much to draw you in onceyou've beaten a few matches. The Xbox One-exclusive modes are even moredisappointing. The splitscreen mode is an endless version of Garden Ops, wherethe second player doesn't get to save his or her progress and the boss mode relegatesyou to providing support to your team during competitive matches from a topdownmap of the battlefield. Garden Warfare's most interesting twist is how itincorporates the series' tower-defense elements into matches. Players can spawnzombies or plants in designated locations on the map, which then attackopponents autonomously. Unfortunately, these characters are treated asconsumable items that players must purchase before matches using Garden Warfare'smicrotransaction-ready economy.The vast majority of Garden Warfare's content is lockedbehind its PvZ Coin currency. Support plants and zombies, customization items,weapon upgrades, and even new class characters are bought with the coins youearn from matches. However, can't just buy what you want; instead you mustpurchase blind card packs of varying prices. Consumable card packs give you a handfulof zombies and plants to summon during matches, while more expensive packsprovide random upgrades or character stickers  though you have to collect all ofthe stickers for a character before you can actually play as them. Like anygood pusher, EA gives you a couple packs for free, but after that the grinding for coins begins.This faux free-to-play approach undermines Garden Warfare's promisingtower-defense elements. Each plant or zombie you spawn feels like a waste ofmoney; regardless of how helpful they may be on the battlefield, buyingconsumable packs just holds you back from the larger goal of unlocking more playablecharacters, which is the only motivator to continue playing after you've learnedthe maps inside and out.Those extra playable characters are worth unlocking. Althoughthey have the same class abilities, each character has its own unique twist ongameplay. For instance, the marine-biologist zombie features a higher rate offire than the regular scientist zombie, and the fire sunflower deals extraelemental damage. Unfortunately, characters take an exorbitant amount of time tounlock, and because card packs are random, you can't just unlock upgrades or charactersfor the class you're interested in. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the economy is thatthere's no option to purchase coins with real money, but EA says it mayinstitute such an option in the future. Frankly, I can't imagine a world wherethat change doesn't happen, but it doesn't really matter. The progressionsystem and tower-defense elements are already broken to accommodate thepossibility. Garden Warfare is designed like a free-to-play game, despite the$40 price tag.PopCap's approach to class progression also plays out forthe worse. Instead of gaining experience points, you level up classes bycompleting a series of challenges. Things start out easy  deploy five potatomines, kill three plants with rockets  but more specific challenges distractplayers from what's best for the match and make leveling up a pain. Killing twoscientist zombies with a sun beam or shooting down three garlic drones seemseasy enough, but what if the other team isn't using those characters? I wententire matches making zero progress with characters simply because the rightelements weren't on the battlefield. Some challenges are downright devious; spawningfive conehead zombies first requires you to buy consumable card packs until yourandomly receive enough of them to complete the challenge. Luckily, you unlockall of the abilities for a class in the first few levels anyway, so you canabandon the progression scheme after that.Before the tedium set in, I had fun with Garden Warfare.Spending a few hours with the accessible combat and charming world wasentertaining, but the random card packs and achievement-style leveling systemkilled my desire to keep playing. Garden Warfare's simplified gameplay andlimited map selection can only entertain for so long  without rewardingprogression, there's no carrot (or brain) at the end of the stick.", "date": "Feb 27, 2014", "grade": "6.5"}
