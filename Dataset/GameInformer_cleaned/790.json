This sequel continues to build on its interesting characters while addingsome new gameplay features, but Tales of Xillia 2 stumbles compared to itspredecessor. Tales of Xillia 2's issues first appear in the pacing; theplot starts slow, taking about 10 hours to get interesting. Part of this is dueto a debt-paying mechanic introduced early to get players to engage with the side content and to better prepare forthe challenging battles. The debt plays into the story and begins as a greatway to get acquainted with the world, but later it becomes an annoyingroadblock since you can't progress unless you pay off a portion. Thefrustration mounts quickly, since the side quests rely heavily on fetchingobjects and hunting monsters, which is not engaging. The only worthwhile extracontent is the side chapters for the returning characters. The narrative improves as it progresses,and held my interest more than its predecessor. Set a year after the events from the first game, Xillia 2has interesting beats (like exploring alternative timelines), but its shiningstars are the characterrelationships. The new protagonists, Ludger and Elle, have a growing, heartfelt bond that's fun to watch. Elle stands out asa child dealing with the hardships oflosing a family member and finding her place in the world, quicklybecoming my favorite character. The returning cast is also redeeming. I thought Leia was dead weight inthe last entry, but Tales of Xillia 2 makes her muchmore interesting as she strives to become a successful journalist. Moments likethese make me recommend playing the first game before entering Xillia 2. It'snot required, but one of the highlights is seeing how the old cast has grown. Tales' action battle system, which plays out like a fighting game, continues to improve, and is morefun than ever. Battles are fast-paced and frantic, and you're equipped with awide variety of skills to handle the baddies. You can swap weapons this timearound, taking down enemieswith dual blades, a sledgehammer, or guns akimbo. Each weapon plays differently and works better for certain enemytypes. In addition, atransformation skill also provides more powerful attacks for a short period, saving you from jams during tough boss battles.Bandai Namco also brings back the wonderful link system, which pairs uptwo characters for bonuses as they flank enemies. The longer Ludger links upwith another character, the more his affinity increases. Affinity alsoincreases based on your responses in dialogue, giving you a reason to chooseyour words carefully. The affinity system is an excellent addition, as buildingrelationships nets you new combat skills. Learning special attacks and skills has changed. Instead of Xillia'ssphere grid-like upgrade system, which I enjoyed immensely, this entry'sprogression system focuses on elemental properties. You equip orbs, each with anumber of the six elements, to learn and upgrade attacks and skills. Some orbscontain overlapping skills, so if a character already knows an ability, the neworb improves it. I didn't enjoy this as much as the previous streamlinedsystem, but it's solid nonetheless. Tales of Xillia 2's biggest crime is how much it reusescontent. You visit new places in Elympios, but the Rieze Maxia environments areripped from the first game. On top ofthat, you visit dungeons, towns, and fields multiple times, and it's even worse if you factor in theside content. Many of these places aren't anythingto write home about, as the majority of dungeons are linear affairs devoid of puzzles. At leastfields are cluttered with collectibles that help for customization andupgrades, but the lack of new environments is disappointing. Tales of Xillia 2 has its flaws, but it also has plenty of what fans ofthe series love: Challenging battles, great character interactions, and a storyfull of twists. I'm still continually lured in by the series, I just wish thisentry felt like more than a sideways step.", "date": "Aug 17, 2014", "grade": "7.75"}
