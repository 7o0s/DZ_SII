It took a murder to alert him to thecorruption surrounding his beloved Fabletown. Then he discovered the tendrilscrawled even deeper, uncovering a prostitution ring run by a figure called TheCrooked Man, who is blackmailing Fables to do his dirty work. What's a sheriffto do? The Wolf Among Us' finale puts justice in your hands; the decision feelsliberating and impactful, giving you a final mark on Fabletown. Episode 5 begins with Bigby face-to-face with The CrookedMan and the members of his crime ring. It is the encounter the season has beenbuilding to, and Telltale makes it an unnerving and interesting scene. TheCrooked Man may sometimes fall into clichd villain territory, but he worksbecause you can tell he's always a step ahead of you. The tension is palpable,and the whole episode I had an uneasy feeling as I watched more Fables crackunder the pressure, making startling revelations about the murder, Fabletown,and The Crooked Man. Some minor characters develop further and become moreimportant. Vivian and Georgie are more candid, and they share a particularlytragic and touching moment. Telltale also does a great job of fleshing out Nerissa(The Little Mermaid). Her role makes more sense, and you see the character in adifferent light. Despite these developments, I still did not feel a strongconnection to the characters. Deaths didn't strike me the way they did in TheWalking Dead, and I rarely felt conflicted or emotional about my choices. Theone relationship I did care the most about (Bigby and Snow) started to becomeless important as the episodes progressed.The finale does a lot of what's expected, with big fights, aget-under-your-skin villain, and moments of redemption. This is its biggest problem.Outside of a questionable, last-minute revelation, it remains a run-of-the-milldetective story. The episode still does plenty right. I appreciated the revved-upaction, especially after last episode under-delivered. A chase scene bringssome needed adrenaline, and the fight between Bigby and Bloody Mary stands asone of the best fight sequences Telltale has done.Your past decisions also factor in (like who goes to thefarm and stays), but Telltale still doesn't make these choices reach as far as theyshould. It falls back on the same uncreative method from The Walking Dead; youlisten to people rattle off what you did, rather than witness any meaningfulconsequences. The scene is reminiscent of The Walking Dead's disappointing walkie-talkieman. I was hoping Telltale wouldn't repeat a similar, unsatisfying scenario.Thankfully, Episode 5 gives you plenty of choices of howyou want things to end. You decide what being just means, and there's no rightor wrong answer. Even when you think everything is resolved, Telltale gives youone last bombshell to ponder. This twist got me thinking, driving me to replaycertain parts of the story to figure it out. That's the most admirable part ofthis finale; Telltale leaves a lot up to your interpretation and values. Maybeyou'll realize you made some mistakes along the way, or maybe you'll feel likeyou've done some good. The point is you've been role-playing as Bigby, tryingto fight against the corruption the way you see fit. Despite all the good parts, the finale isunderwhelming, which sums my feelings about the overall season. It has amazingmoments, but the missteps along the way make them harder to enjoy. I didn'twalk away from the finale amazed, yet I did feel satisfied. Episode 5 endssmartly, leaving you with something to think about  one last mystery for thedetective in you to examine. If only that last moment wasn't the only one inthe five episodes that made me feel that way.", "date": "Jul 08, 2014", "grade": "7.5"}
