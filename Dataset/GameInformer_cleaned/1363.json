Yes, you'rerunning around the world of Ancaria, one of the playable characters is aSeraphim, and there are plenty of other touchstones to be found. To newcomers,it's all standard fantasy tropes like burning villages and powerful artifacts.Fourcharacter classes fulfill most the roles of a well-rounded Dungeons &Dragons party. The warrior specializes in melee combat, the ranger hangs backwith his rapid-fire bow, the mage uses offensive fire and ice spells, and theshaman specializes in lightning and plant magic with a dash of helpful buffsthrown in. Unlike many brawlers, all of the characters feel markedly differentwhile retaining a similar control scheme that makes them all easy to pick upand play. The warrior specializes in melee tanking, but all of the others canhandle themselves when the action gets close as well. Combos are extremely easyto grasp and recall on the fly, so you can knock enemies to the edge of thescreen or air juggle them as the situation demands. The dodge roll on the rightstick is your primary defensive maneuver and it works very well (you can'tcount on the block with more powerful enemies).DeveloperSouthend Interactive has created a fluid and versatile combat system. Variousenemy types push you to change your strategy, and environmental hazardssimultaneously present danger and opportunity. Golden Axe fans will enjoy thevariety of powerful mounts and environment-clearing super moves that build upover time. A wide mix of tricky mini-bosses and huge screen-filling menacesrain fire from above.All ofthese positive traits help to balance out my complete indifference to thestory, characters, and overall tone. I forced myself to watch the narrated pansover static art that break up the chapters at least once. In-game dialogue isequally as dry, seemingly taken straight from the standard evil villainhandbook. With games like Scott Pilgrim, Double Dragon: Neon, and CastleCrashers brimming with character and charisma, Sacred Citadel falls short inthis respect by a wide margin.With fourcharacter types, one would assume that this is a four-player co-op game, butfor some reason this disappointingly tops out at three. Creating your partyends up as a choice of ~Who do we leave out?~ when you're teaming up with twoother friends. You don't have the option to double up on character types, sokiss your dream of rolling with a team of warriors goodbye. Online play workedsmoothly in my tests, though teammates would occasionally warp across thescreen. This didn't hinder things much, and I prefer it to slowing down theentire gameplay screen to a crawl if the connections are dipping. Onefrustrating bug in co-op frequently cropped up: When tutorial messages appearthey often stay up for the rest of the level, blocking much of the lower partof the screen in the process.Light RPGelements pervade the entire experience. Characters level up and gain points youcan invest into four stat categories (attack, defense, dexterity, and power).Some characters benefit more from certain upgrades, but you're free to investagainst type and make your mage a tank if you like. Be careful, though. Youcan't respec your stats, so if you don't like the way your character isdeveloping, you've got to scrap him or her and start from scratch.Lootdrops here and there in every level, and more often than not it's better thanyour current equipment. In a refreshing break from the rules, pickups willnever fade away, so you can focus on the fighting at hand and pilfer later.Each character dual wields melee weapons, so you can equip any combination ofswords, axes, and maces with various elemental properties. Armor andcharacter-specific weapons round out the pickups. While everyone shares gold,you have to battle over equipable items. You can only carry one of each itemcategory at a time, meaning that you have to drop your current sword to get anew one. This is usually fine, but it sucks when you encounter a piece that'sjust above your level and you're forced to leave it behind. Why not allowplayers to sell old loot at the shops in town or at least offer a backpack slotor two for situations like these?Sacred Citadel gets a lot of core mechanics right, andit's always fun to load up on powerful new loot. If you just want to run aroundand smash stuff and don't care about compelling antagonists or heroes, thisdoes the job. But if you're looking for the total package, plenty of greatalternatives are already out there.", "date": "Apr 19, 2013", "grade": "7.25"}
