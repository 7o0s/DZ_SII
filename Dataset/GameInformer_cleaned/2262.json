The Wii version innovated slightly by letting gamers tilt the Wii remote to manipulate the game world and move their monkey ball, but that appears to be where the fresh, functional ideas halt.Super Monkey Ball 3D apes the Wii versions movement-based controls, allowing players to use the 3DS gyroscope to awkwardly steer their monkey ball. The mechanic would work well if you were viewing a full-sized TV, but keeping your eyes on the 3DS tiny screen is near impossible while twisting it in your hands. This control method makes the viewing angle so consistently awful that the 3D effect is out of the question. I tried out the motion control for one world, understood the gimmick, then switched to the circle pad. Even though the circle pad works better than the gyroscopic controls, I would have appreciated if the shoulder buttons couldve controlled the camera to make turning easier. The circle pad works, but the jerky movement of the game makes playing on such a small screen slightly nauseating.Speaking of nausea, Monkey Ball 3Ds three-dimensional effects probably wont upset your stomach. Thats probably because theyre so unremarkable that youll turn them off immediately. Bananas occasionally fly at the screen, dirt is sometimes kicked into your face, and the monkey ball pops out from the game world. Super Monkey Ball 3D is a poor demonstration of the units immersive 3D tech.I lost count of how many times I yawned as I rolled through the least imaginative obstacle courses Ive ever seen. If youve played a Super Monkey Ball game before, youve already played this one. If youre interested in losing some friends, you can invite them into a local wireless race or monkey fight, a two-bit Super Smash Bros. knock-off. Super Monkey Ball 3Ds extra modes are so soulless and boring that only the most juvenile gamers would appreciate them, but those kids are too young to play the 3DS. If youve been a devout Super Monkey Ball fan since the beginning you may be more willing to overlook this entrys glaring faults. If you havent hopped on board the banana bandwagon, however, the weakly implemented 3D and unusable motion controls wont be enough to make you a believer.", "date": "Mar 25, 2011", "grade": "6"}
