{"name": "The Stanley Parable", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/the_stanley_parable/b/pc/archive/2013/10/22/the-stanley-parable-review.aspx", "text": "Originally released as a Half-Life 2 mod back in 2011, TheStanley Parable is best described as an experiment in interactive storytelling.Through the simplest of first-person control schemes, players respond to avariety of choices laid out before them by a disembodied, all-knowing narrator.While your interaction with the world doesn't evolve beyond wandering around anempty office opening doors and pushing buttons, the clever scenarios and amusingnarration entertain for dozens of playthroughs.You play as the titular Stanley, a white-collar button-pusherwho finds himself mysteriously alone in his office one day. As you investigatethe building, the narrator shepherds you from room to room, describing youractions before you actually take them. Whether you follow his guidance orstumble off the beaten path is your choice, but each playthrough only takes a fewminutes, and no matter what ending you come to, the story restarts. The resultis a Groundhog's Day-like loop of youmaking your way through the changing office building, employing differentchoices to obtain different outcomes.Much of the enjoyment comes from your interactions with TheStanley Parable's wry narrator, voiced by British actor Kevan Brighting. Everychoice you're presented with offers a new opportunity to obey or defy yourhandler, who responds in unpredictable and amusing ways. Go through the wrongdoorway, and he may give you the benefit of the doubt, bending the story toaccommodate your errant action. Continually disregard his directions and he maycall you out in an angry diatribe or magically alter the environment to forceyou into following his lead. As you challenge the narrator's expectations, thegame challenges your own, dropping you into odd situations that defy thelessons you've learned from countless games, with hallways that double back onthemselves, buttons that do nothing, and no-win scenarios you're simply meantto experience, not solve. Galactic Cafe's creativity keeps the basic gameplay loopinteresting. Each narrative twist and humorous soliloquy inspired me to testevery branching path in hopes of uncovering new endings, of which there aremany. Some are throwaway gags that made me chuckle (I never thought standing ina broom closet could be so amusing). Other times, the narrator's musings mademe stop and think; the developer isn't afraid to break the fourth wall,questioning traditional game design, the value of player choice, and many otherconventions we don't think twice about.The Stanley Parable is built upon a single, simple premise,and only offers a few hours of entertainment. That said, those few hours were unlike any I've experienced playing games before. If you're a fan ofexperimental indie projects or just in the mood for a fun detour from yourtypical gaming adventure, look no further.", "date": "Oct 22, 2013", "grade": "8.5"}
