Now its 2009, and Konamisremake of the survival horror gem has ditched the originals industrialdeterioration, combat, and weapons in exchange for corrupting ice,pacifism, and a flashlight. Mix in psychological profiling andShattered Memories is a very different game, for better and worse.Asin the first game, Harry Mason is looking for his daughter Cheryl aftera car wreck near Silent Hill. This is the spot where the two gamesfragment into different experiences. In Shattered Memories, Harry livesin the creepy town, and the entire place is buried in snow. Somefamiliar names return, but the characters arent exactly as youremember them. Dahlia is a seductive young lady with a complicated pastinvolving Harry, and Dr. K takes on the role of the playerspsychoanalyst. The residents of Silent Hill feel real, and I couldnthelp but become emotionally invested in them. A narrative smacking ofM. Night Shyamalan is a welcome departure from the ludicrous andconfounding plot of the original.Shattered Memories alsofeatures an intriguing psychological profiling element. You begin thegame by filling out a surprisingly personal questionnaire that priesinto everything from your virginity to your faithfulness. Harrysdisposition, characters appearances, routes through town, and even themonsters stalking you undergo noticeable changes based on your answers.Its not enough to disturb you to the core of your psyche, but itdefinitely warrants another playthrough.Good thing the story isso redeeming, because most of the gameplay is divided into mediocreexploration and infuriating evasion. In the effort to find hisdaughter, Harry trudges through the town at the speed of a 40-year-oldpickup truck with flat tires attempting to ford a swamp of molasses.Clunky, tank-like movement is dictated by the nunchuk, while the Wiiremote directs the flashlights imprecise beam, and thus Harrysdubious trajectory.Controlling Harry is an awkward affair thatsexacerbated by instances when youre chased by meat monsters. Just whenyou thought negotiating your escape through the confusing environmentscouldnt get worse, the underwhelming monsters pounce on you,initiating a frustrating and unresponsive motion-control prompt. Mimingthe action of throwing off enemies after being dogpiled taxes yourpatience, which is further amplified by Harrys decreased speed aftersurviving an encounter. Instead of guns or rusty pipes, youre reducedto using flares to temporarily stave off the creatures. These chasesegments grow tired very quickly, leaving you missing weapons or anyother option to dispatch your pursuers.Harrys fancy phone playsa big part in navigating the convoluted town, with your reliance on itrivaling that of the annoying guy who texts during movies. Mysteriouscalls require you to lift the Wii remote to your face like an idiot,effectively annoying anyone in the room with the noises its tinnyspeaker produces. In contrast, interesting new layers of interactivityinvolving phone number puzzles and capturing pictures of ghostsexercise your brain to satisfying results.Shattered Memoriesfrustrating control flaws and dull pacing make it a hard game torecommend. Its engaging characters, improved story, and uniqueprofiling mechanic only make it worth checking out for diehard SilentHill devotees willing to wade through the muck. If youre a Silent Hillfan interested in a fresh take on the stale formula, this Wii entry maybe the Cheryl youve been searching for  but it comes at a cost.", "date": "Dec 08, 2009", "grade": "6.25"}
