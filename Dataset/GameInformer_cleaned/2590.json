The choice makes sense. Green Day has across-generational appeal and has maintained a high level of popularityfor going on 20 years now. Its great from a marketing perspective  ayounger skewing, yet still classic-rock friendly band that has enoughwell-known material to fill a disc. Harmonix worked hard to deliver afull Green Day experience  the sheer amount of unlockable videofootage, old photos, and Green Day memorabilia is amazing; its a newstandard for single-artist music games.That said, Im not sureIm on board. For me, this is the least compelling Rock Band game todate. While I enjoy Green Day, theres a difference between a good songand a good Rock Band song. A great many amazing tunes just arent thatfun to play. Green Days stock in trade is power chords, delivered inclipped, repetitive eighth and sixteenth notes. Billie Joe might be agreat frontman, but hes no master guitarist. The bass and drum tracksare more interesting than guitar, but playing this many Green Day songsin a row gets boring. To be honest, I felt some of the same thingsabout The Beatles: Rock Band, but the breadth, depth, and quality ofthe Beatles songwriting gave me fascinating musical touches to noticeand focus on. Here, the repetitiveness of the material is a slog. Thisis especially true of the first tier of songs, which are pulledentirely from the classic Dookie, a fondly remembered butmusically one-dimensional album. Youll notice the band members usingthe same strumming phrasing or rhythmic tricks over and over again  orstealing them outright, like when Warning lifts the riff fromPicture Book by the Kinks.The game hits its peak in the secondtier of songs, performed at the Milton Keynes arena. Here youll playsome well-chosen tracks off the bands middle period albums as well asthe entirety of the blockbuster American Idiot. The tunes are more diverse, especially some of the epic song-suites off of American Idiotlike Jesus of Suburbia, which is the best song in the game, throwingnew parts and melodies at you on a minute-to-minute basis. The finaltier consists of the less satisfying 20th Century Breakdownalbum, which adds a new layer of pomp and (thankfully) more complexstudio-musician lead playing. As a quick aside, Im still boggled bythe decision to include the a capella Song of the Century on thetracklist  couldnt this spot have gone to a more worthy full-bandsong?If, like me, youve cooled on the music genre in recentmonths, I dont think Green Day is the band to reignite your loveaffair with Rock Band. In the future, maybe Harmonix could attempt asingle band title based around a more complex  and more fun to play band like Muse or Rush. This title has all the craft that Harmonixusually puts into its games, I just wish there were more songs I wantedto play more than once.", "date": "on Jun 08, 2010", "grade": "7.5"}
