Its dual-joystick combat involves darting around waves of enemies to avoid damage, and makes me want to mete out as much pain as possible. But with long-term budget to worry about, I need to consider the weight of every shot I fire. Because death can have huge repercussions, I spent the opening moments of every level contemplating my approach, as if I were planning a heist. While Cryptarks hodgepodge of components dont always mesh well, its a worthwhile shooter that provides the thrill of getting through a tough challenge by the skin of your teeth.Cryptark casts you as a gun-for-hire tasked by a mysterious group to find the titular Cryptark, a spacefaring vessel that houses a valuable treasure. To find it, you choose one of seven mech suits, then make your way through five procedurally generated ships. You can choose one of four ships to explore after each level, and your options have different difficulties and optional objectives to accomplish.These objectives and difficulties tie into Cryptarks budgetary system, which allows you to load your mech up with different weapons and useful tools. But with only $500,000 in the bank to start with, you must make a cost-benefit analysis for each of your mechs, weapons, items, and even the amount of health you take on each mission. Do you head in with four powerful weapons, only one healing item and six points of health, and rely on your chosen mechs ability to cloak? This would let you sneak through chokepoints and destroy objectives quickly, but wouldnt leave much room for error. You can also play local co-op with a friend, though the risk of splitting health and ammo between two people is only worth it if both players know what theyre doing.Once youre inside a ship, combat encounters can escalatequickly, as tripping alarms or making a beeline for your objective leads tobeing swarmed by enemies. Though many weapons have a decent enough spread,aiming with the right stick or mouse didnt always feel well-tuned.Additionally, having up to four different weapon slots you can swap out meant Ifrequently pressed the wrong fire button, or forgot I had a given weapon at mydisposal. Thankfully, most opponents dont require too much precision orfinesse to fight, so these issues didnt frustrate me as much as they wouldhave otherwise. The ships youre assaulting allow for a several avenues ofapproach. Every one has a central core to destroy, but also contains severalother systems that make your job more difficult. Shield generators make itimpossible to damage the other systems they guard until theyre destroyed, whileshuffle systems move the location of every other system on the map every minuteor so. Each of these provide a minor challenge on their own, but each shipoverlaps several of these systems to create several kinds of challenges.Despite these varying challenges, I eventually developed aconsistent priority list when it came to different systems, which dampened theinitial fun I had playing around with different strategies. Because of thebudget constraints of the campaign, finding the best solution to every level ismore lucrative than forming your own approach; the more I played, the more Irealized the best plan is to simply destroy the shield or alarm system guardingthe central core and head straight there every time.Though the main campaign forces you to start over completelyif your run out of funds, Cryptark also has a roguelike mode, which offers achange of pace by removing the budgetary aspect entirely and forcing you topick up additional weapons onsite. This means the mech you choose matters more,since you cant swap weapons before missions or spend more cash to increaseyour health points. This mode is undoubtedly harder than the campaign, but iseasier to dive into repeatedly since it has less set up before missions.With its repeatable structure and myriad options forcustomization and approaches, Cryptark begs you to play run after run at itsintricate levels, but I didnt feel compelled to dive back in after Idfinished the final level. Mapping out your plan of attack and then successfullyexecuting it is a thrill, but with only a few key obstacles between you and yourprey, this strategic layer never takes off the way it deserves to. Cryptarks surprisingdepth of options might hook you at the outset, but they arent enough to make youreturn time and again.", "date": "Jun 28, 2017", "grade": "7.75"}
