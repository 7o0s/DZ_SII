Seeing its gameplay on a different platform seemed entirely possible, but the Wii U version took full advantage of the consoles HD visuals which made a port to the 3DS suspect. Thankfully, despite the small visual downgrade, Woolly World is still a great platformer, even on 3DS.In a broad sense, Woolly World is unchanged from the Wii U version. Small things  like a different layout for the overworld  are present, but all the levels, controls, and general charm of a Nintendo platformer in a world made of yarn is all here on 3DS. It still looks great, too, and if youre playing on New 3DS the framerate boosts to 60 FPS, making it a smoother experience.Additions for Poochy & Yoshis Woolly World include a new auto-running mode starring Poochy and changes to mellow mode. Poochys auto-running levels are fun and give you a chance to collect gems, or complete missions like collecting certain items as you speed-run, or making sure you duck under that log. I like these new levels, but as a returning Woolly World fan, I would have liked to access them faster and without having to replay the campaign.Mellow mode, which is geared toward younger players, gives Yoshi wings and lets him fly through levels. On 3DS, a collection of Poochy Pups now follow Yoshi to help find secrets and can be used as yarn balls so you never run out of throwable items. The pups are cute, and a mode that lets my young daughter (who hasnt mastered platforming yet) enjoy the cute visuals without getting frustrated is welcome.Co-op mode, a destination for many in the Wii U version, is gone for 3DS, but I didnt miss it. On Wii U, Woolly World functioned better as a single-player game. The Yoshis are large character models, and placing more than one on the screen could sometimes get claustrophobic.If you skipped Woolly World on Wii U, Poochy & Yoshis Woolly World offers what is essentially a straight port. It doesnt feel downgraded, even if the visuals arent quite as sharp. Exchanging co-op for the dedicated Poochy auto-run levels and a better mellow mode is a worthy trade. Woolly World is still the best Yoshis Island game since the original, even on this less-powerful platform.", "date": "Feb 01, 2017", "grade": "8.5"}
