To put Kung FuRider in this category would be exceedingly generous. This is a game aboutriding office chairs, and through some reverse miracle, the developers actuallymanaged to make the game stupider than it sounds. When I first startedthe game up, I actually thought Kung Fu Rider might offer greater characterdepth than the racial stereotypes that compilation games like Sports Championsand Racquet Sports have offered to Move owners. Man, was I wrong. The entiretyof Kung Fu Rider's ~story~ unfolds on the menu screen. A private detectivenamed Toby and his vapid assistant Karin are being chased by the Yakuza forunknown reasons (Karin even laughs at Toby when he asks why the mob is afterthem, as if desiring any sort of back story is absurd). To ditch the criminals,the pair decides to split up and ride office chairs down the streets ofMegalopolis to a van that will drive them to safety. That's it. The end.The gameplay consistsof short races down six city streets, during which you avoid (or crash into)objects, cars, and civilians. The aforementioned Yakuza members spring easilyavoided environmental traps on you to impede your progress. Kung Fu Rider isvaguely reminiscent of Tony Hawk Ride in its poor implementation of motioncontrols, and for the fact that neither game should have made it out of thefirst brainstorming session.The developers managedto pack quite a few moves into the game's control scheme, but none of them workwell. Jumping on your chair (performed by jerking the controller up in the air)is laggy and only registers half of the time. Leaning back to go underneathobstacles (tilt the controller up and hold the trigger) makes it impossible tosteer. However, the worst design of all is making players shake the controllerup and down to go faster. You will be doing this the entire time you're playingthanks to an annoyingly slow top speed and the fact that running into objectsusually leaves you at a standstill.Each course has four orfive variations, requiring you to replay each area with slight route changesand increased difficulty. Greater difficulty comes in the form of more objectsbetween you and your goal, to the point where the hardest levels have piles ofjunk around every corner, waiting to knock you off of your chair. On the offchance that you actually want to progress to the next course, you willeventually have to make it to the end of the level, which can be annoyinglydifficult when you're getting dethroned every five seconds through no fault ofyour own.Whenever you crash, the game takes a grainy pictureof your face with the PlayStation Eye. I didn't realize how much I wasn'tenjoying Kung Fu Rider until I saw these candid glimpses of my misery. In fact,even after I had unlocked all the courses, I still couldn't understand what theappeal of the game was - until I switched to Toby's buxom assistant (the secondplayable character). Her seductive poses and excessive jiggling will surelyentertain anyone with a sufficient lack of taste to purchase this game in thefirst place. The only thing that managed to bring a smile to my face, however,was purposely steering Karin into traffic during the game's free roam mode. The game's multiplayer mode (one player controls theracer while the other moves a magical floating hand around the screen to pickup money and objects), nicely sums up the product as a whole: an insultinglyshallow cash-grab. The only saving grace to Kung Fu Rider was that I hadunlocked and played through all of the game's courses in less than an hour. HowSony thinks Kung Fu Rider justifies being a full retail release (even with thereduced $40 price tag) is beyond me.", "date": "Sep 09, 2010", "grade": "3.5"}
