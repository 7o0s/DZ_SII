True to hispast exploits, Holmes' newest case provides an intriguing mystery to unravel, despitestill falling for some common adventure game pitfalls.If you haven't played a Sherlock Holmes game before, the serieshas an undeniable hook. It takes everything you love about old-school adventuregames, adds its own unique, deduction-based puzzles, and ties it all togetherwith a plot befitting Sherlock Holmes. While investigating the grisly deathtoll of Jack the Ripper was more intriguing, TheTestament's plot  involving a far-reaching conspiracy to discredit andincriminate Holmes  kept me motivated right up to the end credits.Sherlock is known for looking past the surface details of apiece of evidence in order to find its hidden value; enjoying the game requiresa similar discipline. While The Testament provides the greatest graphicalimprovement the series has seen yet, the game is still rough around the edges.This includes some of the ugliest character models of children I've ever seenin a game, featured in the mercifully brief interstitial cutscenes that framethe storybook narrative.The puzzles suffer from some occasional problems as well.Many of the brainteasers are standard adventure game fare (19th century Londonerssure had a lot of fancy, convoluted locks securing their doors and chests). Otherpuzzles leave you feeling as confounded and stupid as Watson. Frogwares addedthe ability to skip dedicated puzzles (though I'd much prefer a simple hintinstead of abandoning a challenge completely), but it doesn't apply toenvironmental puzzles. Sherlock's intuition ability, which highlights importantobjects in your surroundings, is helpful in this regard, but more often thannot it was of no use to the problems hindering my progress. It didn't, forexample, save me the half hour I spent scouring a garden because I didn't see acoat in a tree, or the numerous other instances when I had to combine random inventoryitems, recheck an object after triggering a subsequent event, or traverse anobscured pathway. Like the last installment of the series, I had to check anonline walkthrough more than once. Once again, deduction-based puzzles shine; I wish there were more of them this time around.The frustrating moments of confusion and downtime I experienced didn't hold the story back. There are a few questionable moments and unbelievable plottwists (the perpetrator of the prologue's crime is especially absurd), but anamoral Holmes makes it a compelling tale. Whether he's threatening children, breakingand entering, poisoning junkies, or being pushed to the point of murder, thecrimes Sherlock commits and gets away with are almost as bad as the ones he'sframed for. Frogwares doesn't pull any punches in its irreverent yet thoughtfulportrayal of the detective, and is similarly unflinching in the intelligenceand attention to detail it demands of players. The Testament joins that small,respected group of M-rated games that actually require maturity from players;recommending this case to adventure game fans is elementary.", "date": "Sep 26, 2012", "grade": "7.5"}
