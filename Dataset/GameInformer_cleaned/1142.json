The developer's second Star Wars table pack doesn't havequite the same punch as its inaugural swing at George Lucas's beloved sci-fifranchise, but that won't stop pinball fans from getting plenty of enjoymentout of the new offerings.Balance of the Force offers fans three more tables to add totheir collections. Return of the Jedi is based on the acclaimed ending to theoriginal trilogy, Darth Vader pays homage to everyone's favorite Force-wieldingsuper villain, and Starfighter Assault lets players side with either theGalactic Empire or Rebel Alliance for dogfighting-themed missions. Likeprevious packs, Balance of the Force offers a little something for everyone,which conversely means you're probably not going to be a fan of every table.Return of the Jedi falls into that category for me, and ismy least-favorite Star Wars table yet. The playfield mixes locations fromTatooine and Endor, and missions run players through scenes from the movie,similar to Zen's Empire Strikes Back table. Unlike the other tables in thepack, however, Return of the Jedi's kickbacks are difficult to activate and thetable is prone to outlane drains. Practicing the ramp and sinkhole shots helpsalleviate the problem, but I still suffered far too many unavoidable losses tofall in love with the table. That said, Return of the Jedi does have some funmissions and modes, including a frantic speeder bike chase complete with itsown mini playfield.The other two tables are top-notch. Darth Vader is a high-scoring,combo-heavy table with easy kickbacks and plenty of multiball modes. DarthVader also features missions taken from the movies, including Vader's fightwith Obi-Wan Kenobi, and final showdown with the Emperor. These missions aremore difficult than those on most Zen tables, but there are plenty of otherscoring options to shoot for at any given time, and the table has a great flowto it.Starfighter Assault is the most complex table of the pack,and also sports the most open design. The left side of the table represents theimperial forces, and the right the rebel alliance. Players pick which side theywish to fight for, and although the missions remain largely the same, thevoiceovers, ships, and color of laser blasts change depending on your choice. Thetable's ranking and upgrade systems provide some depth to games, and the multi-phasemissions take some surprising and creative detours like a simple SpaceInvaders-style mini-game. While Darth Vader is still my favorite table of thepack, Starfighter Assault is a close runner-up.Balance of the Force isn't quite as strong as the first StarWars Pinball pack, but it still offers plenty of variety and replay value tofans. After playing countless hours across dozens of tables, I'm still nottired of Zen Studios' pinball formula, and these new tables are sure to tide meover until the next offering.", "date": "Oct 15, 2013", "grade": "8"}
