Unfortunately, From the Abyss is ultimately a vapid experience. The story is filled with cliched fantasy archetypes - crystals, mysterious drifters, and portals to dark worlds. The gameplay is worse. There aren't enough carrots dangled under your nose to keep you crawling through the monotony of randomly generated dungeons, and the text-based overworld exploration is so simple it seems copied and pasted from an NES game. The only semi-neat aspect of this game is the local co-op. But considering the experience, this is probably a better way to lose a friend.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
