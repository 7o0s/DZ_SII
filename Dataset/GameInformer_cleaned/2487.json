Warriors of Rockwelds the series familiar gameplay to action game elements likeelaborate cutscenes and character transformations. Now, instead of justselecting your character and plowing through setlists, you must gothrough custom sets created for GH characters old and new, earning aludicrous numbers of stars to unlock their new warrior forms. Prettysoon, good old Lars Umlaut is a giant death metal pig with piercednipples, Casey Lynch is a half-snake woman, and Johnny Napalm is...apunk rock version of Nightcrawler from X-Men? Sure! This is about asover-the-top as it gets, and its topped off with a paper-thin plotlineabout defeating some giant beast with your axe of rock (Brtal Legendanyone?) with narration by Gene Simmons of KISS.Neversoftinjected the familiar gameplay with steroids; a host ofcharacter-specific power-ups allow you to get previously impossiblenumbers of stars. Caseys Shield Guardian gives you two rechargingshields that protect your note streaks. Judy Nails can overflow herrock meter, garnering two extra stars. Others include a five-percentStar Power boost for every 10-note streak and an Ankh talisman thatsaves you from failing out of a song.This basically amounts tograde inflation. Im certainly not as good at Guitar Hero as I oncewas, but I remember what nailing a song feels like. What would havebeen a three or four-star run-through of a song now nets you six orseven stars. If that makes you feel better, fine, but Im not going todelude myself.The powers become more interesting later in thegame, when you must assign the characters into two bands to face thefinal boss. Here its important to wisely combine your powers in orderto maximize your advantage. For example, I constructed one band tofocus on Star Power and the other for multiplier and note streaks.After youve finished the game, you can tackle it again in DominateQuest, where you have all eight powers enabled but must get 40 stars oneach song. If youre playing well, you can play an entire song withStar Power on (and a 36x multiplier running). This arcade-styleexperience carries over to the new Quickplay mode as well, which addscool Star Challenges that let you gain points to level up and unlocknew rewards and items.The soundtrack is a mixed bag. The earlierstages are well balanced and focused, giving you genre-oriented setslike Johnny Napalms punk gig at CBGBs or new character Austin Tejassclassic rock block. The games centerpiece is a marathon playthrough ofRushs sidelong 2112 suite. As a big Rush fan, I loved it,though Im not on board with having the band members do an awkwardrecitation of the albums silly story. The end of the game amps up thechallenge with a final boss battle that features some ridiculously hardnew Megadeth songs and a bonus tier of metal shredders. Frankly I thinkmost of these songs are terrible and felt like a chore. I had much morefun coming back to earlier tracks on the Dominate Quest.GuitarHero: Warriors of Rock is often stupid and frequently silly, but I gotcaught up in shredding my way through the ridiculous experience. Itdoesnt matter if I was laughing with the game or laughing at it; I wasentertained.", "date": "on Sep 28, 2010", "grade": "8"}
