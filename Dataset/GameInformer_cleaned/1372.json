First showcased with kooky '50s sci-fi in its Tales from Spacegames (About a Blob, Mutant Blobs Attack), now the team has nailed traditionalMexican culture. Players control an average guy named Juan who is sent to theLand of the Dead by evil charro skeleton Carlos Calaca after he tries to rescuechildhood sweetheart ~El Presidente's Daughter.~ Juan becomes a powerfulluchador who battles chupacabras and Day of the Dead-inspired skeletons - allwhile accompanied by catchy mariachi tunes. Everything is brought to life witha colorful, cartoony art style and fluid animation.Guacamelee is a 2D Metroid-style game through andthrough. A detailed map helps you keep track of where you're going and varioussecret areas. Color-coded blocks wall off special items like treasure chests orheart pieces, restricting access until you gain specific powers. Throughoutmost of the game, you receive new powers from ~Choozo~ statues (one ofGuacamelee's numerous gaming and pop culture nods) that expand both Juan'splatforming and combat skills.A deceptively deep combat system is whatdistinguishes Guacamelee from its exploration/adventure predecessors. Juan'sever-growing arsenal of melee combos, air juggles, ground pounds, grabs,throws, and wrestling slams gives players loads of options in battle. It startsout with basic attacks, but gradually trains you to be a master luchador whocan easily dish out satisfying 80-hit combos. A variety of super moves - like aflaming uppercut or powerful headbutt - are highly effective and easy toperform. Since they're tied to a recharging stamina meter instead of ammo, Ifelt free to use them constantly. Ingenious use of a color-coded enemy shieldsystem encourages you to keep every super move in the mix instead of relying ona few favorites.Platforming is simple in the beginning, but latersections reach a level of challenge reminiscent of Super Meat Boy. Plenty ofwall jumping and tricky triple jumps litter the stages, but the toughestbusiness crops up when you gain the power to swap between the world of life anddeath at the touch of a button. This makes platforms and walls phase in and outin deviously crafted ways. At several points, I could picture what I needed todo, but it took many tries to get my fingers to perform the proper complexseries of button presses. Don't let the difficulty deter you; the occasionally frustratingplatforming sequences are nothing that some practice can't overcome. Headachesare eased greatly by the fact that you're instantly teleported out of a deathpit to the last platform you were on with no health penalty, and the challengesare tweaked regularly so you're always doing something fresh. The sense ofaccomplishment upon completing some of the later setups is tremendous.Boss battles are plentiful and entertaining.Characters like a flame-headed cowboy or a jaguar man show up and harass youlong before you get to fight them, offering an insight into who they are andbuilding up a traditional wrestling feud (sweet versus posters flash onscreenbefore every battle). These showdowns feel like they're from the glory days ofthe 8- and 16-bit platformer era. Most bosses beat you down out of the gate,but once you observe their patterns, you learn how to chip away at their healthand eventually experience the thrill of victory.CrossplayAnyone who purchases Guacamelee will receive both the PlayStation 3 and Vita versions. The two editions are practically identical (Vitas cant co-op with other Vitas, and you have to swipe the screen to transform into a chicken), and the cross save functionality works great. Its awesome to play the game on your TV and bring it with you all on the same save.Drop-in, drop-out local co-op play is supported throughout theentire game (the second player controls lady luchador Tostada), though Ipreferred going solo for the most part. When one player dies, they turn intothe standard New Super Mario Bros. bubble after a brief respawn period. Asecond skilled player is great for extra firepower in combat, but thechallenging platforming segments are only muddied. Battling for camera controland adding another failure condition in the already nasty jumping sequences isbest avoided. Co-op isn't the best way to play, but giving players the optionto team up is a nice touch.Even with its platforming frustrations, Guacamelee is anexcellent addition to the genre, retaining important classic elements andintroducing several fresh additions. The main campaign took me around sevenhours (with a decent amount of secret-searching). The pacing is just right,sending you from one adventure to the next without any bloated, boring spots.If you've got a PS3 or Vita, go suplex this into your system now.", "date": "Apr 10, 2013", "grade": "9"}
