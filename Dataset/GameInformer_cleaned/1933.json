Rowlings world to video games. That tradition continues with LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7. Fans who have already mourned the release of the last book and the final movie have at least one more way to postpone their Potter-free existences.This installment doesnt add new features like LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars RTS elements, but it offers a nicely refined version of a series that was already in pretty good shape. For instance, you dont have to select your spells from a clunky radial menu anymore, thanks to the ability to quickly cycle through them with the press of a button. Theres also a button dedicated to Expelliarmus, which is great considering that its the spell you cast most often to blast environments apart and attack enemies. Warner also added some new spells and abilities, such as an assortment of gadgets from the Weasley twins and a water-spraying spell. They are nifty additions, providing a critical element of variety.One of the niggling problems I had with the first game  a finicky targeting system  is still a problem, particularly when youre trying to levitate objects with a friend. Its not a deal-breaker, but having to jockey around into cryptically exact positions is frustrating. Years 5-7 also adds a tremendous amount of backtracking; Ive probably logged as many miles in Hogwarts halls as Hagrid at this point.LEGO Harry Potter 5-7 is a charming farewell to the series. As with a lot of Travellers Tales games, you wont see a whole lot of crazy gameplay innovations or surprises, but its reliably entertaining and appropriate for a wide range of gamers, Potterphiles or not.", "date": "Nov 22, 2011", "grade": "7.5"}
