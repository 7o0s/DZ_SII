For the last several hours, I'vebeen sneaking through asteroid tunnels and the guts of derelict dreadnaughts,shooting down imperial patrols in dogfights so intense that I've unwittingly grippedmy controller tight enough to turn my fingertips white. Galak-Z can be apainful experience at times, but the white-hot action is worth the discomfort. With Galak-Z, developer 17-Bit has created a charming homageto classic Japanese animated shows like Robotech.Every element of the game - from its plucky characters to its opening credits -is a tribute to the developer's love of '80s pop culture. There are even momentsduring combat that look like they were pulled straight off an old VHS tape.The action looks simple, but the visuals hide Galak-Z'sgreater depth. Fusing Asteroids-like shooter gameplay with roguelike elements,Galak-Z sends you on a journey to upgrade your ship while completing a seriesof randomly generated missions. You get used to the fundamentals of Galak-Z's floatyzero-g combat fairly quickly, but mastering more complex maneuvers - likejuking past enemy fire to circle their ships and lay down your own spread ofmissiles - can take hours. In addition to tearing through space in an agilespace jet, you transform it into a giant lightsaber-wielding mech that doesincredible close-quarters damage. Both modes offer something fresh to theexperience, and I spent equal amounts of time trading paint with enemies inclose-quarters duals as I did in long-range sniping exchanges.After earning my space legs, I really began to appreciatethe depth of Galak-Z's combat. I loved boosting up behind enemies, cutting myengines so that they couldn't hear my approach, and then sending my entirearsenal up their tailpipes. And I never tired of using my mech to grapple anenemy and deliver a series of heavy sword strikes against their hulls beforesending them careening into another foe or some other deadly environmentalhazard.The environment is more than just a static backdrop. Giventhe situation, it can be your deadliest enemy or your greatest weapon. Alienspores clog up your ship's engines, and bubbles of lava can be as fatal as a bomb.Empty space stations are full of giant propane canisters that, when hit with astray bullet, turn into deadly missiles that zigzag all over. Thankfully, thesehazards can also be used against your enemies, and they can turn the tide ofbattle when you need it most. I felt like a maverick every time I lured a groupof unsuspecting foes into a minefield of environmental traps.The minute-to-minute gameplay is a blast, but the largerstructure suffers due to its random nature. Galak-Z is split into four seasons(with a free downloadable fifth season on the way), and each season contains fiverandomly generated missions. As you complete these missions, you slowly acquirenew power-ups and ship upgrades that help you overcome the final boss of eachseason. The power-ups are completely random, so if you get a bad run andcollect a lot of weak upgrades, you are quickly outclassed as the season progresses.This is particularly frustrating since you can't avoid certain fights, andwithout the proper equipment, one misstep or twitch of the wrong finger canlead to game over in the later levels.This lack of structure is further exacerbated by the factthat there isn't a wide variety of mission types, power-ups, or environments. Intrue roguelike fashion, you have to start over at the beginning of a season eachtime you die (without your power-ups), which means you see the same random elementsget recycled over and over again. The only carry over between seasons are theblueprints you collect for ship upgrades, which unlock the chance to see these new items in the shop. It'slike eating a different item off Taco Bell's menu every day; you quickly noticethat all the same elements are still here, they've just been rearranged. Eventhe seasons don't feel much different from each other, so by the time you reachSeason 4, a larger sense of monotony begins to set in.In spite of these frustrations, Galak-Z has the heart of atruly compelling shooter. I wish 17-Bit had taken its elements and laid themout in a game with a more natural progression, or added a greater level ofvariety to Galak-Z's extensive randomness. However, even when the game feels unfair,I couldn't resist returning to these pinpoint-accurate flight controls andtense dogfights.", "date": "Aug 06, 2015", "grade": "8"}
