Some are bonafide classics, like Super Mario Bros. or The Legend of Zelda. Others are more forgettable or havent aged gracefully, like Clu Clu Land and Wrecking Crew. Regardless of which subset of levels youre playing, NES Remix offers numerous challenges that dont add up to anything particularly notable.Unlike the clever 9-Volt levels in the WarioWare series, youll rarely see interesting twists on these classics. Many objectives are as simple as Get the sword! in Zelda or Enter a pipe! in Super Mario Bros. As you progress, a series of remixed levels do turn things around a bit. One Mario level borrows the silhouetted art style of Limbo, one tasks you with navigating the first Donkey Kong level with the grounded Link (he cant use his sword, either), and another has you taking on Bowser in a modified frozen castle.Even the levels with actual modifications feel recycled, as the core gameplay never really changes from what you remember on NES. Excitebike feels like Excitebike, even if youre being required to take out five rival racers. Balloon Fight is still Balloon Fight when the camera zooms out a bit. There are few genuinely clever moments in NES Remix, and I rarely felt compelled to return to completed levels in an effort to get a higher rating on the games three star system.One thing NES Remix does a good job of is presenting bite-sized snippets of memorable moments from the classics. I may not want to play through the entire original Zelda again, but it was cool to hop in and take on a few bosses. Some Mario levels will give you that feeling of dread when you approach Bowser, but you wont have to dedicate four stages worth of time to get that hit of nostalgia.NES Remix is a fun little distraction for a while, and brings back plenty of memories. Some of those memories are great, and others are along the lines of remembering how much Ice Climbers sucks. This isnt a must-play highlight for the Wii U eShop, but its worth spending some time with if you grew up with an NES controller in your hand.", "date": "Dec 19, 2013", "grade": "6.5"}
