Having played bothof them, it's clear that -- while they both work from the templateHarmonix created with the original Guitar Hero -- these games have twodifferent visions for how the genre is going to evolve. At this point,neither is a clear-cut winner. Harmonix, with its overwhelming selection of downloadable tracks andstreamlined interface, clearly views Rock Band as a music service firstand foremost -- the iTunes of video games. Neversoft, industry veteransused to delivering Tony Hawk sequels year after year, approach this newGuitar Hero from a gamemaker's perspective, adding new features andgameplay mechanics in hopes of invigorating the long-established''falling jewels'' design formula.The changes start with the new hardware peripherals Red Octanecreated for the game. The drums appear to be a solid first entry forthe manufacturer the raised cymbals add a touch of realism to gameplayand they generally feel solid, if not as quiet as we had hoped for. Thebigger news is in the guitar controller. The new touch pad (locatedjust above the fret buttons) allows for new tapping and slidingmechanics, the first real innovations in gameplay in the genre to date.As the notes fall down the fretboard, you'll notice clear jewelsstitched together by lines. This signifies it's time to get rad,effortlessly sliding on super fast runs, which proves invaluable whentackling some of the Randy Rhodes and Eddie Van Halen offerings on thesoundtrack. There are other welcome gameplay touches, like the opennotes for bass (displayed as a line across, like the kick drum), andthe ability to activate star power by hitting both cymbals instead ofRock Band's awkward fill system.While Neversoft does more to improve the basics of the music genrethan anyone in a long time, there are some fairly obvious ways in whichit still lags behind Rock Band. For one, the career mode, though nowdivided into gigs, doesn't do enough to convince you that you're doingmore than just playing through a list of songs. Although the numerouscelebrity cameos are entertaining, it feels more like licensingdepartment window dressing than actual substance. As far as thesoundtrack goes, it does a much better job of expanding beyond GH'smetal core; I loved the addition of acts like Willie Nelson, SteelyDan, and CCR to the mix. That said, far too many songs have alreadyappeared in Rock Band or previous GH games. Even with its largesttracklist to date, it's hard for World Tour to compete with Rock Band2's enormous amount of downloadable content. One wonders if the timespent making the recent Aerosmith edition would have been better spentgetting their download ducks in a row.If World Tour has a trump card, it's the groundbreaking new GHMixstudio mode. It's basically a full-on set of music creation software,that allows you to write, arrange, and record your own songs, thenupload them to be freely shared with fellow players. Even better, thegame instantly translates them into fully playable jewels charts on thefly. As much fun as I had tackling ''Hot For Teacher,'' this mode feelslike the future of the franchise.After about a day of experimentation, I had created two songs that-- ifI do say so myself -- would have made pretty good theme songs to an'80s cop show. If recent history has shown us anything, it's thatputting your tools into the hands of your audience can result in thingsfar greater than you can imagine. For this, one has to applaudNeversoft -- and wait for what all the digital shredders out there havein store for us.", "date": "on Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "9.25"}
