Youmeticulously plan, craft tools, wait for openings, and hope your plan goes offwithout a hitch. While the premise is interesting, the gameplay relies too muchon repetition, never capturing the adrenaline rush of a daring escape. The life of an inmate is routine, and The Escapists capturesthis to a fault. You eat meals, take on boring janitorial jobs, curry favorwith other inmates, and exercise your mind and body to succeed. The simulationstarts off amusing enough; waiting for the opportune moment to steal frominmates is exciting, and crafting better items gives you a constant focus.However, the daily repetition (especially locating specific, randomized items)becomes frustrating. Every day feels the same - another fight, another genericconversation, another roll call.Even when you escape one prison and get movedto another, the loop stays the same with a few new items and security measures.You suffer through the routine because you are preparing toescape. Your break-outs can happen in multiple ways, like digging your way outor taking over the prison with brute force. I enjoyed the creative and numerousroutes to freedom, but hatching a plan involves too much patience and trial-and-error.You are given little direction for the complex mechanics, apart from a brieftutorial that barely scratches the surface. You must learn through failure.Want to cut your way through a fence? You need to be equipped with a fake fencecover before you do or you automatically get sent to solitary, lose all yourcontraband, and forfeit three in-game days. You only learn this after youattempt it, and you can't possibly predict every necessary step to avoiddisaster. You're constantly punished for mistakes and losing progress because of them, yet this experimentation is essential.Obtaining what you need to put your plan into action depends on building relationships with other inmates. Unfortunately, you don't interact with them in any meaningful way. You're constantly trying to get on their good side, so they'll sell you items or jump people for you. Yet the relationship progression comes down to you doboring favors like locating items, beating up others, and acknowledging them every day. It feels artificial though. Essentially, you're just raising a meter and your conversations remain the same utterly generic.The whole process is a tough barrier of frustration. Fromaggravating prisoners who constantly attack to the guesswork-focused craftingsystem, The Escapists is always challenging you. On the one hand, this givesyou a grand sense of accomplishment when you win; I enjoyed those lightbulb momentswhen I finally figured something out, and I appreciated the tension that I feltevery time I put my exit plan into the action. On the other hand, the slowprogression loop and repetitive gameplay outweigh the brighter moments.The Escapists implores you to dig deep for yourstrategy, but it doesn't offer enough excitement along the way. The concept issound; I just wish I had more fun. I like the idea of The Escapists better than the game it actually is.", "date": "Feb 13, 2015", "grade": "6"}
