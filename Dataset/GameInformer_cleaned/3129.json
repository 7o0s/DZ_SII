When one of your friends loses a contact lens, do you jump at the opportunity to find it? If you enjoy hunting for well-hidden items, Mystery Case Files will put strain into your eyes in a good way. The goal of the game is simple: find a specific number of items within a heavily cluttered painting before time expires. This may sound easy, but you'd be surprised how well a fish can be hidden. To locate some items, you must interact with the painting, such as tapping a clam to reveal a pearl. There isn't much to the game, but with plenty of paintings to scour, it makes for an enjoyable eye exercise.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
