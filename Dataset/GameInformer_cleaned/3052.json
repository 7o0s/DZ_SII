Race Pro does a good job of handling a number of racing tenants to deliver a simulation-based racer that is fun despite its lack of features. Unfortunately, its bare-bones nature is simply unacceptable in this day and age when racing games are getting more interesting.The only concession Race Pro makes to choice is a contract system that lets you choose a racing series in which you want to participate. Since each car you get handles differently, this isn't a small decision. Thanks to SimBin's physics and car handling, take the assists off and you'll have to adjust how you drive each one.Unfortunately, the track repetition bogs down the game--particularly early on, which is a shame since it has 15 in total. It's at times like these, or when you notice there's no real car damage, that you want more from Race Pro. Sure, you're challenged on the track, but you also want to be excited off of it as well. Codemasters' Grid does a good job of this in its use of sponsorships and teammates.Race Pro's anonymous-sounding name mirrors a game that you might otherwise forget about. This isn't a crime so much as it is a shame. At the very least, Atari has created a ground floor for a franchise that could have some legs thanks to its bedrock developer.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "7"}
