I braced for disappointment, but instead I'm beyond relieved. Thedeveloper didn't just tinker with the game for the sake of slapping the word~new~ on the box. They improved a vital component of the franchise withoutchanging what was already great.The gameplay speed is slower than 2017, allowing users tobetter see, feel, and control players' touches with the ball. The game isslower, but it's by no means clunky. While there are still some moments ofpredetermined possession, if you think you can stretch out that foot for alast-ditch volley on goal or get your foot on the ball to control it and startdribbling on the run, you can do it thanks to the still fluid movement. Thissensation is even more remarkable given that the game adds a layer of physicalityto the gameplay as players shield the ball and jostle for position. The resultof this combination is sophistication, not ugliness. In general, PES'animations are beautiful but rarely feel contrived or cumbersome.As highly as I rate PES 2018's gameplay, legacy issuespersist. Even on higher difficulty levels, rapid one-touch passes, give-and-gopasses, and through balls can break the lines perhaps too easily, and leavedefenses vulnerable. Playing against the A.I., their buildups and attacks can feelthe same. However, I liked having to be selective in my defensive movements,because having to recover from a step in the wrong direction or a hesitationoften makes an important difference between success and failure.The Master League career mode also has its additions,although the mode feels less fresh than the gameplay. Small touches likerelease clauses, a preseason tour, and a new challenge difficulty for the mode(including transfer refusals from some players) are nice, but it still needs anoverhaul. Transfer windows lack drama, with the news buried in menus and a lackof Galcticos and large transfer amounts separating the elite from the rest ofthe pack. I also feel the mode needs more injuries, more variety in the simengine, and in-depth scouting and youth departments. Konami added more club andleague licenses while others like Manchester United and Bayern Munich fallaway, and you'll still have to deal with import files if you want many of yourteams, leagues, and competitions to look like they do in real life.The MyClub fantasy roster mode remains largely the same,but adds 3-on-3 co-op to the play options (co-op is also available for offlineplay), and trying to level up and receive categorical accolades and MyClubrewards is addicting. Exhibition Random Selection matches similarly offer adifferent way to experience the game  even if they're one-off matches  but how this all adds up when you step back and look at the game's bigpicture is hard to assess.I absolutely enjoyplaying PES 2018; its gameplay elevates an aspect that was already strong. Thisis remarkable in and of itself, but also highlights the work still to be donein important areas such as the Master League. The franchise contains a greatfoundation, and will have to continue to build on it to remain at the top ofthe table.", "date": "Sep 12, 2017", "grade": "8.75"}
