Arms explores similarmechanics while pushing the concept far into the realm of the absurd in a waythat is exciting, challenging, and fun.The coreArms experience pits two fighters with extendable arms and super-powered fistsup against one another in one-on-one battles. Punches constantly fly, itemsfall, and tensions rise as the battle goes on. The action in Arms is constant,even when the players are feeling each other out or learning the controls. Ifyou're not throwing a punch, chances are you're dodging one or dashing aroundthe arena to find the right distance and angle. Despite this breakneck pace andaccessible controls, Arms is far more than a shallow experience.Facing off in Arms is more strategic than the basic conceptwould have you believe. Standard fights typically come down staying mobile asfists fly your way, then counterpunching before your opponent can duck out ofthe way. Planning how you use the field also comes into play, as each arenapresents different elements to take advantage of. Do you use the glass tubes inDNA Lab as cover, or do you smash straight through them? Do you keep yourhigh-ground advantage on the stairs at Ninja College, or do you take the fightto your opponent? Arms deftly blends these factors into quick, arcade-stylematches - and you need to gain a base familiarity with all of them beforeyou're going to have a chance against competent enemies. If you try to take ona difficulty level you're not ready for, the steep learning curve only leads tofrustration.An added layer of strategy comes into play before the match,as you not only choose your character, but also which arm loadout you want. Ifyou choose a smaller character, such as the speedy Ninjara, but your opponentselects the bulky tank Master Mummy, you can either try to level the playingfield by selecting heftier arms with slower, more powerful attacks, ordouble-down on the speed advantage by opting for lighter arms.Because of how strategic battles are, being precise andintentional with every move is important. Arms' motion controls feel good; Ilove throwing a right hook in real life and seeing it play out as a curvedright-arm punch in-game. Unfortunately, the default motion controls fail toprovide the level of exactness I needed to be competitive in more difficultbattles. Once I switched to the traditional scheme that uses buttons instead ofmotion controls, I felt much more accurate in my movement and attacks, though Iwish I could remap the buttons.Outside of thestandard fighting modes, Arms features several unique minigames. V-Ball (Arms'oddball take on beach volleyball) and Skillshot (competitive target-smashing)are a blast with friends, but no mode is better silly fun than Hoops, where youattempt to slam or hurl your opponent into a basketball hoop. These minigamesare integrated into the Grand Prix arcade-style offering, local versus, and theonline party modes, but they can also be played standalone. While they are farfrom the main attraction of Arms, I loved whenever they popped up, because theyare an entertaining break in the tense action of hand-to-hand combat. Sadly,these minigames are often over in quick order, and the rule/timer customizationof the fighting modes is largely absent; I would love the ability to make Hoopsmatches last longer. Also, while I enjoy what Arms offers in way of these sidecompetitions, I wanted more of these silly, quick-hit minigames, since the basicofferings feel a little thin.The Grand Prixmode provides a ladder-style tournament similar to what is seen in other arcademodes, but I missed the unique and meaningful nature of a proper story mode. GrandPrix, while challenging, doesn't serve as a strong enough destination mode forwhen your only option is single-player.While myfavorite Arms experiences came from laughing alongside my friends in localmultiplayer, Arms delivers a capable online suite. You can play online againstfriends or try and level up in ranked matches, but nothing compares to theexcitement of party match. In party match, you enter a lobby with other playersand match up in everything from four-player free-for-all fights to the variousminigames to a co-op boss battle, all while the game keeps track of scoreacross all players. Ranked battles let you earn different player titles, givingyou motivation to continue playing over time. No matter whatmode you gravitate toward, you obtain in-game coins, which let you play a bonusgame to earn new arms. As you play the Get Arms target-smash game (which playslike an easier version of Skillshot), giftwrapped presents fall in the distance.If you hit one of these wrapped boxes, you unlock a new arm for one of thecharacters. I relished in adding new abilities to my favorite characters'arsenals. However, with such extravagant character designs, it feels like amissed opportunity for extending the playability of this loop to not includecosmetic customizations into the mix.Arms is a zanyfighter that delivers excitement and fun at every turn. While I wish there wasmore to do, what is included in the package is worthwhile. If you're lookingfor a fresh and exciting experience to play on your Switch, Arms is worth alook.The online portions ofArms were evaluated on pre-release servers.", "date": "Jun 07, 2017", "grade": "8.25"}
