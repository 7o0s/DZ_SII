This latest entry, the first one for Sonys fledgling Vita handheld, is a collaboration between three separate studios. While that sounds potentially troublesome, the game is so in tune with Media Molecules inventive design style and offbeat sense of humor that youd never know it wasnt made by the creators.LittleBigPlanet Vita preserves some of the subtle design changes Media Molecule implemented with sequels and spin-offs. The first games floaty movement physics often led to a cheap death for Sackboy. Over time, these realistic physics have been dialed back in favor of more exact, Mario-style movement. Its a good decision.This new adventure packs in more variety in the form of one-off gameplay sequences, new tools, and vehicles. From grappling sequences to a challenge level where you turn the Vita on end for a slot racing contest, theres always a clever design around the corner ready to surprise you. The only major complaint I have is the boss battles are too routine and sometimes frustrating due to the series odd insistence of having limited lives during the fights. For the rest of the game, you have unlimited checkpoint continues.On any platform, LittleBigPlanet is a hell of a platformer. However, game was made specifically with the Vita in mind. The game makes the best use of the touchscreen Ive seen yet; it doesnt force you into wonky control schemes. Instead, you can use it to quickly hit switches or poke out platforms for Sackboy to jump on using the rear touch panel. The developers consistently find novel uses for the touchscreen that feel organic. That's not even counting the myriad extra minigames that put the touchscreen to good use. This was the most Ive actively used the touchscreen in quick-action sequences, which had the unfortunate side effect of pointing out that the Vitas touchscreen is not nearly as accurate or sensitive as those of most smartphones. The lack of responsiveness led to a few unnecessary deaths.The game also features the groundbreaking creation tools that fans have used to release over 7 million user-created levels since the first game released. Vita owners cant access any previously created levels, but due to some nice features that allow you to use iPhone-style pinch controls to resize, manipulate, and place items with the touchscreen, LBP Vita has the best creation mode in the series to date so eventually levels shouldnt be hard to come by.While LittleBigPlanet has clearly settled into a comfortable groove, its still one of the best pure platformers on the market. LittleBigPlanet PS Vita is another stellar entry on Sackboys impressive resume.", "date": "on Sep 12, 2012", "grade": "8.75"}
