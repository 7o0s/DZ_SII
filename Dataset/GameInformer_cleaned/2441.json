Afterslaying Galens father, Vader secretly brought on the child as hisapprentice. Despite being trained in the dark arts from a young age andcarrying Vaders torch against the Jedi, Galen, under the guise ofStarkiller, still clung to the good inside of him. His softer sideeventually caused him to fall in love with Juno Eclipse, free himselfof his oppressive master, and form a rebellion against the Empire. Inthe end, Starkiller sacrificed his life to save his friends and givethe galaxy a fighting chance against the Empire.The ForceUnleashed II picks up where this tale left off, but it doesnt focus onthe rise of the Rebel Alliance or Vaders unrelenting quest to huntthem down. In a twist that comes dangerously close to breaking StarWars lore, Starkiller returns as a clone, or so Vader tells him.Haunted by visions of Starkillers past and the love he has for Juno,this supposed doppelgangers mission is to find answers as to why heexists, all while battling or embracing ghosts from a soul that may notbe his.The story starts out with a shaky concept and never findssolid ground. Cameo appearances by Yoda and Boba Fett end up goingnowhere. Yodas role is relegated to that of an animatronic Disneycharacter in front of a ride, and Boba Fett talks a big game, but neveronce confronts Starkiller. Boba Fett? Boba Fett? Where? If you can putyourself in the mindset of the prequel movies, where youre willing totolerate a groan-inducing narrative for the tradeoff of Jedi doingbadass things you never thought were possible, The Force Unleashed IIdelivers in a big way.He may be a clone, but Starkillers handleover the Force has grown significantly. When a situation calls forimprovisation, Starkiller shows a flair for the dramatic. Whether thismeans beheading a squadron of stormtroopers or guiding a large spacecruiser inside of a cloning facility, his actions almost always inspireawe and are usually tied to fun gameplay sequences. He can also turnenemies on their own ranks through mind control  an act that alwaysrewards the player with a hilariously visualized betrayal or suicide.When a battle calls for a little extra firepower, Starkiller turns hisForce powers up to 11. With rage fueling his actions, he can bring downa mining droid, an adversary that can normally withstand a dozenlightning blasts and a handful of saber slashes, in one powerful strike.Combatstill has that distinct Force Unleashed feel, but refinements to themechanics, such as the ability to easily pick up and throw items, makeit a more fluid experience. Whether you are Force throwing astormtrooper or crushing a TIE Fighter, the physics convey a true senseof weight and appropriate visualization. I didnt have any issues withthe lightsaber combat in the first game, but many fans felt it was tooshallow. LucasArts addresses this minor irritation with Starkillersacrobatic dual wielding abilities. If you dont want to rely solely onthe Force, you can let the lightsabers do most of the talking. Theenemy lock-on is the only tool that still doesnt quite work, as it issolely based on Starkillers position.The texture work andanimation, for both Starkiller and his opposition, rank among thisgenerations best. LucasArts also went well out of its way to avoidcamera clipping. Every shot is framed beautifully, delivering acinematic view that mimics the motion pictures. The camera work alsobrings you closer to the action than any Star Wars experience before it.Manyof the environments are set on Kamino or the space around it, whichdidnt entrance me like the varied levels in the first game. The onlyiconic locations are a gameplay-free pit stop at a familiar settingfrom the original trilogy and a trip to an intergalactic casino thatwas surprisingly disinteresting. My favorite stage-based moments werethe free fall sequences where Starkiller plummets dangerously towardthe ground.Most levels conclude with a repetitive by-the-numbersboss fight. The last boss fight is particularly nauseating; it lastsfar too long, is too easy, and concludes with one of the mostuneventful send-offs Ive seen. LucasArts hardly offers a compellingconclusion to this story. Most of the key plot points are open tointerpretation, and the logic applied to many of the narrative twistsmake Vader look like a schizophrenic madman who sabotages his own plansmoments after making them.In a similar vein to the Starkillerclones role, The Force Unleashed II is a shadow of its former self.The graceful gameplay offers a higher level of excitement, but the plotand characterization  two large components from which I expect greatthings from any Star Wars journey  makes this experience one of 2010sbiggest disappointments.", "date": "Oct 25, 2010", "grade": "7.75"}
