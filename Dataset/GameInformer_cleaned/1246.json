Frogwares' Sherlock Holmesseries and Telltale's The Walking Dead have carefully identified which elementsof the traditional adventure formula should be preserved, tweaked, or scrappedfor modern audiences. The first episode of The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thiefperfectly illustrates the difference between classic and antiquated. The storyhearkens back to the timeless mysteries of Arthur Conan Doyle and AgathaChristie, weaving a tale full of eccentric characters, plot twists, and a surprisemurder or two. The gameplay, on the other hand, is mired by backtracking,repetition, and scouring environments for objects to solve obscure puzzles.The first chapter of The Raven proves developer KingArt Games is more than capable of weaving an interesting mystery. The stylish openingcinematic sets the stage: In 1964, one of two giant rubies known as the Eyes ofthe Sphinx is stolen by a masked figure who may or may not be the titularmaster thief, The Raven. With the second ruby set to be transported to an exhibitionin Cairo, players accompany the precious cargo aboard both train and oceanliner while waiting for the daring criminal to strike again.While the convoy's modes of transportation provide someclassic mystery settings, the protagonist of the story is refreshinglydifferent. Legendary detective Nicolas Legrand is on the case and closelyguarding the priceless ruby, but players instead take on the role of Swisspolice constable Anton Jakob Zellner. Zellner is a frumpy, over-the-hillofficer who has a penchant for detective novels but not much in the way ofactual investigative experience. Zellner butts his way into Legrand's case andfumbles through one predicament after another, coming off as a lovable loserthat you end up admiring, but wouldn't want to be. The other characters youinteract with draw on various tropes of detective mysteries and haveinteresting backstories, and the dialogue is well-written despite some sketchyvoice acting.Unfortunately, The Raven's gameplay is far less compelling. Antiquateddesign decisions abound; puzzles often involve triggering a frustratinglylinear series of events, so even if you think you know the solution, it may notbe available until you talk to the right people or investigate a certain object often multiple times, as your first interaction doesn't always provide allthe necessary information. This leads to a lot of backtracking and searchingenvironments for that last item to progress the story.At one point, my progress was halted because I missed a small,obscure box that blended into the background  unsurprising, since I had noindication I should be searching for said box in the first place. I also raninto trouble figuring out how to illuminate a darkened environment, whichrequired 10 distinct steps  only half of which were logical. In anotherinstance, I missed out on completing an optional objective (helping a portlyBaroness find her stolen purse) because I accidentally triggered a cutscenethat moved the story forward. The in-game hint system  which sacrifices scorepoints for often inane hints in your journal  does little to alleviate theseproblems. Fortunately, the fan-made guides I found online were more helpful.My bigger complaint with The Raven's puzzles is how littlethey have to do with the investigations at hand. Frogwares' Sherlock Holmesgames feature puzzles that deftly call on the detective's love of deduction,and much of your time is spent figuring out the actual cases you're on. TheRaven's gameplay is decidedly less engaging when you're spending most of yourtime trying to come up with a way to unlock a door or distract a guard. Thesecond half of the chapter features some actual casework as you try to uncoverwho offed one of the ship's passengers, but solving the mystery still makes youfeel like more of an errand boy than a detective.Ultimately, The Raven's underlying mystery is intriguingenough to continue traipsing back and forth between witnesses andreinvestigating crime scenes. However, the chapter ends on such an abrupt cliffhangerthat you won't get much satisfaction out of the experience if you don't plan onplaying the next installment. Thankfully, purchasing The Raven entitles you to all three chapters, even if you have to wait for King Art to finish the remaining two. I forone am interested in seeing where The Raven takes me next  I just hope constableZellner improves his investigation skills in the meantime.", "date": "Aug 01, 2013", "grade": "7"}
