I loved the early titles back in the day, but even such a seeminglyairtight premise as an update to what has already been successful is notenough. So much has happened in the intervening years in gaming in general thatI want more than this title delivers, which at best is an approximation of theseries' gameplay couched in an unimaginative framework.At times Tony Hawk 5 easily reminds me why I played so muchof the series when it debuted. Tricks effortlessly fly off my fingertips as Ibuild crazy combos on the back of whatever surface I can find. I don't know howmuch skating tricks have evolved in the real-life scene since the series'heyday, but you won't find yourself at a loss for self-expression even thoughskaters' trick sets are locked to that particular person.The levels accommodate your imagination, containing longlists of gaps to find and conquer, new twists to familiar levels like theWarehouse and School, and runs that need to be deciphered and mastered. Whilelarger than many of the original levels, the ones in this title are wellconstructed, offering options from moment to moment whether you love to grind,flip into manual, or get air. Many of the levels have power ups you can use  my favorite being the double-jump wings that let you access and grind varyinglevels of the rooftop map. Players can also make their own levels with avariety of objects. These can be plenty large and fans have already re-createdthe first game's classic Warehouse as well as their own original spaces.The game's reality, however, constantly reminds you thatthis isn't the Tony Hawk you remember. Inconsistent framerate, textures thatpop in, and physics quirks that launch you into the sky mar the experienceregularly. I honestly find the latter hilarious if it occurs when I eat itafter failing a trick, but they can also occasionally happen when simply tryingto execute a move at the top of a ramp. As annoying as these bugs are, the gamehas fundamental design problems on its plate.I disagree with the decision to let players glom on topractically any nearby rail, even if your momentum is carrying you in adifferent direction or you're in mid-trick. I don't expect real-world physics,but it takes some of the skill out of the game when you can save yourself fromfailing a trick by hitting triangle/Y button and hope you catch the nearestedge. Robomodo's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD had this same too-forgiving raildetection, and I'm disappointed it hasn't improved.While THPS 5 doesn't feature perfect gameplay, what's justas unfortunate is that the progression system wrapped around it doesn'tinspire. The freeskate objectives of finding the SKATE letters or the hiddentape give you points to upgrade your skills and encourage you to explore thelevels, but the broader missions (which you have to do well in to unlock thenext level) grow old quickly. Their basic template is repeated and adapted ineach level, which means you're going to always be racing through hoops, findingitems and returning them to a specified location, grinding/manualing for aslong as possible, etc., no matter where you are. I actually liked a few ofthem, such as doing tricks on a timer to avoid having your head explode, but itall wore thin quick.The online modes also fail to build to anything meaningful.It's easy to party up and play games like King of the Hill against friends orinvite whoever is near to a quick session, but there is really only oneleaderboard  despite the fact that the game keeps track of numerousindividual stats. Even among friends, the online functions don't spur thatfeeling of, ~Hey, let's skate in this world and see what crazy stuff happens!~For instance, competitor Skate used to encourage players to spontaneouslycreate challenges in the world or dubiously rack up Hall of Meat biffs forpoints. This allowed a normal session to become something else through skaters'own ingenuity. From a technical standpoint, online players will blink out orwarp across the level, which makes it difficult to follow another person to seewhat they're doing, further breaking that feeling of togetherness.After playing THPS 5, I have renewed respect for thestruggles of Tony Hawk's previous developer, Neversoft, as it tried to evolvethe series away from its beginnings. Apart from tightening up its gameplay,Tony Hawk 5 begs for a direction. It's clear that making a game that simplytries to capture the good times in a new setting isn't enough, even if it didnail the gameplay. The gaming landscape has changed a lot since the seriesheyday, but this title is stuck in a no-man's-land between not being goodenough to replicate the past nor ambitious enough to move the franchiseforward.Limited CustomizationTony Hawks Pro Skater 5 doesnt let you create your own skater from scratch, but you can customize the existing skaters. As you progress, youll unlock heads, bodies, and boards for your skater, and mixing and matching these is how you make your skater look how you want  even if it means playing as Tony Hawk, although youve put another persons head on him. Regardless of how your skater looks, they will always share the original pros trick set. This cannot be changed.This review pertains to thePlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game. It also appears on PlayStation3 and Xbox 360, but without online capabilities.Check out Brian and Ben playing the game in our new episode of Test Chamber.", "date": "Oct 02, 2015", "grade": "6.5"}
