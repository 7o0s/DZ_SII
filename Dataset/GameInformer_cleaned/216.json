The gameplay has accessible depth, balancingfundamental emotional needs of immediate gratification with deeper states ofcuriosity and engagement. Now, if you close your textbooks we can get down tothe business of how to topple 18 antique suits of armor and two perched lionstatues with a single flaming golf ball.You start out with a tee shot in an area crowdedwith eminently breakable and often expensive items. A Hall of Mirrors at aFrench palace filled with magnums of champagne. An Australian gas petrolstation with exploding pumps on the outside and well-stocked shelves of food onthe inside. An English manor with enough high-falutin' trimmings to make yourupper lip get stiff. No matter where you are, you're going to want to breakeverything.The tee shot has no power or accuracy meters (thecamera doesn't follow the ball on this shot, either, for some unfathomablereason), but it's not brainless either. Sometimes you're better off aimingbehind you or using the laser-site to knock over and break one item before theball pings off on its way to somewhere else.Most of the boards give you a Smashbreaker next,which lets you steer the ball using Halo-like warthog controls (steering byusing the right analog to control the camera) and apply gas/brake with thetriggers to slow or ramp up the ball's overall speed and bounciness. ASmashbreaker ball also has extra heft, allowing it to bust porcelain urinalsand plow through bookcases. With pounding timpani accentuating its everybounce, you'd think that little fiery ball was almost enjoying itself.The time your ball is in Smashbreaker mode islimited, so you want to end up near the pin, but not too close. The final puttisn't about getting it in the hole; it's about arranging a trick shot to get itthere in style for bonus cash. During putts the ball is more like a homingmissile, so if you approximate the angles you can pull off that high-valueblind triple bank shot and also destroy some more objects along the way.Dangerous Golf straddles different lines toarrive at a difficult-to-achieve nexus of primal fun. The ball physics arenatural enough to produce any number of unpredictable outcomes, though players havesome  but not too much  control. The levels are open and inviting, butcontain some carefully placed objects like mop buckets that can explode forwardto trigger Rube Goldberg-like chain reactions for big dollars. You want to havea plan, but often the best scores and the biggest booms occur when you just gowhere the flaming ball bounces.The many varied outcomes within each of the 100holes is coupled with lots of depth layered on along the way. New areas open upon familiar holes. Bombs can be strategically planted and detonated after yousink your putt. Warp portals take you to new locations. Hazard areas or objectsare instant death if they are hit. Multi-flag holes are a chance to really rackup the bucks. Pistol putts let you go airborne. Even objects in theenvironments have their own surprises. Red pepper boxes explode into instantSmashbreakers, crossbows fire off bolts that aid your cause, and a big-moneySecret Stash bottle hides on every hole. I once got a surprise Smashbreakerwhen I somehow landed my ball pristinely on top of a car jack.Dangerous Golf features couch co-op as well asbuildable playlists for online competitive play, and you can play the entirecareer mode in co-op. Here you pass the controller, but instead of alternatingindividual shots, the second player goes the entire hole in the wake of thefirst player's debris. This creates a kind of friendly competition since thebetter the first player does, the less the second has to smash.You'renot going to find every feature you've ever wanted packed into Dangerous Golf,but what you will find is a title that nails its core gameplay concept. It liessomewhere between precision and randomness  a place where, not accidentally, acharming heart resides.For more on Dangerous Golf, check out our Test Chamber for the game.", "date": "Jun 06, 2016", "grade": "8"}
