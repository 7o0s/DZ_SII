Its blend of quirky trivia and smug sarcasm caught on in a big way, spawning an array of sequels, ports, and TV and online game-show adaptations. Its been a decade since the game has been available on consoles, and the new installmentknown simply as You Dont Know Jackis a great reminder of why it became such a phenomenon in the first place.At its most basic, the game poses a series of 10 trivia questions to up to four players, followed by a lightning round of questions called Jack Attack. Host Cookie Masterson keeps the show running in a format thats inspired as much by game shows as morning-radio sketch comedy. There are fake commercials, clever bumper animations between questions, and recurring characters and in-jokes. Writing is obviously paramount to a game like YDKJ, and the majority of the questions and jokes are top-notch.For example, heres a question called I Heart Atom:If Albert Einstein had written a romantic comedy about the atomic relationship between neutrons and electrons, which Jenifer Aniston flick would have provided the most appropriate title?A) The BreakupB) The Object Of My AffectionC) Hes Just Not That Into YouD) LeprechaunThis is a fairly representative YDKJ question, which requires a working knowledge of both ordinary and pop culture. Part of the fun of the game is trying to decipher what exactly is being asked, and being the first to buzz in. Dis or Dat questions are another highlight, which require players to sort items by category. I especially liked one that had me determine whether proper nouns such as O-Zone, Cutter, and Take That were boy bands or brands of insect repellent. Each session lasts about 15 minutes total, and the game includes more than 70 different episodesand THQ promises more will be available as DLC after the game is released. While its certainly possible to play alone, that experience is lonely guy gaming at its finesteither get together with some friends or connect online for the best experience. Its a competitive experience, but its also a great social game. You Dont Know Jack is proof that games dont need to be excessively complex in order to be fun. Really, theres not much to it aside from pressing the buttons that correspond with then right answers. Dinging the game on its simplicity really misses the point, though. If you have fond memories of the series or are in the market for an uproarious multiplayer game, its time for a Jack Attack.(The answer to the earlier question by the way, is C) Hes Just Not That Into You.)", "date": "Feb 08, 2011", "grade": "8"}
