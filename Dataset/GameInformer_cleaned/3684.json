Its slickpresentation, Ghost in the Shell-inspiredworld, and mature narrative earned it a cult following. That following hadreason to rejoice when Sushee's Kickstarter campaign promised to bring theseries back. Unfortunately, Fear Effect Sedna could serve as a case study oneverything that can go wrong when resurrecting a franchise. The original Fear Effect and its prequel were some of thefirst games to bring anime-like visuals to life, and their smooth storytellinghelped them stand out. Sedna fails to recapture any of that magic. The generic environmentslack the neon glow and exotic technology that made the original series sodazzling, while the story is a mess of cringe-inducing dialogue. I didn't knowwho the main antagonist was until the final boss fight, and even then, their motivationswere unclear. When the credits rolled, I was left wondering, ~What was thepoint?~As bad as the story is, things are worse between cutscenes.Sedna attempts to mix top-down shooting with stealth and strategy, but itsexecution is bad in every category. As a top-down shooter, Sedna feelsunresponsive and clunky. During battle, you have the option to pause the actionand issue commands to your party, but the combat isn't built around this typeof strategy. A single attack does little damage, and you don't have a widevariety of abilities to choose from. This makes the action plodding andmonotonous if you're pausing frequently. Hardcore strategy also isn't necessarybecause the A.I. is so stupid. It doggedly locks on to one character and rarelylooks away; I often had that character hide in cover and wait until the rest ofmy companions took out the inexplicably fixated enemy. If you're patient, you can attempt to take out some foesbefore they spot you by sneaking up behind with a knife. Most guards havesimple patrol patterns, but your stealth movements are so slow that catching upwith them is difficult. Progressing through areas using stealth is tediousbecause you can't hide bodies, and once an enemy discovers a fallen comrade,they sound an alarm and every enemy in the room rushes toward it. Again, theA.I. is so simple that they just look at the body for a minute or so and thenreturn to their patrol patterns, but you have to wait until they're doneexamining the body before you can progress. I also had enemies pop up in frontof me as I was trying to sneak through an area, so the stealth option neverfelt like a viable tactic. You encounter a handful of puzzles between gunfights. Most area chore to navigate, some boil down to brute force trial-and-error, and othersmake no sense within the world's fiction. For example, you have to diffuse abomb by cutting the wires that match a series of numbers on posters indifferent rooms, but there is never any connection made between the posters andthe bomb. Even worse, sometimes you don't know if you don't understand apuzzles logic or if you're actually solving it correctly, because bugs preventsome puzzles from being solved. In one case, I had to restart an entire levelbecause a puzzle wasn't accepting the correct solution. Fear Effect Sedna has a handful of other bugs that ruined myprogress as well. At one point, a character got stuck in the stealth positionand would only attack people with a knife. At another, the game just stoppedsaving my progress, which was a real problem since there is no manual savesystem. Even diehard fans of the original Fear Effect should stayaway from this mess of broken gameplay, system-breaking bugs, and slapdashnarrative.", "date": "Mar 05, 2018", "grade": "2"}
