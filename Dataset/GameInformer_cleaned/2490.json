Reaching out to a bigger crowd,Front Mission Evolved ditches the previous entries' turn-basedtactical gameplay in favor of third-person action. While a fewsignature series staples remain, such as a convoluted politicalstoryline and tons of customization options, the fast-paced mech combatmakes blowing the crap out of stuff far more accessible and fun. Youtake control of a walking tank (or Wanzer) that can be customized tosuit your play style based on speed, power, or durability. Part of thefun is tweaking these machines between missions, ensuring you aren'tpacking too much heat (overweight machines are about as good as scrapmetal). I preferred strapping on a missile launcher and sniper riflefor ranged combat; slamming foes with exploding missiles while pickingoff limbs is effective and satisfying. If you lean more toward melee,you can equip oversized shields and blunt weapons for extra force anddefense, handy when having to quickly power through tons of enemies toreach the next checkpoint. I found ranged assaults to be the mosteffective, but it is easy to adjust to other types as needed to survivespecific scenarios. If you want to just jump into the action, you canselect from a number of pre-built machines, but manually tinkering withthe breadth of customization options ensures the highest probability ofsuccess.The mission objectives are standard, but tight controlsand performance-based difficulty scaling keep things enjoyable. You mayneed to speed boost across an entire level to survive a collapsingenvironment, man missiles aboard an aircraft, topple an enormous boss,or simply blast the hell out of everything in your path. Some scenariosrequire you to ditch the Wanzer and take out human opponents on foot -- missions I could have lived without. These sections slow pacingand combat mechanics aren't as tight as the mech battles. Oncereunited with your Wanzer, however, you'll look forward totransforming your opponents into heaping piles of burning metal.FrontMission Evolved offers four multiplayer modes that are average at best:deathmatch, team deathmatch, domination (take control of turrets), andsupremacy (claim capture points). While chasing and destroying liveopponents might be fun on launch day, the modes are not compellingenough to compete with other multiplayer offerings out there.FrontMission Evolved isn't for everyone, and fans of the series may bedisappointed by the deviation from tactical gameplay, but theaction-focused formula works well enough to earn the series somenew fans.", "date": "zalez on Sep 28, 2010", "grade": "7.75"}
