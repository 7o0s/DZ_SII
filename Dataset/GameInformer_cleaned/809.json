That's the quandary I faced while trying toreview Tuffy the Corgi and the Tower of Bones. Unlike other indie darlings thatcelebrate the challenge and skill of yesteryear's classics, Tuffy is adifferent breed of platformer  a punishing homage that demands a level ofperfectionism and patience only speedrunners possess, leaving most gamers stuck onthe ground floor.Tuffy's goal is to make it to the top of the titular towerwhile collecting 108 bones along the way, and you control the cutesy caninewith a two-button control scheme that mixes traditional platforming with the endlessrunner genre. Tuffy ceaselessly bounds forward with the happy-go-luckystubbornness you might expect from a corgi pup; pressing the left shoulderbutton causes him to switch directions, while pressing the right shoulder buttoncauses him to jump. The initial jankiness of the atypical control scheme slowlygives way to a satisfying platforming rhythm and subtle nuances likewalljumping emerge, but not before driving countless corgis off the cliff of anold-school learning curve.Once you realize that everything kills Tuffy with one hit andthat dying always resets your progress and starts you back at the beginning ofthe tower, you give up on the foolish completionist goal of collecting all 108bones. Instead, you focus on just trying to make it to the top. After hours offurther dying fully conveys the massive scope of the singular and increasinglydifficult level, you give up your dream of making it to the top, and your solegoal becomes playing the game for as long as you can stand it.Which brings me back to the initial question: How many timesdo you have to die before you decide a game isn't for you?I continued thinking about that question as I slowly ekedout progress with each soon-to-be-dead corgi. The further I got in the tower ofbones, the longer each run took, as I tried desperately to recall and avoid everydeadly trap. Reaching new sections of the tower became rarer as I remade old,frustrating mistakes and slowly learned how to navigate new traps. After hoursof play, 161 deaths, and hundreds of bones collected and lost, I was ready to call it quits. Tuffy encapsulates everything I loved and hated about videogames as a kid. The endearing, pixelated art style is as charming as yourfavorite SNES classic, and the platforming controls perform admirably (even ifI'd still give Tuffy's right paw for direct control over his movement). At thesame time, Tuffy's unforgiving design and reliance on rote memorization harken backto a time when I had nothing better to do than memorize tricky platformingsections. There's a reason I've moved on from those types of games, and whymost developers have too.Despite my unabashed love of punishing retro platformerslike Spelunkyand SuperMeat Boy (not to mention an equal fondness for adorable corgis), I neverwarmed to Tuffy. Unless you're obsessed with speedrunning (and are just obsessivein general), this is one stray dog you shouldn't play with.", "date": "Jul 28, 2014", "grade": "6"}
