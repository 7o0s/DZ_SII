No matter how pure your intentions are, though,any game still has to meet you halfway. Like the lazy Adam in Michaelangelo'sfamous painting, Impire seems unconcerned with making any more than a tokeneffort to entertain. The dungeon-builder revels in the cartoonishly twistedevils of its buffoonish characters, but Impire's soulless design fails to turnthat premise into anything approaching fun.Neither of the two phasesof playing through a scenario in Impire is enjoyable, though each action youtake fits neatly into the overall structure and is easily accomplished with thewell-crafted interface. Carving your two-dimensional dungeon out of the bedrockand designating rooms for spawning minions, torturing captured heroes, farmingmushrooms, and other nefarious tasks is simple. Fifteen minutes later, you'veplumbed the ankle-deep depths of Impire's dungeon-building.The layout hardly matters.Once you've ticked off all the boxes in your construction checklist, you'redone. Sure, you can lay traps for invading heroes and make sure your treasurechambers aren't adjacent to the entrance of your lair, but that's the end ofit. Forget about any kind of simulation aspect; neither defense nor economicefficiency is affected by your decisions in any material way. Resources aregained primarily by raiding the overworld, which in practice means sending asquad of minions off the map for three minutes and collecting the spoils theyreturn with. Traps are hilariously incapable of killing anything, so defendingyour domain is simply a matter of teleporting your biggest squads on top ofenemies for a trivial mana cost, then paying that inconsequential price againto send them back on their way.The second part of anImpire scenario, which takes place concurrently with the first, is even lessentertaining. Your squads of minions (each consisting of one healer, one tank,and two of the best other units you can afford) crawl through preset enemydungeon layouts, beating up the foes standing between them and your objectives.Tactics are impossible to execute, as giving any orders prevents your squad AIfrom using its powers appropriately. Tanks don't protect their fellows andhealers don't heal if you give a direct attack order, for example. The idea ofbuilding a better army and then watching the AI battle it out works fine inother titles where it's a sideline to the real meat of managing a simulation,like in Majesty. In Impire, the lack of anything else to do makes thenon-interactive combat just another frustration.The story attempts tochannel Majesty's fantasy-parody wackiness into the realm of squirrely demonsand bumbling would-be maniacal conjurers. The effort is sadly crushed under theweight of badly acted, bland dialogue set in interminable cutscenes that onlyillustrate the lack of fine details in the character models and animations. I'drecommend just skipping the cutscenes, but that only accelerates your descentinto another boring section of gameplay.Multiplayer is no better.Racing against human- and bot-controlled enemy dungeon masters is lessterminally dull than the turgid single-player campaign, but the gameplay sharesall of the problems found offline and trades the lame storyline for infuriatingconnection problems.I wish I had nicerthings to say about Impire, but my disappointment with its failure to turn anyof its concepts into interesting interactive gameplay is total. As cool as theconcept is, gamers interested in building an underground lair and tormentingwould-be heroes are still stuck waiting for a worthy successor to 1997'sDungeon Keeper.", "date": "Mar 05, 2013", "grade": "5"}
