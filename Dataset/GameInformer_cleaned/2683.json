Now Capcom has bundled the original game in with a long list of extra content similar to Game of the Year editions seen with other hit titles. While some add-ons are better than others, the overall value here impresses.DLC AlternativeIf you already own Resident Evil 5, its smart to download the content separately or get it all in the Untold Stories DLC bundle. The bundle comes to approximately $12 instead of $50 for the packaged Gold Edition. The Mercenaries Reunion characters come included with the four DLC packs so you wont have to pay extra for that mode. If you want all of the content on one disc, the PS3 edition is your only option. The 360 version comes with a download token for the Gold features, since it wont all fit on a DVD. Most importantly, downloading means you can play everything before Gold Edition hits retail on March 9.February 17 (360)/ 18 (PS3)Lost in Nightmares - 400 MSP ($5)Costume Pack 1 - 160 MSP ($2)March 3 (360)/ 4 (PS3)Desperate Escape - 400 points ($5)Costume Pack 2 - 160 points ($2)March 10 (360)/ 11 (PS3)Untold Stories Bundle - 960 points ($12)Trophies/AchievementsLost in Nightmares:Beat Lost in NightmaresEarn an S rank on LiNBeat LiN on Professional difficultyDo a set amount of damage to WeskerShoot all 18 hidden score stars in LiNDesperate Escape:Beat Desperate EscapeEarn an S rank on DEBeat DE on Professional difficultyKill 150 enemiesKill 3 Agitator MajiniTwo new stages are the biggest draw. Lost in Nightmares, a flashback to Chris Redfield and Jill Valentines raid of the Spencer manor, is the better of the two. Nostalgia is the focus here. You start out creeping around a dark and seemingly empty mansion, finding crank handles and passwords to unlock new areas. Camera swoops through doorways as you transition to a new room cleverly evoke those classic load screens without making you wait around. Once you get underground, however, combat ramps up. A new non-Majini enemy type provides a nice challenge, especially in tight corridors. If youre playing alone, however, your AI partner can annoyingly block your only escape route in these halls, resulting in a cheap death at the hands of these creatures. The final two sections involve a clever environmental kill puzzle room and a challenging battle with Wesker (as seen in the flashback cutscenes in RE 5).Desperate Escape, the second new stage, follows Jill and Josh Stone during the main RE 5 timeline as they make their way to the endgame helicopter. Since this is set in the same world as the core game, a full set of standard Majini, chainsaw guys, and chain gunners are available for the shooting. A brief rocket turret set piece provides something new, but most of the stage is about surviving waves of enemies while sticking around in one location. Keeping your AI partner alive on the last rooftop can be a complete pain in the ass. Unless you take out the most dangerous enemies ASAP, youll constantly be reviving him or watching the dreaded Your partner died screen.Each of these stages takes around an hour to complete, and a variety of achievements and trophies provide some nice replay incentive (see sidebar). Unfortunately, you cant bring any of your upgrades from the main career into these levels, which sucks because the progression system is one of my favorite things about RE 5. Who cares if I want to rocket the hell out of everything? At least give me the option on a second playthrough.I wasnt a huge fan of the original Mercenaries mode, where you chain together Majini kills for a high score within a certain time limit, but the new Mercenaries Reunion spices up the old formula. Utilizing new crazy costumes for Chris and Sheva along with corresponding alternate weapon loadouts, Reunion allows players to use overpowered weapons like Chris chain gun in a Mercs context. Plus, this is the only way to play as Excella Gionne and classic characters Barry Burton and Rebecca Chambers. Reunion wont necessarily convert Mercenaries haters, but its amusing to check out if only to see Barrys interpretation of Miranda Rights.The last piece of Gold content is the online versus mode thats been available as DLC since shortly after the original games release. This mode isnt amazing, but its nice to have for completeness sake.", "date": "Mar 10, 2010", "grade": "9.5"}
