While the studios financial troubles could mean a new film wont be hitting theaters in the foreseeable future, Activision has come to the rescue. James Bond 007: Blood Stone delivers a solid dose of the agent, with the same exotic locations, over-the-top action sequences, and enough double-crosses to keep fans busy for a while.Activision made a great choice in tapping Bizarre Creations for the all-new Bond adventure. The studio built its reputation on racing games like the Project Gotham series, but it also showed its potential in the shooter genre with the criminally overlooked The Club. Blood Stone divides its gameplay between on-foot action and vehicle-based sequences, and the shooting segments are surprisingly the stronger of the two styles. The vehicular sections are overly long, with slippery controls and spotty collision detection. Youd expect to have a few issues with tire grip on a Siberian ice floe, but the cars seem equally squirrely on the streets of Bangkok.Bizarre took its cue from the latest incarnation of the character, which focuses on the brutality lurking just underneath Bonds polished veneer. While he still looks good in a tuxedo, this Bond is just as happy snapping necks and hyperextending arms as he is sipping cocktails at a baccarat table. Thanks to his prowess as a melee fighter (and his quickly regenerating health), Bond can rush into firefights, disable a nearby enemy in hand-to-hand combat, and finish the encounter by popping off a few guards in the background with a silenced pistol.I was tempted to lean on the melee attacks because the guns feel underpowered. That carries over to the multiplayer segments as well. In both modes, melee attacks earn players focus aim shots. In single-player, theyre essentially instant kills, slowing down time and lining up headshots at the press of a button. In multiplayer, time isnt slowed for obvious reasons, but opponents are still lined up nicely.As with any self-respecting Bond game, the action takes place in a variety of locations across the globe. Some, such as the Monaco casino from Casino Royale and a Burmese dam, are bound to inspire feelings of dj vu, but the action is generally good enough to make it worth double-stamping your passport. The story was written by GoldenEye scribe Bruce Feirstein, and hes packed some excellent setpiece moments into Blood Stone. One memorable chase takes place in Bangkok, with Bond pursuing an earth-mover through traffic as it knocks cars and highway structures asunder. And when Bond meets a contact in a crowded aquarium, wouldnt you know that assassins are ready to crash the party?The whole experience is packed with moments like this. Any game can have you systematically work your way through a villains fortified lair. Doing so while he taunts you over the installations loudspeakers is classic Bond.Many gamers have fond memories of multiplayer matches starring James Bond, and Blood Stone ventures into that arena, too. Up to 16 players can compete as either MI6 agents or mercenaries across eight maps. Aside from team deathmatch and last man standing modes, multiplayer offers a pair of objective-based challenges. Each side either works through a series of three objectives (which culminate in satisfyingly large explosions) or do their best to prevent the other from completing the task. Its a lot of fun, though its a showcase for just how powerful the melee attacks can be. The animations arent as intricate in multiplayer, but theyre just as effective. Unfortunately, they lack the satisfying crack of Halos melee attacks; even when I was victorious in the frequent melee battles, it felt as though I was swatting at air.Players also earn ranks as they play multiplayer, unlocking new skins and weapons. One cool gimmick has the leading player from each team take on the skin of their sides respective hero  James Bond or the evil mastermind Rak. It doesnt grant any special abilities, but its a showy way to prove your worth.Bizarre clearly set out to make Blood Stone feel like a part of Bonds movie canon, and its certainly successful on that front. The weapons are anemic, and the driving sections can be dodgy, but it delivers a dose of spectacle and intrigue worthy of the character.", "date": "Nov 02, 2010", "grade": "7.5"}
