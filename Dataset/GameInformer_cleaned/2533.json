I was nervous about another big changeto the series I love so much, but mixing the exploration and atmosphereof Metroid with the tight acrobatic action of Team Ninjas Ninja Gaidenseries seemed like a very possible win -- you know the old clich abouttwo great tastes that go great together. Unfortunately, thiscombination proves sour.To begin with, Metroids signature senseof isolation on a harsh, alien planet is largely absent since Samus isno longer running solo. Shortly after boarding a derelict spacestation, she meets a crew of Galactic Federation soldiers, and --surprise! -- she has a secret history with several of them. These newallies could have presented a forgivable way to mix up the Metroidformula, but they end up having a negative impact on almost everyaspect of the game.Samus ends up working together with the crew,which makes sense. However, in a totally absurd decision that doesntwork well for her character, she decides to follow the orders ofcommanding officer Adam Malkovich. Although you supposedly begin OtherM fully-powered, Samus will not use her variety of missiles, advancedguns, or armor upgrades until Malkovich authorizes it. I refuse tobelieve that a badass bounty hunter would refuse to activate herarmors heat-resistant Varia suit as she marches through the heart of avolcano with her health constantly draining -- an actual scenario fromthe game.Youll run into situations like this again and again,where a super missile or grappling hook would allow you to progress,but instead youre given orders to turn around, knowing youll have tobacktrack later. Its like Team Ninja wanted to prove that they couldcome up with a more contrived way to lock down your powers than theaverage Metroid game where you just lose them in the beginning sequence.Onthe other hand, maybe Samus is happy not using her full range ofweaponry, because its kind of a pain to do so. Since control islimited to a single Wii remote, many of the games encounters boil downto running in a circle, charging up your gun, and shooting over andover until the enemy dies, praying that the games dodgy auto-targetingworks. Aiming at the screen with the Wii remote takes you intofirst-person view, which is the only way you can shoot missiles.Unfortunately, this also takes away your ability to move. If thedeveloper thought that frequent, jarring switches to first-person toshoot off a few desperate missiles before you get attacked is a fungameplay mechanic, they were wrong.The combat isnt the mostpainful part of Other M, though; that award goes to the stilteddialogue in its many overlong cutscenes. Instead of the subtle,effective storytelling of Super Metroid (which Other M follows in theMetroid timeline), youll get cinematics that look beautiful but oftenrun as long as 15 minutes, exhausting players with repetition ofobvious plot points and overwrought dialogue as mature and interestingas a teenagers diary.The biggest culprit in the badstorytelling is Samus herself. She has a constant running narration,which makes the whole experience feel unnecessarily expository. Iassume its meant to lend her emotional gravity, but the soulless voiceacting and ham-fisted writing make that impossible. Even worse, Samusoften comes off as an idiot. After one supporting character has clearlyestablished that the space station has been doing biological weaponstests, Samus asks, ~Do you think they were doing biological weaponstests?~ Later, in her internal monologue, she again reiterates thisconfirmed fact we learned just 20 minutes ago.If thats notenough to make her unlikable, her attitude toward the GalacticFederation soldiers is. When shes not blindly following orders for nodiscernible reason, she becomes a spoiled brat. One major flashbackrevolves around how Samus became known as the soldier who would givethumbs down during mission briefings. Who does that?!Late in thegame, once Samus unlocks all of her abilities and begins meeting morefamiliar faces from the series, I experienced fleeting moments where itall clicked, and I saw glimpses of how great Other M could have been.But an hour or two of less painful gameplay cant make up for the baddesign choices at this games core. It especially cant make up forwhat Other M has done to Samus as a character. Shell forever betrapped in my mind as a whiny, talkative child who is too willing togive up her freedom and too petulant to be likable. Metroid: Other M isthe most disappointing Nintendo release in quite some time and ablemish that isnt likely to be forgotten on an otherwise superb franchise.", "date": "Aug 27, 2010", "grade": "6.25"}
