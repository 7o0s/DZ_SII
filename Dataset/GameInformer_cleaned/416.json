The little mechanical helper has scootedfrom 3D platformer to garden sim to augmented reality, with the only consistentpart of his life being his inability to fully get a handle on career stability.Whether Chibi-Robos scattershot approach or tiny mechanical claws are toblame, one things certain: This hero needs a jolt of something. With Zip Lash,developer Skip Ltd. is yet again trying something different. Now Chibi-Robo isusing his extension cord to whirl through 2.5D worlds, and hopefully plug intowhat audiences are looking for. Im not entirely convinced hes found solidfooting here, but Im glad to see the little guy again.Chibi-Robos cord is a versatile little apparatus, allowinghim to pick up distant objects or latch onto special panels, grappling-hookstyle. Press a button, and he whips it forward or above him at a 45-degreeangle. Hold down another button, and he uses a charged line  the titular ZipLash  which can be aimed more precisely. Chibi may only be a few inches tall,but collecting balls that are scattered throughout the levels adds more slackto his line. Max it out, and you have a line that bounces off walls, careeningdown tunnels in a nifty zig-zag effect, smashing enemies and sucking up anycollectibles that cross its winding path. Theres a nice balance between thetwo moves, and dialing in the perfect bank shot can be tense, particularly inauto-scrolling sections or when an unstoppable enemy is bearing down on you.On a surface level, its reminiscent of Capcoms old gameBionic Commando, though Chibi is otherwise unarmed and hes able to jump. Evenwithout a machine gun, enemies dont stand much of a chance when theyreknocked in their mechanical noggins with Chibis plug. Theyre part of an alieninvasion force, though I dont think humanity has much to worry aboutconsidering their size and their habit of moving in simple, predictablepatterns. Chibi is fun to control, and I had a great time using hisplug attack. Unfortunately, hes the star of a fairly uninspired show. Thelevels are either cleanly designed or simply plain, depending on how charitablyyou want to describe them. One of the most compelling things about thecharacter is his height, and how it affects his perspective on the world; whenyoure that small, getting onto a couch is a challenge. Thats something thatsnot ever explored in any interesting way, which is a waste. Aside from seeinghow big he is next to a sardine tin or soda can, I never got a sense of hisrole in the world or how he stacks up. Levels are so abstracted that scaleisnt communicated effectively.Aside from one notable exception, levels are also quite linear.Chibi needs to collect a variety of objects along his journey, so explorationis clearly part of the game. Unfortunately, secrets are so obviouslytelegraphed that they dont qualify as being secret. If you see a gap in the ceiling,I can say with certainty that you will find something if you fire your Zip Lashup. Walk to the left of your starting position, and you will find something inabout 75 percent of the stages. The only reason I wasnt able to findeverything the first run through was because one variety of collectible onlyappears after a level is completed.Chibi doesnt just grab things to make his cord longer. Hecan find Robo-Tots, which return from Photo Finder. These tiny guys are supercute, but they can be hard to grab, thanks to their habit of running away.Chibi can also pick up trash, which is used in his home bases generator andconverted into watts to keep Chibis batteries topped off. You can also find ahost of real-world snacks, including Tootsie Pops, Pocky, and Mentos. Chibi cangive these to special friends who are seeking specific foods, and players getwhat amounts to a sales pitch as a reward. Its kind of funny and weird, andits interesting to learn about snacks from around the world if youre intothat sort of thing.Players are strong armed into replaying levels thanks to oneof the weirdest level-select systems I can recall. Each of the six worlds issplit into six stages, which are arranged in a loop. Complete a stage, and youget to spin a spinner, which tells you how many spaces you need to move on theloop. If things go well, you spin a one and proceed to the next stage. Mess up,and you have to replay stages until the numbers align in your favor. Since thestages are designed to be played in a fairly methodical style, you cant zipthrough a stage  even a familiar one  in 30 seconds. You can use in-gamecurrency to buy the numbers you want on the spinner, which only reinforced mythought that its not a super-great idea.And woe to those who are forced to replay the stages thatare based on Chibis vehicles. He has access to a variety of rides, including alittle skateboard, submarine, balloon thing, waterski, and more. Theyreuniformly sluggish and boring, and they drag on for far too long. The submarineis the absolute worst of the worst, which is impressive because the balloon isso dreadful. Both feature exaggerated momentum and inputs that dont seem toregister until youre careening toward a mine or sharp-beaked bird. I wanted topull the plug on the game during several of these frustrating sections, but Ithought Id leave that up to Mr. Robo.There are a lot of aggravating things about the game, butits also a lot of fun at times. The boss fights are cleverly designed andimplemented, and they make great use of the hardwares 3D effects. Even thoughChibi-Robo doesnt gain any permanent new combat abilities during his worldtour, the big battles manage to provide novel challenges.Ive championed the character since I was introduced to thefirst Chibi-Robo game on GameCube. I think his helpful nature and simple designare appealing, and its been disappointing to see him flounder from release torelease. Zip Lash isnt the game thats ultimately going to convert people intobeing Chibi-Robo fans; its a competent platformer, but it sticks too close tothe genre manual and is missing a much-needed spark.Chibi AmiiboChibi-Robo! Zip Lash is available as a standalone game or bundled with an Amiibo. Aside fromproviding a full-scale collectible of the character, the figurine has a fewin-game effects as well. Players can use him to transform into a gold-finishedsuper form, which boasts a longer health bar. It also opens up a capsulemachine, which dispenses virtual toys that can then be arranged andphotographed, and bonus stages. Theyre cute additions, but Im just happy tohave a Chibi-Robo Amiibo  in-game extras or not.", "date": "Oct 08, 2015", "grade": "7"}
