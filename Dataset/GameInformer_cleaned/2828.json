After playing Drawn to Life: The Next Chapter and dealing withthe frustrating inaccuracy of the Wii Remote as a drawing tool, it'sclear the stylus is a far superior choice. As you traverse worldsin The Next Chapter you come across easels that open the game'sdrawing program after a slow load. In this mode you're encouraged tohold the Wii Remote as you would a paintbrush; however, doodling withno direct contact to the surface on which you're drawing is asdifficult as it sounds. Creating something as simple as the sun(basically a yellow circle) was a free-hand nightmare. A variety ofdrawing impements, stamps, and fill tools are helpful for those of uswith the artistic talents of a kindergartner. But even with thistoolset, the poor Wii controls make creating anything with even theslightest detail a chore. I found myself frequently using the game'spre-generated templates to avoid drawing altogether. Adding yourpersonal touch to Drawn to Life was the title's biggest draw, but inpractice it's the most discouraging activity in this game.TheNext Chapter's 2D levels are mostly standard platforming fare, withplenty of items to collect including coins, stamps, and stickers. Inaddition to drawing platforms to get across these levels, you can alsodesign utility items that may or may not work, such as claws to scalewalls, hot air balloons to fly over rooftops, or a monkey tail thatallows you to swing across gaps. To add variety to the levels, PlanetMoon added the new Action Canvas to the Wii version. When dotted linesin the form of a square or rectangle appear overhead, your scribbles inthese spaces will create new ways to traverse based on the ink coloryou use. Blue ink creates steady platforms you can jump on, red inkcreates dropping platforms you can use to climb, and green ink createsa trampoline platform to catapult you to higher areas. To get the mostuse of these platforms you'll need a steady hand and luck, becausethe poor controls turn most of your rectangular drawings into deformedhexagons that do little to help your progression. It usually takesmultiple tries before you finally create something that can help youget across.Drawn to Life: The Next Chapter's multiplayer letstwo players compete head-to-head in sports minigames. Players canengage in soccer, hockey, volleyball, and basketball, as well as designtheir own uniforms and equipment. These games, though short andseemingly misplaced, are a fun diversion from the frustratingsingle-player game.The idea of empowering user-generated art asa gameplay element is a concept that works well on the DS. However,with poor execution and clumsy controls on the Wii, you'll find morefun with a coloring book and a 64-pack of crayons than you will inDrawn to Life: The Next Chapter.", "date": "zalez on Oct 27, 2009", "grade": "5.75"}
