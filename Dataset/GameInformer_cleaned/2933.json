{"name": "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/transformers_revenge_of_the_fallen/b/xbox360/archive/2009/09/22/review.aspx", "text": "The video game adaptation of Michael Bay's money-grabbing train wreck doesn't include plot holes the size of the Milky Way, robots promenading as racial caricatures, or any form of leg humping. While avoiding the film's oil-soaked qualities, the game also lacks Bay's eye for jaw-dropping action. Whether you are playing through the Autobot or Decepticon campaign, the firefights are yawn-inducing affairs that have a chance to become comedic from malfunctioning AI (in a boss fight, Starscream flew directly into a pillar, where he sat motionless as I pulverized his inert form). Moreover, repetitive mission objectives do little to spur you forward. As lifeless as the single-player experience is, multiplayer pumps out satisfying robot mayhem. Each character plays like a different class, making for battles that demand teamwork and strategy. The game is more enjoyable than the movie, but only if you intend to put your skills to the test in the competitive arena.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
