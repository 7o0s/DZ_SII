When the DS, Xbox 360, PS3, PSP, and Wii all released to the public, Americas favorite coach-turned-commentator was there to commemorate the occasion with a shoddy, half-baked entry to the popular football franchise. Youd think after five consecutive failed kickoff attempts EA would learn its lesson and choose to stay on the sidelines for the first quarter, but the 3DS version stubbornly follows the other launch titles into a bad situation.Unlike the infamous Xbox 360 launch, at least the 3DS version is playable. Developer EA North Carolina admirably crammed the traditional Madden controls onto the 3DS, and the moment-to-moment action doesnt feel markedly different from the console experience. Players move with a proper sense of momentum, and you can use the touchscreen to make pre-snap adjustments to wide receiver routes.If youre looking for a game that demonstrates the value of a 3D display, I recommend looking elsewhere. The game doesnt do much to take advantage of the functionality other than a few slow-motion spotlight moments that give you a chance to watch the 3D player models up close. Rain and snow effects could have capitalized on the technology, but I never played a game in the elements and you cant predetermine the weather before games. If I looked at the bottom screen to choose an audible or play, it sometimes took a second for my eyes to readjust to the 3D effects up top, which can cost you precious seconds with the play clock winding down. The GameFlow automatic playcalling system introduced last year is present, which helps keep the game moving along quickly. Hardcore fans will want to turn it off, however, as the problems that plagued the system havent been fixed. It fails to recognize and match passing formations with nickel and dime packages when youre playing defense, which puts you at a severe disadvantage. Unlike the next-gen versions, you cant go under the hood to fine-tune the type and frequency of the playcalls either. With the lockout in full effect, this version keeps the rosters from last season intact, but with one large annoyance. Many of the players who wound up on the injury report last season havent been re-inserted in the starting lineup, so you need to manually make the changes yourself. This also applies to the five-on-five rosters, but you inexplicably cant choose your five players, meaning you have to settle for lesser players like Bernard Berrian over much more effective stars like Sidney Rice.Some small annoyances also keep the game from competing on the level of its brethren. If a ref makes a questionable call you dont have the opportunity to challenge, and the game lacks a true hurry-up offense option if youre using GameFlow. You can get to the line of scrimmage, but precious time is automatically taken off the clock. When the pressure gets heavy in the pocket, the console versions allow you to sprint out of harms way. On the 3DS your quarterback cant turn on the jets to avoid the rush until hes well out of the pocket or across the line of scrimmage. The game also deals with fumbles improperly, stopping the play if an offensive player recovers the ball or a punt returner picks up the ball after flubbing the catch.Though the gridiron action wont get EA booed off the field, the questionable decision-making regarding the game modes will. Madden 3DS features no multiplayer or franchise modes. All you get is a bare bones season mode that doesnt even keep track of your season stats (a feature that even Tecmo Super Bowl mustered on feeble NES technology). You can play a full season, half season, or the playoffs. Thats it. No draft, no player trades, and no contract negotiations with free agents. In an era where millions of football fans obsess over stats, build fantasy teams, and even tune in to watch NFL combine drills, Im not sure what audience EA is targeting by stripping Madden of its core multiplayer and franchise mode features. Nintendo handhelds may not always attract hardcore gamers, but that doesnt mean football fans who own the devices dont want a fully featured game.", "date": "Mar 25, 2011", "grade": "6"}
