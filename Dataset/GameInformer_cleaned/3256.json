But every fighter has a few tricks up his or her sleeve, and FaceBreaker is no different. Whatever critical punishment you can level at the game, its gameplay core packs enough punch to survive your flurry.FaceBreaker is a throwback to the classic button-masher Mike Tyson's Punch-Out. You might think the game's fast pace would upset its balance, but FaceBreaker turns this expected folly into one of its strengths. While hammering on the controller to launch a flurry of punches at your opponent is enjoyable, the fight is all about timing. As fast as your fists of fury may be, if you're not tactful you'll end up on the mat.My favorite part of the game is its block, dodge, and parry system. Each one has its place depending on the situation or opponent -- particularly dodges and parries. Time them correctly as your opponent punches and you'll get in a couple free shots. FaceBreaker's cast of broad caricatures may make you wince, but it's fun to go round-for-round with them exchanging punches and, more importantly, timing blocks, dodges, and parries effectively to turn the fight in your favor or avoid a beating. Each boxer responds with his or her own counterattack, and many aren't beatable unless you learn to use defensive tactics for offensive payoff.FaceBreaker features a number of special combo attacks particular to its characters that provide a fun flourish, but none are as deadly as the move the game is named after. Players earn these game-ending punches by building up the multi-tiered combo meter without being interrupted. As dangerous as this sounds, it was pretty rare to earn or be the victim of one. This only highlights how important it is to play defense and stick to your attack strategies. Combos are merciless if you don't know what you're doing, but it's also rewarding when you discover an opponent's weakness.As fun as FaceBreaker can be, it falls prey to a scourge of many new EA titles -- this first title in the franchise is shorn of exciting features. The game's bare-bones structure presumes that you'll take each boxer through the same gauntlet of fights over and over again. Even with the solid gameplay, it doesn't take long before the unadorned nature of the career mode makes you feel brain dead, like you've taken a few too many punches to the noggin. Regardless, I think this game is worth strapping on the gloves.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "7.75"}
