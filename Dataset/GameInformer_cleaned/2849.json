Rolling grass for sixhundred meters, high tree line perches on the perimeter, moonlightglare turning helmets into fireflies  this is a snipers huntingtrail, and I just ordered my men into the heart of it. But theres nopoint in being hard on myself. I had no choice. Our birds were on theirway. The only way to provide cover was to cross the valley and take outthe SAMs. We almost made it. We could have made it. Even with deathlooming from every direction, I suppressed the snipers long enough formy squad to sprint into cover. Sure, my efforts rewarded me with abullet to the chest, but the blow shouldnt have been fatal. From theblackened tree canopy, my boys flanked the snipers to open a clear pathfor our medic to patch me up. But he never arrived. He didnt take abullet of his own, and he didnt freeze up from panic. As I lay therebleeding out, I could see he was stuck on a boulder, running aimlesslyin place, unaware that his current path was taking him nowhere. Itwasnt a bullet that killed me. It was a *** bug. Such is lifein Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising. When this game is working theway it should, the intensity is nearly unbearable. You can feel yourcharacters heart racing through the controllers vibration, and if youcatch the glimpse of a tracer bullet going overhead, you thank themakers that you are given a second to drop into the prone position.From 300 to 400 meters, enemies are cunning strategists, spreading outinto different formations and flanking at opportune times. Counteringassaults with tactics of your own is easily handled through a slickmenu system. Again, when the functionality is working, thesimulation-like battles are enthralling tests of skill unlike anyyouve seen on console.The entire campaign (which spans 11lengthy missions) can be played cooperatively by a group of four. Thisis the ideal way to play Flashpoint. Yes, it is an empoweringexperience to tell your AI squad to assault a building or to cease firefor a stealth operation, but you never know what you are going to getfrom them. They may malfunction, read a situation wrong to the point itmakes them seem suicidal, or worse yet, ignore everything you say.Human teammates reduce the frustration and make the game all the moreenjoyable.But playing this way doesnt fix the game completely.My team lost the ability to use health packs, would respawn withinvisible weapons, and would finish levels only to find out we failedan objective along the way but were never told. While enemies areintelligent from a distance, you can see their AI buckling inclose-quarters skirmishes. Sometimes theyll just stand there likemannequins taking bullet after bullet.The realistic scale isinstrumental in opening the doors for strategies, but to a fault. Mostlevels are bogged down with vast amounts of walking. Vast as in most ofyour time in specific levels is dedicated to the trek leading up to thefights. Vehicles are a rarity, and even if one can be found, theslippery controls often spell suicide for your team. Running 1.5 km toan evacuation point with no conflict along the way is not a fun way tospend an afternoon.Nor are the competitive modes, Annihilationand Infiltration. Spawn points are too far removed from the action, andonly having eight human-controlled players on these vast maps doesntmake for exciting engagements. Throwing idiotic computer-controlledsoldiers into the mix and refusing players a choice of weapons beforerounds doesnt help either.Basically, only play this game ifyour friends are willing to run at your side. When the game isfunctioning as intended, it can be brilliant. But dont let your guarddown. Problems will arise, and your most difficult challenge may becombating a bout of boredom.", "date": "Oct 14, 2009", "grade": "7"}
