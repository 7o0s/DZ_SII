The clever episodic structure puts a twist on the classic ''young hero saves the world'' formula, and the game adopts several advances from later DQ titles to minimize hassle. However, Dragon Quest IV is about as traditional as an RPG can get. It isn't deep or complicated, and it relies heavily on grinding. When you need another level or better equipment, your main quest must often be put on hold in favor of wandering around and killing monsters in random encounters. If that doesn't scare you off, DQ IV's gameplay, storytelling, and artwork are rewarding  but rarely surprising.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
