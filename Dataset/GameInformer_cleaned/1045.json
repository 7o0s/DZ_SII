While the firstfew hours of every game are filled with exciting opportunity, theresource-heavy maintenance of your character and deadly threats inhabiting theworld make Don't Starve a long, slow grind to nowhere.Don't Starve makes a great first impression. You getvirtually no story setup  survival is the name of the game. The cartoony artstyle makes exploring your massive, randomized world a joy, and happening uponnew animals like the mighty beefalo and creepy tallbirds provides a steadystream of surprises. The beginning is relatively carefree; because you haven'tinvested any time in the world, you don't have anything to lose from diving in andpoking around.Things gradually become more serious as certainrealities set in. Survival requires constant resource gathering, as you collectfood, build tools, and slowly cobble together the semblance of a camp out ofthe items you can create from the extensive crafting system. The gameplay isdifficult but rewarding, and offers a variety of avenues to explore for stavingoff death.Unfortunately, it feels like Klei spent more timedreaming up ways to make the game hard than ways to make it fun. Just findingthe resources to create basic tools can be a challenge depending on the randomlayout of your continent, and heading down the crafting chains required for valuableitems conflicts with the day-to-day grind for survival. At night, you huddlearound a campfire hoping the myriad dangerous creatures in the world don't findyou. Daytime isn't much better, as most animals can kill you in a few hits ifyou're not wearing armor. A large part of your day is spent gathering theresources needed to keep your hunger, health, and sanity in check, and ensuringyou have enough fuel for when nighttime rolls around again.I'm a fan of permadeath in games, but Don't Starvepushes my appreciation for the concept beyond its limits. XCOM alleviates thesting of losing beloved soldiers because their deaths are part of a larger,persistent war. Games like Spelunky and The Binding of Isaac are designed to beshort experiences  dying is easier to swallow when a game only lasts a fewminutes. Don't Starve fits neither template; most of my games lasted hoursbefore coming to grim ends that I had little control over. Just when I hadbuilt myself a few farm plots for growing food, a birdcage for holding andproducing seeds, and a crockpot for cooking better food in one game, I wasmercilessly slaughtered by a roaming pack of hounds. While harvesting wood tobuild some makeshift walls in another game, a monstrous treeguard came to lifeand exacted revenge for me chopping down his coniferous brethren.Once you're dead, the world is lost forever, alongwith everything you created in it. A few one-time use methods exist toresurrect your character, but enabling them takes as much effort as every otherdemand vying for your attention. It also leaves your reanimated body in an evenmore perilous situation, as you respawn without any items or equipment. Don't Starve's saving grace is that it allows you tocustomize your world before starting. After being slaughtered by a pack ofhounds in one game, I immediately turned down their frequency for the nextmatch. Boosting objects like trees, rocks, and berry bushes makes it easier tosurvive and speeds up the crafting significantly.Tweaking the world's variables made my subsequentplaythroughs easier and more entertaining, but even when death was less of animmediate (yet still omnipresent) threat, I found myself wondering what it wasall for. Minecraft is popular because it allows you to build virtually whateveryou can imagine. Don't Starve has no such creative options. Your goal is simplyto survive for as long as possible. Adventure mode (accessed by a door in hiddensomewhere on your island) simply tasks you with surviving and piecing togetherteleporters in six increasingly difficult worlds, with very little in the wayof a narrative or payoff. Each game earns you XP that unlocks new characters toplay as in subsequent playthroughs, but the differences between them are minor.All of this means that while there is plenty of content to explore, survivingfor the sake of surviving is the only reason to continue playing.A small group of hardcore gamers will revel in Don'tStarve's punishing difficulty, but without a better sense of overarchingprogression or purpose, there are more entertaining and rewarding gamingexperiences to spend your time on. I'm interested to see what Klei introducesin promised future updates of the game, but even when playing in a world that'scustomized to your liking, the thrill of Don't Starve is fleeting.The EdgeKlei Entertainment has done a terrific job adapting Don't Starve's inventory-heavy interface to the PS4. Players control their character with the left analog stick, while the right analog stick highlights inventory items. Each direction on the digital pad performs a context-sensitive action for the selected item, resulting in a control scheme that makes switching tools and using items a breeze. If you prefer to play your games on consoles, the PS4 version of Don't Starve performs admirably.", "date": "Jan 07, 2014", "grade": "7.5"}
