Characters can end up in wildly differentplaces, geographically and as people, simply by which path they drivedown. As I played it, I got swept up inthis notion. Wheels of Aurelia effectively constructs a unique setting in 1970sItaly, but as often as it imagines a world where its characters are free todrive where they want, it skims over the details. Those omissions jolt me outof Wheels of Aurelias daydream into a far more mundane drive down the sameroads again.This is ostensibly a driving game,but it doesnt play like one. In fact, you dont have to drive at all. The gameuses an isometric perspective to showcase diorama renditions of Italianseasides and towns like Siena and Piombino, and as long as youre not steeringthe car yourself, it jauntily follows a set path. As Lella, a woman with amysterious past, you meet Olga at a dance club, and the next day you beginmaking choices about which city to drive to, who to pick up as you drive, andhow you carry conversations by selecting one of three options (including silence).Through your dialogue choices, youcan decide to be caring or stern, accommodating or belligerent. But thedialogue itself is often awkward and disconnected; characters tend to talk pasteach other instead of having genuine conversations. The timing's often off,too; during one of my playthroughs, I ended up in a police chase. Despite theurgency of the situation, Lella and her passenger had a relatively calmconversation about what they wanted out of life. What you say rarely has animpact on how others respond to you or where you end up, and by my fourthplaythrough (each one only takes about 20 minutes), Id heard pretty much everythingLella and Olga had to say.Awkward as it might be, theconversations touch on a lot of interesting topics, which can often make up forthe lack of fluidity. As you drive across Italy, the other characters discussand make offhand references to events and people from Italian history, and itsin those references (as well as the excellent, original prog-rock soundtrackthat fits in with the games time period) that Wheels of Aurelia most firmlyplants you in its time and place.The characters you meet throughoutWheels of Aurelia talk about the real-life kidnapping of Italian politicianAldo Moro, director Pier Pasolinis insistence on banning television, and theearly progress of Italian feminists like Simone Veil. I paused and Googledthings frequently, but lm glad developer Santa Ragione didnt feel the need tobog down conversations by over-explaining every reference and detail. Evokingthe era without lingering on details is more than enough.Every time you finish the game, youreceive one of 16 endings, followed by a stats screen assigning your ending aletter and showing how many youve unlocked. Depending on where you go and whoyou ride with, Lella can end up in a variety of situations. In one ending, shebecomes an undercover agent. In another, she casts off her worries and adopts amore reserved lifestyle. She can stop terrorists from setting off a bomb, orhelp others set up the Moro kidnapping. All of these endings are communicatedthrough still images and text, which may conceal some of the more vividdetails, but they let the mind wander about what these situations might looklike. Seeing what other lives Lella could lead, more than the stats screen,motivated me to play through the game multiple times.After exhausting most of my optionsfor new endings, playing again to search for a single new detail to get a differentending felt like a chore. But as whole, the paths I took had enough diversitythat I'm still curious about how else the game could turn out, though it isnt enoughto motivate me to keep playing.Wheels of Aurelia is bestwhen its immersing you in the culture it came from, and when it offers you ascope of choice that seems as boundless as the roads you drive on. While itsucceeds at that more often than not, the unexciting driving, the stilted andill-fitting conversations, and the few paths it forces you to take end uptaking me out of its fascination with roads not taken.", "date": "Oct 05, 2016", "grade": "7"}
