The lack ofany playlist functionality made it impossible to set up routines, soplayers found themselves taking breaks every two to three minutes toslog through yet another set of menus.Nintendo clearly tookthose criticisms to heart, adding both canned and customizable routinesto Wii Fit Plus, a pseudo-sequel that has the feel (and price point)more along the lines of a software update than a substantial newrelease. Thats not to say that its missing anything. Everything fromWii Fit is in Wii Fit Plus, along with a whole lot more.Some ofthe additions are silly, like adding the ability to weigh babies orpets. Others, like a new food journal and the aforementioned routines,make strides toward helping users create new habits and stick withthem. I enjoyed the new games, particularly the skateboarding activity.The balance board makes a great skateboard substitute, and glidingaround an arena, grinding rails, hopping over obstacles, and skating upramps is a lot of fun.Ultimately, Wii Fit Plus is basically thesame game, slightly expanded. If you liked the first game for a whilebut lost interest, its hard to say that this one will keep you comingback. If your idea of fitness centers more on losing weight thanlowering an imaginary fitness age, there are other titles out thereto help you meet those goals without making you flap madly like achicken.", "date": "Oct 27, 2009", "grade": "8"}
