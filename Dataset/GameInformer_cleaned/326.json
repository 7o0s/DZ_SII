Instead,the main draw is the entertaining DaVinci Code-style mystery that lies beneath the idyllic and carefree veneer.Pony Island is presented to players as an Atari-era arcadegame, but unsettling anomalies soon hint at a deeper (and stranger) experience.Before you even hop over your first gate as a miniature equine, you must delveinto virtual menus and start fiddling with the settings, which react insurprising ways; options shatter when you click on them, and warbling binary portalstake you into the game's programming. Meta-game interactions and fourth-wall-breakingmoments abound as you explore the underlying operating system and exchangemessages with shadowy figures. Rarely do you spend more than a few minutes onan action level or puzzle before the rules are changed up, and developer DanielMullins has buried a trail of enticing breadcrumbs that slowly reveal who you are andwhy you're stuck playing the game.This variety is a good thing, because Pony Island's gameplayis as rudimentary as its visuals. The side-scrolling levels require you to hopover a series of gates while repelling enemies (and sometimes Jesus) with yourmouth laser. While the controls are simple, a single mistake sends you back tothe beginning of the level, and the ever-increasing intensity of the actionsequences makes them more frustrating than fun. The puzzle levels offer a welcome(but not particularly engaging) respite. They require you to ~hack~ the game'scode by arranging the right combination of arrows in the corresponding slots,but rarely do they require any real thought to solve.The real magic of Pony Island happens between the levels. Atone point, the game crashes and leaves you to snoop your way through thedesktop files of the creator (who may or may not be Satan). At other timesyou're able to circumvent the creator's wishes, allowing you to skipunnecessary grinding or explore areas that aren't fully complete. Everything ishandled with a tongue-in-cheek humor, but it doesn't diminish the underlyingintrigue. Pony Island also throws some surprising tricks at you  one inparticular caught me off guard and had me laughing out loud.Pony Island isn't particularly long. You can see everythingthere is to see in a couple of hours, and you'll likely need to browse theSteam forums to do so, as some of the secrets are too obtuse to solve withoutthe collective mind trust of the Internet. Nevertheless, Pony Island is anexperimental and novel experience with some memorable surprises.", "date": "Jan 29, 2016", "grade": "7.5"}
