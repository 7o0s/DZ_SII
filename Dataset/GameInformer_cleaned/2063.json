The 2005 titles perfect pacing and spot-on gunplay not only reinvigorated the struggling survival horror series, it set a new standard for third-person shooters. Leon S. Kennedys quest to rescue the Presidents daughter from a cult of infected freaks has cemented itself on countless top 20 lists. Whether you overlooked this gem or are itching to stomp out the Las Plagas once again, Resident Evil 4 in HD is a beautiful thing.Not much has changed gameplay-wise between Resident Evil 4 and 5, so core fans wont have much trouble returning to the creepy Spanish village. Leons tank-like movements arent the most intuitive, but pegging foes in the legs and taking potshots at their vulnerable heads is still a rewarding process. The variety of firearms isnt overwhelming, but each has unique characteristics and are still fun to upgrade. I was shocked by how much I still enjoy Resident Evil 4s puzzle-like inventory system. You get to know your gear pretty well when you have to shove it all in a single attach case.The thrill of Resident Evil 4s gonzo moments lives on in full force thanks to updated visuals. Conquering a mutated sea creature on a tiny wooden boat still gets the blood pumping, especially without the fuzzy haze of last-gen graphics. Its still terrifying to flee from frenzied mobs only to be greeted head-on (or should I say head-off?) by a chainsaw-wielding maniac. Though the textures and character models are much sharper than previous versions, some may find the lack of detail and muted colors dull.The updated visuals arent mind-blowing, but they present the best way to return to this already stellar game. If you somehow missed out on Resident Evil 4 when it turned heads on the GameCube, this is the perfect time to give it a download and see what all the fuss is about.", "date": "Sep 20, 2011", "grade": "9.5"}
