Instead of just bundling thetwo classic puzzle series with a handful of separate modes, Puyo Puyo Tetristries to blend the multicolored brick and blob action in new and differentways. Unfortunately, this peanut-butter-in-my-chocolate experimentation ends upbeing the least compelling part of the game, making the package as a wholeunderwhelming.If you're just looking for the opportunity to play two of your favoritepuzzle games on your new Nintendo Switch, you can stop reading this review andgo pick up Puyo Puyo Tetris right now. While I have a few qualms on the Tetrisside of things (more on that later), the colorful visuals and responsivecontrols deliver all the classic line-clearing, blob-matching action you couldwant. However, most Tetris and Puyo Puyo installments also offer up some newand clever twists on their decades-old puzzle formulas, and that's where thisattemptstumbles.Sonic Team tries to merge the two playstyles into an entertaininghybrid, but puyos and tetrominoes simply don't play well together. Tetris is afrenetic race to build up your bricks and throw garbage lines at your opponentas fast as possible. Puyo Puyo is a slower and more deliberate affair; in orderto bury your foe, you need to lay down intricate, interlocking piles of coloredblobs that trigger huge chain reactions.Sonic Team never truly bridges this disparity, so modes that treat thetwo game types interchangeably, like vanilla Versus mode and the power-upinfused Party mode, are less fun if one player chooses Puyo Puyo and the otherchooses Tetris. Swap, on the other hand, uses the disparities to its advantage,by having players flip between ongoing Tetris and Puyo Puyo matches at timedintervals. The change of pace works well here and feels novel, making Swap mynew favorite mode of the bunch. Big Bang is more of a mixed bag, tasking youand your opponent with racing through a series of single-screen puzzles. Whilethe Puyo Puyo side of this mode is challenging enough, the Tetris puzzles arefar too simple to keep you coming back after your first fewmatches.Puyo Puyo Tetris' biggest stumble is its flagship Fusion mode. Playersmust contend with stacks of puyos and tetrominoes at the same time. However,tetrominoes ~sink~ to the bottom of your well, causing the puyos beneath themto pop and respawn at the top of the screen. This makes planning out combosvirtually impossible, as your layers are constantly shifting. Fusion matchesoffer some chaotic fun, but largely forsake the skills and strategies the twogame types are built on, making it my least favorite of themodes.Puyo Puyo Tetris also has a lengthy story mode, but even going into itwith subterranean expectations, I was struck by what a waste of time it is. The~story~ is just an endless string of cameos of characters from previous PuyoPuyo games, who find the flimsiest of excuses to battle all-new Tetrischaracters. The dialogue is rarely funny, the characters are bland animeclichs (save for a few fun animals), and the story ends with the mother of allshouldershrugs.As such, Puyo Puyo Tetris comes down to its modes, which aren't asplentiful or unique as those found in other installments of the two series.Hardcore Tetris fans may also be disappointed by the lack of options; as withmany modern Tetris incarnations, the game offers no ability to turn off easyspin, and the drop speed maxes out at 15G. I'm far from a Tetris Grand Master,but even when making a ton of embarrassing mistakes, I was able to play endlessmode...endlessly. If you're looking for a Tetris game that pushes your abilitiesto the next level, keep onlooking.Ultimately, Puyo Puyo Tetris still includes the ability to play classicTetris or Puyo Puyo to your heart's content, and that core gameplay remains asfun and absorbing as ever. While that's probably enough for most fans tojustify the purchase, I wish the new flavors were more appetizing.", "date": "Apr 24, 2017", "grade": "7"}
