Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc hinged onthis terrifying question, locking students in a school and progressively givingthem more reasons to kill. The sequel, Goodbye Despair, continues exploringthis worst-nightmare scenario, but it makes the journey exciting and unexpectedthanks to a new locale and cast.As a visual novel, most of thegameplay involves reading dialogue between characters. You investigate crimescenes and find clues to present during trials. These elements are still intactfrom the original, but Goodbye Despair ditches Hope's Peak Academy and takes agroup of talented students to a tropical island for a fun field trip. Theisland holds the promise of relaxation so the students can get to know eachother better, but the bloodthirsty bear Monokuma shows up and brings back historturous game. The group is now imprisoned on the island with only one wayout: murder a fellow student and get away with it.The change in scenery offers richareas for exploration. You visit five different islands, including one that isa theme park, and another that is an abandoned city. The locales are morememorable than the first game, but the characters aren't. The students are morearchetypical, like the meek nurse who doesn't want to upset anyone. The plot does support some standouts though, like some characters who are more than meets the eye. The writing also still does a great job at exploring people's mental states and casting doubt ontheir claims, and that's where the real lure still is. Are you potentiallybefriending a murderer or the next victim?The plot is far from perfect,though, and pacing is the biggest issue. The story doesn't pick up until theend of the third case - halfway through the adventure. The first few casesaren't awful, but they're just not particularly surprising or emotional. Oncethe plot takes off, however, it trumps the first game. I was glued to my Vita, losingsleep to see the next reveal. Endings aren't easy to pull off, but GoodbyeDespair nails its finale, making it just as fascinating as it is satisfying.Still, I wouldn't play Goodbye Despair without playing Trigger Happy Havocfirst, as the ending won't be nearly as rewarding or comprehensible.The gameplay has some tweaks tothe original formula. New mechanics add some new life to the courtroom; insteadof merely pointing out contradictions as classmates spew their theories, youcan now reinforce points when you agree. The solutions to some of the puzzlesare more obtuse this time around, forcing me to rely on trial-and-error - somethingI rarely did in Trigger Happy Havoc.One new addition is absolutelyhorrible: Logic Dive - a snowboarding video game where you dodge obstacles whileanswering questions. Nothing is more frustrating than knowing the answer to aquestion, but having to complete a jump sequence to advance. This is compoundedby the fact that Logic Dive has awful checkpoints. Who wants to put up withannoying platforming when you're about to unmask a killer?If you enjoyed thefirst entry, you absolutely owe it to yourself to play Goodbye Despair. If you weren't enamored with it, you won't find anything here to change your mind.Nonetheless, you still won't find a series out there that messes with your headlike Danganronpa. It sticks with you long after you've watched the credits roll.", "date": "Aug 29, 2014", "grade": "8"}
