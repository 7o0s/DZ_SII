This year developer EA Tiburon is trying to address some of that  which doesnt sound like an exciting focus for the new title, but the beauty of the changes taking place is that they benefit players of all stripes.Ive always been a fan of Tigers old single-player career progression: Completing challenges, drills, and tourneys gave you stat boosts in specific areas depending on how well you did. I liked it because it felt like there was a lot of content, and I knew where to go if I needed to get more distance on my tee shots, for instance. Now, the handcuffs are off. Everything you do in Tiger 11 gives you XP points that you can spend however you want  including on the normal selection of stat-boosting clothes. Using this open-ended points system, you could conceivably concentrate every XP point you have and channel it into your Power attribute right away, and you wouldnt have to grind to quite the same degree as before to do it. Although last years drills are gone, with the inclusion of the Ryder Cup and the return of the standard pro-based skill challenges, its not like there isnt enough to do. If anything, you can get on to playing PGA events a little sooner, which is nice.The game also introduces some slight unpredictability in your shots via real-time wind that can rise up or die during your shot, and more variance regarding where your ball lands and how you come out of the rough. I know no golfer or gamer likes to hear about unpredictability, but if you knew of a way to get your ball to land in the exact same place every time  which is what some Tiger experts have been able to do in the past  it wouldnt be golf. I certainly dont put myself in the expert category, but I didnt notice a huge drop-off in my game from last year, so Im not complaining about the new changes. If anything, its another element that makes the game slightly more realistic while still being fun.Similarly, the True-Aim camera system  which only lets you see what your golfer would see (i.e. no circles showing you where the ball may land, etc.)  makes things more difficult, but I didnt get into it that much simply because unlike the Wii version (see our review on page 95) where the camera actually tracks your head looking down at the ball before you hit it, True-Aim isnt that fun to look at. I was also wishy-washy on the Focus meter. It gives you a pool of points to spend on spinning your ball, accuracy and power boost, and Putt Previews. You recharge your meter as you play, so you wont run out of it unless you rely on it all the time, but as a concept it seems a little strange. I can understand how it makes you pick and choose when to use it, but as a golfer, arent I always trying to focus and hit the ball perfectly?I think a lot of players wont notice too many of this years more subtle new additions, but will instead help themselves to the 24-player online (where you can construct your own Ryder Cup-like competitions), GamerNet challenges, online tournaments, and five new courses. Thats fine, but the smaller improvements made to this years game offer players more freedom and customizability. Hopefully theyll stick around and be a part of the franchises future.", "date": "Jun 08, 2010", "grade": "8.75"}
