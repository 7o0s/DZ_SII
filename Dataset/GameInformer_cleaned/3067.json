Each title has updated graphics to fit high-definition and wide screen televisions. While some of the games don't hold up as well as you might hope, this is your best chance to dive back into everything from Ecco the Dolphin to Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine. The lack of online play is a shame, but the list of titles included here is a true all-star lineup from the Genesis era.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "8"}
