Ubisoft sets the stage well, presenting a lush, foreign planet amidst an interspecies war, where the player must decide which side to fight for, and ultimately, which side will win. After playing through the game as both the humans and the blue-skinned navi, I can honestly say that choice hasnt been overstated; with different gameplay mechanics, storyline twists, and environments to explore based on your affiliation, Avatar is essentially two games in one. The only problem? Neither of them is very good. In the first few missions you play as Ryder, an unremarkable human working for the Resource Development Agency on the planet of Pandora. These first simple tasks introduce the basic weapons and abilities of the human character, while the missions that follow show off your Avatar, one of the navi aliens you control via good old sci-fi hocus pocus. The Avatar sections provide the games greatest moments; not only do you get to see the wide range of differences between the characters (weapons, armor, vehicles, and skills all differ), but you are also introduced to Pandoras large and wildly creative environments. The levels are the games best selling point, and you dont need a 3D display to appreciate their splendor. Just when you are beginning to enjoy your new home, however, you are ushered into deciding between the two factions. From here, the games weaknesses begin to surface.In my first playthrough I sided with the navi. Their size and nature-based powers (including the ability to summon fauna to attack enemies) make them feel powerful, but their tribal society is no match for the RDA. How well do you think armor made out of animal hides and blades made from bones stack up against bullets and missiles? Not well, and the game doesnt avert this reality for the sake of fun, either. The navi use melee weapons even though their gun-toting enemies are always out of range, resulting in cheap deaths made all the more insulting by the brain-dead AI.Playing as the RDA is a little more exciting  you have a wide variety of guns at your disposal, and ammo is plentiful. The vehicles are also varied and more fun than the navi alternative  animals that scream as they get mowed down by your enemys heavy artillery. Despite a few entertaining moments that come from blasting apart the jungle Predator-style, the human faction doesnt offer gamers anything they havent seen before, either.Avatars biggest problems lie with the narrative. The moral choices are more black and white than the developers would like to think, and while seeing the story from both sides is interesting, the missions are so mind-numbingly bland you wont want to play through a second time. Avatar boils down to an unending string of pointless fetch quests, with NPCs barking more insults than explanations as to why youre collecting/killing something for the umpteenth time. The infuriatingly bad endings are the icing on the cake. Play as a navi, and your final mission requires walking into a glowing circle and pressing a button to watch the non-interactive end scene. Play as the RDA, and youll suffer a cheap boss battle followed by a nonsensical explanation of your actions that renders them pointless  and not in a Full Metal Jacket, pointlessness-is-the-point sort of way. Its just plain broken.These shortcomings are a shame considering the games interesting gameplay twists. Avatar features a solid RPG element that unlocks new armor and upgraded weapons at a steady pace. Players also unlock new skills (i.e. buffs) that help spice up combat a little, but cant overcome the gameplay imbalances. A standard set of multiplayer options are also included, plus a turn-based strategy meta-game that awards permanent boosts to your character in the main campaign. These innovations offer much-needed depth and enjoyment, and point to interesting avenues for future genre mash-ups.In the end however, these extra layers cant fix the subpar combat and disappointing storyline at the games core, leaving Avatar a lackluster, though not entirely unpleasant, experience. While forgiving sci-fi fans might still appreciate this intergalactic romp, the average gamer is left with an easy choice: this game is a rental at best.", "date": "Dec 01, 2009", "grade": "6.5"}
