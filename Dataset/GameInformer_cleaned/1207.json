After playing through its sequel, I have an even greater appreciation for the artistry that Ubisoft has brought to 2D platforming.In an era in which game heroes carry virtual steamer trunks loaded with gear and power-ups, Rayman offers an elegant alternative. What you see is what you get. Aside from a rare boxing-glove upgrade, the characters moves are the same from beginning to end. Their arsenal of jumps, glides, and melee attacks didnt leave me wanting more gimmickry, but instead made me feel all the more attuned to their precision and subtlety. Like Super Meat Boy, you learn exactly what characters are capable of, and how they can most efficiently maneuver around their worlds  a must, since the later levels are hard as nails.Instead of simply treading water, Rayman Legends tackles new environmental themes and unexpected gameplay twists  including a stealth-based section and a level that plays a lot like a Metroid-style world. You wont see yet another ice level or desert zone; instead, you explore spy-themed underwater lairs, bizarre nightmares, and other imaginative venues. The games new lighting engine adds another layer of visual flair to what was already a beautiful series. Ubisoft has even included remastered versions of levels from Origins that feature graphical updates and design tweaks.Several auto-scrolling sections incorporate the games stellar soundtrack, including a mariachi-inspired version of Survivors Eye of the Tiger. Players jumps and attacks are timed to fit the music, and it plays like equal parts platformer and rhythm game. I only wish there were more of these  theyre incredibly fun to play.As much as I love Legends, its certainly not a perfect game. Legends sticks with its predecessor in one unfortunate way, which is an overreliance on collecting items. You either squeak through levels perfectly the first time or have to revisit them later if you want to see everything the game has to offer. Im all for gating off high-end rewards for that kind of dedication, but it was annoying to have to replay levels to free 9 or 10 of my hidden friends so that I could unlock the next set.Fortunately, diversionary activities in the game make it feel like less of a grind. As you progress, you unlock tweaked versions of completed levels, which offer high-pressure, time-based challenges. Theres also a silly soccer minigame, as well as a variety of ranked online challenges that will be updated weekly.All told, Rayman Legends provides top-notch gameplay with an expansive package of additional content. Im glad to see the possibility of Rayman and his friends popping up at more regular intervals. If Ubisoft can maintain the series current level of quality, by all means, keep em coming. I know Ill eagerly play each one.The Edge Rayman Legends was originally conceived as a Wii U game, and it shows in many ways. Murfy can be controlled on the GamePads touchscreen, which lets players help friends by tickling enemies, making collectibles more valuable, and manipulating obstacles. That basic functionality remains on the Xbox 360 version, though Murfy is controlled by AI and players trigger his abilities with the press of a button. Its functional, but not as satisfying. When playing solo, however, some sections on Wii U require players to control Murfy while the AI bumbles its way through levels. Its easy to miss out on collectibles or lose lives through no real fault of your own. Playing solo isnt the best way to experience the game, but without online multiplayer, it might be hard for some folks to round up a group for couch co-op.
