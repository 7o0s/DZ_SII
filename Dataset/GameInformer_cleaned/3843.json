MonsterHunter Stories combines those monsters and biomes with turn-based combat and amonster recruitment system to deliver an interesting spin on the series formula.Without the focus on real-time action, Monster Hunter Storiesinstead taps into a Pokmon-esque desire to catch, train, and geneticallysplice perfect monster companions. Discovering new monsters and customizing themvia options that get progressively more advanced as you work through the game(like taking one monsters abilities and putting them in another) is enjoyable.Collecting them is also fun, as you discover standard and rare egg nests  sortof randomized mini-dungeons where your goal is to sneak off with a powerful eggyou can hatch later. As a fan of the franchise, seeking out my favoritemonsters like the terrifying, strange Khezu and enhancing them was a treat.Hunting down eggs and finding out whats inside, assembling your perfectmonster squad, and dialing down deeper to create ultimate allies forms asatisfying loop. The overworld is neat to explore and nothing like theself-contained island-find boss-exit style of the core series and constantlyrefreshing itself with crafting materials, egg dens, and monsters to battle.[View:4168896819001:610:0]While the game is incredibly accessible due to the rock-paper-scissorsturn-based combat system, its a double-edged sword. The simple combat systemis mastered quickly, and although weapon abilities, monster special skills, andcombos attempt to make things more interesting, combat quickly falls off interms of enjoyment and becomes a rote, repetitive task. If youre looking for achallenge, you wont find it here. Your sidekick monsters act on autopilot, butcan learn many useful abilities and skills, and you can ride them during combatto execute special abilities.You hotswap between monster companions in combat to find theright skills you need for the job, and they also have out-of-combat abilitiesto help you break boulders, traverse water, or find items in the overworld. Youcan even go for break offs by targeting specific monster locations during afight like the head, which may weaken it as well as dropping a valuable pieceof loot nods to the core franchise like these are interesting to see inturn-based translation.Dont expect anything resembling an engaging story despitethe games name. I expect the dialogue will appeal to a younger audience, butit didn't resonate with me. Thankfully, the gameplay is the main allure.While Monster Hunter Stories doesnt have nearly the amountof weapon and armor choices that appear in the main entries, you can outfityourself to an offensive or defensive playstyle and upgrade your gear withmonster parts. After youve mastered your skills, you can take on other playersonline with your ultimate team of monsters, which is perfect for players thatwant to really dig in to the endgame experience, as the title doesnt reallyoffer the hundreds of hours associated with one of the mainline games.Series fans might be put off by Monster Hunter Storiessimplified combat, but I enjoyed the opportunity to pilot some of my favorite creaturesfrom the franchise on the other side of the blade. Fans of turn-based JRPGfare, newcomers to the franchise, and younger gamers have more to enjoy here  toexplore and engage with the Monster Hunter universe without having to enter througha less accessible door. Monster Hunter Stories is a warm and welcoming trekthats only brought down by stale and repetitive combat. Despite itsshortcomings, theres still a neat egg to crack here.", "date": "Sep 07, 2017", "grade": "8"}
