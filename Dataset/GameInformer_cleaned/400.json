It felt fresh and it tackled issues we're not used toseeing in games, such as bullying, death, and suicidal thoughts. But throughoutthe project, I've been frustrated with how these portrayals have been handled justas much as I've been rooting it on. I'm glad to say the finale left me cheeringand brought the narrative together in a satisfying way. It captured somethingraw and authentic about the human condition that so many games fail to create. Episode 5 begins right where the previous game left off.Maxine and Chloe have finally discovered the true culprit behind formerclassmate Rachel's disappearance, and the truth is even more horrifying thanexpected. From here on out, we see Maxine struggle to manipulate hertime-traveling powers to make things ~right.~ Dontnod gives you a glimpse intoher subconscious and raises some great questions about life in general. Isthere really a perfect solution to anything? Are you robbing people of livinglife by making things pan out in a certain way? I like how it puts this greatpower in your hands, but then makes you second-guess how you've used it. Up until this point, players have used their powersdifferently. Dontnod does an outstanding job of still telling its own story,while making choices mean something to the narrative. Certain characters willshow up in scenes based on your choices, and additional options are alsoavailable at certain moments. It stays true to how you've played the game; however, it's not perfect. Sometimes characters and romances are shoehorned injust to be another choice. For example, Warren, Maxine's best guy friend who'scrushing on her, comes off more creepy than endearing. He ultimately addsnothing of value to the plot.The narrative comes down to the friendship between Maxineand Chloe. Scenes that focus on their bond have always been my favorite momentsin the game, and it's the heart of this episode. We all have that friend who wemight not see for a while, but then we see them again and it's just like oldtimes. Dontnod shows the strong bond of these two in such a genuine way,proving time and time again just how much both of these girls care about eachother. The most interesting parts of the finale aren't so much the conclusionsto the big mysteries, but how Maxine and Chloe's friendship is affected by thechaos around them. This can either bring people together or tear them apart.Dontnod makes this relationship intriguing beyond just that conflict though,and also explores how far we'll go for the people we love. The result istouching and easy to relate to. Themes of growing up, letting go, andcherishing memories all come through nicely. For all that I loved about Episode 5's writing, the gameplaydoesn't shine as brightly. Plenty of sequences feel like dead weight, with anannoying stealth section taking the cake. This section feels tacked on to padout the finale instead of being worthwhile content. You're in a dark room withflashlights all around that you must avoid, but it gets hard to keep track ofthe multiple streams of light. Another section has you going through tons ofidentical doors and halls listening to voiceovers before you advance. Thesewere my least favorite parts of the experience, especially since they both goon too long. At these points, you just want answers and Dontnod seems toprolong it as much as possible with unnecessary mind games. Even so, Life is Strange remains one of the moremoving experiences I've had in a virtual world. Video games are growing as amedium, and Life is Strange is proof that mature stories can be deeplyaffecting in this format. Despite all its supernatural elements, Life isStrange is relatable, and that's what gives its ending the biggest punch. Itmakes you reexamine everything you've done up until that point. Sure, theproject has had its share of missteps, but it's also been full of powerfulmoments that surpass your average experience with a video game.", "date": "Oct 21, 2015", "grade": "8"}
