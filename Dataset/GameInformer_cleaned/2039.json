Dark Souls, the spiritual successor to Demons Souls, still has all of these features, but developer From Software has latched on to the idea of difficulty and honed it to an art form. Dark Souls is without a doubt the hardest game I have ever played; that is its blessing, and that is its curse.Some frustration in Dark Souls arises from how this generations games have conditioned us. Gamers are used to handholding tutorials that walk you through every aspect of a games mechanics. Dark Souls doesnt waste time explaining things. You encounter the first boss within 10 minutes of starting the game. Hes huge. He wields a giant club that can take away half of your health bar or more in a single swing  and this isnt one of those battles youre supposed to lose. After a quick detour, youre fully expected to defeat this monster as one of your first acts in this deadly world.Taking the death and destruction onlineDemons Souls had a unique online system where you could invite other players, in the form of Blue Phantoms, to help you, but you also had to watch out for invasions from players in the form of Black Phantoms. These multiplayer options have carried over to Dark Souls, but the game also introduces some strange new systems.Throughout the game, players will encounter NPCs that allow them to join different covenants. Choosing a covenant helps determine who you face off against in PvP. Covenants also open up the possibility of affecting someone elses game without directly warping into it, such as dropping an item that summons monsters into other players games.Multiplayer access was limited during my time with the review build, so I wasnt able to see the full implementation of covenants. Like the Blue and Black Phantoms, this system seems like it will set Dark Souls apart from the competition and give it a singular feeling that will make it entertaining for months to come.Strange new concepts such as humanity (a resource that allows you to revert from undead form back to human) and kindling (an act that gets you more health flasks at your current checkpoint) could use more explanation, but this is the kind of stuff that the Dark Souls community will love toying with and figuring out over the next few months.The overall lack of direction the game gives you is harder to forgive. The world laid out in Dark Souls is absolutely massive but, beyond cryptic hints from a handful of scattered NPCs, youre not told where to go. Exploration is a key part of the game but, with a world this huge, youre bound to hit multiple points where you feel like youve explored everything open to you and dont know where to go next. Sometimes the correct path ahead is unnecessarily obscure, requiring you to drop down a cliff or walk across a narrow ledge that doesnt look passable. Without the help of a guide or consulting Internet forums, its likely that youll spend hours searching through old areas before you discover that the way forward was hidden in plain sight.Once you figure out where youre going, though, Dark Souls can be stunning, rewarding experience. I spent a full day playing through the death-trap-filled Sens Fortress level over and over again, but it wasnt frustrating at all. With each attempt, I discovered a new secret or devised a strategy that would afford me another scrap of progress. By the end of the day, I had the whole of this level  easily one of the most devious ever designed  memorized. Now I can practically run through it blindfolded. Its a wonderful feeling showing off this sadistic setting to friends and coworkers and having them marvel at my abilities, which are based entirely in perseverance and smart play rather than twitch skills.But for every few areas that distill what was amazing about Demons Souls down into its purest and most brilliant form, there is one that takes things a step too far. The Tomb of the Giants is a pitch-black catacomb full of giant skeletons that forces you to trade your shield for a lantern if you want to see your hazardous surroundings. The beautiful castles of Anor Londo require balancing across precariously thin walkways while avoiding arrow bolts from multiple angles. The majority of the game is spent in much less frustrating areas, but there are a handful that break the golden rule that made Demons Souls so good: Every death, however painful, was always fair.Despite my complaints, I cant help but feel a rush of adrenaline just thinking about Dark Souls. I spent around 60 hours playing it over the last month and died nearly 100 times while doing so. I screamed, I cursed, and I threw down my controller in defeat more times than Im proud of. I cant wait to get back in and do it all over again. Dark Souls probably wont be the biggest or best game released this year, but Im already sure its the one Im going to spend the most time playing.", "date": "Oct 03, 2011", "grade": "8.75"}
