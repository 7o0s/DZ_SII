Azure StrikerGunvolt harks back to the studio's portable Mega Man Zero and Mega Man Adventgames, but instead of pelting enemies with plasma he zaps them withelectricity. The satisfying action is amplified by an emphasis on keepingcombos going, a risk/reward checkpoint system, and acquiring weapons frombosses.At first glance, Gunvolt is all about blasting enemies andavoiding traditional platforming hazards like spikes and bottomless pits. Aninventive electrocution gameplay mechanic adds a little bit more to theformula. Gunvolt fires small nodes at his foes, then channels rechargeableelectricity into enemies to deal damage. Damage can be focused into a singletarget by sticking it with multiple nodes, or spread across several targets todivide and fry. Gunvolt can even float a little while zapping enemies, allowinghim extra mid-air mobility. This inventive combat is easy to understand andeven more satisfying to master.After a brief intro level, you select which of the six mainstages you'd like to play. These courses, filled with missile-firing enemiesand various hazards, are moderately challenging without being remarkable. Thereal treat lies in trying to kill as many enemies in a row to boost yourmultiplier. Activating a checkpoint unlocks a nifty spot to respawn (you haveunlimited lives), but at the cost of your kill streak. Scoring big wins you achance to be resurrected mid-battle and increases your post-level score,earning you materials used to craft items that raise defense or the effectivenessof recovery items. Gunvolt emphasizes performing well rather than enduring sadistic,old-school punishment. It's a fun gameplay hook, but I wasn't enticed to replaylevels in order to achieve higher grades.While there are instances of funny dialogue, the overall story falls flatGunvolt can take a lot of damage by brute-forcing his waythrough regular foes, but that strategy isn't as great during boss battles.These multicolored foes harness powers like blasting out fireballs, summoninginsect hordes, and even cloning themselves. The one-on-one battles are intenseand challenging, requiring careful memorization of attack patterns and quickreflexes. Gunvolt's limited special skills, like regaining health or stabbingenemies with huge electro-swords, help immensely during big battles. Themajority of the bosses are reasonably difficult, but the encounters in the lastfew levels pack a powerful kick in the groin. I appreciated the no-nonsensefinal showdowns, but I found the sudden surge in deaths jarring. Some bossesdrop alternate primary weapons, some of which fire nodes that travel up wallsor pass through enemies. I liked tinkering with the new weapons, but didn'tfind anything more reliable than the rapid-firing gun you begin with.Save for his appearance in Super Smash Bros., Capcom hasbeen ignoring Mega Man for years, but fans have some great options whilewaiting for news on the Blue Bomber. Azure Striker Gunvolt is a worthwhileadventure, even if it's wrapped in a disposable sci-fi story about telekineticadepts. Azure Striker Gunvolt delivers some of the fun you remember from olderMega Man titles while injecting a jolt of new gameplay.", "date": "Sep 05, 2014", "grade": "8"}
