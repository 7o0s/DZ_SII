Enjoying the superior story andatmosphere meant overlooking some bad AI and loose gunplay. Metro: Last Light fixesmost of its predecessor's flaws while also improving upon its strengths,delivering gameplay that lives up to the exceptional storytelling.Themyriad improvements 4A introduces in Last Light transform the series' punishingsurvival experience into an engaging  albeit appropriately grim  adventure. Theheavy toll of life in post-apocalyptic Russia is still readily apparent inevery dreary inhabitant you meet and corpse-ridden tunnel you explore, but theminute-to-minute burdens of replacing mask filters and charging batteries havebeen toned down, allowing players to soak in the atmosphere and narrative withminimal distractions.LastLight continues the story of Artyom's attempt to save the few remaining humancolonies living in Russia's underground metro system. The narrative revolvesaround Artyom's quest to find a surviving Dark One  a supernatural speciescapable of living on Moscow's radioactive surface. The real threat to mankind'ssurvival, however, comes from the various armed factions inhabiting the railwaystations, which are poised for all-out war over the Metro. Artyom's skirmisheswith these local militias comprise the majority of Last Light, providing asatisfying balance between action and stealth.Humanenemies exhibit improved AI as they patrol areas and investigate noises.They're particularly deadly in groups and are quick to call for reinforcements,providing a formidable threat and incentive to remain unseen. Monsters are muchless interesting, as most just charge in and swarm you with cheap meleeattacks. A few scripted combat scenarios and boss battles also fall flat. Whilethese moments are frustrating, they are quickly forgotten once you're over thehurdle and back to the meat of the game.LastLight features tighter controls and improved sound design for its arsenal,which now puts the gunplay on par with most triple-A shooters. However, I wasmore enthralled by the upgraded stealth mechanics. A light meter on your watchindicates your visibility, while dynamic music cues alert you when enemies areactively searching for you. Despite still being a linear affair, most of theunderground environments are designed around light and shadow, a visual featureA4's custom engine excels at. You can stalk and pick off patrolling enemies inthe order and style of your choosing. Sneaking my way through storagefacilities and engine rooms swarming with Red Line soldiers provided a tenseand satisfying game of cat-and-mouse, as I flipped circuit breakers and unscrewedlight bulbs to create extra cover. After dispatching all of the patrollingguards with a combination of throwing knives and silent, distant headshots, Isneaked out of the station undetected. Other stations I blasted through withlittle care for stealth. I evenmanaged to slink my way across a monster-infested bridge without firing asingle shot  a testament to Last Light's accommodation of multiple playstyles. LastLight packs a powerful one-two combination of story and atmosphere. A nicevisual upgrade is accompanied by a little more color and variety in the subway stationcommunities, and a massive amount of exposition and ambient conversations fleshout the world and Artyom's evolving perspective on mankind's post-apocalyptic existence.Character animations can be a little wooden and the voice-acting crew featuresmore than a few bad Russian accents, but in a genre where most titles don't tryhalf this hard to tell a compelling story, Last Light pulled me into its worldand kept me engaged.Thissequel plays more like a shooter than its predecessor, but doesn't sacrificeits intricate narrative or creative vision in the process. Masochistic fans willappreciate the harder difficulties that recreate the grueling experience of theoriginal, but no matter how you approach it, exploring Last Light's absorbing worldis wholly entertaining.", "date": "May 13, 2013", "grade": "8.75"}
