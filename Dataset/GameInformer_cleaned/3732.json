Unfortunately, that arc concluded halfwaythrough the first season, and Telltale struggled to deliver a compelling antagonistthroughout the following four episodes. With season two, Telltale finds a newintimidating villain in the all-powerful Admin. The Admin carries season twothroughout its five-episode run, but those episodes still have uninterestingnarrative detours, arbitrary choices, and stale gameplay.Pickingup shortly after the first season, the new story begins with Jesse running thehappy village of Beacontown. The utopian feel doesn't last long; the Adminattacks the town, and after fending off the assault, Jesse and friends go on amission to find the Admin's weakness and stop him once and for all. I love thatthe story finds an adversary for Jesse who is seemingly more unstoppable thanthe Wither Storm, while also adding a layer of personality the first-seasonbeast lacked. Thecore gameplay has you control Jesse by engaging in conversations between actionsequences, cutscenes, and puzzles. Though this season does a good job ofproviding variety in its gameplay, I feel like I was simply being shepherded tothe next conversation or quick-time event. Thesecond season also contains tedious moments like the first season where thegame dumps you into a small open area and has you talk to people and look atpoints of interest until you trigger the correct element to progress the story.Thankfully, these are less frequent and more concise.Thisseason introduces extra gameplay elements on top of the conversation trees andpuzzle solving. I like the new combat, which adds a new dodge-roll evasivemove, as well as a stamina meter, but I immediately enjoyed the free-buildsequences. These moments task Jesse with designing a structure on athree-dimensional grid. I loved that the custom structure I crafted early onreappeared multiple times throughout the season, but it feels like the story latershoehorned these free-build moments in with little hope for players to get asecond glimpse of their creations. Though I enjoyed these free builds for themost part, the tedium sinks in; I was relieved when the final episode didn'tfeature one.Theoverall story told by season two is entertaining. Seeing Jesse find ways tostand up to the sheer power of the Admin is entertaining. Sure, convenient plottwists abound to help Jesse compete with the Admin, but that doesn't take awayfrom the fun of the tale.Whilethe larger narrative is decent, drawn-out detours along the way sour theexperience. One such detour that provides little payoff is stumbling upon amore primitive village where I need to compete in a menial competition toimpress its locals. In addition, my least favorite episode of the season,Jailhouse Block, takes place almost entirely in a dull prison setting. Even thehighlight of that third episode, which gives you a gut-wrenching choiceregarding which character to leave behind, eventually proves unimportant, asthe character you leave simply goes missing for an episode before returning inthe finale.Theentire series falls under the same problem where it gives you the illusion ofchoice, but not much in way of concrete choices that truly affect how the storyturns out. The note that begins each episode stating that the story caters toyour in-game decisions isn't technically incorrect, but its inability tocompletely follow through on that promise is apparent.With acompelling overarching narrative and more engaging gameplay, Minecraft: StoryMode  Season Two is an improvement over the uneven and inconsistent firstseason. I enjoy the Admin as both a character and a threat to the world, andseeing Jesse face off against him is entertaining. While the story takesunnecessary and uninteresting turns and gives you few choices of consequence. Minecraft:Story Mode  Season Two is a fine continuation for those who wanted more fromJesse and crew.", "date": "Jan 09, 2018", "grade": "6.75"}
