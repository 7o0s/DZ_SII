Without the distraction of forced innovation, From Software has successfully refined the classic formula to pure retro gamingbliss.3D Dot Game Heroes simultaneously looks like everything and nothing youve ever seen. Its unique graphical style expands classic 2D sprites into the third dimension. Every single object in the Kingdom of Dotnia is composed of tiny 3D cubes. The stunning shading and particle effects make the game resemble the masterworks of a video game-obsessed LEGO architect brought to life. Motivated adventurers can flex their own creativity in the accessible hero editor, or choose from dozens of preassembled characters like a shark, ninja, or funky Santa Claus. Putting the time into making a great-looking hero heightens ownership of the brilliant adventure to come.Whichever character you choose, 3D Dot Game Heroes plays like a version of Zelda that aged as well as your fond memories of the series. Ill spare you the details on the story and gameplay, because youve done the dungeon-crawling, puzzle-solving, boomerang-slinging song and dance before. All you need to know is that its still fun.Where 3D Dot Game Heroes departs from the core Zelda formula is in its challenge. Simply navigating the overworld from dungeon to dungeon can be perilous and confusing, but that difficulty makes finding your destination that much sweeter. Clearing dungeons requires tremendous concentration and patience, but if youre a true Zelda fan youve been training your whole life for this. If youre worried about wracking your mind on a single puzzle for an hour, fret not: Theyve been expertly crafted. Boss difficulty, however, is inconsistent. A huge dragon chewed on me for about an hour, while a towering knight didnt so much as scratch me. Gamers expecting a wistful romp through a bizarro Hyrule are in for a surprising amount of game overs, but each will only strengthen your resolve.The game controls similarly to the top-down Zeldas. Staunch traditionalists are free to navigate the fields and dungeons of Dotnia with the d-pad, but Id recommend the analog stick. Before you recoil at my retro gaming-blasphemy, you should know that improvements have been made to the primitive Zelda swordplay. Many of the games numerous weapons allow 360 degrees of attacks, which the analog stick slicklysupports.Speaking of swordplay, do you remember how in the early Zelda games your sword shot lasers when you had full health? That mechanic returns here, but some blades nearly fill the screen. For example, the fully-upgraded katana lacks width but can cut down baddies from clear across the screen. Combine this with the spin attack and youve got power that makes the master sword look like a pocket knife. Your weapons ability at maximum vitality creates an engaging struggle to always remain at full health. When youre reduced to your regular armament, the game becomes a tough, desperate romp which coaxes from you the dormant Zelda skills necessary to survive.This shrine to Miyamoto doesnt come without its faults. Sometimes the dungeons fixed camera perspective obscures a vital path, which can halt progress for hours. Additionally, your characters collision box doesnt correspond to its onscreen model, which can lead to unintuitive snags on geometry and misjudgments regarding whether youre the right size to squeeze through a narrow passage.Ultimately, 3D Dot Game Heroes combines the original Legend of Zeldas world with A Link to the Past-style gameplay, which proves to be an absolute blast. What the game lacks in originality it makes up for in nostalgic humor, polished gameplay, and length, clocking in at around 20 hours for non-completionists. No self-respecting Zelda fan or retro gamer should pass this oneup.", "date": "Apr 19, 2010", "grade": "8.5"}
