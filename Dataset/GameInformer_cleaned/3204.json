The over-the-top campaign follows the career of The Franchise, a dual-threat rookie of your creation who dominates opponents on both sides of the ball. This gridiron features gruesome over-the-top injuries that happen so frequently you'll spend as much time re-setting dislocated shoulders as you will dropping back to pass. The game controls often feel unresponsive in real-time, but using the Clash meter slows the action down and allows you to make cuts that spell the difference between torn tendons and touchdowns. If senseless violence and arcade football are your passions, Blitz is the league for you.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "7"}
