{"name": "Time Hollow", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/time_hollow/b/nintendo_ds/archive/2009/09/22/review.aspx", "text": "Time Hollow, like any of the interactive novel titles on the DS, is a tough game for which to issue a blanket recommendation. In one sense, it isn't much of a game at all  you generally just go from place to place and scroll through text. On the other hand, elements of classic adventure games are alive and well, including an intriguing story and some compelling puzzles dealing with time manipulation. It's cool to see the ripples your actions in the past create in the present, but Time Hollow's characters and writing fall a little flat, which makes some sections incredibly dull. Thankfully, the satisfaction you feel when the pieces start falling into place makes it worth the effort  providing you don't expect any real action out of the gameplay.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
