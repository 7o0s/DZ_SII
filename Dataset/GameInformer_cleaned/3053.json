{"name": "Godfather 2", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/godfather_2/b/xbox360/archive/2009/09/22/review.aspx", "text": "Electronic Arts' interpretation of Francis Ford Coppola's Oscar winning film, The Godfather: Part II, draws more comparisons to the raunchy teen film Porky's than the masterful gangster story that moviegoers and critics alike herald as one of the greatest sequels of all time. For every shot gangster, a pretty girl is hit on with groan-inducing lines like ''Has anyone ever told you that you look like an angel?'' Topless women are everywhere; I even saw a few walking down the side of the street. To top it off, a car ride isn't complete without your cronies telling you that you should pull over to pick up a gal. Of course, like Porky's, no matter how much you try to impress the ladies, you'll never reel one in.The foundation is certainly here for an amusing dating game, but I honestly don't see how this content fits with The Godfather. Most of this game's content is in betrayal of the license, and it's not all ***, either. In one mission, you are tasked with assassinating Fidel Castro, an act that ends up being just as comedic as The Naked Gun's assassination attempt on Queen Elizabeth II. Unfortunately, the intent of this sequence isn't to make players laugh.But laugh is all I did throughout most of this game. At any given time, you may see two character models occupying the same space. I was fortunate enough to see two topless call girls meld to create a three-breasted beast. I also got a kick out of shooting the bottom crate in a stack, only to see the others float magically in the air. Upon exiting a vehicle, there's a chance that it may vanish. Periodically while sniping, my bullets were blocked by invisible barriers, even when the target wasn't near cover. Police seem to have short attention spans, as they'll give up during car chases and walk away nonchalantly after taking a shot at you.The problematic gameplay, unfaithful story, and array of graphical glitches create an experience I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy, which is a shame since all of the tasks associated with being the Don of a family are handled nicely. When you pause the game, you enter a mode called ''Don's View.'' From here, you can upgrade your family members' abilities, purchase new weapons for them, and send them on attack and defend missions. Additionally, you can promote them when positions become available, and entrust your life to them as protectors who enter battle with you. Taking out businesses under the control of other families can bring benefits other than additional income. If you can take control of a crime ring, such as drugs or strip clubs, you'll earn perks for your family. One ring delivers bulletproof vests, whereas another will give you armored cars. These boosts come in handy, as the game's difficulty elevates when other families are introduced into the mix. As you build up your crime syndicate, your rackets will come under attack from rival families. Protecting them isn't difficult, however, as you can send in guards or take the defensive responsibilities into your own hands by driving there. All three of the worlds (Queens, South Florida, and Cuba) are miniscule in size, making most commutes feel like an unnecessary drive around the block.You can also earn additional cash for your family within the moderately amusing Don Control multiplayer mode, where two dons and seven henchmen on each side battle for control of an area. Each Don has a bird's eye view over the action. He can highlight enemies, reward players with boosts, and dictate the flow of the action. Under his tutelage, the other players battle standard deathmatch style for supremacy. The winning team takes home all of the money wagered before the match.Most of the gameplay, both online and off, boils down to pop-and-shoot firefights. Despite the hit detection difficulties, these end up being a blast. The excellent lock-on targeting system makes lining up headshots a breeze, and the shotgun decimates everything in your path. Like the last game, if you can corner an enemy, you can finish them with an awesome (albeit graphic) Black Hand execution.This game shows how having control over a family can be a powerful experience. But as I dictated where a city's money was sent, I couldn't shake the feeling that this wasn't a Godfather game. Although many of the characters from the film are present (complete with actor likenesses), the vibe often reflects that of a teen gross-out comedy. The Godfather II seems to have more in common with Saints Row than the license it gets its name from.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "5.5"}
