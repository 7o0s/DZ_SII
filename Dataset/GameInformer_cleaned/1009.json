While the genre can bedifficult to get into due to clunky interfaces, obtuse or cryptic instructions,and infuriating citizen behaviors, Banished offers a fairly intuitive take onthings and its also easy on the eyes. Players attempt to create a thrivingcity that can survive starvation, disease, and the elements.Your citizens start offwith a bundle of resources, and then its up to you to decide the best route tosurvive and thrive. Will you build fishing docks? Farms? Orchards? You need tokeep your villagers fed, but at the same time you have to commit citizens tomoving things to stockpiles, chopping firewood, crafting tools, making clothes,and a long list of other options. Theres no right way to do things, and themap seed may play a role in some of your decisions. This leads to a deliciousbit of decision making each game, and as players go from game to game they findthemselves learning  and applying  new tactics.You dont actually havehands-on control of your citizens; you prioritize tasks and allocate people andto specific duties and roles. Alerts will appear onscreen to let you know whenpeople are hungry, freezing, dying of old age, or contracting typhus. In manycases, these warnings will come too late  Banished is a game that favors thehyper-prepared and the planner.The first few games my population died fromstarvation and the cold. A few games later, I was able to handle the moreobvious threats and fell victim to a disease outbreak. Each attempt to createthe perfect settlement gets more satisfying, and its quite easy to sink hoursinto the title coming up with new ways to make things work.Unlike some of the othertitles in the genre, Banished does not feature dungeons or monsters to battle.The war is waged against the reality of cold winters, devastating diseaseoutbreaks, and hungry populations. Banished is subtle in some of its ways thatit can crush the player; even if you have a healthy stockpile of food and othercritical supplies, time may simply win out as old age claims your populace ifthere isnt a younger generation to take over.Banished is an alluring optionfor players looking for something in the same vein as Dwarf Fortress or Townsbut want something a little more accessible and graphically inclined.", "date": "Feb 17, 2014", "grade": "8"}
