{"name": "Guilty Gear 2: Overture", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/guilty_gear_2_overture/b/xbox360/archive/2009/09/22/review.aspx", "text": "After a brief glance at Overture you might mistake it for a Dynasty Warriors clone. You'd be wrong to do so. While Overture is largely a hack and slasher that sends you speeding across large battlefields and slicing through enemies by the dozens, the game also adds RTS elements. While this strategy twist could have made the title shine, it's marred by too many problems. When your units cluster together it is difficult to select specific units. Your troops also don't respond quickly enough, but that doesn't matter since they don't listen to your orders half the time anyway. With crawling load times and a story that reeks of awkward Japanese translation, a glance should be all you give this game.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
