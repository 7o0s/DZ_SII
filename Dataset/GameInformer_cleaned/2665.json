{"name": "Yakuza 3", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/yakuza_3/b/ps3/archive/2010/03/19/review.aspx", "text": "If Im to believe Yakuza 3s depiction of Japan, a visit to thecountry would consist of being constantly accosted by punks whilewalking through markets, being asked out on dates by random beautifulwomen in burger joints, and performing menial tasks like going fromshop to shop looking for dog toys. Youd get the occasional flash ofexcitement in the form of shirtless fistfights on the rooftops, butthese would be few and far between.For a game rooted so heavilyin a tale of organized crime, Yakuza 3 is filled to the brim withwholly unexciting errands. In those moments where it does shift intoall-out action, the gameplay feels incredibly dated. The brawling feelsdistinctly last-gen, complete with horrendous collision detection.Youll unlock some vicious finishing moves and techniques that providemore wiggle room in terms of improvisation, but the combat feelsdownright mechanical when put up against other action games on the market.Leveling up your abilities is a fairly basic ordeal,requiring you to funnel experience into one of four categories.However, these upgrades never do much to significantly change the wayyou approach combat. Its a minimal nod to RPG conventions, but nomatter how much youve upgraded, youll still groan every time somegangsters want to fight because they think you looked at them crooked.An overall lack of polish is evident in many aspects of the game. Let'ssay you're wielding a giant couch as a weapon and a quicktime eventoccurs in the middle of a fight. The couch will magically disappearfrom your hands for the duration of the QTE, then it will pop up againas soon as you're done. If you're stumbling down the street in adrunken stupor and some gang members attack you, you'll becomeimmediately lucid and fight them gracefully, only to return to yourintoxicated stumble the moment they're successfully dispatched. I'llstop there for the sake of brevity, but rest assured you won't go 15minutes in this game without seeing plenty more like this.Outsideof the repetitive fights, gameplay is mostly confined to walking aroundand talking to people in an effort to advance the story. When Yakuza 3comes down to these open-world elements, its trounced by a title asold as Grand Theft Auto III. Downtown Ryukyu may be heavily populated,but the lack of any real interaction makes it feel like a ghost town.Numerous activities are available, from surprisingly completerecreations of golf, pool, and darts to afterthoughts like the dreadful karaoke minigame. Some of these serve as decent distractions when youwant to take a break from the main quest, but the scant XP and cashbonuses you receive from them wont do anything to make the coregameplay more tolerable.Yakuza 3 does offer an involved,lengthy story for those with the patience to wade through therepetition and annoyances. Fans who have followed Kazuma through theprevious installments should enjoy watching him return to mob life toprotect his orphanage. Yakuza 3 carves its own identity and characters,making it more than just Grand Theft Auto in Japan. If you dont feela strong connection with the story, however, the dated gameplaymechanics and lack of polish do a fine job of sapping most of theenjoyment you could potentially receive.", "date": "Mar 19, 2010", "grade": "6.5"}
