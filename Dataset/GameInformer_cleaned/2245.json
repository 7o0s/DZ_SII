{"name": "Chime Super Deluxe", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/chime_super_deluxe/b/ps3/archive/2011/03/30/review.aspx", "text": "The original Chime first released under non-profit video game publisher OneBigGame and developer Zo Mode for Xbox Live Arcade (and eventually on PC). With each $5 download, players made a charitable donation toward Save the Children and Starlight Childrens Foundation. Now Zo Mode returns with a deluxe commercial release (not for charity) of the audio/visual puzzler for PlayStation 3 users. The team brings back tracks from the original Chime and pads the set list with five more mesmerizing tunes and grids, plus four-player multiplayer, making Chime Super Deluxe on PSN ideal for first-timers. Chime has often been compared to the likes of Lumines, which is far from being a bad thing, and gameplay for Chime Super Deluxe remains largely the same as its addicting predecessor. Youll be given randomly chosen Tetris-style blocks in a variety of shapes that youll place on a grid to create rectangular quads that need to be the minimum size of 3X3. Youll rush to keep expanding upon your quad for the greatest possible grid coverage before the moving beatbar passes over it and locks it in (changing the color of that area). Your ultimate goal is to cover the grid in its entirety all the while a hypnotic musical track slowly builds as you progress. One round with a grid usually lasts nine minutes, however a variety of time modes in the three and six minute range ramps amp up the challenge to get as much coverage as you can before time runs out. If it sounds identical to the original Chime, its because it is, however the addition of new tracks and grids gives the harmonious experience some more length.Another new addition in the PSN version is co-op and versus modes. You take on the simple to learn, tough to master gameplay experience on the single-player grids and share it with up to four friends who can work together to gain maximum coverage on a level, or sabotage your progress while advancing their own. Online multiplayer unfortunately isnt available, but if you have a few friends over, Chime Super Deluxes multiplayer is the ultimate way to experience the game.With new mesmerizing tunes and grids, and the inclusion of four-player co-op and versus multiplayer, Chime Super Deluxe on PSN is by far the definitive version.", "date": "zalez on Mar 30, 2011", "grade": "8"}
