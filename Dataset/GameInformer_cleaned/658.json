Head-to-head gunslinging is the sole focus of Secret Ponchos, butwhile the short matches favor skill over twitchy reflexes, myriad drawbackswill run you out of town faster than a belligerent sheriff.Secret Ponchos throws you into the game without any kind oftutorial, so you can expect to get slaughtered while learning the basiccontrols and abilities of your chosen character. Because characters level upindividually and can't be swapped during matches, it takes a fair amount oftime to find out which character best meshes with your playstyle, and once youdo there's little incentive to switch things up since it means starting fromscratch again. Despite Phantom Poncho's overpowered bullwhip attack (which hasmade him a favorite among the game's tiny player base), I ultimately settled onKid Red and his dual pistols and dynamite attacks, then started on the long andslow process of increasing my bounty (i.e., level).Unfortunately, Secret Ponchos' shortcomings surface almostimmediately. It contains no story or single-player content, and the competitivemodes are limited to death match, free-for-all, and the tug-of-war dominationmode (the first team to five kills wins, but each death sets you back a point).Rookie matches start you off easy by negating skill points (earned by levelingup) and XP penalties. However, death match and domination are both limited toone-versus-one or two-versus-two matches in Rookie play, which are far toosmall to be interesting; after the first player dies, matches invariablydevolve into bum-rushing the lone remaining gunman. I gravitated towardseight-player free-for-all matches in Rookie play, but even then the chaoticaction was hard to get into.Even with the benefit of being one of Sony's freePlayStation Plus games in December, virtually no one is playing Secret Ponchos.Joining a match is like going to the doctor's office; you wait forever just tobe placed into an empty lobby, then wait even longer as the game desperatelytries to find enough other players to fill the rosters. Waiting timesfrequently dwarf the length of actual matches, making Secret Ponchos feel morelike a baseball game than a twin-stick shooter.When you do finally get a full lobby, the other playersoften have terrible connection speeds, resulting in lag that sends them warpingacross the battlefield. Secret Poncho's gameplay is fairly unforgiving; lengthyreloads, limited stamina, and cooldowns on abilities require you to be accurateand efficient with your attacks  which is virtually impossible when lag isintroduced into the mix.Like all competitive titles, the real focus of Secret Ponchosis ranked play, which offers up four-versus-four death match and dominationmodes. The larger team sizes provide a more tactical experience, but they comewith a harsh tradeoff. Not only is it harder to find a game, but the cripplingend-of-match penalties mean you're often losing experience instead of gainingit. Losing automatically costs you 100 XP  a substantial amount, consideringyou'll often only earn 200-300 XP in a good match. Having a K/D ratio in thenegative also costs you big, and is usually enough to offset any potentialbonus you might receive for dealing out damage.The worst factor in how much XP you receive (or lose), isthe match odds, which you have absolutely no control over. The game assigns a~favorite~ ratio based on your rank and whoever the matchmaking pairs you upagainst; if you're deemed the underdog, you receive a nice boost to your totalXP after the round ends. However, if you're the projected winner (which startshappening at rank two, since most of the people playing are newbies who have yet to grow tired of the game) the odds cut into your earned XP  even if you getwalloped by the opposing team and penalties already have your experience in thered. The XP system is made even more volatile by the fact that matches areextremely short and greatly dependent on the quality of your teammates. Gettingstomped because one of your allies gets disconnected or completely blows it isbad enough  losing a significant chunk of your XP adds insult to injury.These punitive end-of-match penalties brought my progression and enjoyment  to a prompt halt. I finished one match with six kills and onedeath, only to watch my sizable XP gain get cut in half by the ranking gods. Inanother match, I barely broke even despite a 2:1 K/D ratio. Sometimes evenbeing the highest-scoring member of my team still left me with less XP than Istarted the match with.The variety of bugs I ran into provided the final straw.Matches periodically hang up during loading, the mute button frequently failsto mute players, and in one particularly memorable two-versus-two dominationmatch, the opposing team inexplicably had a third member.Despite debuting as part of PlayStation Plus' Instant GameCollection, the barren lobbies and long matchmaking times tell you everythingyou need to know about the state of Secret Ponchos. No one wants to play alaggy, imbalanced, and punitive multiplayer-only game, even if it's free.Unless Switchblade Monkeys' planned content updates can iron out the kinks andadd more compelling modes to boost the mediocre gameplay, you're better offleaving Secret Ponchos to the tumbleweeds.", "date": "Dec 15, 2014", "grade": "5"}
