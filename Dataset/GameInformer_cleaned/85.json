House of the Dying Sun taps into a lost era of starfighting simulation, successfully evoking the feeling of a classic space shooter like X-Wing, TIE Fighter, or Starlancer. If youre looking for a story, forget it; its as clich and barebones as they come. If youre looking for tight gameplay, great music, and intense dogfighting, youve come to the right place.A minimalistic story could be a serious detriment to other games, but the focus is clear here: Gameplay and space combat take center stage. Arcade-style movement with the ability to drift and brake on a dime after boosting to dodge a locked-on enemy combatant is satisfying, and you dont need a HOTAS setup to enjoy it either  the core mouse and keyboard controls work great.With an upgradable arsenal of autocannons, heavy weapons, and sleek maneuvering around asteroids and other craft, you unleash hell on the enemies of the Emperor. The concept is simple and so are the missions, tasking the player to destroy enemy ships, defend allied assets, or run escort duty. Dogfighting in your craft with enemy fighters zipping around asteroids is intense fun, and missions are a quick restart if you run into an errant piece of space debris. The constant pace of combat is immersive and exciting, with the threat of enemy reinforcements always moments away, forcing you to complete your task and warp away before more difficult opponents join the fray.It takes a a few mid-tier missions to really get the hang of ship control, assigning your other pilots tasks while shooting around the sky, and hopping into your allied vessels when your first option is turned into scrap, but the challenge summons a nostalgic feeling I enjoyed, though theres little variety in mission structure or tasks.The core game and missions can be completed in just a few hours, but many additional unlocks and challenges can keep the journey through space rolling for those seriously looking for more. Short length is not necessarily a negative point to a game, but its a noticeable detriment here, offering a tiny taste of what a full-fledged title could be within the same framework and strong mechanics.Within the brief campaign, content offerings are sparse and consist mainly of tougher difficulty encounters or a challenge mode  simple, barebones stuff with graphics that dont really live up to todays standards. While the visuals are functional and crisp, they dont need to be as blast-from-the-past as the rest of the title.House of the Dying Sun is light on content offerings and depth, but big on giving players a modern day chance to experience the great gameplay that defined classic space shooters of an era long past. Dogfighting In VR  House of the Dying Suns lightweight graphics and laser-focus on crisp combat lend themselves admirably to a VR experience. If you have either a Rift or Vive, those should be your first choice for hopping into the pilots seat.", "date": "Nov 11, 2016", "grade": "7.5"}
