The first Resident Evil Revelations was a pleasant surprise, modernizingthe series with faster gameplay while still retaining its horror and tension.It was Capcom's best attempts to capture the best of both nostalgia and modernaction. Resident Evil Revelations 2 continues that feat with more visceralgameplay and intense encounters. Everything feels better than its predecessor,but Revelations 2 struggles with momentum due to poor pacing and tediouspuzzles. Revelations 2 features one of themore engrossing stories in Resident Evil. A mysterious woman has trapped ourheroes on a secluded island, putting them through horrific experiments. Thestory has two campaigns that alternate each chapter; one focuses on fan-favoriteClaire and newcomer Moira, daughter of popular character Barry Burton, whileanother jumps forward in time, starring Barry and an enigmatic child namedNatalia. Bringing back two characters thathaven't been seen for years works to the game's advantage. Finding out whatthey've been up to is just as interesting as discovering who's at the roots ofthese heinous occurrences. Moira and Natalia also hold their own secrets andsurprises. True to the series, be prepared for some crazy plot twists,laughable dialogue, and campy moments. It all comes together in a verysatisfying way, and every character has unique arcs and developmentthroughout. The only issue is the pacingfeels uneven; sometimes the game lacks explanation and a reveal jumps out ofnowhere.Bonus Episodes?Resident Evil Revelations 2 has two bonus episodes that come with the retail version, but can also be purchased digitally. One episode focuses on Moira, the other stars Natalia. These episodes didn't factor into our review, but we wrote up impressions about them. See how they fare here.The Resident Evil basics haven't changed; you're stillblasting through zombie hordes, corridor-crawling, managing resources, andfinding a way around occasional obstacles. Combat is smooth, and featuresprecise, entertaining gunplay. Claire and Barry handle the guns, while Moiraand Natalia work as support characters. Moira can shine her flashlight inenemies' faces to stun them or melee attack them with her crowbar, whileNatalia can spot zombies through walls and throw bricks at them for damage. Ienjoy how the characters' abilities work together, like having Moira use herstun so Claire can line up a headshot.You can swap between characters with a click of a button,but a friend can also pick up a controller for local co-op. However, I had morefun playing solo, since Moira and Natalia have smaller combat roles and aremore vulnerable, making them less fun to control long-term. The only hindranceto single-player is that the A.I. is anemic, and doesn't make a difference inbattle. Due to bad decisions and questionable path-finding, I had some battleswhere it was hard for the A.I. to stay alive. Sometimes you're forced to switchaway from your gun-toting characters to pry open doors, and this was alwayswhere the A.I. let me down, never keeping the enemies at bay.Exploring the island, you encounter everything from creepyprisons to grotesque meat factories. Old standbys like the woods and sewers arealso in place, but they are the least exciting of the bunch. I appreciate thatthe dialogue and setpieces have plenty of nods to longtime fans. The only bigknock is you're doubling up on a lot of the same environments in both campaigns,since Barry is retracing Claire and Moira's steps. Granted, Barry takes new routesthrough these and has some different encounters, but these places lose theirmystery a second time around. At the very least, Capcom interjects exciting situations inevery chapter. My favorite moments were when I was locked in with a horde ofenemies rushing towards me, trying to keep the crowd under control. I alsoreveled in stealth-killing enemies, and enjoyed the stranger enemy types likeinvisible and instant-kill monsters. Plus, some of the boss battles are insane,requiring every last bit of ammo you have. I'd feel panicked as my ammodwindled, wondering if I'd make it through, when the boss went down with onlytwo bullets remaining. I love the chaotic moments, but Revelations' weakest part isits dated puzzles. For instance, moving a power supply through various conveyorbelts is tedious and unexciting. Every puzzle brings down the momentum. Theyaren't fun, and feel more like tacked-on busywork to prolong the episode. Thankfully,the story and intense encounters take center stage, and you only encounterabout four of these tedious affairs. As soon as they're done, they're longforgotten and you're back in the fun of tracking down the lowlife that's out tomake your life on the island miserable.Resident Evil Revelations 2 gets a lot right. Itleft me on edge and invested in the world and characters. I just wish theexperience was more even, because some dips in the action hinder theexperience. Still, trudging through the slower moments does pay off when youexperience the adrenaline rush from some of the unforgettable moments. Falling In Love With Raid ModeI got completely engrossed with raid mode, which allows you to build up your own iconic Resident Evil character. You take on levels with waves of enemies and collect items, such as new guns and upgrades for them. Completing stages helps level up your character; you can apply skill points and customize your guns afterward. If you want to prove your skills and feel the intensity of battle, this is the mode to play. You earn special medals for completing extra goals like killing every enemy on the map. Get enough medals and you open up new level sets; some are straight out of the main campaign, others are new for the mode or reappear from past games. I had a blast watching my character grow, finding better weapons, and throwing myself into insane challenges with restricted time and ammo. Raid mode gives you something to do after youve completed the main story, especially with daily challenges and extra perks.", "date": "Mar 16, 2015", "grade": "8"}
