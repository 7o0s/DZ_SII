{"name": "Major Minor's Majestic March", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/major_minors_majestic_march/b/wii/archive/2009/09/22/review.aspx", "text": "As a huge PaRappa and Um Jammer Lammy fan, I was very excited about this reunion of designer Masaya Matsuura and artist Rodney Alan Greenblat. What the hell happened? The game starts by casting you as a cartoon drum major who leads a marching band through town by moving the Wii remote up and down to the beat like a baton. Unfortunately, that's where it ends, too. This is the shallowest game design I've seen in years. Even worse, the infectious music and lyrics of PaRappa (the real draw of that game) are replaced by forgettable marching band instrumentals. If I'm going to spend a long period of time with my hand wrapped around an oblong object, moving my arm rapidly up and down, it sure won't be with this game.", "date": "on Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "3"}
