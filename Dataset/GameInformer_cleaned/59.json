Kingdom Hearts II launched more than a decade ago,and a whole new generation of gamers can play the early entries thanks to HDremasters on PS3 (and later this year on the PS4). Final Chapter Prologueshould be the last new remaster before Kingdom Hearts III; it includes DreamDrop Distance (originally a 3DS exclusive) for the first time on the bigscreen. Additionally, an episode starring Aqua and a mini-movie, which showshow this crazy journey all began, are both new for this entry. As convoluted asthe Kingdom Hearts storyline is, after playing through this collection, I havea clearer understanding of the narrative leading into Kingdom Hearts III. Evenwithout the extra story context, Final Chapter Prologue is fun on its own, andSquare Enix did a wonderful job making this a worthwhile collection and notjust a port of Dream Drop Distance.The most appealing partof the collection is A Fragmentary Passage, which follows Aqua after the eventsof Birth By Sleep. The episode took me about three hours to complete, but ifyou collect every treasure, you can extend that an extra hour. Aqua is one ofmy favorite characters due to her selflessness and determination to save theworld, and getting some resolution to her story was satisfying. I won't spoilanything, but playing the episode only makes me more excited for what potentialrole she might play in Kingdom Hearts III.A Fragmentary Passagetakes you through various levels, each with its own gimmick. For instance, inthe first world, Aqua must locate five clock gears, platforming on high ledgesand rooftops, while battling enemies to achieve them. In another, she must gothrough mirrors and uses their reflections to create ledges or manipulategravity. Square Enix says A Fragmentary Passage uses development tools similarto Kingdom Hearts III, showing off more expansive environments and the ease ofgetting around them using the air slide and a powerful double jump, so it'salmost a first look at how the tech has advanced for the upcoming entry. Itmakes me excited for Kingdom Hearts III's exploration. The episode also showsoff the smoothest combat I've experienced in the series, playing out in afaster, more fluid pace. Camera issues didn't plague me as much as past entrieshave, either.While some cool bossfights, like a titan that takes up most of the landscape and a tower ofHeartless that morph into different shapes, test your skills, these baddiesoften repeat through the short levels, and a lot of the objectives feel likebusy work. You're never just locating one thing it's usually five, orbacktracking to get what you need. The journey is breezy, so if you're lookingfor a challenge, I recommend starting on Proud Mode. You can unlock CriticalMode after completing A Fragmentary Passage on any mode for the highestchallenge, which really tests your combat prowess.A Fragmentary Passage isn't perfect, but I'mglad Square Enix included completely new content, and dressing up Aqua bycompleting challenges is a fun bonus. My Aqua ended up wearing Minnie Mouseears and having a red-and-white dress with ribbons to match. At the end of theepisode, a lengthy scene (presumably from Kingdom Hearts III) allows you tofinally see the characters embark on the next part of their journey, which isreally what we've been waiting all this time for to see that Kingdom Hearts'plot is moving forward instead of explaining past elements.The collection also features an HD movie, KingdomHearts Back Cover, which runs a littleover an hour. The movies in these collections haven't always been thatimpressive, and I was skeptical knowing that this was based on a mobile game'sstory, but Square Enix really spruced it up. It's the best movie featured inall the HD collections up to this point, and sheds worthwhile light on theseries' early history and how the prophecy of darkness affected theForetellers. The movie is a good look at what set the events of Kingdom Heartsinto motion, and has some memorable betrayals and action sequences, as everyonetries to do what they think is right to save the world from its dark fate.Dream Drop Distance HD is the part of thecollection you can sink the most time into, and Square Enix has made plenty ofenhancements and changes to get the 3DS game running smoothly on console. Thebattles are faster-paced, the camera benefits from a larger screen, and loadtimes are improved from the original handheld version. The controls are alsobetter on the PS4, feeling less clunky. Square Enix updated the minigames andabilities that previously used the 3DS' touchscreen, although it's not alwaysan improvement. For instance, the reality-shift slingshot worked much betterwith touch controls, and petting your Dreameaters felt more natural with astylus. Still, this version is far from just a visual upgrade (although it doeslook fantastic on PS4). For those who haven't played Dream Drop Distance, orwant a refresher, this is the best way to go.Final Chapter Prologue is a solid collection that Ienjoyed playing, and got me more excited for Kingdom Hearts III due to how itsets up everything so wonderfully. I wish I were playing Kingdom Hearts IIIinstead of another remaster, but this is the best collection for getting youprepped for what's ahead.Whats In 2.8?The only previous game included in Kingdom Hearts 2.8 is Dream Drop Distance; it does not have Kingdom Hearts I or II in it. If you want to play those, you need to buy Kingdom Hearts 1.5 and 2.5 for PlayStation 3, or wait for the announced PS4 versions.", "date": "Jan 23, 2017", "grade": "8.5"}
