{"name": "The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Is Already The Second Best Selling Game Of 2023", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/dragon_age_origins/b/ps3/archive/2009/11/03/review.aspx", "text": "This is the strangest case of video game dj vu Ive everexperienced. After playing through the PC version of Dragon Age lastmonth, I know these characters, Ive seen these locations, and Ivedone these quests. In terms of content, everything in the consoleversions of BioWares epic fantasy RPG is practically identical to thePC release. On the other hand, the gameplay drastically changes thecontours of the combat, creating a new landscape littered with familiarlandmarks. By no means is it the same game, but it remains a greatadventure. When it isnt being measured against the successes ofits PC counterpart, this iteration of Dragon Age stands on its own as amix of real-time battles and tactical combat. Instead of executingstrategies using the classic pause-and-play approach (a hallmark of theBaldurs Gate and Neverwinter Nights series), you spend most of yourtime in the trenches activating abilities and firing off spells inrapid succession. Pausing to issue commands is still available, butfights seem tailored to be action-oriented and less about consideringyour options  especially since the lack of an isometric view meansthat you rarely have a solid awareness of the whole battlefield.Powersare mapped to the face buttons, which works particularly well forcharacters with a modest selection of skills, like fighters and rogues.Youll wade into a group of enemies, use your powers, then attacknormally until your cooldowns are ready to go again. If you plan onplaying as a mage or carefully managing your ally mages, you shouldexpect to pause combat regularly in order to select the mostappropriate spell from the clunky menu system.Battles have amore freewheeling style thanks to the shift away from pause-and-play,so youll want to be confident that your party members arent doingsomething stupid where you cant see them. Constantly juggling controlamong your various allies throws a wrench in the otherwise smooth flowof combat, so Id recommend spending lots of time with your AIscripting so your pals can fend for themselves. As an unexpectedbenefit, I felt more of a connection to my created characters since Ispent more time controlling them directly rather than managing my partyas a whole.In streamlining combat for consoles, developersBioWare and Edge of Reality also dialed back the punishing difficulty.Fights that I won by the skin of my teeth in the PC version were abreeze this time around, largely because friendly fire is disabled onthe normal difficulty setting. You can spew gouts of flame and conjurelightning storms with relative impunity, which removes all of the riskfrom casting high-level spells. I thought this was lame at first, butit isnt without charm; I got lots of laughs using attacks andstrategies that wouldnt be viable if my allies were in harms way.Tossinga fireball into a crowded melee is entertaining, but it represents thebiggest problem with this incarnation of Dragon Age. Theaction-focused, low-pressure encounters are fun, but they rarely forceyou to truly test your skills. Though youll mow down hundreds ofdarkspawn and thugs, youll rarely feel the satisfaction that comeswith a hard-won victory. Even the spoils of battle are a pain, sincecramped inventory is a pervasive problem, and the only way to trulysolve it is to shell out seven dollars for the Wardens Keep DLC,adding a sorely needed storage chest for your excess items. Thisfeature is a genre standard that should have been in the core package,and holding it back to make players buy it on launch day is pathetic.Despitedifferences in the mechanics, the land of Ferelden is just as vast andintricate in the console versions of Dragon Age. The involved historybehind the characters and organizations lends the world surprisingdepth, though technical hiccups (like an uneven framerate andoccasional glitches) and an awkward interface can hamper your enjoymentof the content. Your dialogue and interaction options eschew thetraditional good-versus-evil dynamic, instead embracing a moreambiguous view of morality. The story and its multiple branches willgrab your attention, and the combat  while different in style delivers plenty of thrills. I prefer the PC iteration, but its stillgood on PS3 and 360, and way better than not playing Dragon Age at all.", "date": "Nov 03, 2009", "grade": "8"}
