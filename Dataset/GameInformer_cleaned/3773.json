Similarly, Sonic Team has remedied its recentstruggles by piecing together things that have worked in the past to create a better3D Sonic the Hedgehog game. Unfortunately for both Eggman and Sonic Team,despite this being their best effort in a long time, the flaws are still evident.SonicForces puts you in control of modern Sonic, classic Sonic, and a custom hero asyou speed through more than 30 stages to take down the maniacal doctor. Ratherthan delivering jarringly disparate pacing, Sonic Team made all three playablecharacters focus on speedy gameplay. The main differentiating factors betweenthese characters is their movesets. Modern Sonic has his signature homingattack that lets him lock onto enemies in mid-air, as well as slide, stomp, andboost abilities, while classic Sonic is limited to his spin dash.Beyondtwo versions of Sonic, Forces also features a custom character you take controlof in dedicated stages. The creation suite allows you to choose from severalanthropomorphic animal species, and equip them with cosmetic clothes andaccessories. While you can easily create an abomination that sticks out incutscenes like a sore thumb, making a hero that feels at home in the world isjust as simple.Yourcustom character shares most of its moves with modern Sonic, but you can alsoswing from grapple points and equip a Wispon weapon. Wispons range from anelectric whip to a device that traps enemies in cubes, but the most effectiveis the flamethrower you start with. Each Wispon also carries a traversalmechanic - the flamethrower allows you to burst upward to reach higher levels,while the cube device can spawn platforms. I like how you can reach differentitems if you have a particular ability at your disposal, but a few extra ringsare usually all that's at stake when choosing your route.ModernSonic's 3D stages are better than they've ever been, and deliver a terrificsense of speed without making you feel like you're out of control. My favorite3D sequences come when you're rushing down a straightaway, relying on yourreflexes to sidestep enemies and obstacles. However, Sonic Team has yet tofully crack the code of how to make Sonic feel great in motion when not onrails, and the slippery controls feel like he's skating through the world. ClassicSonic's 2D gameplay is surprisingly the worst part of the trio of characters,as his side-scrolling portions don't control nearly as well as the classicgames, and precise platforming is unnecessarily frustrating. In addition, classicSonic inexplicably loses momentum at a rapid rate, slowing down too quickly afterhitting a booster, and often struggling to make it up ramps seemingly placedfor him to easily blast over.Withmany recent Sonic games, level design has been a sore spot. Sonic Forceslargely fixes the series' longstanding problem with random pitfalls; I trainedmyself to let Sonic speed forward with little fear of my character falling to hisdeath thanks to the better designed stages. Unfortunately, Forces' attempts tocreate branching paths falls mostly flat, giving you little incentive toexplore the alternate routes when they do pop up. Instead, Sonic Forces ismostly about blasting through the stage as quick as possible while scooping uptons of rings and taking out some enemies along the way.SonicForces encourages you to revisit stages with the promise of new customizationitems for your created character. SOS missions pop up at random on previouslybeaten stages, but the missions are poorly defined. Despite making it throughthe stage again during these SOS missions, I sometimes received an ambiguous~Mission Failed~ screen with no explanation as to why. In addition, dailymissions give you simple goals like clearing a Sonic stage, while other challengesfocus on tasks like using specific weapons. While I like the added emphasis puton replaying older levels, I am frustrated and baffled that the action-stoppingtutorials from the earlier levels persist on repeated playthroughs.Despite my multiple gripeswith Sonic Forces, I still enjoyed the adventure. 3D Sonic games still aren'tto where they should be after such a long time of iteration andexperimentation, but through improved gameplay and level design, Sonic Forcescontinues the series' evolution in the right direction.", "date": "Nov 08, 2017", "grade": "6.5"}
