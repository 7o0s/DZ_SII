I dont mean hitting a button to close your virtual eyes. Through the power of a webcam, Before Your Eyes tracks when you blink which allows you to progress through a wonderful narrative adventure title from GoodbyeWorld Games. It may seem like a novel gimmick on the surface, but the mechanic is used so inventively that it meaningfully enhances the already powerful storytelling that fans of narrative adventure titles would be mistaken to write it off as a shallow trick.Players take on the role of Benjamin Brynn, a lost soul who has already passed on. At the beginning of the game, you encounter a canine ferryman who forces you to relive the events of Bens life, beginning at birth. This is all to impress a being called the Gatekeeper who wants an honest assessment of the kind of person Ben was. By blinking when prompted, youll jump days, weeks, and sometimes years forward in Bens life. Im impressed by how the game accurately recognizes eye-tracking. I never had an issue where a blink didnt register or my camera needed recalibration. I also never felt disoriented or uncomfortable playing using eye tracking, but those factors will vary by person. On that note, its good that theres an option to play the entire game using traditional mouse clicks, but I think youd be doing yourself a major disservice in doing so.Having played Before Your Eyes twice, once using blinks and the other using the mouse, I think the story loses a fair bit of its magic when playing with solely traditional control inputs. Closing your eyes, then opening them to a brand-new scene creates the awesome sensation that youre reliving a life through an old-school View-Master toy. Bens memories are fleeting, and the mechanic sells that point perfectly. Yes, I was occasionally disappointed after I blinked involuntarily and advanced the story sooner than I would have liked. However, I didnt mind it for long because I found that doing so lends to the games dreamlike quality and the sensation that even cherished memories eventually fade even when we hope that they wont. Some of my favorite moments involve closing my eyes to better eavesdrop on hushed conversations or so my childhood bestie could leave a heartfelt note embarrassment-free. It's also just more funto ~look and blink~ instead of pointing and clicking on objects.Even while playing with your eyes, you still use a mouse for other actions likeconnecting stars in the night sky to write a cosmic message or to keep in rhythm with a piano tempo. These interactions are largely basic but are still delightful. No matter how you play, Before Your Eyes story is a heartfelt tale that had me close to tears at several points. Despite its pleasantly whimsical veneer, the narratives themes of depression and existentialism hit hard, as does understanding lifes meaning from the perspective of a person who, despite having a great family and being born with prodigious gifts, struggles to find personal fulfillment. The writing is earnest and thoughtful, and the story takes some unexpected turns culminating in a bittersweet final message that lands harder than I was prepared for (in a good way).A great story needs good characters, and Before Your Eyes has that in spades. Bens parents, a caring yet demanding mother and a lovably goofy father, are sweethearts. The same goes for Chloe, your mischievous neighbor who comes off as a genuinely endearing kid you cant help but want to impress and hang out with. I was surprised by how attached I became to the cast in such a short time, but the superb performances and well-written dialogue do their job and ingratiated me to the characters.Throughout the story youll make some choices, but I was disappointed in how little they impact the overall narrative. Dont stress too much over whether to sneak out with your friend or get much-needed sleep for your big piano recital; this is one of those games where youre merely choosing what colors to paint the road as opposed to creating whole new paths. Since the game only takes about an hour or so to get through, its worth replaying just to see a few of those scenes, but I wish my decisions had more weight given the large number of choices presented.Before Your Eyes story left me reeling by the end, and its a memorable journey worth going out of your way to play. You rarely get a lot of first-of-a-kind experiences in games anymore, and Before Your Eyes largely nails the execution of its primary hook. Its a concept Id love to see further explored in a follow-up, and I couldnt be happier that something like this exists.PlayStation VR2Before Your Eyes is now available in VR for the first time, exclusively on PlayStation VR2, and it is the best place to play it. Everything Marcus wrote about the game above  it being a heartfelt and truly novel experience  applies to the PlayStation VR2 version, but every aspect is improved by the new perspective. Its one of the few PlayStation VR2 games that takes advantage of the hardwares eye tracking and it works great. I personally encountered issues playing with a webcam in the past, but I never encountered a single issue on PlayStation VR2. It also doesnt require initial calibration. It just works immediately, and continues to work, letting you focus wholly on Benjamin Brynns story. Beyond the blinking, though, being able to look around the environments makes everything feel more impactful and real. The structure of the game, where you as the player character are sitting in one place as you move through life, is perfectly suited to VR. Its also not a long experience, so the nausea potential is very low. You should play Before Your Eyes if you can on any platform, but if PlayStation VR2 is an option, then that is absolutely the route you should take. Plus, no one will see you cry if youre wearing a headset.  Kyle Hilliard", "date": "Mar 10, 2023", "grade": "8.5"}
