After years asthe kingpin of military multiplayer, Battlefield creator DICE found itstitle in jeopardy as FPS gamers abandoned PCs in favor of consoles andCall of Duty became the gold standard. At the core of Infinity Wardsworld-beating shooter was the Battlefield blueprint. The studioborrowed the persistent rankings and unlockable weapons concepts fromBattlefield 2, refined them to unprecedented levels, and matched itsrobust online offering with an expertly crafted single-player campaignfeaturing thrilling scripted sequences that put action flicks to shame.Not content to settle for second place, DICE throws down the gauntletwith Bad Company 2, delivering its best multiplayer package sinceBattlefield 2 and a remarkably improved single-player campaign thatopenly mocks its rival while cribbing from them at the same time. Aswith all Battlefield titles, a phenomenal multiplayer mode serves asthe heart of Bad Company 2. The game successfully blends manyinnovations from the series past with impressive new features tocreate a robust experience that rightfully challenges Modern Warfarefor the multiplayer crown. All the Battlefield staples return  playerprogression, rankings, squad groupings, unlockable weapons, and hugemaps that allow players to attack via land, air, and sea. The deepprogression system constantly dangles the carrot of achievement infront of you, offering a wealth of unlockable weapons, gadgets, andspecializations with nearly every round. An impressive array of pinsand insignia document your battlefield prowess, and the dog tags returnas boast-worthy incentives to knife unsuspecting enemies.Conquestand Rush still serve as the multiplayer pillars, but Bad Company 2 alsointroduces two new change-of-pace modes. Squad Rush places afour-player team in the role of attackers who must best the fourdefenders by destroying two crates. Squad Deathmatch, on the otherhand, pits four teams of four against each other in a battle for killcounts and bragging rights. Both modes feature more intimate maps andtake much less time to complete than the standard Rush mode. Teamworkand coordination are stressed to new degrees as well. Keeping closeproximity to your squad is essential for reviving fallen teammates,which can spell the difference between successfully defending a crateand losing it while half your squad waits to respawn.Themultiplayer modes are complemented by a fantastic array of maps. Manypay homage to great maps from Battlefields past, and the diversity inlocale and terrain assures every battle plays out differently. Someconcentrate on vehicular combat, where controlling the air withchoppers or mounting an assault with tanks are the keys to winning thewar, while others stress infantry tactics in tighter urban locales.These expertly crafted environments are a far cry from their crampedand frantic counterparts in Modern Warfare 2, giving players room toorchestrate coordinated assaults.A pair of useful new toolsbolster the team tactics. The spotting mechanic helps improvecommunication by allowing players to mark enemy positions as theyidentify movement on the battlefield. In addition, the overpoweredartillery from Bad Company has been removed in favor of a player-guidedUAV that allows you to track and mark enemy movements from abovebetween missile barrages.DICE made many logistical changes tothe multiplayer experience, but failed to address some other minorhindrances. You can finally kick unwanted players from your squad tomake room for a buddy, but large groups will gripe when their partygets split by the sometimes unaccommodating matchmaking system. Thesketchy statistics updater still takes awhile to post the results fromyour most recent match (a legacy problem thats plagued Battlefield foryears), and the annoying kill cam is sure to anger players using therecon class because it gives away sniping positions. Snipers also wontbe pleased that DICE once again doesnt allow players to go prone.Thankfully, you can ditch the kill cam in the new Hardcore mode, whichalso turns off many HUD elements and increases the damage to deliver amore realistic war experience.As great as the multiplayer is,DICE takes its biggest strides forward with the drastically improvedsolo campaign. The follow-up to the Swedish studios first attempt at acrafting a meaningful single-player experience finds success inmimicking some of the best games to date  keen gamers will noticeborrowed elements from Call of Duty and Uncharted 2 sprinkledthroughout the campaign. The most drastic improvement comes with itsrenewed sense of pacing. By ditching large open-world environments infavor of a more linear path, DICE is better able to craft memorablescripted sequences that the first game sorely lacked. Amazingly, DICEpulls this off without sacrificing the players sense of freedom  thelevels are still big enough to offer several tactical options forplayers to explore.The jokers from B Company resume their role as the loveable heroes, but DICE trades in the humorous Three Kings storylineof the first game in favor of a more somber mission. When the U.S.learns the Russians are after a secret WMD the Japanese developedduring WWII, a routine mission turns into a globetrotting escapade thattakes B Company from the jungles of South America to the peak of theAndes mountains. Though the stakes are higher, that doesnt stop Sarge,Sweetwater, Haggard, and Marlowe from cracking jokes at each othersexpense. The comedic dialogue shines throughout the game; theseeccentric soldiers have more personality than all the protagonists fromCall of Duty, Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon, and Medal of Honor combined.Anumber of subtle improvements keep the campaign moving along with theclip of a Hollywood blockbuster. DICE ditched the health syringe fromthe first game in favor of a regenerative health system, the forgivingcheckpoint system doesnt punish players, and you never have to babysityour more-than-capable squad during the intense firefights. The onlything the campaign lacks is co-op; since four heroes are alreadyfighting side-by-side throughout the game, this was a missedopportunity for DICE to one-up the competition.Though thecampaign doesnt top the brilliant set pieces found in Modern Warfare,the drastic improvements bring it near the level of Infinity Wardsjuggernaut. Placed in tandem with the exceptional multiplayer, BadCompany 2 is a memorable shooter that should be a favored destinationon Xbox Live and PlayStation Network for much of 2010.", "date": "Mar 01, 2010", "grade": "9.5"}
