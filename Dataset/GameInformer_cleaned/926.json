{"name": "Monument Valley", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/monument_valley/b/ios/archive/2014/04/07/savoring-every-moment.aspx", "text": "Optical illusion-based puzzle games are quickly becoming a genreunto themselves, with indie titles like Antichamber and The Bridge challengingplayers to leave the basic conventions of reality at the start screen. UstwoGames' Monument Valley is the latest to encourage its own line of thinking, asplayers help a mysterious princess navigate the visual tricks of herenvironment. While Monument Valley is definitely the most polished of this newbreed of puzzle games, it is ultimately also the easiest.Indie games often skate by on rudimentary visuals, but not MonumentValley. Each level sprawls out before the player like a minimalist movieposter, and features its own vibrant color palette and creative flourishes. MonumentValley's surreal towers and castles are adorned in networks of interweavingpaths and stairways, which players manipulate with switches and levers thattransform the landscape in interesting ways. Towers rotate, staircases unfold,and passageways shift to reveal a path forward. In every level, I paused toadmire how gorgeous Monument Valley is, demonstrating an indie game doesn'tneed a 16-bit art style to be aesthetically appealing.While Monument Valley's puzzles are visually clever, they don'ttake much brain power to figure out. Your path through the beautiful landscapesis often obvious, with only a few slides or rotations of environmental objects standingin the way of your goal. That said, Ustwo does a good job of constantlyintroducing new mechanics, so even though the puzzles are simple, they arerarely repetitive. Elements like path-blocking crows and a totem that can beslid around to reach new areas don't really make the puzzles more challenging,but they change things up just enough to keep players engaged.The biggest head-scratcher is the obtuse narrative. MonumentValley seems like it's trying to tell a meaningful story, but the symbolism isso vague it's hard to tell what the developer is trying to convey. Players controla princess who appears to be returning geometric shapes to some ancient monuments;beyond that the story is open to interpretation, and doesn't give the playermuch to go on.I often commend developers for not padding out their gameswith filler content, but Monument Valley is one case where I was left wantingmore. The game only features ten levels, with the first few serving to introducethe basic gameplay mechanics. Only the final levels hit a satisfying length andcomplexity, and then the game is over. That shouldn't detract indie fans frompartaking in Monument Valley's wondrous journey, however, which has alreadylanded on my short list for mobile game of the year.", "date": "Apr 07, 2014", "grade": "8"}
