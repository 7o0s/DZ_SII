This is the essence of Oxenfree. The complex relationships of ragtagteens mixed with supernatural elements reminds me of scary movies from the'80s, but Oxenfree also tries to be a narrative game that reacts to yourdecisions. It is a dialogue-heavy experience, and a lot of its success dependson that. The character interactions are the best part of the journey, but likea lot of games that delve into choice, the results of your decisions aren'talways satisfying. Oxenfree follows a group of unlikely companions on an islandfor a night of partying. It was supposed to be a huge rager, but only fivepeople show up and they all have strained relationships. You play as Alex, whois dealing with accepting her new stepbrother, Jonas (who she brings along).You also encounter the resident mean girl, her quieter sidekick, and thehappy-go-lucky best friend. Seeing these characters grapple with complex andrelatable issues is a highlight; you may think you have their archetypespegged, but the characters' family and romantic lives come to the forefront anddemonstrate that not everyone is so easily classified. While this is definitely a coming-of-age tale, it's just asmuch as a ghost story. The group accidentally opens a rift, causing spirits toinfringe on their weekend of fun. Getting off the island becomes the priority,and your interactions are all framed by that goal. This means you spend a lotof time exploring, but I like how it feels like a performance. The stage andscenes are set, but you choose your lines and actions. As Alex, you selectdifferent dialogue options that pop up frequently, but you can also interactwith the environment how you choose. For instance, in one scene by a campfireon the beach, you can stoke the fire, sit by it, throw rocks in the water, andmore. These small actions don't impact the plot at all, but they help set themood and give you a sense of control. I enjoyed the freedom of acting out thesescenes according to my interpretation of Alex.The most important aspect of the gameplay is choosing Alex'sresponses. Unlike most peripheral actions, your dialogue can alter the game andchange your relationships, what information you learn, and how your endingturns out. The story keeps trucking along, and doesn't stop to let you knowyour next words are about to have a big impact on the game. That's one of themain problems in Oxenfree: You never know when you're making an importantchoice or just selecting dialogue to keep Alex a participant in the story,which can have some unintended consequences.Your different selections factor into some branching paths,and I was excited to see the outcome of my actions - until I got to the end anddidn't understand how I arrived at the outcomes. I'm a fan of unpredictablechoices and things not always turning out how you expect, but something feelsfundamentally wrong when players think they're influencing events in onedirection, and the exact opposite happens instead.At the very least, the dialogue choices are varied, almostalways giving you something interesting to say - and that's a big feat for agame with this much communication. Conversations tackle a slew of decisions,like choosing between different characters to talk to and assist. You havelimited time to make your selections, so you're discouraged from agonizing overthe ~correct~ option. Also, whileOxenfree tackles some serious issues, it has a great sense of humor withmemorable lines. The dialogue comes off as authentic and genuine, providingsome of the best exchanges I've encountered.Outside of these main beats, you use a radio to conversewith the spirit world and navigate the island by climbing and jumping throughits wooded areas. The gameplay is more like performing the motions and focusingon the discussions at hand. However, a lot of scenes and expectations areturned on their head when Night School Studio taps into the spiritual world andits impact on the characters; these are the most creative and thrillingsequences in Oxenfree. Still, as a longtime fan of spooky movies, I felt the actualplot and explanation for the weird occurrences could have been more cohesive. To Oxenfree's credit, it kept me engaged the whole waythrough. Iconstantly wanted to see where it was going and where my choices would lead.Night School Studio clearly wasn't afraid to experiment and try some differentand interesting things with presentation in regards to a narrative-based,choice-driven game. As much as I loved parts of the overall experience, otherslet me down. Even so, I enjoyed learning about these characters and seeing themgrow through my actions.", "date": "Jan 15, 2016", "grade": "7.75"}
