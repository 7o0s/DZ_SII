Holding true tothis series' heritage, it has no sympathy for the player, delivering apunishing difficulty in all of its challenges. The ~Game Over~ screen can comewithin seconds of play, but the push to top a friend's score on theleaderboards makes it one of most rewarding bragging rights games around.Dimensions expands this series' thrills in a multitude ofways, the most prominent and successful being the adoption of multi-dimensionallevel designs. Most of the stages are three-dimensional constructs, like cubes, spheres, and cylinders, that the player can freely navigate. Since the playercan't see what types of enemies are spawning on the dark sides of a cube, thesestages add difficulty to the mix, creating blind spots and numerous battlesurfaces that must be cleared. Most of these stages push theplayer to deploy different tactics, whether it's more conservative attackpatterns for the smaller cube surfaces, or different companion ships and powersto better handle the blind spawns.Unfortunately, not all of the punishing aspects of the newdimensional play are welcome in this experience. In the game's version of Adventuremode, which offers a variety of level-based challenges similar to the Wii game,Geometry Wars: Galaxies, players are pushed to score well and survive longenough to earn stars that unlock boss battles. Given how difficult the stages areto begin with - many rank as the toughest in the series - blocking playerprogression with this star system is an odd choice. Yes, pushing players to goback and play the same levels over and over again extends the length ofAdventure mode, but it also means repeating stages that are notfavored or may be too challenging.The difficulty (and the pursuit of stars) ramps up the mostin the boss battles, a first for this series. The idea of taking on a giantenemy ship may sound awesome in concept for Geometry Wars, but they are more strenuous than fun, especially whenattempting to net two- or three-star rankings, which is likely need to unlockthe final stages. The bosses are all designed the same, too, as giant, shielded entities that must be dealt with as enemy waves protect it. With onlyone life to work with, the player's focus is split between attacking the vesseland collecting enough multipliers from the smaller fighters to achieve higherscores. Yes, these battles can be thrilling at times, but I found them to bemaddening for star-collecting purposes. With the player's attention having to beapplied to the boss in timed sequences, these stages also lose that smooth Geometry Wars flow, andare a bit more chaotic in play.Adventure mode, for all of its structural problems, is also home tosome of my favorite stages in Geometry Wars history, such as a wonderful10-minute Retro Evolved marathon, and a spherical onslaught against giant,exploding versions of the typical enemy types. I also love the new Snipermissions, which push the player to excel with a finite number of bullets.Another nice touch is the leveling up system, in whichexperience points are rewarded through play, and cashed in to upgrade theship's capabilities, and purchase powerful weapons for its tiny companionvessel. The homing missile upgrade is a little overpowered, but it is fun touse when maneuvering spaces are limited. Being able to switch to magnetism isanother helpful way of upping the multiplier for tougher, single-life stages.A short cooperative-based campaign is offered for up tofour-players, but it is balanced for the larger group, making it overlydifficult for just two players to achieve high scores, or even stand a chanceagainst the final boss. Plenty of hours of excitement are packed into the game's multitude of modes, but I have a feeling most people will sink their time into the classic Retro Evolved mode, which is fantasticin this installment.Developer Lucid Games has a firm handle on Geometry Wars' twin stick action, but sometimes struggles to put it to good use. Thestar-based progression system is a head-scratcher of a decision, as it likelyblocks the majority of players, and is strictly there to give skilled players areal run for their money.", "date": "Dec 06, 2014", "grade": "8"}
