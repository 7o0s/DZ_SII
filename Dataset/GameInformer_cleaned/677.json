It bringstwo Atlus RPG series - Persona and Etrian Odyssey - together in an unexpectedway, and each benefits from the strengths of the other.  Thought Etrian Odysseyhad uninteresting characters? The Persona 3 and 4 casts add the personalitythat's been missing from the punishing dungeon crawler. Did you want Persona'sbattle system to be more rewarding? The harrowing dungeons and new tweaks tocombat keep you on your toes. Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth has creativityand challenge around every corner, making it a stellar crossover.Persona is fantastic at characterization, and Persona Qcapitalizes on that when the casts of Persona 3 and 4 meet. The journey entailsfighting through dungeons to discover why these two groups, along with two newamnesiac characters, have ended up together. The highlight is seeing how thecasts of the two games interact, and of course, witnessing your favoritepersonalities again. Yes, Kanji still tries to act like a tough guy, but it'seven more fun seeing him charmed by the adorable dog, Koromaru. Plenty ofcallbacks are present throughout Persona Q, and the charisma of the two groupskeeps dungeon treks interesting. As with the Etrian Odyssey games, this first-person dungeoncrawler still has you mapping out areas with your stylus, a throwback toold-school RPGs like Wizardry. This requires a patient touch, as you must lookevery which way to make sure you've marked things, like doors and walls,correctly, or else you have to retrace every step. Some people might find thistedious, but there's something thrilling about emerging victorious afterfinding your own way through a dangerous area. The Etrian Odyssey series has always provided a satisfyingchallenge, but it's struggled with a few things, such as uninterestinglabyrinths. After themed dungeons spiced things up in Persona 4, this gamecaptivates with even more creative dungeons. All have fun and unique themes,like Alice in Wonderland, Japanese horror, and romance. These themes areincorporated in several clever ways; for instance, in the haunted labyrinth,the FOEs (mini-bosses) are terrifying babies who lunge at you, and you seefootsteps, blood dripping, and hands hanging down from above.Persona's focus on exploiting weaknesses returns in theturn-based combat, but it has some new wrinkles. Should you land a critical orhit a weak point, you get a boost, allowing that character to act first nextturn and reducing the move cost to zero SP or HP. This plays into your strategy, but it alsomeans you're not constantly leaving the dungeon to heal up. Persona fusion alsobecomes even more vital, as most characters can be equipped with a sub-personathat provides additional special moves and more HP and SP. You're creating newPersonas for more than one character, which keeps you hooked on the fun fusionsystem, getting to test out more Personas than ever before.Boss battles can be intense affairs, but they also havetheir own creative spins. For instance, I battled with a priest-like creature,who vowed that I couldn't use a certain attack or item. If I did, I would beseverely punished by having a bunch of stat penalties and ailments unleashed onmy disobedient character. As the difficulty escalates, expect instant deathattacks and the need to constantly improve your Persona to survive. I lovedconstantly adjusting my strategy; I never felt safe, so I never took any turnsfor granted. Getting through dungeons isn't about merely surviving, butalso requires smart thinking. Sometimes this includes solving switch puzzles,other times it's about reading cryptic clues to find your next move. Many ofthese, especially those in later dungeons, give you so little to work with thatI imagine many people will have to consult a guide. At the very least, if youceaselessly wander without a solution, some characters will provide clues oreven offer to solve them for you. I wish you had the option to turn off orreduce encounters while you figure them out, as it's distracting getting throwninto battles as you try to piece things together. My only other complaint is alittle too much reliance on backtracking, but it's never too daunting. The reward loop is also well done. Like Etrian Odyssey, youcollect items from defeating monsters and then sell them to the shop to unlockbetter items. Tackling a deadly FOE is even more satisfying, since you also geta higher-level Persona than you're able to fuse. Side quests hold a similarlure as you often receive a great deal of experience and quality items. They'realso varied and often provide additional story. One had me facing off againstElizabeth from the Velvet Room, while another involved arranging a meet-up forJunpei with the Persona 4 girls to hilarious results. Persona Q is easily one of my favorite games this year. It delivers in both quality gameplay andwonderful characters, but what stands out is the extra effort that went intoevery area, always raising the bar.", "date": "Nov 25, 2014", "grade": "9"}
