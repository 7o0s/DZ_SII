Kids games are often poorly designed, shoddilybuilt, and rushed to market before theyre ready. Theyre also cheap todevelop and dependable sellers, so publishers dont have much incentiveto reevaluate the status quo. Why mess with a successful formula?Fortunately,Disney Interactive and Avalanche Software have strayed away from thegenres quick and dirty inclinations with Toy Story 3 after realizingthat such an approach serves no one particularly well. Its bad for theaudience, and can only diminish a license as cherished as Pixars ToyStory.The bulk of Toy Story 3 is divided into two modes. Thefirst is standard fare for licensed games, taking key scenes from themovie and transforming them into levels. A Toy Story 2-inspired sectionstarts with Buzz Lightyear showing off his rail-shooting prowess andplatform-hopping capabilities before letting him flex his brain withsome rudimentary puzzles. One of the later sections in the gamerequires quick switching between Buzz, Woody, and Jessie as they taptheir unique abilities to advance through a garbage dump and rescuetheir friends from a trash compactors gnashing metal teeth.Exploringthe levels and playing through the story is enjoyable enough, but thegame really takes off with a second player on board. Reiner and Iplayed through the game cooperatively, though at times we stretched thedefinition of the term. The game is designed so that skilled playerscan carry their partners through the experience, similar to howTravellers Tales approaches co-op in its LEGO games. Players can alsoliterally carry their partners, opening the door to some hilariousmoments of sabotage. Its not unlike New Super Mario Bros. Wii, whereplayers can knock their friends into hazards or pick up their buddiesand chuck them directly into pits.Playing through the moviesstory is fun, but its not nearly the most interesting thing in ToyStory 3. The second mode, the toy box, lets you hop into a WoodysRoundup-themed zone and mess around in an open world. At first, theresnot a whole lot to do but smash barrels and pick up item-filledcapsules. After getting a few missions from Hamm, Slinky, Stinky Pete,and a few others, the world opens up. You can buy new buildings andplaysets from Als Toy Barn, some of which allow access to new areasand unique missions. After pouring a few hours into the town, I haddeveloped a bustling little community filled with customizable people,buildings, and plenty of tasks on my to-do list. One moment I wascapturing escaped bandits and tossing them back into the jail. Thenext, I was tossing plastic paratroopers into the air and guiding themonto their targets.As with the story missions, the entirety oftoy box can be experienced with a friend in tow. Better still, playerscan act independently. Every once in a while Id glance over atReiners half of the screen and see him painting a building for amission or tossing renegade cows in a pen. Activities like racesrequire the two players to join up, but you can play through themajority of the mode doing your own thing should you desire.ToyStory 3 ultimately succeeds in the same way that Pixars films do its attractive to young people who get a great surface experience andfor older audiences who appreciate extra layers of depth. It also posesa challenge to those who are satisfied with churning out half-bakedlicensed games: You can do better, and the results of that effort areworth it.", "date": "Jun 29, 2010", "grade": "8"}
