Matts full-on next-generation title fell flat on its face, and developer Vicious Cycle decided to shave off a dimension and make a 2D side-scrolling shooter. Blood Bath and Beyonds return to basics proves to be a better fit for the wisecracking has-been, resulting in a clean and simple old school action game with only a few lose screws. Just be sure to bring a friend.Blood Bath and Beyonds goofy and entirely skippable plot involves Matts old nemesis, General Neutronov, traveling back in time and holding the heros younger, 8-bit self hostage. Matt then returns to the classic games of his past an attempt to track down the weasel-y Neutronov. The Hazard games of yesterday share striking similarities to some popular, recent titles such as Bioshock, Mirrors Edge, Team Fortress 2, and even a dash of Okami. Vivid and varied colors liven up each unique level as you paint the walls red with your machine gun. The eight side-scrolling worlds of Blood Bath and Beyond are a perfect fit for Vicious Cycles copious amounts of humorous video game nods.Wacky level design isnt the only homage here, as the gameplay of Contra has been ripped-off wholesale. Matt and on-again-off-again sidekick, Dexter Dare, scramble for familiar power-ups just like in Konamis classic shooter. Countless thick-headed enemies saturate the screen with bright, glowing projectiles that mercilessly tax your reflexes. Problem is, the games physics-based engine results in floaty platforming, botched jumps, and sluggish bullet-dodging. On anything but the Wussy difficulty (unlimited continues), prepare to shred through lives like popcorn. The game attempts to remedy this with an invincibility power rewarded for combo-kills, but youll be dying so much that youll forget it even exists.If you intend to play Blood Bath and Beyond single-player, you can knock at least one point off my score. Playing solo feels unbalanced, unfair, and downright not fun. Have a buddy suit up as Dexter, however, and you have a fine-tuned level of rewarding challenge. Strategically cooperating to take down the games humungous bosses gets better as the game progresses. The biggest gripe youll have with your co-op buddy is who gets the flamethrower.Matt Hazards downloadable excursion for the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade is custom-tailored for hardcore gamers with a thirst for challenge. This is a punishing shooter made for masochistic video game enthusiasts with a sense of humor and a thorough knowledge of gaming history. Matt Hazards debut missed the mark with gamers, and though this entry isnt a bulls-eye, his aim has gotten a lot better.", "date": "Jan 06, 2010", "grade": "7.75"}
