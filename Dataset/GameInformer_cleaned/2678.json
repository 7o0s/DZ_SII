{"name": "Infinite Space", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/infinite_space/b/nintendo_ds/archive/2010/03/15/review.aspx", "text": "Infinite Space is a game about adventuring through the galaxy, butits best parts have nothing to do with the things you associate with aspace opera. The story of a young boy assembling a rag-tag crew tofight evil and uncover his destiny is ordinary, and the combat systemdoes what it can to capture strategic starship battles. However, thegames depth and true spirit lie elsewhere.The heart of the gameis in ship creation and management. To build a ship you have to buyblueprints, but mixing and matching the modules is what ultimatelygives the ship its characteristics and what delivers the fun. Unlikemany upgrade systems, its not just a case of buying the best laserturret or shield generator at the shop. Every ship mod you add takes upspace on your ship. Moreover, mods come in different shapes and sizes,which means everything has to fit in the ships grid of boxes.Farfrom being frustrating, I loved the challenge of arranging mods and thestrategy in balancing the tradeoffs among them. I was also impressedwith the sheer amount of mods: mess halls, navigation bridges, radarrooms, crew cabins, security rooms, and much more can all be addedalong with your standard complement of weapons, shields, and engines.Given that you can cruise the galaxy with up to five ships at once, youcan build a whole fleet to your own specifications.If the modsdefine your ships, your crew optimizes them. There are 33 crewpositions, and while you dont have to have someone in every spot, acrew member gives you combat bonuses, and much of the games storyexploration is tied to recruiting new people. Unfortunately, scouringevery tavern in the galaxy for hired hands is part of what bogs downInfinite Space. On multiple occasions, I missed the chance to hire acrew member or skipped a plot point because I simply didnt go to aspecific tavern enough times, which is frustrating.Despite allthe preparations that you put into your fleet, the real-time combat isthe weak link because of the basic rock-paper-scissors gameplay (forboth ship-to-ship and melee combat) that doesnt hold up through allthe grinding and random encounters. Its not bad, but it doesntdeliver the payoff (and neither do the isolated multiplayer battles)after the time you spend on the more exciting ship building. I guessits true what they say: Its better to create than to destroy.", "date": "Mar 15, 2010", "grade": "8"}
