While gaming's premierassassin is more nimble than ever, his latest hit is far from perfect; evenwith your expectations set to ~episodic,~ Hitman's first content drop doesn't provideenough meat to keep you interested.To call the new Hitman episodic in the first place is disingenuous;IO Interactive didn't design the game to be episodic, and it doesn't have thesame sense of pacing or self-contained arc that an episodic game should have.Rather, this first episode feels like a demo for what could turn out to be avery good Hitman game, which IO Interactive has decided to start selling beforeit's done. That decision casts a dark cloud over 47's latest outing.Episode 1 starts with two prologue missions that takeplayers back to the first time 47 and his handler Diana Burnwood meet. A fewshort cutscenes reveal that Diana has chosen the emotionless killer to be heragent in the field against her superior's wishes, but 47 must complete two fauxassassinations with the odds unfairly stacked against him before he's clearedfor duty. This is about the only compelling story element in the episode, andthe two levels merely serve as a tutorial to walk you through the mechanics in smallenvironments mostly composed of plywood sets. Once you've completed themissions, you're free to experiment with alternative approaches, and to IO's credit, the developer has included a variety of creative kill options. As a whole, however,playing around in a miniature testing ground is a lackluster introduction towhat are usually grandiose, globe-trotting adventures.Once you've learned the ropes, you tackle the one main levelHitman launches with: a sprawling mansion in Paris that plays home to both a high-societyfashion show and a clandestine auction for illegal information taking place behindthe scenes. The level is beautifully detailed and massive in size, but this scalingup of the environment causes some problems for Hitman's classic formula; learningthe layout of the labyrinthine building and the patterns of enemies takesconsiderably longer than in previous games, as does finding specific items toincorporate into your elegant assassinations.IO helps counteract this problem with Hitman's newOpportunities, which track the elements needed to pull off the game's myriadsignature kills. The system is basically Hitman for Dummies, and even though theygo against the spirit of the series, these hints are somewhat of a necessaryevil. Not only do they cut down on blindly searching the environment, thesignature kills themselves are also more convoluted this time around. Inprevious Hitman games, pulling off a creative hit was a matter of setting up a deadlytrap and getting yourself into position. Now you often have to worry aboutmaneuvering the target into the right place as well; he or she may tread thesame endless loop in a level until you fulfill some hidden requirements to movethem along to a different location. Performing these secondary objectivesrequires more busy work of tracking down items, acquiring the right disguises,and avoiding eagle-eyed NPCs. Pulling off a deviously planned kill is still supremelysatisfying, but you have to put up with more trial-and-error than in previousinstallments.Replaying missions has always been a part of Hitman, butgiven the perplexing new release format, it's now the only part. Episode 1 onlycontains one actual story mission; once you complete the fairly straightforwarddouble assassination, your only motivation for replaying it is to find moretortuous ways to snuff out your targets. IO tries to supplement the experiencewith a host of extra challenges, but they all revolve around scouring theenvironment for items to pull off an assassination you've already completed (probablymore than a few times). Escalation mode epitomizes IO's new repeat-ad-nauseamapproach to the series: The new mode tasks you with carrying out the sameassassination five times in a row, with each repeated hit adding a single newobjective, like breaking into a safe or hiding the targets' bodies within 90seconds of taking them out. Only the fifth and final challenge adds somethingmeaningful to the formula, but it's still not worth the repetition.Confusingly, Escalation mode is only available for one of the training levels,and not the main Paris map.User-created Contracts are also back, including a dozen orso designed by IO. While these offer the novelty of tracking down a new targetin the giant sandbox the developer created, in practice they are just lesscreative missions with generic targets that offer no story or narrationwhatsoever. How much fun can you really get from killing a random character ina sea of other NPCs? Crafting your own contract also offers diminished returnsbecause signature kills and accidents don't register as criteria in yourcontract  you may take an hour meticulously setting up a contract in which youonly off your targets by drowning them in toilets (don't judge me), but whenthe player accepts your challenge, they can kill them in any way they seem fit.Hitman's gameplay mechanics provide a solid foundation forwhat could perhaps be the best game in the series. However, the new releaseformat assumes every player is the world's biggest Hitman fan, content to endlesslyreplay the same level while they wait patiently for the developer to finish thenext one. IO says the staggered release will give them extra time to polisheach subsequent level, but the Paris episode is launching with long load times,occasional framerate dips, and some wonky A.I. behavior  I even ran into a few glitchesthat crashed me out of the game. The short cutscenes that bookend the level dolittle to set up the overarching narrative, and would be forgettable even ifyou didn't have to wait a month for the next few minutes of story. This simplyisn't enough, even for devoted fans like me. I'm still optimistic that Hitmanwill end up being a good game, but you very well may have to wait for the fullbundle in January to play it.", "date": "Mar 10, 2016", "grade": "6"}
