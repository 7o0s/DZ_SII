The units in this tower-defense title are versatile and useful, enemies are diverse and deadly, and there are enough power-ups and options to keep things fresh. Best of all, levels don't seem to have a preset way to beat them, unlike many tower-defense games on the market. Some strategies may work better, but as long as you put some thought into your actions you're bound to do all right. Whether it's to improve your score ranking or to check out multiplayer, Ninjatown will pull you back again and again.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
