Populated with self-importanthedonists and self-improvement gurus, the luxuriously wealthy andstartlingly poor, vanity plate liberals and border-patrollingconservatives, the region captures an impressive number of Americanidiosyncrasies. Californian essayist Joan Didion perhaps described itbest as ~a place in which a boom mentalityand a sense of Chekhovian loss meet in uneasy suspension.~That suspension serves as the perfect backdrop for the threeanti-heroes of Grand Theft Auto V. Retiredbank robber Michael drinks his days away secluded from hisdysfunctional family, reminiscing about his glory days by watchingold action flicks in his luxurious estate. On the other side of thetracks, young hustler Franklin scrapes by, repossessing cars whilelooking to escape his dead-end neighborhood. The third miscreant,Trevor, is most at home drinking and fighting in the trailer parkoutskirts.With the loquaciousness of Justified'sBoyd Crowder and the volatility of Trainspotting'sBegbie, this maniac acts implicitly off impulse, often to hilariousand destructive results.Afterevents join these disparate personalities in an uneasy alliance, thethree navigate the criminal underbelly of Los Santos, performingunsavory tasks for corrupt officials, Mexican cartel leaders, whitecollar swindlers, and, most importantly, themselves. When they aren'tbickering, the trio pulls off increasingly daring heists.Openworld games are often weighed down by ~errand boy syndrome,~tasking players with menial jobs that seem beneath the ability of theprotagonists or outside the cause of the narrative. While Grand TheftAuto V still has its share of blue-collar work (like towing cars forFranklin's crackhead friend), the majority of the tasks feel moreimportant because you can often see the direct benefit. For example,running weapons across Los Santos may increase the amount of moneythe airfield you purchased generates. This also applies to the heistsserving as the game's centerpiece. Before you can rob the jewelrystore, you must case the joint to identify vulnerabilities, hijack apest control van that provides your crew with cover, buy some masksto conceal your identities, steal a gas canister to deploy throughthe vents, and procure getaway vehicles.I didn't mind running these errands because I knew the payoff potential.Beforeattempting the big-time heists, you are given the choice of twoapproaches. The first typically involves an Oceans 11 degreeof cunning, stealth, and deception, while the alternative frequentlyinvolves a dosage of lead normally reserved for world wars. Beforeyou act, you also must pick your crew; hiring a cheap, young hackermay cost you valuable time to acquire the jewelry, but if you pickthe experienced guy he demands a bigger cut.Oncethe heists begin, the signature innovation driving Grand Theft Auto Vtakes center stage. During these missions you can instantly switchbetween each of the three characters. Rockstar often uses thismechanic to avoid the hassle of relocating to meet another wave ofenemies, imploring you to switch via a blinking icon and noticeablesound effect to keep youin the thick of the action. The transitions occur smoothly, and thespeed at which you swap characters is impressive.Thediversity of the heists and other missions is also worthy of praise.During my time in Los Santos, Iscuba dived into a scientific research center to steal a chemicalweapon, infiltrated a burning government agency building posing as afirefighter to steal a hard drive, and fought though a five-starwanted level with military grade weapons.Should you falter during these high-octane scenarios, theforgiving checkpoint system (a much needed improvement over GrandTheft Auto IV) preserves your forward progress rather than forcingyou to start missions from scratch.Thetrio has distinct lives outside of these jobs, which includesseparate friends, properties, bank accounts, and problems. Takingthis approach allowed Rockstar to craft unique content for each,which keeps the side missions fresh. You can alternate between theperspectives of Michael, Franklin, or Trevor at will, and Rockstaruses this as an opportunity to surface unique gameplay opportunities.Jump to Trevor and you may find him passed out drunk on a hill nearbya hunting mission. Switch back to Michael later and he may be playingtennis with his wife or heading to an appointment with hispsychiatrist.Givingthe player so much insight into the inner workings of the threeprotagonists provides great mission diversity, but it also createsthe biggest crack in the story. Given what we have witnessed from oneparticular main character, hisreaction to one of the major plot reveals seems extremely out of linewith his personality. This happens early on and hangs like analbatross around the neck of the narrative for the majority of thegame. The choose your own adventure ending (you have three options)also fails to deliver on the tension promised by this setup.Whilethe plot doesn't live up to the high standards set by Red DeadRedemption and GTA IV, the design surpasses every previous Rockstargame. Grand Theft Auto V melds together the expansive open world ofits Western, the vehicle control and customization of Midnight Club:Los Angeles, the shooting mechanics of Max Payne 3, and Rockstar'ssignature sense of humor to create its most well rounded game todate.Thosewho complained about boat-like vehicle controls in previous gamesshould be placated with the refinements Grand Theft Auto V delivers.Cars have a proper sense of weight, while retaining the agilitynecessary for navigating through traffic at high speeds. The damagemodels are also drastically improved, with more variance to thescrapes and dents you collect careening down the highways like amadman.Thetargeting and cover systems also should win over holdouts who decriedthe gunplay of GTA IV. Rockstar offers three different aimingmechanics - the classic GTA snap-to shooting, aim assist, and freeaim for those who prefer more autonomy. If you struggle with liningup shots with the default micro reticle, you can choose a larger onein the settings. I found the shooting to be competent inmedium-to-long range shootouts; the only time I got into trouble waswhen being flanked up close. Aiming with the left trigger slows downyour reticle movement, which can make it tough to address enemiespinching from the sides.Thecritical mission path offers roughly 25 hours of gameplay, but youcan spend an even greater amount of time exploring the vast openworld. Whether you are in downtown Los Santos or the sprawling SanAndreas countryside, you always have a diverse array of activities atyour disposal. While in town you can shop for new clothing, get atattoo, catch a flick at the movie theater, or base jump offskyscrapers. Outside the city limits, you can search underwatershipwrecks for lost treasure off the coast of Los Santos, huntanimals in the wilderness, play darts in a dive bar, or participatein one of the many race varieties. I also spent a considerable amountof time betting on the stock market; paying attention to characterchatter can land you a huge payday. That money won't spend long inyour bank account; every time I had a significant amount of cash Iwent on a shopping spree, scooping up businesses, buying newvehicles, and customizing cars.GrandTheft Auto V has the lofty expectations of living up to the pedigreeof its critically acclaimed predecessors. Rockstar Games deservescredit for pushing the boundaries of its flagship franchise yet againwith improved controls, great mission variety, and the mostjam-packed open world I've ever visited. The narrative fails tomatch the impact of John Marston or Niko Bellic's tales, but thecolorful characters kept me interested in the story nonetheless. Likethe golden state it parodies, Grand Theft Auto V is filled withbeautiful scenery, a wealth of activities, and the promise offortune.", "date": "Sep 16, 2013", "grade": "9.75"}
