Within moments ofloading into each puzzle in Snipperclips, I was able to understand what myultimate objective was. Cutting your player character down to either match aparticular shape or form a tool needed to achieve a solution is gratifying fromthe moment you hear the clipping sound, but it's this simplicity that makesSnipperclips an enjoyable puzzler from start to finish.To find the solutions, players stack, rotate, and even cutchunks out of cute paper characters to progress. You might have access to asfew as two or as many as four characters depending on the mode, but they alwayspossess the same abilities and form regardless of the puzzle. Almost everypuzzle revolves around playing with your characters' geometry in clever ways.For example, one puzzle features a threaded nut in the middle of the stage thatneeds to be turned to lower an out-of-reach object. To achieve this, I had touse one of my characters to cut a hole the size of the nut through the othercharacter's midsection, then have that character position itself like a wrencharound a nut and rotate to lower the object down.Goals like delivering heart containers to a specificlocation, herding stubborn fireflies in bug-catchers, and transporting fishfrom a pond to an aquarium are scattered through both World, a mode that can beplayed solo or with one co-op partner, and Party, the game's 2-to-4-playerco-op mode. Though your objectives are usually clear from the start, the pathsto achieving them rarely are. ~Get the ball into the hoop~ is immediatelyunderstandable, but the characters can't jump high enough to dunk the ball in.I probably could have timed my characters' jumps to be able to whack the ballinto the hoop, but instead I cut a ball-sized scoop out of one character, stackedthat character on top of the other, and did the equivalent of a jump-shot. I don'tknow if that was the intended solution, but that's what I like so much aboutthe puzzles of Snipperclips: They give you the freedom to solve the puzzle yourown way.World mode challenges you to solve 45 puzzles spread acrossthree themed worlds. The puzzle concepts rarely repeat themselves, but whenthey do, they add extra wrinkles to make you change your strategy. When thebasketball puzzle returns later in World mode, it has a heavy bowling ballinstead of a basketball, so the jump-shot no longer works. Even with theseadded twists, the level of difficulty never felt like it was too much or thatit expanded beyond the scope of the addicting, simple gameplay.Playing Snipperclips cooperatively adds to the fun, but alsocreates havoc within the puzzles that can sometimes be detrimental to yourprogress. Despite this, more times than not, a mistake that set us back was metwith laughter from all players rather than outright frustration. Throughout theentire co-op Party mode's 21 distinct puzzles, my fellow players and I neverfelt overwhelmed or defeated.However, coordinating with your teammate when the puzzlerequires precision is challenging, and such a level of coordination accentuatesshortcomings of the controls. Playing multiplayer can demonstrate that themovement controls can be a little too touchy for the precision some puzzles askof players - a problem that is further brought to light by the small individualJoy-Cons of the Switch that need to be used to play in multiplayer. Luckily,that issue doesn't present itself outside of a few select puzzles.Snipperclips' suite of offerings is rounded out by amultiplayer mode called Blitz. This minigame mode lets you challenge yourfriends to basketball, air hockey, and even a deathmatch mode called Dojo whereyou try and clip the other players into nothingness until they run out of lives.While a basketball game can descend into chaos quickly once everyone realizesyou can clip players out of existence during the struggle to get the ball inthe hoop, hockey and Dojo offer heated fun with four people. I enjoyed theseminigame modes, but with the setup and ruleset staying the same each time youplay it, Blitz mode acts as little more than a simple diversion.Snipperclips is at its best when you bring your friendstogether, but I also enjoyed playing through a large collection of the puzzlesby myself. Fun, clever, and overflowing with charm, Snipperclips is adelightful experience no matter how you play.", "date": "Mar 10, 2017", "grade": "8.25"}
