In a slightly more abstract sense, its about flyingoff to see new sights and escaping to new experiences. Video gamesarent that different. Youre still on the edge of your seat, drivingby the seat of your pants, only youre far more safe from danger thanyou would be if you were actually strapped into a 400-mph death trap.You also want to feel like all that driving is taking you somewhere.TheForza series progression of rewards has always been one of its strongsuits. The driver and car XP levels see to this. Win a couple races andnot only does your driver get a new car, but shops give you a discounton parts. Add in the fact that the credit system is generous (evenafter you subtract some for repairs to offset the damage to your car),and Forza avoids becoming a grind like other sim racers. Turn 10Studios also redid its menu system to make everything more visuallyinviting, and added a calendar to keep track of the racing events.These tweaks are small changes that greatly help the games pacing andshow a vast improvement from Forza 2. One tiny criticism I haveregarding the calendar system, however, is that the trio of events thegame suggests for you arent your only options. To see everything youhave at your disposal, you must back out of the season play menu andhit up the events list to check out all the races available. Ingeneral, youll go through your usual mix of multi-race series,manufacturer- or spec-specific events, drag races, and some killermarathons courtesy of Le Mans and Nrburgring. Needless to say aboutthe Forza series, the driving is still tight.The games calendarand progression system make the game very inviting, but I think thegame misses a little by being  in some ways  too easy. Whats thepoint of rating races and cars by their performance level if there arenumerous times that you can race a superior car in a lower event for aneasy win? The automatic upgrades are great, but take away from actuallybuying those parts. Remember the cool discounts you won frommanufacturers? I never went into a parts store because it was allautomatically done for me. Its hard to scoff at the accessibility, butin a sense, is the game working against itself? Add in the fact thatrewinds are unlimited (I wish they were limited or you got fewercredits for using them), and Forza 3 trades letting you see everythingit has to offer for a payoff that doesnt feel as big.I ate upeverything Forza 3 had to offer. I raced hard through the streets ofItalys coastal town Amalfi, taking in the games gorgeous sights andpushing the laws of physics around every tight turn. I spent lots oftime in the garage adding layer upon layer to my cars custom graphicswith the games easy-to-use tools. At the end of it all, however, Ididnt feel like I was light years ahead of any other game in the Forzaseries. Forza 3 redefines the franchise, but it definitely didnt takeme to anywhere I hadnt already been before.", "date": "Oct 27, 2009", "grade": "8.5"}
