If the first entry worshipped at the altar of Resident Evil 4, then The Evil Within 2 is polytheistic, borrowing more from several other games to introduce new scares into its mix. Though it finds a successful middle ground between horror and shooter, it doesnt elevate itself above its inspirations, which makes for an enjoyable, if not unique, trek through a demented world.Three years after the events of The Evil Within, Sebastian Castellanos is traumatized his journey into STEM, a nightmare-inducing device that amalgamates the consciousness of everyone who enters it. During a late-night bender at a bar, hes told his deceased wife and daughter are still alive, but he has to dive back into STEM to save them. The plot has its moments as reality becomes upended and characters grapple with the idea that they may not make it out STEM alive. Events are easier to follow this time around, though, as in many horror films, you can see when logic goes out the window in favor of creating specific scenarios.During the first few hours, sneaking is almost mandatory, since combat is brutally difficult. You may be lucky to get one bullet for every few enemies as you make your way between checkpoints. Enemies also behave erratically and are quick enough to keep up, which means even stealth isnt a foolproof approach. These are welcome curveballs to make sure players dont get too comfortable; as soon as youve figured out the patterns of one enemy, you start seeing new enemies that throw a wrench in your strategy.When you decide to expend your precious ammo, the shootingfeels sluggish and unwieldy until you spend resources to steady your aim.Horror purists might say thats key to building the tension the genre relieson, but lining up a headshot only to watch my bullet whizz by an enemy becauseI hadnt accounted for where Sebastians trembling hands would sway isnt tense its aggravating.You eventually find more weapons, ammo, and healing itemsthan you know what to do with, and a basic crafting system lets you turn foundcomponents into ammo. However, The Evil Within 2 doesnt make the turn fromhorror to action until much later, and I enjoyed the prolonged tension of thinkingabout my ammo and health in the long term. Even weak enemies can overwhelm you,and since you can only upgrade your ammo limit by finding hidden pouches, I wasalways counting rounds. I cursed the loss of every wasted bullet, but Iappreciate that my actions carried weight, and that I was rewarded for takingmy time to sneak up on enemies, scouring the environment for resources, andcontemplating how Id upgrade my skills and guns.Only in the last few hours did I feel I couldhandle whatever twisted monster the game would throw at me next, and I feltlike I had earned that feeling. As it focuses more on barreling through bespokeencounters instead wading through large expanses, The Evil Within 2 goes fromplodding to intense. However, even as the combat and stealth became moresatisfying and the speed picked up, I never escaped the nagging feeling that Iwas going through the motions instead of wondering what new environment ortwist Id see next.Although most of your time includes running from one narrowcorridor to the next, The Evil Within 2 also has expansive, hub-like areaslittered with enemies, supplies, and a few side quests. Although the sidequests are worth tackling (one quest that initially felt like a drain led to aconsistent source of supplies) youre more likely to lose resources early on asenemies decimate you in groups. These sandbox areas are a bold step to expandthe scope of the series but feel less focused, since sneaking by the sameenemies multiple times between objectives damages the momentum.The open-ended segments funnel into tighter, more curatedlevels, which feature a surprising amount of visual variety. Although most ofthis includes horror staples like abandoned mansions, dungeons, and variouskinds of facilities, you get a few refreshing and impressive worlds with a moresurreal flair. You never stay in one of these spaces for long, which helpsstave off the sense that this is your hundredth time through a spookyunderground laboratory.These linear segments are also where you see the mosthomages to other games, such as a chapter dedicated to exploring the psyche ofa murderous artist similar to BioShocks Sander Cohen, or an otherworldlystealth sequence reminiscent of Batman: Arkham Asylums Scarecrow levels. Thesesegments are well-executed, but few of them are surprising. They dont twistthe source material enough, making them feel more like rip-offs than homages. Mostof the boss fights are similarly run-of-the-mill, never eliciting fear or forcingyou to devise unique tactics; you lay into them with your shotgun. Seeing agroup of regular enemies scared me more than meeting a boss.The Evil Within 2 is a solid horror game that expands thescope of the series to extend out of the shadow of a titan in the horror genre,even if it sometimes leans heavily on borrowed ideas. Its progression anddifficulty curve create a satisfying loop that repays resourcefulness andstrategy, but its set pieces and structure dont build enough on the many ideasthey borrow to make them feel new or interesting. The result is a ride thatoffers some fun thrills in the moment, but I dont think Ill lose too muchsleep over these particular nightmares.", "date": "Oct 12, 2017", "grade": "7.75"}
