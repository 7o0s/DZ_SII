It lists two-player co-op, monster control, and Crash's signature fighting style as the game's standout features. These elements are certainly present, but they take a back seat to the real feature set: unpredictable framerates, extensive backtracking, and the guarantee of one death caused by faulty camera positioning for every platforming segment. These inexcusable qualities corrupt the entire experience. Thanks to the shoddy camerawork, co-op is mostly unplayable. With the framerate fluctuating like a yo-yo, it's nearly impossible to find a rhythm in the platforming and combat. Getting a new monster should be a joyous affair, but its acquisition usually leads to a lengthy hike through a previously conquered area. From design to execution, this is a mess of a game, and a new low point for the once-loved marsupial.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
