As core members ofthe Darksiders team at Vigil Games, they paid tribute to Nintendo's beloved TheLegend of Zelda series. Now, with a new studio (and help from a well-fundedKickstarter), the team at Airship Syndicate is displaying their adoration foranother legendary gaming franchise: Final Fantasy. Nightwar is a gorgeousturn-based RPG with clever battle mechanics, but if you want to survive thisadventure, you have to work for it.Nightwar is technically a spinoff of the WildStorm/Image Comics series Battle Chasers from the late '90s, but you wouldn't know that by playing the game. It quickly introduces thecharacters and lays out their backstories in an opening text crawl, then it'soff to the races to tell an uninspired story about a necromancer's pervertedmission to raise an undead army. As a fan of the comics, I got a kick out ofseeing these characters back in action and hearing them voiced for the firsttime. Even so, the core characters are not well-developed over the course ofthe story, which left me feeling unattached to my party and their interactions.The story didn't grab me, but the battle system did. Similar to games like Final Fantasy X, Nightwar features a designated turn order, so you can plan out each battle in advance. Regular attacks might be relatively weak, but they happen immediately. On the other hand, abilities burn mana and require a casting timeso your selected ability might not trigger until after an enemy's attack. Thissystem requires a little extra planning, but the tension of trying to knock outan enemy or heal a party member before your foes' turns is thrilling. On top ofall this, each party member has unique skills and abilities, and many of themdeliver bonus damage depending on the buffs applied by other heroes' abilities.I loved experimenting with this team synergy and chaining together differentsets of abilities as I calculated the optimal damage output.Managingthe mana pool for each hero adds an additional layer of sophistication tocombat. Heroes earn overcharge each time they perform a normal attack, and thisovercharge acts as disposable mana that disappears at the end of each battle.The longer a battle drags on, the more resources you tend to have for morepowerful attacks, which encouraged me to experiment with my teams' full suiteof attacks.Nightwar'scombat system is incredibly rich, but these turn-based encounters begin to feelrote thanks to the massive grinding required to overcome each dungeon's boss. Amassive difficultly spike accompanies each transition from one story dungeon tothe next, and my characters often had to level up several times before thatchallenge evened back out. Nightwar's limited handful of side missions only exacerbatesthis problem, because you quickly run out of fresh content and are forced togrind through the same battles repeatedly for extra experience.Lootdrops could have mitigated the frustration of replaying old content, butNightwar's reward system is also unbalanced. The biggest problem with Nighwar'sloot is how sparse it is; dungeon treasure chests and monster drops are few andfar between. You can replay old dungeons on harder difficulties for the chanceto receive legendary gear, but unless you replay a dungeon you just completed,these drops are often worthless because they are so far below your level. Evenwhen I tackled harder dungeons, I was still rewarded with equipment I didn'twant. After spending more than an hour replaying one of the hardest dungeons, Ionly walked away with one sword for a hero I hadn't touched since the beginningof the game.Thebalancing problems create an uneven play experience, which is disappointingconsidering the good things this stylish RPG has to offer. Airship Syndicate'sgorgeous art design and fluid animations are a wonder to watch, and Nightwar'sovercharge ability system offers a layer of strategy that is often missing fromturn-based RPGs. Overcoming Nightwar's most challenging battles is a thrill, butonly if you're willing to put your nose to the grindstone.", "date": "Oct 02, 2017", "grade": "7.75"}
