The people you meet either want to fight you or give you free stuff, and both kinds of people chase you down the moment you cross their line of sight. Its a bizarre world, but it is an inviting one, and time flies by as you get absorbed.Pokmon games get two color-themed releases, and then a third a few months later named after another hue. I assumed that Pokmon Gray was the logical follow up to Black and White, but we were all surprised when Nintendo and Game Freak announce a direct sequel. Despite the number 2 that appears after the title, these games feel more like the Gray we expected.You take on the role of a new trainer who sets off on his or her own journey two years after the events of Black and White. You cross paths with characters from the original, as well as the villainous Team Plasma, but for the most part this is a separate story rather than a continuation. It hits all those saccharine notes of friendship and fighting for whats right without anyone ever being in real danger  everyone makes their Pokmon fight all of their battles for them, after all. The story introduces you to all kinds of different trainers with distinct looks and personalities, something I have always appreciated in the Pokmon games. Even if they only have a sentence or two to say, I was always interested.Like Black and White, the world is 3D with 2D elements, battles are fully animated, and you occasionally have up to three Pokmon battling at once. There are a number of aesthetic changes to the sequel, including redesigned gyms and characters to account for the two-year storyline gap. All of the impressive online trading and battle features also made the transition. These are all great features that work well with the Pokmon formula, but none of them have expanded in a tangible way for the sequel.Movie-making sequences are among the new additions, and they involve a slowed down battle where the player has to input combat commands in a certain order. After completing the fight, you can head over to the theater and watch the finished product. So you battle slowly, and then re-watch the battle you just fought in normal speed. As one of the few brand new elements of the sequel, this mode could have helped set the experience apart. Instead, it offers so little that it may as well have been cut. Thankfully, players can skip it entirely and pretend it isnt there.Nintendo and Game Freak dont introduce any new Pokmon this time around, another strange choice for a supposed sequel. A few classic Pokmon roam the world of Unova, though. I openly chalk it up to nostalgia, but when I see Pokmon like Psyduck or Rattata show up in the field, I get excited. Not many of the recent Pokmon inspire the same emotion. Tepig (my choice of starter), Purrloin, Drilbur, and Minccino (who rivals Pikachu in cute factor), all have simple designs that are clearly based in the real world, but most lack the elegant simplicity of Pokmon of the past in favor of being bizarre and slightly terrifying.This latest entry benefits from the long line of previous releases that have iterated on and perfected the original Pokmon games that released in 1998. Its still incredibly addicting to catch em all, and seeing your Pokmon evolve is one of the most rewarding forms of leveling up in any RPG. So many little things make these games fun that its tempting to forgive their stubborn opposition to experimentation, but the lack of innovation is disappointing. I know that is a common complaint about Pokmon these days, but it has been earned through years of Nintendo and Game Freak sticking to the same formula. Black and White Version 2 has a title that is usually reserved for sequels that adds new features and expand the experience, but it doesn't live up to that promise.Black or White?Black Version 2 and White Version 2 are sold separately, and are largely the same game. The main difference comes down to certain Pokmon being more common or only being available in one game or another. For example, you can only catch Mr. Mime in White, while Beedrill is exclusive to Black. Also, each title has its own specific version of the legendary Pokmon Kyurem.", "date": "Sep 30, 2012", "grade": "7.5"}
