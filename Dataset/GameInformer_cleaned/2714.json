P.B. Winterbottomcomes from a simpler time, where cartoonish capers and a diabolicalmoustache were all one needed to become a pinnacle of infamy.Winterbottom lives in an age when pie thievery is a deplorable offense,and insults like buttwit are the height of vicious wordplay. WhileThe Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom draws its antiquated antiheroand silent film aesthetic from a bygone era, the game doesnt feelremotely outdated. On the contrary, its devious puzzle design,entertaining writing, and striking artistic style earn Winterbottom itsplace as one of the best downloadable titles since Braid and CastleCrashers.Players control P.B. Winterbottom, a notorious piethief who has obtained the ability to manipulate time to create clonesof himself. Fitting in with the old-timey movie theme, youll recordyour actions, generating a P.B. doppelganger who performs the recordedsequence in an endless loop. This concept is at the core of everypuzzle, governing P.B. and his temporal copies as they filch piesacross the games five levels. It sounds simple, but when youremanaging several clones in a multi-pie gambit, things get delightfullytricky.Once you master the basics, the game switches things upby adding a fresh set of conditions or restrictions. Sometimes P.B.needs to nab pies in a specific order. Sometimes only your clones cancollect pies. Sometimes your clones are evil and kill you on contact.These twists on the formula arent just to make things complicated; byperiodically changing the rules, developer The Odd Gentlemen hasensured that you arent just reusing the same tricks on an escalatingscale. The variety makes every puzzle feel like a unique hurdle, makingthe experience satisfying without feeling bloated.SinceWinterbottom is a 2D puzzle game involving time, it invites comparisonsto Jonathan Blow's hit downloadable title, Braid. However close they may sound in concept,dont make the mistake of assuming Winterbottom is just Braid in adifferent skin. It has its own clear identity, forged not only bydistinctive puzzles but also by the charming writing delivered viainterstitial poems and hints at the bottom of the screen (whichquickly devolve into blatant antagonism). Complementing the quirkylanguage is a stylized black-and-white Victorian setting. The union ofthe two is ultimately what makes the whole silent movie motif cometogether so successfully.While I had a great time working my waythrough Winterbottoms bizarre world, as I neared the end, each successwas met with a mixture of satisfaction and disappointment. Mostscenarios are clever and fun to solve, but the puzzle design never getsa chance to bare its fangs. Im not saying the game is easy; thechallenges still require plenty of brain bending. However, the gamenever throws down the gauntlet with any you expect me to do what?situations that push the mechanics to their limit. This left some ofthe final scenes unsatisfying  though they are cool in other ways Iwont spoil.The entire quest will probably take most gamersbetween three and four hours to complete, which could be an issue forsome people. If youre one of them, I encourage you to stop whining.The greatness of a game isnt decided by length. The Misadventures ofP.B. Winterbottom impresses with its puzzle design, offbeat humor, andsheer style. Hopefully P.B. has more hijinks in his future, because Ialready miss the ol buttwit.", "date": "Feb 16, 2010", "grade": "8.5"}
