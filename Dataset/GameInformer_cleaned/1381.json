WRC 3FIA World Rally Championship focuses solely on rally racing. While this game'sattention is not divided and it covers the expected bases, it also falls shortof being a definitive experience.WRC'3 nominal career mode makes you mainly compete inspecial stage, super special stage, and multistage rally races to move up theranks, upgrade your car, and unlock more events. None of the races or theoverall structure are dramatically different from what you've experiencedbefore, although I did like the Gate Contest events. Here you must breakthrough green blocks on the track (and avoid the red ones) as their color isrevealed at the last second.Despite the uninspired nature of the career format, Italiandeveloper Milestone was wise to change up the racing surfaces you encounter aswell as the car you use from race to race (a mix of classic and current rallycars). While this may be disorientating during the first few turns in your newcar, it at least highlights their differences and how you must approach drivingthem (particularly as you upgrade their parts), as well as the precise throttleand brake inputs required in order to put down a good time. That said, thedriving experience is not perfect. There are times when the cars feel like theyswivel on a pivot, and contact with objects on the side of the road can produceexaggerated accidents.If you don't feel like marching through the lengthy careermode, you can also jump into an official WRC Championship season or take yourtalents online. While the latter offers the majority of the race types of thesingle-player (you can also post your best times when playing by yourself) thematchmaking seems flawed in that it puts players who have played wildly varyingamounts of matches together. All in all, online play is perfectly sufficient  a characteristic that describes the rest of the game.It's commendable that WRC 3 aims to give a full rallyexperience  complete with the need to repair cars between stages -andnot dilute it with other forms of off-road racing. Despite this commitment tothe sport and the fact that the game has some fun moments, its middlingexecution only goes so far.", "date": "Mar 29, 2013", "grade": "7.75"}
