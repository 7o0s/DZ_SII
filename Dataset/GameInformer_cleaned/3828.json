The Fall of Oriath expansion adds six acts to the games campaign (for a total of 10, not including the end-game epilogue), stuffs monster pockets with new items and loot, and fundamentally tweaks the games difficulty and progression path. And, nearly four years after the base game officially debuted on PC, its finally available on Xbox One. Grinding Gear Games has methodically finessed PoE since release, and players who drop into this dark fantasy world for the first time will reap the benefits.If youre new to the game, getting settled can take a little while. On its surface, its a straight-up Diablo clone, with the same presentation, environments, and overall flow that creates an immediate sense of familiarity. While it certainly shares foundational elements from Blizzards series, Grinding Gear Games veered into a different direction. Or, more accurately, a whole lot of different directions. One of the things I like most about PoE is the sheer number of gameplay systems and microloops that are available at any given time. The most notable (and perhaps notorious) of them is the games massive skill tree. Its an intricate web that all character classes share, giving you the ability to slowly devote points into becoming a powerful archetypical hero or dabbling around to develop a hybrid that fits your own personal playstyle. Unlike a game like Diablo III, where you can mix and match abilities to create new character builds whenever you feel like it, PoE is moredeliberate.My first build was a zookeeper-style witch, which is a style of play that I usually enjoy. I squeaked through the campaign thanks, in large part, to her skeleton army. The Xbox Ones controller generally works well, and I was able to hang back and accurately fire off potshots while enemies were distracted by my minions. Casting spells that require precise placement was a bit trickier. Using an on-screen cursor to drop them into place is a clunky process that requires holding down a trigger and then the corresponding skill button. Life comes at you fast in PoE, especially when youre a glass cannon, and an analog stick is no match for a mouse in some circumstances.Since characters share the same skill tree and have access to the same large pool of weapons, skills, and other items, I was concerned my next character would feel too similar. Thankfully, that wasnt the case. My marauder is a melee maniac who sprints into enemy clusters and swings his axes until theres nothing left to swing at. He feels completely different from my witch, which was exactly what I was hopingfor. PoE has a lot of content to wade through in the lengthy campaign, which has more than doubled with the new expansion. While you keep a shared inventory stash between characters, your new heroes will have to play through the campaign again. The Fall of Oriath expansion removed the games previous loop of playing through the campaign multiple times at increasing difficulty levels, which is an improvement. The overall story is fine, but considering how much variety the games randomly generated maps offer, I would have loved for my second character to have access to something similar to Diablo IIIs adventure mode. There is a loose analog in PoEs end-game atlas content, but thats reserved for high-levelcharacters. PoE is a free-to-play game, which means that there are microtransactions. Fortunately, theyre handled well. Aside from the ability to buy new character slots and add inventory space (which is, by default, generous), everything else is cosmetic. You can pay for spell effects, so that you hurl flaming skulls instead of fireballs, as well as a vast array of costume elements, pets, and weapon skins. Most importantly, the games economy a huge part of the experience is completely divorced from any for-pay elements. Instead, players buy and sell items using crafting items and other raredrops. Ive been having a great time with PoE, and its fast become my go-to when I need to get in a rewarding grind. The Xbox One version may be a little late to the party, but it was absolutely worth the wait. This fantastic game takes the best of the genre and propels them to impressive new heights.", "date": "Sep 20, 2017", "grade": "9.5"}
