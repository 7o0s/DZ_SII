Is itenough to just explore a wondrous setting? Fantasy Life has charm, but it'smore about its ambiance than what you actually do. The art style is strikingand the music whimsical, but soon you're scrolling through mounds of boringtext - or worse - completing fetch quests on repeat. I enjoyed Fantasy Life forthe first few hours, but it showed its hand too early, never offering anything newor exciting. Fantasy Life feels like an amalgamation of a grindy MMO anda simulation game like Rune Factory. You start a life in a new land and yourfirst task is to choose from a widespread selection of classes, such as amercenary, angler, or cook. The classes don't change the course of the mainstory, but they do determine the side activities available. All my challengesfor the mercenary class revolved around slaying monsters or collectingbounties. Satisfaction comes from building up your stats, finding new gear toalter your avatar, and unlocking new features, such as pets and the ability toride a tortoise. However, the progression loop is small and little skill isrequired to complete the monotonous tasks laid before you. You can swap classes at all times and not lose progress,however, which is great because of the aforementioned lack of variety. Cookswill always have tasks regulated to making new dishes, so switching to combatis refreshing. Fetch quests are also littered throughout each land, which awardcash to spend on gear, house items, plots of land, and pets. All of this iswrapped in a lousy story mode that lasts around 12 hours.The narrative is run-of-the-mill: the shell of the world iscrumbling and you must collect relics and wishes to save it. Every long,drawn-out conversation is stuffed in a horrendous story structure. To unlockthe next sequence, you're often backtracking from one location to the next. Throwin characters that lack personality and every boring conversation is just goingthrough the motions. To add insult to injury, after you polish off the story,you don't have much left to do aside from the class challenges, fetch quests,and a multiplayer mode that lets you play through the tedium with friends. Every action taken is rote, the bosses arepushovers, the dungeons are barren, and nothing is complex enough to evoke anysort of emotion. Fantasy Life is the gaming equivalent of lukewarm oatmeal. I never found myself excitedly strategizing to maximize my profit, enticed by the superficial upgrades, or challenged by the simplistic action combat.A tantalizing world can only do so much whenwhat it holds isn't that exciting. Fantasy Life starts off enjoyable, but itnosedives quickly, leaving you with an experience disconnected from thepotential of the world and its inhabitants.", "date": "Oct 22, 2014", "grade": "6"}
