The wildly colorful visuals and retro/sci-fi soundtrackimmediately establish a world like no other, grabbing you and refusing to letgo. Like a digital pied piper, Furi brought a steady stream of intriguedcoworkers to my desk to watch over my shoulder while I played. Once they got asense of the gameplay, however, they didn't stick around long. While Furi hassome substance behind its style, the unforgiving difficulty takes its toll.Furi pits an unnamed, silentprotagonist up against 10 bosses in a bid to escape from a surreal, sci-fiprison. In between the one-on-one battles, players watch the prisoner slowlywalk through lush, dreamlike landscapes for far too long. A mysterious figurein a demented rabbit costume spouts a stream of exposition during thewalkabouts while sprinkling in details about the next fight. I would have lovedto explore these strange worlds, but with linear paths and no points ofinteraction, they function as little more than glorified cutscenes. Furi isprimarily about boss fights and nothing else.With such a singular focus, Furilives and dies by its combat, and you can expect to do a whole lot more dyingthan living. Plenty of games revel in their own difficulty, but Furi pushes the~git gud~ concept beyond the breaking point. Elements from the twin-stickshooter, hack-and-slash, and fighting genres are mashed into a singleFrankenstein's monster. While the core mechanics are tight, the blisteringspeed of combat and duration of the fights are sure to test your patience asmuch as your skill.Most of Furi's boss fightscontain between four and six stages, serving up a gauntlet of attack patternsthat must be figured out through trial and error. Whittling down a boss'shealth bar only to have them spring back to full health is never fun; having ithappen five times in a single fight robbed me of any sense of satisfaction fromthe eventual, hard-fought victory. This isn't simply a matter of skill, sincefiguring out when bosses are invincible, when they instantly dodge or counter,and when certain attacks are useless requires rote memorization. You get threeattempts to pass each stage, but many boss attacks take huge chunks off of yourhealth bar, so you can expect numerous restarts as you try to reach the laterstages.I enjoy challenging gameslike Super Meat Boy and Dark Souls. Even so, I was baffled by Furi's defaultdifficulty. The developer does a good job of layering in new mechanics andwrinkles for each fight, but when the difficulty is ratcheted up as high as itis, it just feels like you're discovering new ways to get kicked in the groin. Evenmore perplexing is Furi's only easier setting, which renders most of the fightsridiculously simple and brief, allowing you to breeze through the campaign  afact the game warns you about before choosing it. Including more difficultyoptions would have given more players a chance to appreciate the responsivecombat, but even if the challenge were to hit the sweet spot, I'd still be leftwanting more.Much of my disappointmentcomes from Furi's success in creating such intriguing landscapes, andsubsequent failure to do anything engaging with them. While the story is mostlybluster, later encounters introduce some much-needed nuance and muddy your rolein the narrative. I'm sure some masochistic players will enjoy bashing theirhead against Furi's towering wall of difficulty, but with little else to go on,I was questioning my reason for fighting long before the protagonist started to.", "date": "Jul 14, 2016", "grade": "6"}
