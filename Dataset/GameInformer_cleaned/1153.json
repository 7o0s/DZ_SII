After a yearof development, the indie game's release leaves much of the promising pitch onthe cutting-room floor. While the art style lives up to expectations and thenarrative contains plenty of mystery (too much, actually), playing Knock-Knock simplyisn't much fun.In the same way that B-movie horror films try to mask theirlow production values with tongue-in-cheek campiness, Ice-Pick Lodge explainsaway Knock-Knock's half-baked game design and barebones narrative with a bizarrebit of meta-game fiction. An opening message warns players that Knock-Knockisn't a ~game~ per se, but rather an ~interactive meditation~ that thedeveloper pieced together based on instructions from an anonymous benefactor. Themessage also warns that the game's ~many strange things and unclear moments~are (conveniently) due to those mysterious design requirements. While Ice-PickLodge's explanation of the game's flaws and limitations is certainly novel, it doesn'tearn the developer a pass for failing to balance the gameplay, flesh out themechanics with some much-needed variety, or craft a meaningful narrative.Knock-Knock's gameplay is dreadfully simple. As thepajama-clad protagonist, your task is to shuffle around an increasingly complexseries of randomly generated houses, opening doors and flipping on and offlight switches to check for monsters as you wait for dawn to arrive. Monstersspawn randomly in certain rooms during the night, requiring you to either hidebehind furniture or move to other areas of the house. If one catches you, moretime is added to the countdown, taking you further away from dawn. Get caught toomany times, and you'll have to replay the level.If Knock-Knock sounds like an interesting twist on thetower-defense genre, it isn't. While you spend your nights patrolling the house,you aren't actually increasing your defenses, as your actions have nodiscernible or repeatable effect on where or when monsters spawn. You alsodon't have any offensive or defensive capabilities, so there's not much you cando other than continue creeping through rooms and hoping that a shadowy specterdoesn't spawn nearby (or directly on top of you, as is sometimes the case).It doesn't take long for more flaws in the formula to emerge.Waiting ends up being the main mechanic, and although you can find clocks thatspeed up time by scanning rooms, they often lead to running into more monsters,limiting their usefulness. Most of the levels aren't big enough to offer alternateroutes for avoiding enemies, which often pop up so quickly that your sluggishprotagonist doesn't have time to hide or escape anyway. Some monsters can spotyou even when you're hiding, leaving you with no other option but to run away usually right into a dead end.The futility of your actions is underscored by a smatteringof infuriating outdoor sequences, which task you with wandering through thewoods until you meet whatever random (and unexplained, naturally) criteria isrequired for progressing to the next level. Maybe the player is meant to usethese segments as an opportunity to meditate on the purposefully obscure storythat the game barfs at you via note scraps and the garbled gibberish of theprotagonist, but I didn't find them challenging, engaging, or remotely frightening.That's true of the main levels as well; aside from a fewjumps caused by loud noises and flashes of lightning, Knock-Knock is rarelyscary. Some of the monster designs are creepy looking, but they disappear assoon as they touch you  half the time I never even saw what attacked me.Without any kind of meaningful setup or room for strategy, Knock-Knock's horrorelements fall flat. I just found myself hoping the level would randomly spawnmore clocks than monsters, and frustrated when it didn't.Knock-Knock offers players two different endings based onhow quickly they finish the game, neither of which provides any kind ofsatisfying conclusion or explanation as to what the heck is going on in thegame. Ultimately, Ice-Pick Lodge is right; Knock-Knock isn't much of a game or a story, for that matter  which makes it hard to recommend.", "date": "Oct 09, 2013", "grade": "5"}
