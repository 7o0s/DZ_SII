A samurai-infused 2D action game from the makers of the exceptional Odin Sphere, Muramasa is a visual masterpiece with the potential to appeal directly to the Wiis hardcore base. But simply wanting to like Muramasa isnt enough; it also needs to hold up its end of the bargain as a piece of entertainment a feat it manages onlysporadically. No one can deny that the game is beautiful. The vibrant backgrounds, hulking bosses, and flashy combat make Muramasa a treat to behold. I definitely took a little extra damage because I was staring at the gorgeous art instead of paying attention to my enemies. A little more context behind the characters and their breathtaking surroundings would have been nice, but narrative clearly isnt a priority. Instead of getting a story, youll traverse the Japanese countryside, encountering random ambushes by various ninjas and mythical beasts. Combat is where Muramasas sharpened blade truly shines. Movement is quick, controls are responsive, and the intense action puts your reflexes to the test. Mid-air clashes over the rooftops and effortless dashes through enemies give combat an exhilarating kinetic vibe. Unfortunately, most encounters dont last more than a minute or two, forcing you to sheathe your blade just when youre warming up. As much as I enjoyed the battles, the system doesnt get deeper or evolve. The moves you perform during the tutorial are the same ones youll use against the final boss, save for your sword-specific special moves. You never get the sensation of becoming more powerful as you progress; the swords you forge grow stronger, but so do the enemies, so nothing really changes. In a particularly lame decision, the two playable characters even control identically. Apart from the disappointing ramp-up, Muramasas other major issue is backtracking. Certain s words essentially act as colored keycards, breaking down previously impenetrable barriers often in areas youve long since beaten. This means you need to take an uneventful run back, fighting weak enemies along the way. The process serves no purpose other than artificially extending the game and snuffing out your enthusiasm in transit. Even in the face of some structural missteps, Muramasa is a visually stunning game that is entertaining in the heat of battle though that heat eventually cools down due to short and shallow encounters. Without better pacing and a lot more depth, Muramasa isnt fit to run with the top-tier action titles.", "date": "Sep 27, 2009", "grade": "7.75"}
