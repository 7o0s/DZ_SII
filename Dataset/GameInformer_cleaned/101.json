With WWE 2K17, however, developer Yukes decided to subtract instead of add. Rather than bolster a bloated feature set, WWE 2K17 ditches the popular Showcase mode in favor of polishing existing systems. But while the core combat has improved over last years entry, Yukes grappling skills still arent strong enough to make anyone other than hardcore WWE fans take notice.Most of WWE 2K17s combat improvements are incremental. Wrestlers still dish out the same basic attack combos, still have the same stamina management system, and still use the same pin/kickout mechanics. However, reversals now feature a larger timing window, which makes it easier to take control of a match. Taunts give you mid-match buffs that are a great way to catch your breath while your opponent is down. You can also perform post-match run-ins to interrupt a wrestlers victory celebration, which is great for fueling new rivalries. And for the first time in years, you can take the action into the crowd and into backstage areas. I loved throwing my opponent through AV trunks and finding other interactive objects to smash over their head. None of the tweaks to 2K17s action are game-changing, but theyre all welcome.Unfortunately, 2K17s incremental improvements only help expose the greater flaws in Yukes wrestling series. The in-ring action is as sluggish and plodding as ever. These WWE superstars move like rigid action figures, which tends to drain most of the tension from each match. While 2K17s reversal windows are widened, the reversal cues are still disconnected from character animations, so the only thing clueing you into a reversal opportunity is a button prompt that appears over your wrestlers head.Many matches feel like drudgery as your opponents almost always kick out of your first pin. You often have to build up and use your finishing move at least once or twice before getting a three count. Conversely, if youre really bad at WWEs timed button minigames, your opponent could count you out even when your characters health is in the green. Even when youre completely overpowering your opponents, 2K17s action feels like a battle of attrition rather than the exuberant display of athletic prowess that fans have come to love about WWE.Its a shame WWE 2K17s core mechanics are such a grind, because most of the content surrounding the in-ring action is sure to please wresting fans. The creation suite  which lets you create your own wrestlers, championships, and arenas, among other things  is as deep as ever. MyCareer mode simulates your created wrestlers journey from the performance center through NXT and a string of championship belts to the WWE Hall of Fame. This experience is repetitive, but it is so deep that it allows you to create your own promos and manage your merchandise sales. Meanwhile, the WWE Universe mode is basically a manager mode that lets you organize WWE shows, plant rivalries, and build championship dynasties. You can even see how you stack up against other players online in a variety of exhibition matches, and I experienced almost no lag while duking it out with real opponents. All of these modes are meaty, but the Showcase mode, which let you relive some of yesteryears most glorious smack downs, was always the most polished and presentation-heavy mode. Its absence is sorely felt.After previous publisher THQ folded and 2K took over this series with WWE 2K14, I had hoped the WWE games would see a slow crawl out of mediocrity, and that wrestling fans would eventually have a wresting game they could be proud to show non-wrestling fans. Unfortunately, the 2K series has carried forward with the same by-the-numbers combat weve seen for years. 2Ks next WWE game doesnt need to check off a list of incremental improvements  it needs a complete overhaul.", "date": "Oct 14, 2016", "grade": "5.75"}
