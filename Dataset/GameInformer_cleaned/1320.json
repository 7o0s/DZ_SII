On one hand, you're outwittingenemies by creating mazes with a variety of towers that damage them. On theother hand, the variety of enemy types brings chaos, forcing you react on thefly. Planning gets you ahead, but making choices in the heat of the moment isjust as important. This dichotomy makes Sanctum 2 some of the most fun I've hadwith a tower defense game in a long time. Sanctum 2 forces tactical thought at every turn. It startswith tower placement, which helps prevent the enemy from breaking through tothe core you're defending. With each level and wave, you have a certain amountof towers to place. These tower mazes prolong enemies' trek to your core, whilespecial towers damage the monsters; slow-firing lightning towers, quick Gatlingturrets, and mine-producing towers are all part of your arsenal. Each of theseis effective against a different type of enemy, so you must choose your loadoutwisely. While you can see the different enemies appearing in eachwave, the short time between waves forces you to rapidly execute a plan ofaction, intensifying the challenge. A big part of Sanctum 2's fun comes fromdiscovering new ways to stall enemies' path to the core with labyrinths, orplacing deadly combinations of attacking towers and watching the enemies falllike dominos. I loved crafting paths and the resource management aspect testedmy mind constantly, keeping my head in the game. Once enemies start appearing the field, the towers controlthemselves and you must use the only other resource at your fingertips: guns.Each of the four selectable characters comes with a unique advantage and guntype. Playing stages - even if they end in failure - levels you up, unlockingmore guns, towers, and perks. Character perks provide an edge, like giving you40 percent more damage to enemy weak spots or healing your core after everyround. The gunplay is smooth, and deciding where to focus your firepower becomesjust as important as tower placement. For instance, some of the larger enemieshave high HP, and draining them before they get to the core is essentialbecause your towers alone just aren't enough for the job.The campaign can be conquered in single-player or via onlineco-op. Both have strengths and weaknesses. I had the most fun playing with agroup, especially in the late waves when complete pandemonium hits and theenemy spawning seems endless. The intensity of the fight is so much greaterwith others by your side. Levels are easier to take down with a group, but coordinatingtower placement with others is more difficult. It becomes a free-for-all as towho picks up the resources for towers. If one person in the party isn't on thesame page and takes the towers, it can cost the team victory. Sanctum 2 does a lot right, but it does make small missteps.Sometimes I would get stuck in the environment and struggle to get free. Andwhile it's extremely accessible, sometimes finding the perfect strategyrequires too much trial-and-error. Tower placement often dictates success, evenif you're an expert gunner. In levels with 10 or more waves, a single mistakewith your towers in wave 5 can cost you everything. Sanctum 2 is definitely forthose who love experimenting and can handle a loss, as long as it teaches alesson. I didn't mind learning from my mistakes, but it can be tough when you haveto see some of the same levels several times while correcting the error of yourways. Sanctum 2 shines brightest when it's forcing you to thinkand consider all the options it places in front of you, from tower choice towhich enemies to gun down to what perks are the most advantageous. Being testedon and off the battlefield with my decisions kept me constantly picking mybrain. For those who enjoy tapping into new creative ways for victory, Sanctum2 doesn't disappoint.The EdgeUnsurprisingly, Sanctum 2 looks and controls best on the PC, plus the requirements are incredibly low. It also supports the Xbox Gamepad if you prefer dual sticks.", "date": "May 16, 2013", "grade": "8.5"}
