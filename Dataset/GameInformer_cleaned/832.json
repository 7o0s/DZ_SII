The Sniper Elite series has made a name for itself by embracingthese skull-busting kills in all their gory detail. Developer Rebellion hasratcheted up the brutality of these slow-motion X-ray sequences with detailedmusculature on every skeleton. Unfortunately, boring campaign missions andfrequent bugs hold back Sniper Elite III from its sharpshooting potential. Rebellion swaps out the grim, bombed-out Europeancities of the previous entry with the bright, rugged terrain of Africa. Thearid, sun-bleached environments look beautiful at first, but despite the exoticsurroundings, the mountainous terrain and dirt roads all start to feel the sameafter a while. The illusion dissolves further thanks to the erratic, dim-wittedNazis mucking up the scenery. The German soldiers have stiff, robotic patrolroutes and swivel in place unrealistically when they get a bead on you. Sniper Elite III's linear campaign is all aboutsneaking through Nazi encampments among the baking sands (but they're nevercalled Nazis and all the swastikas have inexplicably become palm trees on theirbanners). Sometimes missions call for you to place explosive charges, offer supportingfire, or assassinate top-ranking German officers. It's old hat for the militaryshooter genre, and I eventually began mindlessly chasing down objective markerswithout thinking much about it.The campaign objectives all serve as a framework forthe solid long-range gunplay and mediocre stealth elements. Lining up shotswith your rifle adheres to the familiar routine of pressing a button to holdyour breath and dial in a shot. As in Sniper Elite V2, lining up a good shotand pressing the trigger initiates a satisfying slow-motion kill sequence. Thecamera follows your bullet's dramatic path from the rifle barrel all the way tothe doomed soldier. For headshots, the X-ray vision shows the projectile'sgrisly path through the skull, complete with bone-splintering entrance and exitwounds. Femurs split, eyeballs pop, and testicles explode in these gruesomefinishers. These macabre, unflinching executions are satisfying at first, butthe thrill wears off after seeing someone's teeth erupt from their mouths forthe umpteenth time.For a game with the word ~sniper~ in the title, Iused my silenced pistol an awful lot. You crumple quickly when facing off withtoo many enemies, so avoiding attention is important. This strategy is at oddswith using a loud sniper rifle, however, so you mask your noise using thunderor backfiring generators. This mechanic is fun and novel, but I routinely avoidedsniping when these obscuring noises weren't available. You can't fire off morethan a couple shots without having to relocate so enemies don't find you. Iunderstand the logic, but you can still run away from your sniping perch andthen just head back when the enemies lose your trail. It comes off as anannoying, half-baked attempt to keep players circulating around the map.Speaking of annoyances, Sniper Elite III is filledwith considerably more bugs than its predecessor. The game has a weird habit ofresetting objects in the world when loading a save. Sometimes vehicles thatblew up 20 minutes ago explode again or corpses wiggle around sporadically.Other times the effects are more troublesome, like one instance when an enemyvehicle suddenly appeared near my location and gunned me down instantly witheach load. While most of the hiccups are aesthetic, they disrupt the mood of thehigh stakes trek behind enemy lines.Whether you beat or abandon single-player,competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes are available. I enjoyed thetense, long-distance free-for-all sniper battles that tested my patience andperception. Laying down traps and relocating after taking a shot is moregratifying when facing off against human players rather than the idiotic A.I. foes.The entire campaign is also playable cooperatively, which helps spice up themundane missions. Synchronizing your shots and covering one another's back injectsexcitement into the ho-hum mission structure. However, Rebellion has ditchedsplit-screen co-op and doesn't support matchmaking, so hopefully you knowsomeone with a copy of the game if you want to try it out.I openly admit that I love gory kills and living thehero sniper fantasy, but Sniper Elite III only partially delivers on the latter.If you can't get enough of dramatic, transparent shots of enemies gettingshredded by sniper fire, Sniper Elite III has you covered in spades. If you're interestedin more motivation beyond the glory of the kill, look elsewhere.This review only pertains to the PlayStation 4 and PC versions of the game. Sniper Elite 3 is also available on Xbox One, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.", "date": "Jul 01, 2014", "grade": "6.5"}
