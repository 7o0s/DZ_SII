Action is around every cornerin this rail shooter, and the game retains its winning formula unapologetic RE fan service augmenting uncomplicated arcade play. Whetheryoull enjoy Darkside Chronicles more than its predecessor ultimatelycomes down to personal taste. Instead of a string of definitivegameplay improvements, Capcom and Cavia have made many trade-offs. I ama big fan of the newly introduced sub-screen, which allows for weaponconfiguration and the deliberate use of recovery items, but would haveloved to see the nunchuk-enabled camera control stick. I like thestreamlined reticule sans ammo indicator, but wish the simpletwo-button grenade lob hadnt been left for dead. The shaky camera addsa level of authenticity, but makes it notably harder to pull offheadshots.Gameplay refinements aside, Chronicles excels atreimagining and abridging past Resident Evil games. Darkside followsthe events of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil Code: Veronica, whileadding an all-new South American mission. Starring Leon Kennedy andJack Krauser, the new campaign fleshes out the events leading up toResident Evil 4 and feels right at home in the world of Umbrellasunleashed horrors.While seeing fan-favorite Leon Kennedy in anew adventure will be the largest draw for some, others will revel thechance to have him work in tandem with Claire during the Resident Evil2 set piece  my personal favorite of the three. Here Capcom did afantastic job of reworking key plot points of both Claire and Leonsplaythroughs, making the single integrated campaign feel fresh andfamiliar. The result is a comprehensive look at the entire RE 2narrative, albeit a condensed one. The same can be said for the CodeVeronica adaptation, where the scenarios are adjusted to facilitate acooperative experience. It feels natural for Claire and Steve to worktogether against the omnipresent Alfred Ashford. When you factor inadditional appearances by Albert Wesker, Ada Wong, and Chris Redfield,you get a game steeped to the bone in classic Resident Evil lore.Allthree episodes are comprehensive, resulting in a surprisingly longgame. Even on the default difficulty setting, this is compounded by thechallenge offered by bottlenecks of infected creatures and bosses.Expect to die a few times, especially if playing alone  something Idont recommend as single-player feels unbalanced. Darkside Chroniclesis obviously optimized for teamwork, but even a pair of reticles cantstop a few frustrating cheap shots. These troublesome sections are theonly times the on-rails gameplay feels restrictive  but at least thesave points are forgiving.Collectables provide a strongincentive to keep picking up the controller. Shooting environmentalobjects yields Umbrella tokens and gold. Once a chapter is complete,tokens unlock archives  character and enemy bios, movies, and evenjournals and diaries unchanged from their original debut. Gold can beused to upgrade weaponry for your next adventure.Being on railsand having a handgun with infinite ammo at your disposal negates thefear associated with tank-like controls and limited resources from theearly Resident Evil games, so real scares are few and far between.Quick turns of the camera try to catch you off guard, but I wouldntcall Darkside Chronicles scary. Intense seems to be a more accuratedescriptor, especially when describing the numerous back-to-back bossfights.Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles acts as afantastic primer for those who started with the more action-centricResident Evil iterations, while simultaneously providing fan serviceand fun for dedicated followers. Novices and veterans alike would bedoing themselves a disservice by passing up this game.", "date": "Nov 17, 2009", "grade": "8"}
