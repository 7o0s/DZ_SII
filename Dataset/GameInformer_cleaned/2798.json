Combining two ofgamings legendary characters with the worlds most famous sportingevent translated into worldwide sales of over 10 million copies forSega and Nintendo last time around, so a sequel was virtuallyguaranteed. Two years later, the duo is back and looking for morefilthy lucre at the Vancouver Winter Games.I had a good idea ofwhat I was in for before I even popped the disc into the Wii. The gamefeatures 27 events, a good number on paper, but one thats somewhatmisleading. Many of the events like alpine skiing or snowboarding dont feel particularly different from each other unless you use theWii Balance Board functionality,a feature that doesnt warrant thetime it takes get the Wii to sense the peripheral.Some events arebetter than others, with the more race-oriented events like skeleton,skiing, and snowboarding usually reaching a level of acceptablegameplay. That said, the skiing isnt as good as it was in Wii Ski, andthe snowboarding as good as in Shaun White Snowboarding: Road Trip, sothere isnt a lot of benefit here to anyone but the most ardent Marioand Sonic fans. The other events range from fairly entertaining (dreamgliding and dream snowball fight) to annoying (hockey, speed skating).Before you ask What the heck is dream gliding?  let me explain. No,you didnt miss it in the last Olympics, its a hang-gliding style gamethat takes place in a weird, Mario-and-Sonic themed aerial environment.The developers have added a few odd events like this, which are fairlyfun but distance the game even further from its Olympic origins. Thegame also features challenge matches with rivals like a giant robot orJet, a Sonic character that looks like a Hedgehog with a beak.Apparently, he exists, and is really good at speed skating (at least Ilearned something in writing this review). These annoying matches areidentical to the regular events, being distinguished only by the factthat you have to beat them to proceed to the merciful end of the game.Is it more fun with friends? Perhaps, in the sense that misery lovescompany. Id knock the game for not having online multiplayer if Iactually thought anyone would bother to play it. In general, theminigames work about as well as Wii games always do: just enough toprevent me from calling them broken. For all Nintendos claims that theWii was going to empower developers with brave new mechanics, thereality is that were already to the stage where motion control schemesseem just as clichd as any console two-stick FPS formula but withoutthe accuracy necessary to convey compelling gameplay. Functional butnot fun, Mario & Sonic at the Winter Olympic Games is a productthats destined to sell...and destined to be forgotten.", "date": "on Nov 10, 2009", "grade": "5.5"}
