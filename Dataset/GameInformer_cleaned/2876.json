It does, however,present a good handheld version of the series fundamentals. Thebig new feature in Arctic Edge is customized rides, but since thevehicles are already balanced by their class, these customizations arepurely cosmetic. That being said, I was impressed with the optionsavailable, which reminded me of games like Pure or the MX vs. ATVseries in that youre changing the color and style of all kinds ofparts, like sprockets, suspensions, and lights. Theres even a handyrandomize feature.These parts are awarded after races for a jobwell done, and the game also offers 50 in-game badges. These prizes,however, feel hollow after youve just completed another cookie-cutterrace. Developer Bigbig Studios maps replicate the franchises classicstyle, with long courses, a contrast of high and low paths that suitdifferent vehicle classes, and shortcuts. Arctic Edge introducescollapsible bridges and avalanches (initiated by the bigger vehicles),but these additions are not enough to take the game to that next level.If anything, I was surprised at how much I didnt notice them. Thesteady diet of the same basic race type didnt do anything to spicethis game up either.Arctic Edge looks good for MotorStormsfirst appearance on the PSP, but gone are the days when I can beimpressed with simply squeezing down a console title intact onto ahandheld. Lets ask for more so we can get more.", "date": "Sep 30, 2009", "grade": "7"}
