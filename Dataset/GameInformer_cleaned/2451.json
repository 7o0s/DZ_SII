Costume Quest would have made a fantastic cartoon; I enjoyed the cute dialogue,charming art style, and quirky cast in the Halloween-themed adventure. Unfortunately,everything in the package that qualifies Costume Quest as a game falls short. With the trick-or-treat theme, kids-save-the-day plot, and abundant candy worship,I assumed that this downloadable game was aimed at attracting a young crowd. OnceI got a taste of the tedious combat, I had to question that assumption. The turn-basedbattles are far too simple for their own good; you just hit attack, and then followa brief button prompt to maximize damage (or wait to defend). You wont findany magic, healing items, or anything else that could add entertainment. The animationsfor the attacks can be funny at first, but youll get sick of them in no time.Youd think the simplicity would make combat more accessible, but insteadit becomes more difficult. All strategy and variety are stripped away, so all youcan do is hope that you succeed at the button prompts. If you fail a couple timesin row, youre screwed, and you cant do anything about it. Youllcollect a bunch of costumes with different special moves, but none of them fullyaddress this issue or the tediousness of the battle system in general.Its too bad that combat is such a prevalent part of Costume Quest, becausethe time you spend just exploring and talking to fellow trick-or-treaters can behilarious. The world is brought to life with a colorful art style that reminds meof a less deranged Tim Burton movie, and the dialogue has plenty of comedic gems.While advancing through each area doesnt amount to much more than a few fetchquests and simple puzzles, Id put off the battles in each section for aslong as possible to enjoy the atmosphere  but you need to go through theencounters eventually.Other annoyances make it hard to fully enjoy Costume Quests bizarre world.Without objective markers or a minimap, finding your next goal is an occasionalproblem, but the save system is an even bigger concern. Lacking any manual options,you need to rely on the autosave to retain your progress, but it only kicks in undercertain conditions that are difficult to force. You cant just decide youredone and quit playing; you need to complete a quest, pick up a new quest, or changeareas. In one case, I lost about 45 minutes of progress because I quit after fightinga bunch of battles that didnt trigger a save event (and I even leveled upduring that time!).Costume Quest is cute and funny, so it may look like a good game for kids. Let meassure you: After completing the adventure (which took me about five hours), I cantrecommend Costume Quest to gamers of any age.", "date": "Oct 20, 2010", "grade": "6"}
