The gorgeous visuals and natural dialogue of the Uncharted seriesproved the team was capable of much more than cartoonish character platformers.The developer then escalated itsstorytelling to a dramatic new chapterwith the unprecedented, visceral journey of a broken man seeking redemption.The Last of Us is the defining PlayStation 3 game, and Naughty Dog has refinedits visuals and packed in meaningful DLC content for the new generation.The Last of Us treads familiarground for video games, with a post-apocalyptic world filled with infectedhumans hungry for flesh. Naughty Dog uses this grim backdrop to tell a dramatictale about a man and the girl he must protect. Similar to the stories told in The Walking Dead and The Road, the narrative impact is foundless in the moment-to-moment action and more about what Joel and Ellie say ordon't say as they scrape by with one another. It's a powerful story of moralgrays and unlikely bonds that I won't risk spoiling for those who will beexperiencing it for the first time on PS4.Also included in the Remasteredpackage is the single-player DLC, Left Behind, which fills in a gap in the mainstory while offering insight into Ellie's life before meeting Joel. Ellie and aclose friend explore their complicated friendship with each other whileexploring a mall that packs an unexpected development. Naughty Dog does aterrific job of shifting between the grim tone of Ellie's adventure with Joeland a more lighthearted encounter with her friend. If you haven't played thebrief-but-powerful Left Behind yet, the Remastered edition is the perfectopportunity.Speaking of perfectopportunities, Remastered is the definitive way to play The Last of Us. Plentyof HD remakes have hit consoles in recent years, but Naughty Dog's PS4 updateis among the most striking I've seen. The PS3 version of The Last of Us was nographical slouch, but Remastered's improvements to the detailed character models,lighting system, and framerate dramatically elevate it above the original.Looking at the two versions side by side, it's remarkable how much smoother andcrisper this new version is. Scanning the environment for clues or lining upcrucial headshots feels silky smooth compared to the original (though you canstill lock in Remastered's framerate at 30 frames-per-second if you're a crazyperson).For all the visual enhancements,the solid, visceral gameplay remains the same. Sneaking past or stealthilytaking out violent Clickers and marauders is still the order of the day. Ammois scarce, so eliminating enemies with spiked 2x4s and shivs is key. Ellie'sA.I. pathfinding still suffers from occasional immersion-breaking hiccups, but thankfullyshe's invisible to foes. Merely surviving in The Last of Us can be a punishingtask, but with that challenge comes the satisfaction of living to see the nextturn in the unforgettable story.The Last of Us made a profoundimpact on how I view storytelling in games when I originally played it on thePlayStation 3. I didn't review the game then, but my thoughts on its myriadstrengths line up well with what Matt Helgeson conveys in his original review. Mypersonal feelings on Naughty Dog's masterpiece place it a hair higher on ourreview scale compared to Matt's original glowing review, PS4 bonuses aside. All the graphical improvementsare wonderful, but you may be wondering if The Last of Us Remastered is foryou. Like the best visual updates, Remastered plays like you remember it. Ifyou played 2013's Game of the Year near release and have been dying to returnto the dark tale, then this is a great opportunity. If you never played TheLast of Us at all, this is absolutely the way to do it. But be careful - you'llnever want to go back to the PS3 original again after reveling in all theimprovements.Note: We were unable to test The Last of Us Remastered's multiplayerprior to release, which includes all previously released DLC. These competitiveonline modes were fun in the original, but weighed little on our overallimpression of the game. When the servers are live, we will spend time withthese modes in Remastered and update the review accordingly.", "date": "Jul 27, 2014", "grade": "10"}
