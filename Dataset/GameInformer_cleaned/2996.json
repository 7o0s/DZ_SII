All it takes to catch one of these wild beasts is a slow ''two steps forward, one step back'' approach and the occasional tasty treat. After moving out of the big city with your mom, you help her open a pet shop by capturing the hearts of the local wildlife. When you're not in the forest dancing with the animals, you're performing banal minigames to help your mom shampoo, comb, and train the town's pet population. If you suffer through the repetitive process of running the shop long enough, you'll eventually be able to take your animals to contests, and earn more exotic pets such as pandas and penguins. As much as I'd love to own a panda, after an eight-hour shift in the dullest pet shop in the planet, I was ready to tell my mom to stuff the allowance.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
