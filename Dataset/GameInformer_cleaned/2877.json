Both clearly ape other properties (X-Men and Daredevil forthe comic, Smash Bros. for the game), and both have production valuesso low they look like they were created in someones garage. For anindependent comic published in the early 80s this is understandable,but for a video game based on a 25-year-old multi-million dollarfranchise you have to wonder why the menu system looks like it was madeusing MS Paint. Comparisons to Smash Bros. are inevitable  eventhe title references Nintendos brawler. Hoping to please its fans,this team of ex-Smash Bros. developers sticks to the formula ofwicked-fast four-player action, two-button controls, and crazy leveldesign. SmashUnfortunately, you can only squeeze so much varietyout of a two-button control scheme, and the movements are so floaty youfeel like youre controlling a bunch of teenage mutant feathers. Powerpickups  which allow you to throw ninja stars or electrify yourenemies  range from useful to unfairly useful (surrounding yourselfwith a mini tornado can turn the tide fairly quickly). The rosterstarts out thin, but you can eventually unlock 16 playable characters,including Ubisofts famously demented Rabbids.If the Smash Bros.formula has worn thin for you, the Smash-Up experience will feel assturdy as a wet paper towel. On the other hand, Smash Bros. and TMNTfans should embrace this games dodge-happy action.", "date": "Sep 30, 2009", "grade": "7.75"}
