I'm a huge fan of brawlers andhadn't heard a thing about this game; it's not often that I download somethingon Xbox Live Arcade sight unseen. Usually, this spells complete disaster - butnot this time. Despite some rough edges, Battle Grounds is a unique and deepquest for fans that have maxed out all of their characters in Castle Crashersand Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.Inspired by Guardian Heroes, battles takeplace on two different horizontal planes. Limiting vertical movement into twoplanes allows for the deeper, fighting game-style combat to shine. I don'tnecessarily want this system in every brawler, but it's nice to see it in themix again. It's not without annoyances, however; huge enemies battling in theforeground can completely cover up the action in the rear plane. Finishing thatone last goon who keeps hopping between planes can also be a hassle at times.All of the characters' attacks feel unique (rather than the lamepalette swaps that are common in the genre). Weak, medium, and heavy strikeshandle the core combos while the ~specials~ button combines with simpledirectional movements to pull off useful and impressive moves like air juggles,screen-filling lasers, and whirling tornados.The action gets crazy, and that carriesover to the main cast. Waka is a shrine maiden with a spear, Mikoto carries asword, Itsuki wears a maid outfit to complement her hammer, and Yuzuha is somekind of ninja schoolgirl with daggers. The silliness doesn't stop there. Youfight a wide range of possessed humans, pesky robots, and huge monsters. On topof this, most of the bosses are other characters from the original fightinggame with motives about as complex as what you'd find in a Mortal Kombat orStreet Fighter plot.Mashingbuttons will get you relatively far in the lower difficulties, but you're goingto want to take the time to truly understand the battle system and master allthe cool moves available. Unfortunately, this process is a huge hassle. Thepoorly translated instructions are in a rudimentary menu, forcing you tomemorize what you can and bring that knowledge back to battle. I recommendturning to the also poorly translated official website for more detail and theability to look at commands while playing.Red gemsdropped by fallen foes serve as the prime currency for upgrading characters. Theskill tree holds all varieties of fancy special moves. Some upgrades are simpleto understand, like a double jump, but many high priced options have vaguedescriptions and no controller input instructions so you don't really know howto perform the thing you just bought. Again, take to the website to learn moreabout this stuff.You canalso invest in a separate attack, speed, and defense stat category to beef upyour character, but with the level 50 cap, you can only max out either the skilltree or the stats. You are constantly faced with the decision to unlock more ofthe battle system or take and receive more damage. Fortunately, you can respecyour points easily with no negative consequences to constantly tweak things toyour play style.DLC ImpressionsFor an additional $5 (the base game is $10), players can use a new character. Kurisu Makise, from the anime Steins;Gate, brings unique attacks like a banana peel toss and flame thrower. However, the base game already has so many characters that it's hard for her to stand out. The more valuable component of the pack is the new level cap, raised from 50 to 99. Now players can fully max out their characters with all of the move options and beefed up stats. You could look at it like, ~Wow, the base game is cheap for XBLA. If I want, I can pay more for a higher cap,~ or ~What a rip-off. I have to pay more to get the full experience.~ Though, to be fair, Scott Pilgrim just did the same thing with a new character and online play. At least Battle Grounds got this out within a matter of weeks instead of years. Unfortunately, the DLC haves and have-nots can't play online together, further splintering the already small online community.Thefour-player co-op has its own set of plusses and minuses. Online play is ablast as long as everyone's got a solid connection. Offline is more reliable,but your buddies can only power up characters on the host's profile rather thanimporting their own. For some reason, all of the story sequences are removedfrom co-op. I didn't mind since I had already seen them in single player, butI'd at least like the option to show them to friends. The strangest choice isthat you can't tweak your skills and stats in co-op without exiting out to themain menu, whereas solo players can do it in the continue screen or betweenstages.The bestpart of co-op outside of the natural camaraderie boost is the ability to playas a multitude of unlocked special characters outside of the core group of four.These people, mostly bosses, are all just as deep as the main characters andadd to replay value tremendously.BattleGrounds includes a couple of other modes as well, but they aren't particularlyimpressive. Arcade mode is for those who care to compete on the leaderboards, havetime to play through the entire game in one sitting, and are looking for a wayto solo with the cast of side characters. Battle Ground mode allows up to fourplayers to fight each other online or offline, but since you use your roster ofleveled characters, victory heavily favors the more juiced player. Having thisas an option is nice, but it's not much more than a quick diversion.BattleGrounds is not the super-polished experience of many of today's top brawlers,but it's definitely worth a look if you're interested in the genre and are atpeace with familiar anime tropes.", "date": "Mar 25, 2013", "grade": "8"}
