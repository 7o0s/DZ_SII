Marth in his native context set your tummy a-flutter? This remake of an old Japan-only NES title is competent, but outside of adding some concessions to a new generation of Fire Emblem players, Shadow Dragon does nothing to change the staid Fire Emblem formula. The turn-based tactical battles and permanent character death are as unforgiving as ever, and the story is banal as only mediocre heroic fantasy can be. Fans will love this for being a nicely updated piece of history; the rest of us will wonder why Nintendo is re-skinning this venerable franchise yet again.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
