The ability to port overmaterial to the Wii U gives the system's software catalog a boost  particularly when a game utilizes exclusive Wii U features like theGamePad. In the case of Most Wanted, however, all things aren't equal.The content for the Wii U version of the game is all here,and then some. The open-world city of Fairhaven is filled with races with whichyou can upgrade your cars, boss battles for the Most Wanted cars, all kindsof billboards to smash, and other secrets to uncover. The ability to switch carson the fly not only means more races at your disposal, but it's also handy whenthe cops are hot on your tail. The Wii U version of Most Wanted comes with evenmore cars and challenges thanks to the inclusion of the Ultimate Speed PackDLC.The game also benefits from developer Criterion's commitment to online. Cruising around with friends and taking on different multiplayer events back-to-back is a lot of fun, and I love seeing what billboard jumps and speed camera speeds your friends have posted when you're cruising around in single-player. Of course, such a distinction between the single- and multiplayer modes is largely irrelevant.Of course, another added feature for the Wii U version isits extensive use of the GamePad. Whether a friend is manning the GamePad whileyou race or you use it yourself, you can disrupt nearby police, remove traffic,repair your car or select upgrades, and more with a touch of a button. Ifsomeone else is controlling the GamePad, they can even drive for you if you'rehaving trouble. You can also race directly from the GamePad, although I wouldadvise against this. Although the game looks good from the peripheral as wellas on a big screen, it's hard to pick out objects on the GamePad when thedetail is scrunched down. This can lead to some crashes when you can't pick outthat concrete median.While it's up to you how much you use the GamePad to youradvantage, no matter which way you choose to control the game (includingcombinations with the Pro Controller, using the Wii controllers, or the GamePadas a motion-based controller itself), it doesn't feel as tight as the Xbox360/PS3 versions. Steering, acceleration, and braking seem more binary, and the lack of aspectrum reduces the subtlety of control that can mean the difference betweenfinessing a tough corner and veering wildly from curb to curb. Most Wanted isall about going full throttle and flirting with wrecking at every turn. Havingto pull back because of the controls is against the game's philosophy.This edition of the game has many of the components thatmade the title successful on the other systems, and more, but thebehind-the-wheel experience puts it in second place.", "date": "Mar 19, 2013", "grade": "8.5"}
