Junction Points console Epic Mickey games disappointed Mouseketeers, as did DreamRifts spiritual successor to the 1990 Genesis classic Castle of Illusion on 3DS. Segas new downloadable remake of the aforementioned Genesis platformer outperforms those titles, but it ends up feeling formulaic by modern standards.Castle of Illusion isnt a one-to-one remake of the original, but it features familiar levels, bosses, and side-scrolling platforming sequences. It also incorporates checkpoints and generous retries, which curbs most of the originals challenge. The most drastic difference is the inclusion of 3D boss fights and platforming sequences. Mickey leaps across macaroons in a milkshake river and flees a giant apple while running toward the camera Crash Bandicoot-style.Note: This Test Chamber preview was recorded at an earlier date and is not a video reviewWhether bounding off the heads of toy soldiers in 2D or evading a huge jack-in-the-box in 3D, the platforming feels responsive and reliable. Despite the solid controls, the action in Castle of Illusion isnt exciting. The remixed levels and 3D sections show Segas eagerness to rejuvenate the originals 23-year-old design, but those changes dont bring it up to todays platforming standards. Leaping over a bosss shockwave attack in a 3D battle is clichd enough that I cant pretend its fresh and exciting just because its new to this game. Players may have loved hopping across floating leaves in 1990, but the pretty new visuals cant rescue it from mediocrity.Castle of Illusions colorful worlds, good controls, and detailed character animations are charming (A giant, licorice dragon boss killed me several times because I was too busy admiring its craftsmanship). If youre a diehard Disney fan in the mood for a short, breezy platformer, this may hit the spot. However, the core gameplay beneath the endearing Disney aesthetic left me wanting more.", "date": "Sep 03, 2013", "grade": "7"}
