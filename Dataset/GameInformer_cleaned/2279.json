{"name": "Monster Tale", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/monster_tale/b/nintendo_ds/archive/2011/03/22/review.aspx", "text": "When a group of devious kids sneak into the Monster World andenslave its creatures, a young girl named Ellie comes to their rescuewith the help of a rare monster named Chomp and a powerful bracelet.Monster Tale's cutesy demeanor and child-like themes may turn offsome at first glance, but the genre-bending portable title offers asurprising amount of depth and gameplay variety. Monster Taleprovides tight 2D platforming across five colorful locales, each withits own theme and enemy types (though you'll run into the occasionalpalette swap). To accomplish her goals, Ellie relies on her legendarybracelet, which doubles as a blaster weapon. Whether it's learning toroll under a row of spikes, or gaining the ability to perform arapid-fire blast with a quick button combo, players must master andupgrade all of Ellie's skills to progress though the levels. Hand-eyecoordination and reflexes are put to the test in later boss battles,which require successful execution of all skills acquired for agratifying victory.Chomp's role in Monster Tale adds aPokmon-esque monster-raising element that makes excellent use of thehandheld's dual screens. With a press of the X button, Chomp retreatsto the ~Pet Sanctuary~ below to help Ellie activate puzzleswitches, pick up items that provide experience for leveling, take downenemies that sneak below, and activate combat items like catapults andsoccer balls to knock out enemies above. Being mindful of Chomp'sactivities on the lower screen while guiding Ellie through combatsequences above makes for fun, if occasionally chaotic, gameplay. Chompcan roam along with Ellie on the top screen as well to lend a hand withmonsters for experience points. These unlock evolved forms of thecreature, which are worth experimenting with during tougher skirmisheslater in the game.Monster Tale does a great job of leading youto your next objective on the map, but since the lower screen isprimarily used as the Pet Sanctuary, I found myself regularlydisrupting gameplay to check the map in the menu to ensure I was takingthe most efficient route toward my goal. As you progress through theworld, your next objective often requires tedious backtracking acrossseveral environments. Instead of giving the player new experiences,you're stuck revisiting familiar areas and fighting familiar enemiesseveral times over.Criticisms aside, Monster Tale is a polishedplatforming adventure with light RPG elements that make it more thanjust another pet simulator. It uses the aged DS hardware to full effectfor a novel experience.", "date": "zalez on Mar 22, 2011", "grade": "8"}
