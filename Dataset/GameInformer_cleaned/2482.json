Developer Ninja Theory spends far too much time holding theplayers hand, and in the process removes any sense of escapism to thisintriguing tale of humanitys last gasp for life.The game startsoff with a bang reminiscent of Uncharted 2s introductory trainsequence. A robot-infested slave ship is sabotaged by a resourcefulfemale prisoner and starts plummeting toward the skyscraping remnantsof a lost metropolis. Your first goal is to survive the crash. Thisfeat takes you through exploding corridors and out onto the shipshull, where breath-stealing leaps must be made as debris passesoverhead and every second wasted brings you closer to impact.Thisexciting sequence concludes with an unlikely partnership being forgedbetween the female, Trip, and a protagonist who never reveals his truename, yet insists on being called Monkey. To no surprise, Monkey isape-like in appearance and possesses the uncanny ability to swingacross poles just like a simian. Monkey is brought to life aptly byAndy Serkis, Hollywoods resident primate expert (he played King Kong,the ape-ish Gollum in The Lord of the Rings, and will play Caesar in the forthcoming Planet of the Apes film).Therelationship that develops between Trip and Monkey is fun to watch. Itdoesnt follow the path you think it would. Their personalities clash,yet neither could survive in this harsh climate without the other.Thanks to sharp writing by Ninja Theorys scribes, I cared about thefate of both characters. The banter between them is emotional at theright times, filled with smart jabs and amusing sarcasm, and theirchemistry shows noticeable progression as their journey family takesthem farther west. The resonance of the tale, however, is undermined bythe gameplay.Most of the platforming sequences showcaseaction-packed moments, such as a bridge falling apart as Monkeyshimmies along. But rarely do these tense set pieces offer a realthreat, as Monkey can never fall or miscalculate a jumps trajectory.If he isnt lined up correctly and you press jump, he wont jump. Hejust stands there until you move him into the correct position. Towardthe end of the game, he has to avoid flames and spinning gears but upuntil this point, most of Enslaveds platforming is simply an exercisein basic movement.Combat, while offering a great sense of brutalphysicality with each of Monkeys staff strikes, lacks depth. I usedthe same combo sequences from start to finish. Ninja Theory also failsto offer interesting adversaries. The largest foe, a robot dog, lookscool, but is easy to snuff out with repeated EMP blasts. Watching thisbeast rise from the ground only to knock it down again with another EMPshot feels like cheating, but as far as I could tell, it was the onlyway to destroy it.Enslaved also lacks a sense of exploration.Whenever Trip enters a new area, she must first scan her surroundings.This extensive fly-by of the level details all of the enemies andpoints of interest along the way. Trips findings are digitallybroadcast to Monkey through his slave headband. He can see the distanceat which hell alert an enemy, as well as all the objects with which hecan interact. One platforming stretch toward the end of the game evenhas Monkey following a dragonfly that is discharging a sparkling trailfor fear that the player may not know where to go next.Given theamount of hand holding, Im surprised this game doesnt play itself.The lack of immersion and knowledge that every jump  no matter howperilous it is  will land without fail saps Enslaved of itsentertainment value. You know a game is troubled when you find solacein its extensive orb collecting.This experience is also marredby a lack of polish. Ugly textures frequent most environments, the jumpcommand is touchy, the framerate skips like a lopsided record incertain areas, combat controls lack responsiveness, and the cameraoften clips into the environment, hiding cool takedowns or cinematicsequences. With the gameplay being such an unwanted distraction, thestory is the only attraction. The plot delivers a cool science fictiontwist in its final moments, but ultimately serves as a slave tomediocre gameplay for eight to nine hours.", "date": "Oct 01, 2010", "grade": "7"}
