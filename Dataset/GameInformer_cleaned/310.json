As we've seenthrough history, the press has helped facilitate change by informing the publicof corruption. The Westport Independent gives you the intriguing duty ofmanaging an independent newspaper in the final weeks before a governmentcensorship bill passes. Will you make your last days matter by printing thereal issues and exposing extortion or will you try to stay on the government'sgood side to avoid a total shutdown? Unfortunately, that summary is more exciting than playingThe Westport Independent. It takes place in a fictional post-war country, wherean oppressive government rules with an iron fist, censoring movies and preventingsubversive propaganda. Two extreme groups have formed: The Loyalists, who arein blind support of the government, and the Rebels, who want to bring it down.As editor-in-chief, you select which stories to run, alter headlines, selectwriters, and omit certain information to push your agenda. The concept haspotential, but falls short due to undercooked ideas.Your main goal is to tell the side of the story you want andattempt to sway the other side if possible, all while selling newspapers.However, the game doesn't make it seem like the other side can waver, nor doesit explain how you can influence public opinion in the opposite direction. Forinstance, advertising is more strategic than it first appears. You canadvertise to increase your popularity in certain districts, but their politicalallegiance still dictates their opinion, so you have to throw in some articlesto please them if you want them to support your paper. I constantly felt like I didn't have enough options toreport the way I wanted; instead, it felt like it was making reporting toocut-and-dried to be satisfying. You can't even get extra sources to confirm thestories you're receiving are true. The whole interview process is absent. Injournalism, it's essential to get both sides of the story to print, but younever get that opportunity. You only get two headline options for the news thatappears in your inbox. When you select the headlines, your choices are eithersensationalized or sanitized; more options would have gone a long way.Sometimes you're forced to pick a side in your title, choosing to tell thestory from the Loyalists' or the Rebels' view. After all, you're trying to sellpapers, but at what cost?That brings me to one of my other problems with The WestportIndependent: it operates on extremism. It doesn't have middle ground -reporting events as they happen doesn't get you anywhere, as your paper salesand popularity depend on catering to these rabid groups. Maybe insincerepandering to a specific audience is part of the point, but the game makes youfeel like you're this town's last hope for change, making you not want to feedinto either group's problematic agenda.This can be tough, because both sides do some horriblethings to get what they want. The Loyalists will look the other way at thepolice being violent if it ensures less crime, while the Rebels have no issuewith ignoring laws and leading dangerous and violent protests. Egging on eitherof these groups can accelerate their extremism; rebels resort to terroristattacks, and the police get more corrupt in dealing with dissidents. If you gofull-on with catering to the rebels, the government shuts you down, resultingin a game over. Siding with the government only has narrative repercussions,resulting in them increasing censorship and influencing the academiccurriculum.Your staff is also in the crosshairs. Of your four writers,each lands somewhere on the Rebel or Loyalist scale. They may refuse to writecertain stories if they represent the opposing side. Assigning the work to theright people is a balancing act, and the government might arrest your employeeif the story goes too far, giving you fewer articles to print. At the veryleast, you learn about your staff's feelings about the articles you print eachweek in small skits that delve into their personal lives. This is a nice touch,as it humanizes them instead of just making them faceless supporters of oneside. If your paper can stay open without making the governmentsuspicious of propaganda you get an ending that focuses on the state of each ofthe four districts you sell the papers in and the current lives of your staffmembers. You can't stop the bill from passing, but you can overthrow thegovernment. Most playthroughs will take anywhere from 30 minutes to anhour depending on how thorough you are, but you can test out differentstrategies and see how they play out in the multiple endings. Even so, theendings are unsatisfying. Winning over these extreme groups by catering totheir agendas is easy. However, I was disappointed to see the game end withoutany solutions or progress, despite the fact that I feel like I made the rightcalls and ran stories that exposed corruption. I had the most fun seeing howcovering certain stories played out and seeing if I'd get a nasty letter froman unhappy reader or government official.The Westport Independent is a great idea, butdoesn't have enough content to capitalize on it. More strategy, variety, andreward would have gone a long way. Journalism is far from a glamourous job, butstories that make a difference are the most gratifying part. Unfortunately, TheWestport Independent never made me feel that was possible.", "date": "Feb 18, 2016", "grade": "6.5"}
