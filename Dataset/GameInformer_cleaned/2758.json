Weve stormed the beaches ofNormandy, fought the Battle of the Bulge, and liberated Stalingrad ahundred times over, yet developers keep dangling Nazis in front of ourgun muzzles. Thankfully Pandemic isnt interested in making us relivethese historical triumphs again. Rather than trying to encapsulate thedrama of the entire European Theater, The Saboteur earns points forconcentrating its efforts on a specific location with a specificstoryline. Sean Devlin wasnt always a revolutionary fighter. Thesmarmy Irish race car driver would rather spend his time in bars andbedrooms. But when a Nazi officer steals a race from him, kills hisbest friend, and aids the invasion of Paris, he puts his leisurelypursuits on hold and takes up arms with the French Resistance. Thatsnot to say hes carving a new identity for himself  Devlin still makestime for the occasional race and romp, but instead of hanging out atbars in between exploits, hes hanging off Nazi towers plantingexplosives to drive the Wehrmacht back to Germany.As befitting its brash leather jacketed protagonist, The Saboteur bleeds cool. Like Sin City,Parisian neighborhoods stifled under German occupation have no colorsave for the yellow light emanating from building windows and the boldred banners of their Nazi oppressors. With German soldiers harassingParisian citizens and even lining up impromptu execution squads on thestreets, the oppression is palpable. As Devlin rids the area of Nazitanks, watchtowers, AA guns, and encampments, color comes back to thearea and its citizens will start openly defying the German squadsstationed around the city. While much of the joie de vivreParis is well known for is stifled above ground by barbed wire and Nazipropaganda, the underground is full of life, with sexy showgirls atParisian cabarets who take you into hiding, wily black marketeers eagerto sell you new weaponry, and intellectuals turned revolutionaries inneed of Devlins help to drive the Germans from their homeland.TheSaboteur isnt afraid to borrow concepts from its contemporaries. Anamalgamation of the open world sandbox of Grand Theft Auto, the chaoticfreeplay of Crackdown, the climbing of Assassins Creed, and thezipline and rooftop traversal of Infamous, the game wears itsinfluences on its sleeve. While these game mechanics work, like theFrench resistance they seem to have been done on the cheap. Thesluggish car controls seemingly turn on an axis in the middle of thevehicle, which takes practice to master. Climbing frustratinglyrequires you to jam on the A button for each movement up the building.The gunplay has a sketchy auto cover system and the weaponry lacks thepunch of more visceral shooters.Other areas of the game alsolack the polish of a groundbreaking title as well. Pandemicquestionably buried the map three clicks into the menu system, which isa major faux pas for an open world game that requires you to placewaypoints to navigate the large city. Cars take damage from bullets,but youll need to run over an entire city block of benches before youstart seeing any wear and tear on the chassis. The Germans were boldenough to overtake Paris, but given the braindead and lackadaisicalnature of their infantry, it doesnt take much to drive them fromindividual posts.The Saboteur may lack the polish of thecontemporaries it boldly mimics, but protagonist Sean Devlins questfor revenge and an alluring 1940s Paris make this a World War II memoryworth making.", "date": "Dec 03, 2009", "grade": "8"}
