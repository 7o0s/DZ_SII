{"name": "The Silver Case", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/the_silver_case/b/playstation4/archive/2017/04/27/the-silver-case-review.aspx", "text": "Before earning a cult following with over-the-top action games like Killer7, No More Heroes, and Shadows of the Damned, Goichi Suda and Grasshopper Manufacture made more subdued (but still strange) adventure games. The Silver Case was the first of those, and it delivers on what fans waiting for a translation of the game for 18 years have wanted. It has a strong, unique look, intriguing characters and dialogue, and a story as engaging as it is confusing. The Silver Case has trouble pulling all of the threads together, but it still has the surreal atmosphere and unique storytelling that are Sudas signatures. The Silver Case is a visual novel that tells the story of Kamui Uehara, a previously detained serial killer who has broken out of a psychiatric ward and begun murder several innocent women. The story is split into two scenarios; one follows the detectives hunting Kamui, and the other is about a former journalist gathering info on him.As you learn more about Kamuis motivations, the plotunfurls into a mix of political intrigue, slice-of-life anime, cyberpunk, andhorror over several chapters that feel like side stories with tangentialconnections to the main plot. One chapter delves into a conflict betweenresidents and a corporation slowly destroying their town, while another centerson a child looking for his lost playmate from within a makeshift base ofoperations beneath his apartment building. I loved the way the game was able totouch on these disparate topics while keeping a consistent tone.Although most of the story is delivered via text, theinterface often plays into the story. Character portraits, scenes, and text allappear in different parts of the screen at different times. Live-action oranime videos occasionally punctuate key plot developments or serve as context,such as a news segment in which local residents are interviewed about what theythink of Kamui. Some play out within frames of the interface, while others fillthe screen. First-person adventure segments are interspersed with dialogue andexposition, but the 3D spaces you explore are bland and devoid of life, makingthe few times you are forced to explore them a chore. Still, the kineticinterface helps liven up the story, making important moments more impactful andmaking every chapter distinct.While individual moments shine, the overall plotcan be hard to follow. I frequently found myself wondering what had justhappened after a long explainer, and which pieces of information weresignificant. Even at the end, after a lengthy series of reveals, I wasnt quitesure what had happened. I encountered multiple scenes promising to reveal thetruth, only for another scene to upend the plot again. Several scenes also dragon by reiterating obvious plot points while skimming over more pressingquestions or waxing philosophical for a bit too long.The remaster includes two new chapters (one for eachscenario), firmly establishing the game as part of a Sudas larger Kill ThePast thematic series. The new chapters fit in nicely with the rest of the gameand provide some interesting details to the story, but they dont resolve thecliffhanger ending or convey a sense of closure.While the main plot left a lot of questions toanswer, I enjoyed most of the time I spent with its characters. Thejournalists frequent interactions with a pet turtle Red and daily affirmationemails are great, and the interactions and clashing ideals of the detectivesmix well with random pontificating about life and conspiracy theories during astakeout. Not every character is likable, but they were developed enough that Icould sympathize with them on some level. The writing oscillates between purpleprose and loose colloquialisms, but this feels like an intentional way to makecharacters feel layered. Some sentences had me wondering whether their weirdstructure was on purpose or translation issue, while others were just plainoffensive.I have a hard time putting together what exactly happened inthe The Silver Case, but its a testament to the writing, characters, and moodthat I want to figure it out. Portions are often slow, dense, and overbearing.However, the relatable character moments, intriguing short stories, and strongvisual style eventually won me over, even if I had to wade through some roughedges to get to them.", "date": "Apr 27, 2017", "grade": "7.5"}
