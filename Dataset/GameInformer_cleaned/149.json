With nary a mention of theoft-requested 2D Metroid game, many saw Federation Force - a four-player cooperativefirst-person shooter for the 3DS - as a slap in the face and refused to acceptit as a true Metroid title. While those complaints are justified, Next LevelGames overcame the scrutiny to release a spin-off title that is enjoyable mostof the time.In the latest Metroid Prime game, you're cast as a newrecruit to the Federation Force, an elite intergalactic group devoted toridding the galaxy of impending threats. The campaign consists of travelingbetween three unique planets and completing bite-sized missions that tie intothe Metroid Prime universe. The 22 missions range from clearing out a base of spacepirates to progressing through a level full of sphere-based puzzles. Unlikemost Metroid games, there is little emphasis on exploration or upgrades,setting Federation Force apart as a definite spin-off.Each mission provides a different challenge, but FederationForce is at its best when you're blasting through a room full of baddies. I'vealways had an aversion to shooters using the 3DS controls, but Federation Forceemploys a strong lock-on system combined with motion controls to pick exactlywhat part of the target you want to shoot. Even at great distances I could lockonto enemies then target their weak points by tilting the 3DS system.The only times the lock-on system failed me were rareoccurrences when several enemies and points-of-interest were on-screen at thesame time and the system had a hard time deciding which one I was trying totarget. An alternate control configuration exists that lets you use the C-Stickof the New 3DS models for aiming instead of the motion controls, but it's much less precise.Amiibo FunctionalityUsing any Amiibo with Metroid Prime: Federation Force unlocks a special skeleton paintjob for your mech, but youre going to want to use one of the Samus Amiibos for your playthrough. Scanning the standard Samus figure unlocks a paintjob that mirrors the iconic bounty hunters armor while boosting your missile inventory to 10 for each bundle you equip, while the Zero Suit Samus figure opens up a Zero Suit paintjob that boosts the Slow Beam auxiliary ammo to 5 rounds per bundle. I highly recommend using the paintjob from the standard Samus Amiibo if thats an option.Though the missions are diverse and the mechanics are sound,the experience is hindered by the lack of checkpoints. That means if all playersdie or the objective fails, you must play it again from the start. In manymissions this isn't a problem, but some contain longer boss fights withsubsequent battles, and the lack of a save point is enraging. In a latermission, I had little problem dispatching the multi-stage boss, but the difficultarea following that boss battle caused me to fail out repeatedly. Each time Ifailed, I had to face that long boss battle before getting to the difficultpart. Another mission required that I ride a slow-moving cart through anenemy-filled stage before facing an all-out assault that destroyed the preciouscargo on the cart and forced me to restart the level.When you combine the lack of a checkpoint system with thesheer challenge of the missions, the game is not ideal for solo players.Federation Force is an experience best played with friends, but the gamesometimes gets in the way of letting that happen. To play with another person,each player must be on the level that you want to play on their individual savefiles. This means if you're stuck on mission 20 and want your friend who justgot the game to help you out, you need to wait for them to catch up before theycan help you progress.When I wanted to power through a mission by myself, I neededto use the equipment systems to my advantage. Before each mission, you can equipmodifiers and auxiliary weapons to your mech's slots. The mods range from armorplating and increased missile payloads to even one that auto-revives you upondeath. The special ammo uses an inventory system to let you bring things likemissiles, repair kits, decoys, and elemental weapons into the mission. You canalso activate autonomous combat drones to help you, which I found necessary onharder missions. While this system doesn't quite deliver the variance of thearsenal of a standard Metroid title, I enjoyed reconfiguring my mech eachmission to try and optimize it for the situation at hand.Outside of the main campaign players can tackle Blast Ball,a three-on-three soccer minigame with the objective of using your blasters topush a giant ball into your opponents' goal. This mode puts the shooting mechanicsto good use, and while you won't find much depth, it's fun to step away fromthe main game to play some quick rounds and it can even be played locally withfriends who don't have their own copy of the game using Download Play.If you're interested in Federation Force, I recommend verifyingthat someone you know is also planning on buying it. It's not impossible tobeat by yourself, but it's more fun to play alongside someone else - especiallywhen you can do so locally. Metroid Prime: Federation Force features strongshooting mechanics, diverse missions, and a high level of challenge, but thefrustrating matchmaking infrastructure and lack of checkpoints prevent it fromtruly achieving the greatness of its namesake.", "date": "Aug 19, 2016", "grade": "7"}
