Wii Sports didn't just sell the potential of motioncontrols; it became synonymous with the Wii itself and fueled the system'sstellar sales. 1-2-Switch is the Bizarro World incarnation of Wii Sports  a bush-leaguecollection of gimmicks that fails spectacularly at selling the new capabilitiesof Nintendo's hybrid console. You may still throw your Switch controller atyour TV, but for entirely different reasons.To call 1-2-Switch a collection of ~mini-games~is so charitable it should be tax deductible. While the video tutorials sportthe polished production values and orchestrated campiness of an Old Navycommercial (and are just as obnoxious), the rudimentary tech demos theyintroduce wouldn't cut it at a middle-school game jam. Most of the activities tryto divorce the motion-controlled action from the screen as much as possible (becausegraphics are such a clich), whilesporting less depth and nuance than a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.Quick Draw has two players raising theircontrollers and pressing the trigger when the announcer says ~fire,~ awardingthe win to the fastest time. Fake Draw does the exact same thing, but with afew false audio cues thrown in. Telephone times who can pick up theircontroller the fastest when the ringer goes off. Samurai Training challengesyou to swing your controller before your opponent can react. All of them boildown to simple reflex tests, and use the same technology present in virtuallyevery modern controller and smartphone. None of them are fun beyond theinherent entertainment of staring down a friend and seeing who can move faster,which is why the game constantly prompts you to make eye contact with your opponent despite throwing up images and score indicators on the display that itapparently doesn't want you to look at. Either way, you and your friends arebetter off just playing the hand-slap game; the sting of defeat will wear offmuch quicker than the sting of wasting your money.Only a few games do a good job of demonstrating the Switch's capabilities,specifically the HD rumble. Safe Crack tasks you with spinning your controllerlike a number dial and feeling for the correct position. The granularity of therumble is genuinely impressive; it really feels as though you are dragging itacross the pins and locking it in. However, Nintendo doesn't expand upon thatseedling of a concept with different levels or variations  it's simply a raceto do it three times before your opponent does. What could have been a moreinteresting and engaging experience instead elicits a shoulder shrug. This isalso true of the scant few other games I enjoyed, like Sneaky Dice and TreasureChest.Other games do more to highlight the system's limitations than itspotential. Copy Dance and Runway encourage you to strike silly poses, but allthat really matters is the orientation of the controller. I wildly flailed asingle hand during a round of Dance Off, and not only did I beat my moresincere dance opponent, I received an ~A~ for rhythm (I can assure you, I have zerorhythm). These games aren't fun, but their failure runs even deeper; theyundermine the Switch's capabilities by relying on obvious smoke and mirrors.The worst example of this is Table Tennis. Its inclusion should be nosurprise given the immense popularity of Wii Sports' tennis mini-game, but1-2-Switch's insistence on not using the screen for its games (even though theystill kind of do) downgrades it to a simple timing exercise. The strength orangle of your stroke doesn't matter because it's all a cheap charade. Whothought it would be a good idea to try and sell the Switch with a mini-gamethat is inferior in every way to its 11-year-old progenitor?Some games, like Baby, are just plain weird. It tasks you with soothing afussy infant by cradling the Switch in your arms, boldly embracing the factthat 1-2-Switch is as enjoyable as taking care of a crying baby. Other gamesreally scrape the bottom of the barrel (or shoe for that matter). Take Zen, whichhas you place a controller on the palm of your hand and then hold still for aslong as possible. I actually liked Zen, because if I closed my eyes, I couldforget I was playing 1-2-Switch for a few glorious minutes. If you were toactually bring 1-2-Switch's dull offerings to a rooftop party like in theSwitch commercials, you're liable to get thrown off.Given its diehard fan base, it would be easy forNintendo to forget that the point of first-party launch titles is to sellconsumers on the capabilities of a new system  especially when it has Breathof the Wild up its sleeve. But most consumers would like more than one reasonto buy a new console, and 1-2-Switch is insultingly shallow. Nintendo hascreated an intriguing piece of hardware, but its default runner-up launch titlepresents the Switch like it's a cheap gimmick machine. As someone who hasplayed more Wii bowling than I care to admit, I honestly can't imagine who Iwould recommend 1-2-Switch to  except maybe the parents of the video tutorialactors, as proof of their child's first and last gig. Even after you've wrungevery drop of enjoyment out of Zelda, you're better off saving your $50 dollarsand ~playing~ the Switch's Mii editor instead.", "date": "Mar 02, 2017", "grade": "4"}
