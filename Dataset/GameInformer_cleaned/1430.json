{"name": "Special Forces: Team X", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/special_forces_team_x/b/xbox360/archive/2013/02/12/review.aspx", "text": "For years, full-fledged online shooter modes were confined to big budget franchises like Call of Duty, Battlefield, and Halo. More recently, weve seen the release of downloadable offerings in the genre. Gotham City Impostors, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Section 8: Prejudice, and more have entered the XBLA and PSN fray to offer deathmatches at a reduced price. Zombie Studios Special Forces: Team X is the latest to release, and it fails to forge its own identity.If youve played a shooter in the last few years, the list of modes in this multiplayer-only title wont come as a surprise. Youve got your team deathmatch, king of the hill, juggernaut, domination, and capture the flag standbys, along with a similarly by-the-books progression system. As you kill dudes, capture control points, and complete challenges, youre able to customize your character with new weapons, attack dogs in the place of grenades, and even unlock the super-sweet ability to turn your hat backwards. If you feel like whipping out the old Hulk Hogan hand to ear gesture, youre free to do so once you hit level 5.When it comes to the boots-on-the-ground action, theres only one thing that separates Special Forces: Team X from any other online shooter. Before each round, players get to vote on more than just the predetermined map; they get to vote on three different components to a modular stage. With three different slots that can house various stage elements, there are tons of possible combinations. Its a cool idea, but one that would be better off in a more competent and original shooter.Above: Our recent Test Chamber episode covering Special Forces: Team XSpecial Forces: Team X may be uninspired, but most of the action performs without much issue. Aiming feels decent, spawns arent broken, and the nearly endless map variety leads to a mostly enjoyable experience when its working. Unfortunately, a lack of polish rears its head in the form of connection errors, stat/XP resets, spelling mistakes, and a cover system that feels far too sticky.If theres one area of the game thats just downright awful, its the art style. Characters look like they were modeled to be realistic military operatives, but then a last-second attempt at a cartoony Borderlands-esque style was made. The end result is a bunch of character models that look terrible no matter how many customizable items you unlock for them.It isnt a broken game, but Special Forces: Team X doesnt really offer anything that cant be found in better form elsewhere. Shuffling maps around is a cool idea, but it doesnt matter much if the gameplay is average at best. If youre looking for a unique downloadable shooter, go for Gotham City Impostors. If youre looking for cheap multiplayer, buy an older Call of Duty or Gears game. As is, theres really no reason for Special Forces: Team X to be a must-have for any shooter fan.", "date": "Feb 12, 2013", "grade": "6"}
