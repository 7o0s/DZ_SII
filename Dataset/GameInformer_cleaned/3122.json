{"name": "Line Rider 2 Unbound", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/line_rider_2_unbound/b/pc/archive/2009/09/22/review.aspx", "text": "The original Flash version of Line Rider is about drawing a landscape for a tiny guy to sled through. Unbound maintains that creative aspect (including online level sharing) and adds in a puzzle campaign to deepen the experience. Patching in missing sections of track with various line types is a fun mental test, but several things bring down the experience. Unclear instructions mixed with an unintuitive interface prevent new riders from getting up to speed. You can't save puzzle progress, so if it's half-finished and you have to take off, you must restart it all over again. Don't forget to go into the sound options and turn off the god-awful music.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
