The story is about an evil corporation that tries to take over the world by turning everyday appliances into robotic devils. Why does the FBI have a group of super secret guinea pigs prepared to fight off this kind of threat? Who cares? You're fighting a bunch of evil CD players and waffle irons. Go with it. The game stars Darwin, a furry weapons expert who uses his jetpack and mousy paws to scamper through human-sized environments and battle mechanical baddies with a plasma whip. Sections of the game let you play as his pet fly Mooch, who can sneak into areas and unlock doors the little rodent can't. Even the game's stereoscopic 3D setting is a fun novelty. Gamers who enjoyed the movie could do worse than this well-polished platformer.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
