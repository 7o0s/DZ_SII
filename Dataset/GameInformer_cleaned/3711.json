The previous UFC series by Yuke's set a highbar that EA initially struggled to meet. With UFC 3, EA Sports refines andsharpens the entire package, finally earning its place as the champ ofmixed-martial-arts video games.No game captures the calculated-yet-violent spirit of mixed martialarts better than UFC 3. The rush of entering the Octagon with the sole purposeof topping your opponent is well represented through both gameplay andpresentation. The UFC brings multiple martial-arts disciplines into each fight,and you must always be on guard against both ruthless knockouts and technicalsubmissions. Fights often turn into breathless affairs, keeping you on the edgeof your seat. Just because you're winning the fight doesn't mean a singlewell-placed uppercut or takedown won't turn the tide in your opponent's favor.UFC 3's striking controls are the best the series has everseen. From the base knowledge of each face-button corresponding to a limb tothe more advanced strikes using shoulder buttons as modifiers to your basicattacks, the stand-up game in UFC 3 is intuitive and accessible whilemaintaining depth. New vulnerability windows leave you open to damage when youattack to make striking a more careful art. This, when combined with the finelytuned stamina bar, successfully balances out the number of fighters who comeout swinging for the fences, as getting caught with a head kick in the middleof throwing a haymaker puts them in a precarious situation.Animations have been rebuilt from the ground up for UFC 3,making for seamless transitions between moves. In addition, there are fewawkward strikes and glitches during gameplay, and fighters look and move muchmore like their real-world counterparts. Each fighter's stance, pre-fightroutine, and post-fight celebration looks authentic to how they behave inreal-life.With how great and authentic UFC 3 typically looks and feels,I'm disappointed by how often the commentary fails to keep pace. Play-by-play analystJon Anik does a great job in his debut effort, but longtime color commentatorJoe Rogan adds little in way of new voiceover, a noticeable detriment insequences where Anik and Rogan are going back and forth. In addition, thecommentary sometimes lacks contextual awareness, with incorrect calls or setups that give the wrong storyline of fights.UFC 3's overhauled career mode is a huge success. The newGOAT Career mode peppers in multiple short-term goals to keep you engaged atevery turn. I enjoy watching my fighter climb the ranks on his way to his firsttitle shot, but the satisfaction of completing smaller goals every few fightson my way to a better contract is much more exciting. I also love how eachcontract gives me a new rival to trash-talk throughout my contract beforefacing off against them. UFC's licensed shows help tell the story of yourfighter each step of the way, making each milestone even more satisfying.Earning the title is still one of the ultimate goals, but tobecome the greatest of all time, you need to perform well inside and outside ofthe Octagon. I love the balancing act between training and promoting during thelead up to a fight. Do you want to boost your fight's hype by talking trash toyour opponent on social media, or do you want to learn a new submission thatmight come in handy during that fight? I often struggled with the answer tothat question, and because of that, I looked forward to each training camp asmuch as the fights themselves.In addition to career, players can engage in several diversions,both returning and debut. Popular one-off exhibitions like Knockout mode return(with Snoop Dogg delivering humorous commentary), while the new Tournamentsfeature allows you to pit 8 or 16 fighters against each other in abracket-style tournament with custom rules. I'm glad Live Events are back, as Ienjoy following along with real-world cards and putting in my picks for who Ithink will win.Online, you can play in ranked championship in pursuit of abelt, or unranked quick-matches, resulting in a basic-yet-enjoyable suite. Onlineplay is mostly smooth and absent of lag, but I'm annoyed you still can't skipthe long-winded pre-fight and mid-round presentations unless both players agreeto.Ultimate Team also introduces many new features. As youfight through opponents online and offline, you earn in-game currency, whichcan be used to purchase packs. Each pack you open features fighters, moves, andconsumable boosters that can be applied to different slots of each fighter inyour starting lineup. Items can also boost your chemistry rating if you applythem to the correct weight class, fighter type, and slot (for example, punchesto the arm category). With each added move and consumable boost, your fighterbecomes more competitive, which helps whether you're jumping into onlinematchmaking or staying offline.With items carrying different tiers of effectiveness, andbetter packs costing more in-game currency, it opens the mode up to tempt youwith microtransactions. However, without paying any real money, I still fell into the addictive loop of earningcoins through completing in fights and opening packs to improve my fighter. Openinga pack to reveal your favorite fighter, or the move you've been missing from oneof your starters' arsenal is a thrill. I love that the online portion ofUltimate Team has been complemented by a fully featured offline mode for thosewho don't want to throw down in the fiery gauntlet of online competition orworry about players who have paid money to acquire the best items.By building on its already strong foundation andadding meaningful new gameplay and modes, UFC 3 delivers a terrific MMAexperience from top to bottom. Whether you want to play against a friend in asingle bout or develop a fighter from local favorite to greatest all time, UFC3 allows you to live out the fantasy of stepping into the Octagon like neverbefore.Note: The online portion of this game was evaluated using EA Access servers prior to official launch.", "date": "Jan 30, 2018", "grade": "8.75"}
