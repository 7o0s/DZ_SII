If you're still willing to give the game a shot, you'll find some snazzy animation and impressive set piece moments like controlling a screen-filling Slug. The main campaign is relatively average, but it's nice that you can jump into any mission once you've beaten it. Unfortunately, the bottom screen contains a useless lo-res map instead of incorporating the action somehow and the ''Training Grounds'' bonus challenges feel too similar to the main game.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": null}
