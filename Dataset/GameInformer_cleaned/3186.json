The game's more traditional puzzle modes feature tributes to titles like Mario Picross, Tetris, and Echochrome. Rubik's isn't just one big digital cube to solve (although it's included), as the individual cubes star in sideways takes on different puzzle conventions. While this variety makes Rubik's World a versatile title, some of the modes are throwaway material, like the music-maker and the create-a-picture mode. Still, there's plenty here to twist and turn your brain.", "date": "Sep 22, 2009", "grade": "8"}
