Krillbite'sfirst-person horror game turns this expectation on its head, tossing playersinto the psyche of a child coping with a turbulent family life. Amongthe Sleep packs fewer scares and puzzles than I traditionally enjoy in horrorgames, but its surprising storytelling helps it succeed despite theseshortcomings.Players experience everything from the vertically challengedperspective of a toddler on its second birthday. The quiet celebration betweenthe child and mother is interrupted by a loud knock at the door followed by themuffled sound of adults arguing. The mother returns with a present and noadditional company, subtly suggesting a custody battle is being waged for theyoung protagonist. This sets the tone for the story to come, which spirals downan Alice in Wonderland-esque rabbithole. Childlike wonder mixes with the traumatizing effects ofabusive family environments to achieve potent results. I consistentlyconsidered the real-life effects of irresponsible parenting on children -something few games touch on - and it made my time with the game even moreimpactful.The story unfolds as players explore the deep recesses of achild's imagination. Interacting with the world and solving the simple puzzlesis reminiscent of Amnesia: The Dark Descent, but without the blood and guts.You pull chairs up to doors and climb them to reach the handle. You can opencreaky doors and drawers as slowly or quickly as your bravery permits. Playerscan waddle about on their feet, but running too long causes them to stumble andcrawl before getting back up. It's a clever concept, but doesn't impactgameplay in any purposeful way.Among the Sleep is also playable on Oculus Rift kits, if you've got oneBasic puzzles like collecting toy trinkets or slotting shapetoys into shaped holes are fitting for the theme, but don't scratch trueproblem-solving itches. However, the experience is less about what you're doingand the context surrounding it. Throwing a ball at a liquor bottle on a shelfdoesn't feel meaningful, until darkness begins to spread and ominous noisesbuild. Among the Sleep is a powerful, emotionally movingexperience, but it takes a while to get there. Momentum drops off after astrong opening, leaving players to wander around corrupted playgrounds andfoggy forests. While these early sequences are heavy on creepy atmosphere,they're light in terms of actual threats. I began to brazenly charge after monsterslurking in the dark, unconvinced they would ever actually harm me. However, mydoubt was eventually extinguished during a tense-yet-brief encounter with amenacing creature. Don't go into this game expecting to be endlessly stalked byinvincible foes. Krillbite relies on monster evasion far less than other horrorgames, a trade that swaps thrilling gameplay for elegant storytelling.True scares are disappointingly infrequent, but Among theSleep helps make up for it with a gripping tale that picks up in the secondact. Krillbite expertly communicates the rough upbringing this child has had.Few words are spoken, and text appears as gibberish (given the protagonist'sinability to read). Nevertheless, numerous crude crayon drawings, repeatedthemes like broken bottles and claustrophobic spaces, and a general ominousvibe deliver the story in a memorable way. The final moments and the dramatictwist before the end made the whole ride worth it.Krillbite's horror game is an impressive feat in video gamestorytelling. It leaves more of an impact in a distilled 3 to 4 hours than somegames with 60-hour campaigns. The scares may be lacking and some of the puzzlesare dull to a fault, but this studio has expertly crafted a game that letsplayers unravel its story in a meaningful way.", "date": "May 30, 2014", "grade": "7.75"}
