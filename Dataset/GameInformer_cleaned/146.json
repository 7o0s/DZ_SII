Davis, the ex-player providing the colorcommentary, talks about how coaches are always looking for that ~perfect game.~The perfect game doesn't exist in the NFL or in any given rendition of Madden.Even so, Madden 17 has a lot to enjoy. As they do every year, developers EATiburon concentrate on a set of new features, fixes, and points of emphasis tovarying degrees of success. Not all the bases are covered, but this is still ateam win that Madden gamers can appreciate on some level.If last year's gameplay was all about the airattack, this year is about what happens on the ground. Instead of just pickingyour hole and turboing through it, the revamped blocking schemes give playersmore to consider. Even though the holes are a little bigger, I wouldn't sayrunning is easier. In fact, an in-your-face danger surrounds the defensiveplayers as they crash in to disrupt the play or hold off an offensive linemenwith one arm and come sliding down the line to gobble you up in the backfieldwith the other. The interplay between the offensive and defensive lines at theline of scrimmage is dynamic, exemplifying football's human chess match.As fluid as some of the line play is (I saw anoffensive linemen shuffle down the line of scrimmage, make a block, and thenslide off and make a second block further down the line),you still seeawkward steps by isolated players. Lead blockers occasionally prioritize thewrong target, players slide into catches or blocks (something I thought wassolved last year), and others take baffling steps in the wrong direction.Despite this emphasis on the ground, the air gamehas not been ignored. The new defensive zones make you double check a receiveris truly open before you throw the ball. It's a necessary addition that doesn'tthrow off the balance. Even when you're on defense, knowing which zones to calltakes getting used to, although the new run/pass counters playcalling option  where you call defensive plays to address specific areas on the field  are a nice option when someone keeps beating you over the middle, for instance.The latter is a nod to accessibility (itself adirty word to the hardcore players out there) that I am happy to reap the benefitsof. Similarly, the expanded sim options, like the Play the Moment feature thathighlights only the key moments in a game for you to play, shows that it'spossible to enjoy some of Madden's new features that I wasn't explicitly askingfor.This sentiment applies to the Connected Franchisemode as a whole. I have a running list of things I'd like to see in the modethat aren't in Madden 17 (better free agency, coordinators, more salaryoptions, etc.), but I can't throw the baby out with the bathwater. Being ableto take the risk of rushing players back from injury and the way injuries canaffect your management of the new practice squad is satisfying, as are playersregressing because of injury and highlighting which players develop faster thanothers. These features, as well as formation subs (in franchise mode) and thestreamlined weekly game-planning, are relatively small potatoes compared to theoverhaul in scouting, ownership, and other GM functions that ConnectedFranchise mode needs, but they are useful.Madden 17's various online modes like UltimateTeam stay largely the same, but at least features that were added post-launchto Madden 16, such as ranked salary cap matches and playing against friends inDraft Champions, remain. One Ultimate Team addition worth mentioning isChemistry styles, which expands and makes prominent the boost styles from lastyear.Gamersoften use the term ~.5~ as a derisive tag for a title merely being a half steptoward the series' next evolution. While I agree Madden 17 isn't a leapforward, the fact that it rides Madden 16's coattails while creating its own (thanksto the commentary system and some of the trench play)doesn't make it abad title. If you asked me which I'd rather have  a new franchise mode orthe improved line play that's now in the game, it's hard to ignore what I'veactually experienced versus a hypothetical. The game is better because of it,and there's no going back.", "date": "Aug 23, 2016", "grade": "8.5"}
