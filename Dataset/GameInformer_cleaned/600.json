Helldivers is different. While the hordes ofenemies are just as endless, limited ammo and the ever-threatening presence offriendly fire create a more challenging and calculated shooter.Full disclosure: I haven't beaten Helldivers yet, andneither has anyone else. Arrowhead's less subtle take on Starship Troopers tasks players with ~defending~ Super Earth byexterminating a trio of extraterrestrial races, and that galactic conquest is acommunity-driven campaign that takes 4-6 weeks to complete. While this meta-structureis a clever addition, it's ultimately little more than window-dressing for thefrantic, co-op focused action. You play Helldivers for the thrill of eachindividual battle, not the outcome of the larger war.Helldivers offers a simple-yet-satisfying gameplay loop. Youselect your warfront (bugs, cyborgs, or the alien Illuminate), a randomizedplanet to battle on (from one of 12 difficulty levels), and then completemissions to level up your helldiver, unlock new gear, and upgrade your existingarmaments before jumping back into the fray. This basic structure has asurprising amount of variety; each of the three alien races features differentenemy types and fighting styles, and objectives offer a healthy number ofvariations on taking and defending points, blowing up enemy encampments, andescorting. Three planet types (jungle, desert, and snow) mix things up further,as do special hours-long attack and defend events that pop up every couple ofdays and award bonus XP.Like Diablo III, each procedurally generated map inHelldivers feels unique and familiar at the same time, as does themoment-to-moment gameplay; I grew comfortable mowing down countless swarms ofhostile aliens (ideally with three friends at my side) while sprinting from oneobjective to the next. Brief pauses in the action are typically used to call down strategems from theheavens to aid you in combat and hopefully keep you alive for what always seemslike a last-second extraction.Strategems are the real draw of Helldivers' deep progressionsystem and gameplay variety, supplying you with everything from rocketlaunchers and airstrikes to your own overpowered mech. Surviving higherdifficulty levels requires coordinating who brings what to the fight andworking in constant unison, but even on lower difficulty levels, Helldiversdoubles down on communication and teamwork; you're just as likely to be offedby an inaccurate squadmate or your own automated turret as an enemy ambush.Even after the unlocks dry up, the challenge and camaraderie that Helldivers offers makes it hard not to attempt ~just one more mission~with your friends, a proposition made all the more enticing by the inclusion offour-player couch co-op. I still don't know how the community-driven galacticcampaign will shake out over the coming weeks, but contributing to the largerwar effort is just one more welcome excuse to enlist.The EdgeHelldivers is a cross-buy, cross-play, cross-save title for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Vita. While the core gameplay is identical, the loading times, visuals, and framerate get steadily worse across the three respective platforms, making the PS4 version the clear favorite.", "date": "Mar 03, 2015", "grade": "8.5"}
