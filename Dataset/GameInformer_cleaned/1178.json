{"name": "Divekick", "ref": "https://www.gameinformer.com/games/divekick/b/playstation_vita/archive/2013/09/18/divekick-review.aspx", "text": "At the onset, Divekick is as simple as a fighting game could be. There are no complicated directional inputs and only two button commands: dive and kick. The first to land a hit wins the round. Its an interesting approach to accessibility that makes it an easy sell to those that typically shy away from complex fighters. But just beneath the freewheeling, goofy exterior of Divekick is a layer of complexity that might scare off newcomers as fast as it brought them in. Once the concept of diving and kicking has set in, new questions arise. What are those meters for? Why is this guy teleporting? How come you can jump backwards?Divekicks roster includes 13 absurd characters that serve to lampoon fighting-game tropes or parody notable figures in that community. Its a diverse group with very distinct play styles. Aside from the obvious differences in dive speed or kick angle, each character has two special moves  one on the ground and one in the air. Pressing both buttons simultaneously executes your special, which depending on your character, may have you hover in the air, shoot a fireball, or even parry an incoming attack. But even the properties of the basic diving and kicking are specific to each character. Fighting-game veterans will welcome the unexpected depth, but newcomers will have a tough time wrapping their head around some of the mechanics.The story mode helps flesh out the ridiculous cast. The humorous storyboards tell each fighters tale, but gamers likely wont be spending much time in Divekicks single-player mode. Divekick shines the brightest in local multiplayer, which is a blast.If you cant find a partner within arms reach, Divekick does offer minimal online play. Dont expect to get a large lobby going with your online friends  Divekicks definition of a lobby is a room of two people. Technically, two people is a group, but its not exactly a party. Direct invites are impossible; creating a private lobby merely opens up a spot to anyone on your friends list, but they have to search for it specifically while in-game. Both ranked and unranked matches are offered, but again, without a local group of people to play with, Divekick loses most of its appeal.Divekick is saturated with inside jokes and parody from the fighting-game community. For example, one of Mr. Ns win poses mimics an incident in which his real-life counterpart, a pro gamer named Marn, unsuccessfully attempts to put his arm around a female interviewer. The exchange isnt all that amusing on its own, but knowing that this really happened makes it worth a chuckle. That type of humor is consistent throughout. It doesnt necessarily alienate those who arent in on the jokes, but without context, it just comes across as odd.In the right environment and with the right people, Divekick offers some fun. But the lack of online lobbies drastically limits those opportunities. Like most novelties, the fun of Divekick is short-lived.", "date": "Oestreicher on Sep 18, 2013", "grade": "6.5"}
