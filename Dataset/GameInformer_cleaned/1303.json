So could rediscoveringthe long-forgotten methods of blacksmithing that let your foundries churn outchainmail armor that shrugs off your enemies' primitive clubs. Learning tocommunicate with reclusive storm dragons and charging into battle with thepowerful beasts at your side is another of dozens of ways to emerge victoriousin this fantasy empire-builder. Every one is worth exploring, thanks to theskill with which Legendary Heroes is executed.Legendary Heroes isexactly the kind of quality release that developer Stardock needs to win fansback after the disastrous 2010 release of Elemental: War of Magic. It isn't perfect,and the AI has a few glaring blind spots that are hard to forgive, but buildinga fantasy empire and developing superhuman heroes to lead magical and monstrousarmies to victory hasn't been this fun in years. This standaloneexpansion-to-an-expansion directly addresses the worst issues from last year'sFallen Enchantress while also fixing dozens of lesser problems and mercilesslyhacking away at tedium. The result is an undeniable improvement on an alreadyfun game.Rather than basingLegendary Heroes around adding new systems and content as the ~expansion~moniker implies, Stardock instead chose to re-examine Fallen Enchantress fromthe ground up. From completely changing the way cities grow to redrawing thelayout of individual battlefields, the developers have improved the gamewithout adding more stuff to the rich set of interlocking systems. You're stillgrowing an empire turn by turn, but the process is smoother and more fun acrossthe board in both the strategic map and in the tactical turn-based battles.Combat has undergone themost dramatic change, and not just because it's the flashiest part of the game.I've conquered empires and slain elemental lords with a variety of strategies,from summoned monsters screening ice-flinging mages to armored footmen grindingthe enemy down through sheer endurance. Several improvements combine to take itfrom the largely trivial sideshow of Fallen Enchantress to a legitimatelyinteresting tactical puzzle. Redesigned battlefields offer chokepoints thatcreate meaningful decisions about unit placement. Abilities fromweapon-specific attacks to hero-cast spells offer more interesting wild cardsthat are better-balanced than before. Rebalanced attack/defense values and theswarm mechanic (which gives bonuses for surrounding your enemies) make itnearly impossible for a few heavily armored units to slaughter entire armieswithout taking losses, which was a serious problem in the last game. Theground-up reworking of units, weapons, armor, spells, and everything else is amassive success that gives players real choices in how they approach buildingand commanding armies to a level far beyond that of the last game.Many other elements havebeen altered, and unanimously for the better. The diplomatic prestige resourcehas been removed entirely, as trading gold serves the same function. Heroes nowlevel along defined trait trees rather than choosing from a randomly generatedlist at level-up, which sacrifices diversity between playthroughs for a muchgreater gain in terms of balance. The complex, unintuitive encumbrance model hasbeen scrapped in favor of simple initiative modifiers. The full list is far toolengthy to address point-by-point, but as a dedicated strategy gamer I foundmyself delighted at yet another newly discovered tweak well past the fifty-hourmark with Legendary Heroes.(click screen to enlarge)The AI no longer suffersfrom the awful problems it had concentrating armies in Fallen Enchantress -enemy empires can and will stack up sufficient technologically advanced troopsand powerful heroes to threaten well-defended cities - but it does have disappointingfailures and blind spots. Armies seem to get stuck when their paths are cut offby a rival or monster unit, often idling for several turns (or much longer onoccasion) before setting off on a new mission. The AI also loves to build tonsof decent-but-not-great units and stack them well beyond the limit for joininga battle at once. This is a horrendous mismanagement of resources, sinceLegendary Heroes still significantly favors smaller numbers of elite troopsover mediocre hordes. The problem is much less pronounced than in FallenEnchantress thanks to the combat rework, but the overall higher quality barmakes the issues the AI still has stick out.Diplomacy is hardlypresent in Legendary Heroes. The vast sums of money required to bribe your way intoa rival faction's good graces can be much better spent conquering them, and therudimentary calculations that the AI appears to go through in determining whoits friends and enemies are leave much to be desired. In nearly all cases, it'snot a matter of if you'll go to war with an enemy, but when. I don'tparticularly mind the overall effect since Legendary Heroes makes no bonesabout being a wargame first and a diplomatic simulation somewhere around 38th,but be warned that this is about as far from Total War's careful manipulationof alliances and betrayals as it is from Animal Crossing.(click screen to enlarge)The endgame is rarelyengaging. The peaceful method is as boring as it typically is inempire-building games, and involves little more than assaulting the end turnbutton while the requisite pieces fall into place (bribing the remainingleaders into alliances or building the towers that enable the Spell of Making).Conquering the world through force is fun up until the two best stacks in thegame collide; after that point the emphasis on elite troops usually means thatthe surviving army can cruise through any remaining resistance. Completing theMaster Quest involves taking on a massive dragon-riding boss, which would be acooler fight if it weren't so easy to defeat with any army capable of making itto that point. None of the options are particularly enthralling, though neitherare they so awful that I find myself abandoning playthroughs once victory islikely. After Total War: Shogun II and its expansions showed the world what anexciting strategy endgame can be, I'm no longer as forgiving of the genre'straditionally boring mop-up phase as I once was.The better class ofempire-building strategy games is renowned for replayability thanks to randomlygenerated maps that present unique challenges on each playthrough. LegendaryHeroes doesn't lead the pack in this regard, but I have thoroughly enjoyedmyself across dozens of restarts. Each city needs to build enough of the samecore buildings that empire development feels roughly equivalent every time,though experimenting with different tactical approaches and research focusesmakes each game unique to some degree. Every once in a while, a rare hero oritem that changes the rules shows up; obliterating entire enemy armies with ahero-class wildling shaman's unique flame-throwing attack is a starklydifferent experience than anything else I've tried, as is stealing enemy soulswith a one-of-a-kind skeletal mage and then using that mana to raise volcanoesunder enemy strongholds. None of LegendaryHeroes' rough spots keep it from being an excellent game that I recommend withno reservations. Stardock has finally delivered on the promise that Elementalonce held, back in the halcyon days of 2009. You don't have to be any kind ofstrategy savant to appreciate what this exceptional release has to offer.", "date": "May 29, 2013", "grade": "8.5"}
