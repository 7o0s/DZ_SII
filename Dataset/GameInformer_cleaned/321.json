With littlemore than a silent protagonist, a grand orchestral score, and a few excerpts ofexposition, Unravel delivers style and soul, even if the puzzle mechanics arethreadbare.Unravel stars Yarny, an anthropomorphic yarn doll whotravels back through the memories of an elderly woman. The string from Yarny'sbody constantly unravels as he navigates the environments, and serves as theprimary mechanic for solving puzzles. The first few levels of Unravel arefilled with wonder. You swing from branches, build yarn bridges, and bounceyour way over obstacles. Much of the gameplay is reminiscent ofLittleBigPlanet, but Unravel benefits from tighter platforming controls, andthe realistic environments sell the fantasy of being a little characterexploring a big, dangerous world.Unfortunately, the sense of discovery and awe is fleeting.While each level takes you through a different chapter in the elderly woman'slife (with new settings, emotional themes, and obstacles), your solutions arealways the same. You continually roll around rocks, apples, and snowballs tohop over high ledges, and slide objects up and down your constructed yarnbridges  usually to also hop over high ledges. None of Unravel's puzzles areparticularly challenging; the few times I got stuck it was from overthinkingthe problem at hand.Without evolving gameplay mechanics, Coldwood Interactiveinstills a sense of progression by introducing more difficult action sequences anddeadly objects. Unravel's checkpoints are generous, but since most dangers killyou in a single hit, some frustrating sections kill you repeatedly before you getthe timing of Yarny's actions just right.Despite the puzzle repetition, the changing environments andstory kept me engaged with the adventure. Each level fills in the elderlywoman's photo album with images from her past along with light exposition ofher (and Yarny's) emotional journey. The narrative has some ambiguity,conveying themes of love, loss, and coming to peace with the past  both throughthe expanding photo book and through the tone of the levels you visit.With just a dozen levels, Unravel's brief six-hour runtime stillproves too long for the basic puzzle mechanics. However, the satisfyingplatforming, thoughtful story, and adorable protagonist make it a worthwhilejourney. I grew tired of repeating the same puzzle solutions, but seeingUnravel through to the end was still a treat.", "date": "Feb 08, 2016", "grade": "7.75"}
