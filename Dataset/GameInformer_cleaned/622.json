The developer provided play sessions at virtually every gamingconvention over the past year, and offered fans extended alpha and betasessions before release. That ~proof is in the pudding~ approach revealed thecore gameplay experience of Evolve, but also opened the door to questions aboutits breadth and longevity. At long last, the final game is here, and remainstrue to what we've seen before; Evolve is a concentrated and highly replayableexperience, if you can accept the limitations of its unique format.Evolve offers up the flimsiest of narratives to frame itsendless 4v1 conflicts. A burgeoning human colony on planet Shear has beenoverrun by giant monsters, and it's up to a ragtag crew of disparate hunters tohold them off and save whatever fleeing civilians they can. Like in Left 4Dead, all of the character building happens through in-game chatter, which getsrepetitive since players are limited to the first four hunters until theyunlock new playable characters to spark additional conversation.Turtle Rock has made a concerted attempt at fleshing outthese hunters' personalities, but Evolve lacks the emergent narrative of Left 4Dead; it simply feels like a series of loosely connected multiplayer matches.As such, gameplay is king, and Turtle Rock succeeds in serving up two verydifferent experiences depending on which side of the fight you're on. While Ienjoy the occasional bout as one of Shear's untamed beasts, the cooperativefocus of the hunters is the greater draw for me  especially when teaming upwith friends.Friends aren't a necessity when playing Evolve, but it'simportant to note that single-player is just multiplayer with bots, and theA.I. performs admirably in some cases and falls flat on its face in others.Computer-controlled monsters are appropriately challenging, knowing when tofeed and stage up, when to attack, and when to retreat. A.I. hunters areusually competent, but a single mistake can spell doom for your entire crew,and those errors often stem from your bot companions. You can take over A.I.teammates with the press of a button, but staying on top of your own abilitiesin the middle of a showdown is work enough, so trying to juggle anothercharacter's skills rarely ends well. That said, humans are far more compellingto play with and against anyway, and matches don't require much in the way ofverbal communication, so even random online squads are a viable and fun option (afteryou mute the insult-spewing mouth breathers that plague every online game).Matches are surprisingly fair, regardless of who is playing.A certain balance in the chaos comes from the sheer variety of playablecharacters, abilities, and match-affecting bonuses. My win/loss ratio hasstayed impressively even, especially in the main attraction: evacuation mode.These five-round pseudo-campaigns sport an auto-balance feature, an overarchingpuppet master that keeps things as even as possible between rounds. Evacuationmode still doesn't tell much of a story, but the civilians you're saving (or killing)carry over from one round to the next and give a greater sense of weight toeach victory and defeat  not to mention a healthy amount of bonus XP thatspeeds up the leveling process.Evolve's progression system was criticized during the beta,but is less of an issue in the final release. Unlocking the next hunter in agiven class requires gaining a one-star rating in each of the currentcharacter's weapons and abilities. A few of these challenges are annoyingdistractions (like stealth resurrecting creatures as Lazarus), but most makesense in the context of your role on the team and force you to use your wholerepertoire. I had every character unlocked by about the 20-hour mark. Newhunters and monsters pop up with satisfying regularity, and you can always spamcustom and solo matches for the more obscure challenges.Longer-form progression is largely absent. After you'veunlocked the last playable character, all you have to look forward to areincremental stat upgrades to your weapons, a few character skins, andcustomizable avatar badges. If you're a Call of Duty player who needs anendless stream of unlockables to you keep you interested, you need to lookelsewhere. Loving Evolve requires loving the minute-to-minute experience.Ultimately, that experience is rather limited. No, notbecause of Evolve's monster count  despite all the pre-release whining aboutthere only being three monsters, I still have fun going up against each beastafter countless matches (even if Wraith is a total pain). Rather, thelimitation lies in the 4v1 format itself. Nest, Rescue, and Defend are allinteresting variations on Evolve's base Hunt mode, but they're still onlyvariations (and are also not currently available as one-off skirmishes inonline matchmaking). I would've liked more in the way of variety andchallenges, even if it means occasionally straying from the asymmetricalfive-player formula.As it is, Evolve does its one thing remarkably well, and thefew other gripes I have  including long, multi-stage load times and theinability to customize A.I. teammates when playing with friends  don't dampenmy enthusiasm for playing more. Evolve's matchups offer a lot of replayabilityand competitive thrills, and I can see myself returning to it consistently in thefollowing months  even if those play sessions do inevitably end with melusting for more to do in the world.The EdgeAs expected, there are some visual differences between the three platforms. PC users have the clear advantage in resolution, effects, and frame rate. The disparities between the home consoles are less obvious, but PlayStation 4 has a slight graphical edge over Xbox One. Ultimately, however, you should play the game on whatever platform you and your friends prefer  the visual differences arent significant enough to change the overall experience.", "date": "Feb 11, 2015", "grade": "8.5"}
