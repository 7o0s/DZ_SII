Every important event good or bad shapes the person you are, and taking away these tribulations would change who you eventually become. As we've seen across time-travel fiction,going into the past and future and changing events can have huge repercussions.The latest episode of Life is Strange explores more of this concept, showing charactersat their worst and explaining how these events have affected them. Life is Strange is doing a great job at acknowledgingchoices  big and small you've made. The biggest choice came at the end ofthe previous episode, which determined whether you saved a certain character'slife. This chapter focuses on the aftermath of this event and characters'reactions. Because I was able to save the aforementioned character, Max hasbeen made into a town hero of sorts, but it hardly feels like a victory. Thingsare still chaotic, with corruption and supernatural occurrences abounding. Thepacing has slowed down to give Max time to make sense of it all and repair herbroken friendship with Chloe. I enjoyed learning more about the past they share,especially seeing what led to Chloe's rebellious path. The writing is still at its best when it's tapping into rawemotions, like Chloe confronting her feelings about her father's tragic death,and Max's guilt at letting their friendship fall to the wayside. In a lot ofways, this episode has mellowed characters' personalities; it feels like you'rejust seeing people at their worst  not crazy exaggerated archetypes. The bestpart doesn't come until Chaos Theory's finale, though. This is when Life isStrange turns everything on its head, showing the true dangers of messing withtime. It focuses on the temptations that come with Max's strange power, which Ireally enjoyed. I gasped at the episode's final moments, and I can't wait tosee what's next.My problems with Chaos Theory revolve around the gameplayand puzzles being too obtuse. I found this particularly frustrating in asequence that has you sneaking past the principal to get out of the dorms atnight. The game makes it seem like you can get around him by sneaking around inthe environment, but you're supposed to use your time-travel powers. It wouldhave been great to have a reminder of this after I failed a few times. Also, in another sequence, I needed to findingredients to cook, but the eggs aren't in a logical place (like the fridge)  they're in an entirely different room. The character I'm helping doesn'tprovide even the slightest hint.I like that Dontnod is keeping actual puzzles in, but a lot ofthese are just boring fetch quests where you're scouring the environment for ahidden item. However, one stealth sequence was done well and stands as anexample of what I'd like to see more. In this scenario, I broke into an area andhad to avoid a guard searching for me with his flashlight. I had funoutsmarting him and liked the tension of possibly getting caught. As for thechoices, Chaos Theory didn't have as many hard or intriguing ones as I wouldhave liked, but the surprising ending of the episode makes up for it.Life is Strange's story continues to beinteresting. I like being blindsided by where the plot is going next, and itreally is a different kind of video game experience. I keep wondering how someof my choices will play out, and I'm invested in these characters and theworld. Hopefully, Dontnod can make everything between the characters' strugglesand supernatural occurrences feel satisfying and pay off in the end.
