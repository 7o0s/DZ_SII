{"name": "Si torna in pista!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/94848-dance-central-2-si-torna-in-pista.html", "text": "The game requires Kinect for Xbox 360The new Microsoft peripheral that detects our body to use it as a control system is now in the homes of many of us, as well as a large lineup of available titles. Between a sport and a fitness course, the sequel to the excellent Dance Central could not be missing, the dance game that was most successful for the new Xbox camera. Kinect is able to ~map~ us from head to toe and one of its characteristics is precisely that of detecting movements. What better occasion to create the ultimate rhythm game? The first chapter turned out to be one of the best titles in the initial lineup, but suffered from a certain lack of options and modes. Let's find out together if the developers have been able to fix the shot. Every day I'm shuffling! The best-selling dance game for Kinect, the ads read. And it's really true because Dance Central immediately conquered a considerable slice of the public thanks to its undoubted qualities as a fun rhytm game and punctual and precise controls thanks to one of the best uses that could be made of the Kinect camera. The Harmonix guys have always had experience with musical titles, starting with their greatest success, Rock Band. On Xbox 360 it was ~only~ to create yet another dance game, but one that managed to amaze everyone thanks to the 1:1 mapping of the player's body. The first chapter already worked wonders, showing for the first time to the world what that magic box that looks at us, observes us and reproduces our every little movement on the screen is capable of. But it is with Dance Central 2 that we surpass ourselves by implementing the new Kinect features in force on Xbox 360 after the system update: voice controls, more precision, less lag, more players on screen at the same time. And here the conditions for making ~the best of the best~ magically materialize without effort: Dance Central 2 is clearly superior to the first chapter. First of all for the music, a primary factor for a game of this kind. There are 44 songs on the disc, and it is also possible to import all the songs from the first chapter by simply entering a code that you can find on the back of the original Dance Central instruction booklet (but don't get confused, don't enter the one contained in the box by Dance Central 2!). The only drawback, this operation costs 400 Microsoft Points, and although the monetary value is small, one wonders why pay for something that we have already purchased, although it is very convenient to have all the songs available without having to change discs and restart the game. In addition, there are already dozens of unreleased songs on the marketplace to download to further expand the available tracklist. Furthermore, in the game package there is a code that gives us 240 points to download a song to our liking. The beauty of Dance Central 2, in addition to the vast catalogue, also lies in its quality: almost all successful songs, from the past or new ones, but in any case always suitable for the context and to satisfy every kind of palate, from the lover of hip hop to those who only follow radio hits, from dance enthusiasts to electronics enthusiasts. Heterogeneity is one of the strong points of the Harmonix title. But what news does Dance Central 2 reserve for us? First of all the most welcome: the simultaneous multiplayer of two people. So just ~switch~ on the fly mid-song with our partner / opponent, in DC2 we face everything together, both in cooperative and competitive mode. It is also possible to create personalized playlists, but no ~shuffle~ option has been included to send random songs in rotation, a useful function for example during a party. The menus are treated as in the first chapter, stylish, essential and very functional even a short distance from the TV (which is rare in Kinect games). Accuracy in video response was one of Dance Central's strengths, and in this sequel it has been further increased thanks to the unprecedented sensitivity in 1:1 movement mapping that the Kinect update has given to its software. Dance lovers will be thrilled, once again, in front of the heterogeneous and vast tracklist made available on the Dance Central 2 disc: like the first chapter, here we are again in front of a super mix of pop, hip hop and dance that inserts many great successes of the past and many novelties. The complete 44-track list includes global hits like Rude Boy (Rihanna), Club Can't Handle Me (Flo Rida), Born This Way (Lady Gaga), Like A G6 (Far East Movement), DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love (Usher), Sexy Chick (David Guetta) and Nothin' On You (B.O.B.). But besides the super hits there are also hip hop classics like Right Thurr by Chingy, Get Ur Freak On by Missy Elliott, Last Night by P Diddy, dance music like Sandstorm by Darude, and songs for young people like Somebody To Love by Justin Bieber or Whip My Hair by Willow Smith. In short, there is once again something for all tastes: adults, children, truzzi, tamarri and black music lovers. Xbox 360 goals The new benchmark of dance games for Xbox 360 puts on the plate the canonical 1000 points to unlock retail games, divided into 50 objectives. Not easy to achieve, since we have to win the trust of all the crews, at all difficulty levels (it won't be a walk in the park since the difficulty level is often very high). 80% of goals are conquered like this: sweating in the true sense of the word. The rest simply by playing it and trying to win stars, earn points, level up. Harmonix Got Us Fallin' In Love The novelties of Dance Central 2 do not stop at multiplayer, but also invest those who want to play alone: Harmonix has inserted a sort of ~story~ in which we have to delve into the gangs of dancers to win their trust with ballets and choreography. By completing song after song you level up and unlock new clothes and accessories, gain the trust of the crew and challenge other dancers. Completing all challenges, with all teams, at all levels won't be child's play. Moreover, there is also an ultimate goal: to defeat the bad guy on duty (but we prefer to leave this to you as a surprise). Furthermore, the new Kinect firmware finally allows it to be able to manage voice commands, a control mode that Dance Central 2 makes quite sparing and limited use of, relegating it to the management of some basic commands such as ~slow down~, ~record~ or ~ skip~ song within training mode. You can also upload your photos to the game server, for the sharing freaks. Little else to say about a title that has only one goal: to make you dance and have fun with friends, a goal fully achieved on the other hand. However, we can and must mention the fact that the graphic style has been drastically changed, veering on toon shading accompanied by a character design that winks a lot at the orientals. An operation certainly designed to make the game more international and also make it attractive to a different audience (women and children in particular). It's a matter of taste, of course, but we liked the previous style better, also because the new one comes with a few more playlists. One of the shortcomings of Dance Central 2 absolutely to be solved: the lack of online modes that pit two dancers from one side of the world to the other, a factor that would dramatically expand longevity and the desire to always deal with new people even when not We always had a friend on our bedside table. You could create online crews, custom logos, custom moves, unique dances choreographed by your own body, challenges, bets, there are hundreds of ideas for such a game and we'd like to see some of them in the next Dance Central 3.", "date": "2011-10-25", "grade": "8.7"}
