The male protagonist is called Max, and he is the classic good-looking womanizer wannabe rock star who doesn't love rules; while Anne, the female protagonist, is an impeccable little fellow who hides inside her always tidy uniform a mad desire to give vent to her primordial instincts. Let's immediately clarify that the game system, which we will describe in the next paragraph, is identical for both. What changes, however, are the plots of the stories and, of course, the events that will lead to the coupling at the end of the game (after all we are talking about appointments). Roommates is set in an American college, even if the style of the drawings tries to follow that of Japanese genre games (not completely succeeding). As it is obvious that it is, the visual novel component is very strong and, in a certain sense, predominant. Therefore, expect the stories of the boys and their relationships to be told by hundreds of lines of text, with continuous dialogues describing what is happening, while the silhouettes of the characters involved remain fixed against the images of the environments (at best they move, but without animations ), although they have different expressions depending on the situation and the dialogue. From this point of view we are perfectly within the canons of the genre and there is little to complain about. But let's go in order and try to understand how an appointment simulator works, also because it's not a very popular genre in our country. Impress The idea behind each dating simulator is to allow the player to manage a part of the life of a person, man or woman, making sure that he gets to conquer a partner or a partner he likes. How does all this nice talk translate in terms of game mechanics? In Roommates in a weekly schedule of activities, interspersed with special events. Let's explain better. After the introductory dialogue sequence, which serves to introduce the selected character and supporting characters, you will enter the management screen. Here we will have to select the activities that our hero will have to carry out throughout the week, taking into consideration some fundamental factors. Managing planning is really easy at the interface level. Each day is divided into three time slots (morning, afternoon and evening) and for each one it is possible to decide what to do. For example, in the morning you can study or sleep, while in the evening you can play a game of chess, play a paper role-playing game or go out and go to a pub to have a beer with friends. If we need some money we can do some chores, like cleaning a garden or being a clerk in a bookstore and so on. Each activity is linked to a certain characteristic of the protagonist (creativity, physical activity, spontaneity, and so on) which, in turn, can be useful for impressing a certain character. In fact, it soon becomes clear that there is no need to set the weekly activities at random. Taking into account the need for rest and study, one must plan one's choices based on the goal one has decided to achieve, that is the partner with whom one wants to cheerfully exchange moods. So if we wanted to hook up with a girl who loves spontaneity, that trait needs to grow, while to get laid with a painter you need to be creative and so on. Start from the principle that, unless you select the easiest difficulty level among the three available, which allows you to grow the characteristics faster than the other two, it is not possible to maximize them all by the end of the game. So you have to choose well. Two protagonists, many friends, all possible partners in the dating simulator Roommates One or both? Depending on your preferences, you can choose whether to purchase one or both Roommates playable characters. By purchasing them together you will save something, while we recommend purchasing a single character only if you have no intention of playing with the other at all. Given the choice, between the two we recommend Anne, whose stories are better written than Max's. The art of seduction Roommates is not just an activity to be carried out. As we mentioned above, events will also happen during the game, which will serve to get closer or away from the other characters. Events occur with some regularity while going about the normal activities of life. Basically they are narrative sequences in which you are called to make choices. Startlmentally you can decide whether or not to take part in an event (doing it costs energy), so you have to read what happens and decide which action to take, favoring one of the characters involved, so as to improve the relationship with the protagonist. Obviously you will have already understood how the choices work in the player's head, which will tend to favor the supporting character with whom you want to develop a relationship. From this point of view Roommates is quite schematic and never really gets in trouble. The choices are always pretty obvious, except on some occasions (at the Halloween party, for example), and it's not hard to figure out what to do to get a certain result. It is actually a common feature in dating simulators, much more interested in allowing the player to follow the stories of the characters, rather than making his life complicated with controversial or opaque choices that could ruin the story. In fact, the game system is completely bent on narrative needs, which is not a bad thing since fans are looking for just that. To compensate for the not very high difficulty, even if things get more interesting on a hard level, the wealth of content takes care of it. Let's say that to unlock all the images in the gallery, i.e. to maximize all the possible love stories with all the characters (Roommates provides heterosexual love stories and homosexual love stories for both Anne and Max) it will take several hours , also because at least once you have to read all the texts, which are so many. In later games some things can be skipped, but it will still take some time to get through. Scattered drawings and notes As you may have understood, Roommates definitely has the amount of content on its side, both in terms of situations and in terms of drawings. However, there are also contraindications, which do not make us reject it but which lead us to prefer other titles of the same genre (although not in an absolute sense). Let's just take the drawings. Sure, as pointed out, there are many, but the average quality is lower than titles like Always Remember Me, another dating simulator, also by Winter Wolves. They are not ugly, mind you, but they are more anonymous and less incisive than seen elsewhere. We won't comment on the stories themselves except in these terms: do you like college love plots that oscillate between the romantic and the alluring, seasoned with double meanings and with some explicit jokes? If the answer is yes, then you will like the stories of Roommates, also considering the added value of love stories between all genders.", "date": "2014-08-19", "grade": "7.8"}
