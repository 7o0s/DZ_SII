Released in the original version for Super Nintendo in 1992 has been repeatedly revised and corrected: in 1998 it was enriched with two unpublished films in FMV in a collection designed for PlayStation, while in 2006 it underwent a graphic update and an addition of content in the Advance version released precisely for Game Boy Advance. Among the most relevant innovations, the new dungeon ~The Sealed Temple~, the unpublished boss Enuo (designed by Tetsuya Nomura, the same artist who had dealt with the first release), and four new classes should be mentioned. In 2012 it was further refined for landing on mobile devices, with a touch screen-oriented graphical interface and new sprites created by Kazuko Shibuya, another member of the original development team. This edition has arrived on Steam, which has proved to be less convincing than the one for Android, for easily imaginable reasons: the first obviously concerns the technical aspect. Although improved, the resolution of textures and characters is too low for large monitors such as those of desktop PCs, where the pixel density, compared to small smartphone screens, is lower. To this bleak picture we must add the almost total absence of animations (during the clashes the characters remain motionless and only the values of the wounds inflicted or suffered appear) which makes this hasty conversion even more difficult to digest. Then there are certain ~extravagances~ that it was reasonable to expect resolved at least in this release: the reference is in particular to the portraits of the characters that are absolutely different from the basic sprites that are controlled. Just to give an example, Faris is represented with a gray hairstyle, while in reality she has pink hair; the protagonist Bartz, on the other hand, has an interlocutory androgynous appearance that absolutely does not suit his two-dimensional counterpart. As if that weren't enough, the title has compatibility problems with Windows 10 that prevent it from running in full screen: fortunately, it is sufficient to tick the Windows 7 compatible mode to bypass this obstacle. For those who care about substance, however, with Final Fantasy V they will find bread for their teeth because the contents are many and guarantee a very high gaming experience. For those who care about substance Final Fantasy V guarantees a very rich experience, but the quality is lacking A story of friendship As mentioned, the player plays Bartz, a wandering orphan who is lounging under a tree alongside the beloved chocobo Boko. Suddenly the earth shakes and the two seek shelter: on their way they cross Lenna, daughter of King Leothas, while she is being kidnapped by a group of goblins. After saving the girl, our discovers that the earthquake was caused by the breaking of the crystal of the air and that the princess is rushing to the aid of her father who had gone to the temple of the element to see what was happening. Soon the forgetful Galuf and the pirate Faris will also join the crew: the four will thus form a group charged by fate with preserving the crystals of fire, earth and water from the clutches of the ruthless wizard Exdeath who wishes to destroy them in order to control the world. The narrative canvas, while not shining for originality, manages to capture the attention for the usual excellent characterization of the protagonists, each of whom has a very defined personality with which one immediately enters into harmony. There is no shortage of moments of hilarity given by animations which, however rudimentary, can be convincing: dubbing in Italian certainly helps to identify oneself, despite some gross mistakes that could have been avoided. The structure is obviously that (we are still talking about Final Fantasy) of the tradition of Japanese role-playing games: the player maneuvers Bartz on the world map, bouncing from one point to another in search of the location in which to continue in the main story or, more trivially, to discover some dungeon full of challenges. The fights are random: as you move around the world map you are thrown onto the battlefield at CPU free will. Here, as always, what matters is the correct management of the party. One of the aspects that makes Final Fantasy V still relevant today is the presence of classes (or, as written in the menu, of ~jobs~) with which to specialize party members: the range of professions expands with increasing experience deThe character and each one grants specific abilities. For example, the white mage can use healing magic, while the swordsman, being able to wield shields, has the ability to provide shelter to his companions under attack. Not all professions actually prove to be particularly effective and probably one of the most stimulating challenges proposed by the Square Enix title consists precisely in the composition of a team that knows how to mix the strengths of the four members. However, it must be said that the level of challenge, while settling on good levels, is not so prohibitive as to require extremely refined tactics: towards the end of the game, even the toughest monsters become within the reach of the majority of the parties. As we wrote, the graphic sector disappoints, even if the tables on which the battles take place and numerous locations manage to maintain a certain charm despite the very high weight of the years. The one that has aged the best is certainly the soundtrack by Nobuo Uematsu which we hear here in the remixed version for the most recent systems and which aligns with the unattainable standards to which the production of the master of the Rising Sun has accustomed us. The number of hours required to complete the game is also impressive, which can easily exceed forty: from this point of view, Final Fantasy V continues to fear few rivals, despite the springs on its shoulders.", "date": "2015-11-17", "grade": "5.5"}
