{"name": "Colin McRae Rally 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/colin-mcrae-rally-3_a.html", "text": "Ready? Street! The first thing that awaits you, once you start the game, is an initial selection screen with a very successful design: Championship, Courses, Options and Extras are the four possible choices at your disposal. The universe of the new Colin McRae Rally has as its core the championship mode which will project you, in less than no time, aboard the Scottish driver's Ford Focus. Immediately a small defect: it is not possible to select the car with which to compete. Once on the ~track~, you will slowly begin to appreciate all the wonder that the Codemaster title offers. The road test Let's leave aside for the moment the technical discourse and the running of the world championship, the most important thing to analyze in a rally game is certainly the behavior of the racing car that you will find yourself controlling. So here comes the good news: the third act of the saga proposes, refining it, the serious and credible driving model that has given so much success to the series in the past. The feeling of being able to control drifts is something that only Codemaster can convey and the absence of the famous ~bar of soap~ effect will give more than one satisfaction to lovers of dirty driving on four wheels. So forget the slip-ups of Vrally 3, the setting of the title is decidedly more realistic albeit far from the simulation. Asphalt, earth, gravel, mud, ice, snow... these are the various conditions of the road on which you will compete and the differences will soon make themselves felt enough to force you to change your driving style. The reverse of the medal is easily imaginable: the game is neither easy nor immediate. Someone could now feel disoriented and indecisive, perhaps oriented towards buying something different, my personal advice is not to let yourself be discouraged because the experience, once you have properly assimilated control of the car, is really satisfying. One of the major innovations compared to the past is damage management: in the event of various types of accidents (rollovers or collisions with poles, trees, boulders, railings, etc.) the various components of the machine will gradually deteriorate until they break. Gearbox problems, bumpers that come off, glass that breaks, wheels that converge will be the order of the day and will greatly influence the results of the tests and in the most nefarious cases, after having complicated your life, will force you to an ungenerous retirement. Modes, circuits and beautiful company Let's take a small step back and go back to the championship mode. The aim is simple and it is useless to talk about objectives: you will have to face 15 fierce CPU-controlled opponents and win the various rallies to be number one. More interesting is having to face 6 rallies every season. Yes, you read the word season, in total the game offers you the beauty of 8 rallies (the nations represented are different: from rainy Japan to scorching Spain), each of which consists of 6 special stages, 3 for each virtual day competition, plus a super-special final or a test organized on a temporary circuit (think of the competitions that take place every year at the Motorshow). Before each stage of the Championship and in any case, at the start of a race day, the car will be repaired and you can change the car settings from brake balance to steering hardness. For once, the manual proves to be providential for better understanding where changes should be made. However, programmers thinking of developing a product that can be enjoyed by all, propose default settings that certainly prove to be competitive even if they can be refined. Let's recap: 8 Rallyes, 6+1 trials per rally... in total there are 56 different tracks to tackle, it's about 3/4 hours of driving recreated, a truly remarkable effort. All this quantity is accompanied by excellent quality: the design of the courses is really the most varied I have ever seen in a similar title, seeing is believing. Dulcis in fundo, at the end of each world stage, depending on your placement, you will unlock new components that will allow you to experiment with ever more refined settings, new machines and more. The circuits mode offers the possibility to compete, with the main cars of the past world championship, in each of the 56 tracks available. You will not be forced to use the Ford Focus and you will be able to compete with a friend (in turns or in split screen, the choice is up to you) On the options front, we appreciate the one that allows you toenter the screen while the extras are nothing more than footage from other games developed by Codemaster. And finally... Graphics and Sound Two quick words in closing for the technical aspect. The music of the various menus is not enchanting and the roar of the engine is not particularly fascinating, rather the small effects such as the noise of the tires on the ice or a difficult gear change shine. The implementation of the co-pilot is good, the indications are in fact always precise. The visual department is undoubtedly very accurate, beyond some highly evocative landscapes, the three-dimensional models of the machines are truly sensational and maniacally made. Seeing the car get progressively dirty or observing a dangling bumper will fill the gamer's eyes with joy. The view from inside is spectacular, the pilot (still visible even in the classic view from behind) is well animated. Maximum performance is obtained in the event of rain or snow: the wipers will operate to restore a high degree of realism. The graphics engine travels without uncertainties anchored at 50 frames per second, unfortunately it seems that some small compromises have been necessary: some objects on the track are still made in 2D, a popup effect can be seen in the distance which in any case is never annoying and finally the tracks appear a bit bare at times. The video cleanliness is fair, in general one gets the impression that the monolith has been well exploited, despite the cross-platform setting of the Codemaster title. Comment Colin McRae 3 is a majestic work but given its size it could be difficult to digest. Everyone, including beginners, will appreciate the guide model created by Codemaster for the occasion in the long run. The technical improvements compared to the past and the variety of tracks will delight fans of the successful rally series. He kept waiting and it's hard not to appreciate him, easy to love him. Advised. Pros + Cars modeled with maniacal care + Credible driving model + High number of tracks + Very varied course design Cons - Not suitable for arcade lovers - Technically discreet but not flawless It sometimes happens that personalities from the world of sport and entertainment achieve fame thanks to video games, this is certainly the case for the rally driver protagonist of this highly anticipated game, now in its third incarnation: the Scotsman Colin McRae. Lovers of the previous episodes, who have contributed to making the Playstation name great, have been waiting for Colin's debut on the new generation consoles with great patience, I can immediately say that Codemaster has lived up to expectations.", "date": "2003-01-13", "grade": null}
