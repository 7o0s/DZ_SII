On every possible occasion. It is the fault of the halo of holiness that has always surrounded its small but revered development team to which we owe the birthplace of Max Payne and Alan Wake. Or maybe it's because of the charming charisma of its creative director, as well as writer of all the stories starring the characters created by the software house, Sam Lake. Or maybe it's because of its nature as a flashy Xbox One exclusive born out of a thriving alliance with Microsoft that has been going on for more than a decade. Or of its having suddenly become, and with an echo that is still heard in the debates among hardcore gamers, a simultaneous release also on PC. The fact is that a few days after our in-depth hands-on and after a substantial and repeated video coverage, the time has finally come to draw a line and judge this awaited and talked about action adventure in detail. But don't worry because we will try to reduce the spoiler risk to a value close to zero, limiting ourselves to treating the story superficially and focusing on the most discussed aspects of the game and in particular on its gameplay and the narrative structure adopted. So sit back and enjoy reading! Quantum Break is reality and despite some obvious flaws we absolutely loved it. Very. The taste of pre-ordering Microsoft has been able to play the pre-order card well with the new work of Remedy Entertainment. In fact, all players who have pre-ordered Quantum Break on Xbox One will receive a nice gift package: a copy of Alan Wake including the two splendid DLCs, a copy of the spin-off Alan Wake's American Nightmare and a key to activate the game also on Windows 10 While in the case of Alan Wake there is little to add apart from the fact that it will be playable through backwards compatibility with Xbox 360, as far as the PC version of Quantum Break is concerned, information is currently still very scarce. What is known for sure is that the conversion will only work through the Windows Store and the player who takes advantage of this promotion will have to log into the PC with the same username and password used on the Xbox Store to reduce to zero the possibility of exchanging codes even between non- bought the title. Alan Wake Previously on anything else The story told in Quantum Break is distinctly science fiction and tells of time travel gone wrong, of technology capable of altering the space-time continuum and of old friends who in the blink of an eye become bitter and ruthless enemies. It is an adult plot, by no means trivial and, despite the hackneyed assumptions that smell like they have already been seen from miles away, absolutely not obvious. The cast is typical of large productions with a Shawn Ashmore and a Dominic Monaghan who respectively play the role of brothers Jack and William Joyce and an Aidan Gillen very ready to impersonate the cunning of the gang who passed to the dark side, Paul Serene. There are also some supporting actors: some famous faces flanked by secondary actors who, among many high and low ones, certainly know how to do their job. And it is no coincidence that Remedy has decided to use well-known faces to enrich its project given the particular and original mix between sequences rendered with the game engine and scenes shot and recorded live. Probably the greatest peculiarity of Quantum Break, its characteristic element that has left numerous players surprised (and doubtful) since the announcement, is the cross-link with a sort of TV series that somehow accompanies the video game and is directly intertwined with it to the point that it cannot be understood and appreciated without simultaneously playing the title (and vice versa). To go into detail, the Remedy title is divided into five acts, each composed of a variable number of parts (from two to four) which are nothing more than the actual levels. At the end of each act, we will have to face a very small section, the turning point, however commanding Paul Serene, the game's antagonist, and choosing one of the two possible contextual choices that are offered to us. Once a decision has been made, we will be able to watch the episode of the similar TV series which will act as a bridge between the act that has just ended and the next one. We will be able to watch it in streaming or download all the episodes in a single solution for the modest weight of 76 GB. In all there are four episodes, each lasting between twenty and twenty-five minutes. The movies are undoubtedly well done, well shot,with good directing choices, excellent exteriors and some interiors perhaps a little too ~cheap~ but the problem is that the solution adopted doesn't really add anything of interest. It is certainly particular and original to see these long narrative pieces but the exact same result could easily be achieved using normal cutscenes. Among other things, there is always the risk that the most savvy gamer, these twenty-five minutes of total passivity for each episode even annoy. The choices made during the turning point will have small repercussions on what we see next. Don't expect sensational butterfly effects like those seen in Until Dawn or Life is Strange, or even an in-depth system of cause and effect in the style of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Much more simply, the sequences with actors in the flesh will show or not some scenes that will often concern the life (or death) of the supporting actors and these same characters will be more or less present also in the in-game sequences and we will find ourselves interacting (minimally) with them according to the microscopic branches taken from the plot. The ending of Quantum Break will always be only one, regardless of your choices, but this solution adopted by Remedy is able to stimulate a minimum desire to replay some parts, if only to see what happens to certain characters. And speaking of replayability we can't help but address the age-old question of longevity. The game offers three different levels of difficulty and our advice, especially if you are quite familiar with action adventures and third-person shooters, is to start directly with the maximum. In any case, it will hardly take you more than nine, ten hours to complete the game provided you dedicate yourselves in a sufficiently thorough way to the sea of collectibles with which the levels are scattered and which prove to be essential for fully understanding the plot of the game (beyond to offer long texts to read to pass some time). Our estimate also takes into account the abundant hour and a half necessary to see the four episodes of the TV series and, for the record, in our review session we spent about eleven hours to complete Quantum Break at 100%, facing its challenges at the medium level of difficulty. Shoot, shoot what passes you! And we come to the most important element of the game: its gameplay. Quantum Break, we recall, is an action adventure with a very strong propensity for action. Almost more of a third-person action  la Gears of War to be clear than an adventure  la Tomb Raider or Uncharted even if there are several sections in which we will have to limit ourselves to exploring the scenario, solving very basic environmental puzzles and jumping on some platforms. But it's when you shoot that the true nature of the game comes out. An old-fashioned nature, probably too much that, we cannot deny it and it was already evident in the hands-on phase, made us turn up our noses on more than a few occasions. Let's start by saying that the work of Remedy Entertainment has a rather peculiar and simplified coverage management: it is completely automatic and concerns only low obstacles. Once in close proximity to a ~suitable~ stage element, Jack will crouch to hide from the eyes and blows of enemies. The system is particularly effective and gives a feeling of great fluidity and realism during the most agitated actions that force us to move continuously through the scenario making the most of the shelters and continuously switching from the classic view to the close-up view from the weapon to shoot the unfortunate shift. However, the problem lies in the absence of a whole series of accessory elements to which we have been accustomed for some time now, especially when the covers come into play. For example, it is not possible to take cover behind elements as tall as Jack or taller than him by leaning out only to shoot, such as near a door. And there's no option to blind fire while in cover either. At the same time, an interaction to climb over obstacles or to move from one element to another in the vicinity while remaining sheltered is completely missing. More generally, the lack of a dodge or a somersault is strongly noted, especially in the very first hours of the game, given that the only command from Jack that does not concern the use of firearms or powers is the jump. The result is therefore a strange hybrid: if on the one hand you feel forced, almost frustrated in having to manage a protagonist who seems limited in his movements, woody and not very agile, as well as very ~heavy~ as per the tradition of the Remedy charactersEntertainment, on the other hand we must recognize that once you get familiar with the controls, the shootings are very frantic, fast, they force us to move continuously, to shoot wildly. In short, in the ~old school~ style. Basically, however, it is inevitable to think that these are limitations of the gameplay. How limiting is the lack of grenades but above all of a melee attack; if it is true that both are partially replaced by two special powers, their absence in ~normal~ situations is felt above all at the higher difficulty levels and with the more advanced enemies who have the ability to approach us very quickly to hit us with the rifle butt. Going into the details of the weapons, Jack will be able to carry three at a time: a pistol with infinite ammunition, an automatic rifle and a heavy or highly specialized weapon such as carbines, shotguns and light machine guns. There is a distinction between these types and it is strong enough but the problem is that within each category there are really too few variants to be able to give an interesting feeling or to give an effective sense of enhancement and evolution. Automatic weapons in particular follow a very simple balance: the larger the magazine, the less damage the shots do. Also in this case, in short, we don't feel we can only criticize the design choices of Remedy given that in concrete terms, in practice, they work and give substance to that action element that characterizes Quantum Break but there is no doubt that even from the point in terms of equipment, much more could have been done. Jack the ubiquitous And we come to the powers, the iconographic element of this video game since its announcement. Jack Joyce due to an unsuccessful experiment, and well told in the first act of the game, will literally find himself in his hands the possibility of modifying and altering time. The world told in Quantum Break is a planet on the verge of a great catastrophe where the space-time continuum no longer follows the normal laws of physics but is crumbling leading to a whole series of phenomena that humanity cannot control except for Jack and his antagonist Paul. The interesting narrative trick serves to explain why the protagonist is able to block opponents, bullets, elements of the scenario inside ~bubbles~, can go very fast, generate a protective shield around his body and slow down the enemy's actions , while remaining immune to the stasis situations that paralyze the scenario during some highly scripted and decidedly spectacular sequences. In all, Jack will find himself having access to six powers (two are actually evolutions of other special abilities) and in the course of the adventure we will be able to spend the chronon particles recovered by exploring the length and breadth of the scenarios (they are in effect another collectible) to enhance each of these on three levels, with the exception of the two ~evolutionary~ powers which have only two levels of enhancement. These special abilities of Jack all work perfectly and their management through two front buttons of the pad and the two backbones allows practically simultaneous and immediate use of each power without ever having to pause the rhythm of the action to perhaps navigate through some menu of selection. In short, Remedy's precise desire to push hard on the action is evident, forcing the player to fully enjoy the shootings without any help at the interface or automatism level. The result, it will be clear to you by now, convinced us but with several reservations. On the technical front, however, there is very little to criticize Remedy: Quantum Break is a great sight that really borders on excellence in some glimpses and scenarios. Of course, we could open the parenthesis on the rendering resolution which in some situations betrays its not fully full HD nature, bringing unclear sequences to the screen, slightly ~smeared~ if you pass the term. But in terms of management of lights and particles, the game really has no rivals on consoles and knows how to amaze on numerous occasions, especially when armored soldiers and chronon armor begin to take action, perhaps while we are in the midst of a stasis and the game world around us is completely paralyzed and ~fragmented~. The glance is truly remarkable and also helps in this sense an environmental destructibility that we are not used to seeing in third-person action. Glass and furnishings that shatter, splinters that fly everywhere, walls and wooden crates that fall apart and much more. In terms of frame rate the game is almost always stable", "date": "2016-04-01", "grade": "8.5"}
