There are those who simply don't know anything about it, and therefore fill their speech with prejudices, as well as a pinch of self-absolving racism, which aims to establish a kind of non-existent cultural superiority; and there are those who know everything, really everything about the other culture, even what the natives don't know, and who usually tend to magnify every manifestation of it, taking everything it produces to extremes. In both cases there is a similar but opposite obtuseness which does not allow for any dialogue. For example, it is difficult to explain to the former that the fact that a visual novel is full of cat girls enslaved by a master, who occasionally exploits them sexually, is not who knows what scandal in a country like Japan; while it is impossible to make the latter understand that like any self-respecting repressive culture, even the Japanese one has its works by a happy hand, that is, produced without who knows what philosophical aims, but to allow sexual outlet, usually solitary, going to tickle a part of the national erotic imagination. One is therefore dumbfounded when part of the Italian public lashes out horrified and moralizing against a visual novel like NEKOPARA Vol. 2 because it considers it perverted (often implying that all Japanese are perverted), and then it turns out, reading studies and statistics, that the same public finds pornographic videos with rapes more and more exciting (simulated, true, but it counts for little). On the other hand, one cannot even waste time in lofty disquisitions when one is faced with such stories and characters, evidently aimed at masturbation. What do we think of the visual novel NEKOPARA Vol. 2? Find out in our review! Plain or with cream? NEKOPARA Vol. 2 continues the story that began with volumes 0 and 1, and tells us about the new background of the La Soleil pastry shop. The user once again puts on the role of the owner of the restaurant, Kashou Minaduki, to witness the vicissitudes of his cat maids. From a narrative point of view, there isn't much to say, given that, as in the other volumes, the story is made up of stereotyped and superficial situations, such as competitions to see who makes the best cake or dull discussions between sisters, which end with a big ~ we loved them~, so much the important thing is to have excited the buyer. As? But with truly excellent designs and alluring situations, which lead to porn. From this point of view, Neko Works has kept faith with its fame, creating splendid drawings and inserting simple but well-made animations almost everywhere, to give more movement to what would otherwise be a pure and truly static visual novel, in which it just reads, with no crossroads or other elementary forms of interaction to add some variety. In short, no articulated plots like Clannad or The Fruit of Grisaia, but a straight line, or it would be better to say erect, that leads to the ending. Even the interface is designed to make reading as pleasant as possible and includes all the typical options of the genre. If you wish, you can skip the texts by pressing a button, or you can leave the game itself the burden of going ahead by itself, so as to free up your hands (don't laugh... it's just for doing that). Once the story is over, it will be possible to review all the main illustrations in the extras section. At this point it is urgent to give you some indications, especially if you have not yet purchased it but intend to do so. The Steam version of the game is censored, i.e. missing all the more extreme scenes. Playing NEKOPARA Vol. 2 without erotic scenes is like buying a strawberry pie without strawberries: it makes no sense. If you have read this far, the reason for our statement should be clear to you. So our advice is to buy the uncensored version directly, from the publisher's site Denpasoft, of which we cannot provide you with the link, or take it on Steam and then download the patch to restore the original contents. Also in this case we cannot give you direct links, but just write ~nekopara vol. 2 uncensored patch~ on any search engine and you should have no problems finding what you need.", "date": "2016-03-11", "grade": "6.0"}
