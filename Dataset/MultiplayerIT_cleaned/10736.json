{"name": "Zeno Clash", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/zeno-clash-recensione-lav.html", "text": "Mad Bud At first glance, Zeno Clash looks like a first-person fighting game with a setting halfway between a painting by Bosch and the film Mad Max, but with a tribal setting. Finishing it (it takes a handful of hours) confirms the idea of the fighting game 3D, but the films of Bud Spencer and Terence Hill must be added to the list of possible sources of inspiration. Why? Because in Zeno Clash you get hit with blows, sometimes you even shoot, but nobody ever dies. Furthermore, as in all the films of the dynamic duo, one can be sure that in one of the following scenes some enemy of one of the previous ones will return, despite the hammering received. In the game they play as Ghat, son of a Cha... ahem, it sucks we know, but she ran away. We said: in the role of the aforementioned Ghat, who killed the Father - Mother, the first de facto couple enclosed in a single individual, we will have to flee, together with the beautiful Daedra, from our family eager for revenge. On the way to freedom we will have numerous encounters and, in parallel, through interactive flashbacks we will retrace the events that led our hero to commit the crime, up to the ending which ... will ruin everything due to the involuntary comedy of some turning points narratives. As soon as you start the game you are truly amazed by the combat system created by the developers. We don't think we've ever seen something so physical and capable of enhancing hand-to-hand combat in a video game, relegating firearms to useful supporting actors only in specifically dedicated moments. Despite the simplicity of the controls and the small number of keys to press to perform the different moves (practically the two mouse keys plus the movement keys), it is immediately clear that we are faced with more studied fight mechanics than those normally dedicated to melee weapons in FPS. Stronger, guys Zeno Clash is a real fisticuffs simulator in which you have a whole series of moves to give them to the opponent on duty; you can throw weak but quick punches, strong but slower punches, you can dodge, parry, shoulder while running, grab a stunned enemy, throw him at his comrades, kick him while he is still on the ground, grab a large club and banging the unfortunate people like hanging clothes, throwing explosive skull-shaped bombs and so on. However, there are many variations to the basic formula: for example, in an advanced section you will have a magic scepter that launches fireballs, the only weapon capable of destroying animated statues, while in another case you will have to shoot primitive creatures who want to ruin our boat trip. More than actual levels, Zeno Clash is made up of arenas. The environments are in fact very small and difficult to explore, in the sense that there is not much to find apart from a few energy flowers. Only a couple of areas are larger, but you shouldn't expect who knows what anyway; after all, that's right, given that we are not dealing with a traditional first-person shooter and that too dispersive scenarios would probably have penalized it. The game gives its best at the maximum difficulty level and in the presence of multiple enemies, that is when it manages to test the experience gained by the player and his combat technique (pressing keys at random doesn't pay, in short). The challenge mode is also interesting, in which you have to climb a tower facing battles of increasing difficulty on each floor. Although quite classic, it gives the title a few more hours of longevity (the main story ends in 5-6 hours) which never hurts. Graphically we are faced with a valuable title, considering the price range and the level of production. Zeno Clash takes advantage of the Half-Life 2 engine and offers good three-dimensional models that are well characterized. The different maps are quite small, although some are full of details that shape an original and pleasant world to observe. There is no shortage of spectacular moments such as a fight at the feet of a cetacean stranded on a beach or a long journey on a river where huge beasts drink. We also point out that the game has been completely translated into Italian with a patch released subsequently, always downloadable from Steam. Interview with Carlos Bordeu Multiplayer.it: To start, introduce yourself to our readers and tell us what you do.Carlos Bordeu: Hi, I'm Carlos Bordeu, co-lead designer of ACEMultiplayer.it: What does it mean to be a game developer in Chile? How is the development scene there, Carlos? Carlos Bordeu: Being a developer in Chile is a very unique and special thing. There are Frprobably fifty film directors for every game developer here...maybe even more. It is a very rare professional line. The only real development studios here are ACE Studios and Wanako Games, and in both cases the ~Bordeu brothers~ have been around since the early days of both companies. This definitely makes us pioneers in this country. We often get a lot of laughs, because most people don't understand what it means to be a developer, they ask you questions like ~So you sell games, right?~ or ~You basically play all day!~ Because there are so few parameters to make a comparison, people don't really understand how much work is done. I have high expectations for the growth of this industry in our country, so that one day it can become a creative and competitive territory, where many quality games are created. The fact is that the development of videogames is extremely rare in South America, and I think this depends on a lack of information. Multiplayer.it: Let's have this information, then. What do you mean? Carlos Bordeu: The biggest costs in terms of development are people, and knowledge, not technology, so I don't there are actually reasons why South American studios might not be successful. We even have advantages from an economic point of view, because the cost of living here is lower than in the United States, Europe, or Japan. And then we have such a different culture, I'm really sure there's a lot of creative talent in these regions. Multiplayer.it: Can you tell us about the creative process that gave birth to Zeno Clash? His world? His characters?? Carlos Bordeu: Edmundo is the art director, and the story writer of the game. Andres and I (Carlos) are the designers. But our roles aren't that structured... I mean: we all collaborate for art and design. The result is definitely not the product of the effort of separate individuals. In a small team like the ours, each performs different tasks. I deal with design, modeling, texturing, animations, level design, sound design, production, public relations, even a little dubbing. If I told you that Zeno Clash came from a methodical and detailed study of how things would be in a bizarre-fantasy world, I would be lying. We create and build based on concepts, themes and styles, rather than devising rules and shaping specific details. And it works, it finds its cohesion, because we all know what Zeno Clash is and we share his universe in our minds. And perhaps this is also possible because the creative guides of the game are two brothers (Carlos and Andres Bordeu, ed). I think one reason we were able to pull off the style of the game is because we want the game to be able to evoke feelings that you would find in traditional art forms. Most games just want to be ~cool~, they don't really want to express nothing in particular other than ~being the next bomb~. It's hard for me to fully explain... but when I look at a painting by Bosch or Dal, the feeling it produces is totally different from the one you get from watching a movie, or playing a video game. Trying to stimulate a similar sensation with a video game is a real challenge for us, a really interesting challenge. Multiplayer.it: And you have chosen the Source. It makes me think, perhaps because the facial animation system is ideal in a game where the characters are so important and well defined, and must be known very closely. Also for Vampire: Bloodlines it was fundamental, and also in that case the result was fantastic in my opinion. Carlos Bordeu: There were many reasons. One of the reasons was that of the technical characteristics. But a less obvious one was Steam. Being a small indie studio meant we needed to have our game on a platform that was perfect for large digital release. If we had gone with someone else, we would have been much more dependent on a publisher...and that really would have complicated things for such an unusual project like ours.Multiplayer.it: Returning to the world of Zeno Clash... Carlos Bordeu: Edmundo, I was saying, was in charge to write the plot and I think he took more inspiration from the concepts than from another existing story. He is certainly better suited than me to answer, but... the game was created in a world fantasy punk, so it was very important to understand what in a punk fantasy world would be different from an epic fantasy world... this was a very present concept behind the realization of many elements concerning the plot and the characters of Zeno Clash. It's not the way the plot is passed on that doesmakes it original (there are cutscenes, ingame dialogue, etc), but it's the content and the characters, so unfamiliar with everything around, that make it unique.Multiplayer.it: Returning to the world of Zeno Clash.. . More variety in content. I think we in the industry can do much more than that, and this is also true from a graphics point of view. Why can't a game be like a Picasso painting? I would buy it a million times more than one of the war or sci-fi blockbusters that abound in the market.Multiplayer.it: Thanks a lot, Carlos and all the ACE TEAM Thank you for the nice conversation and for the interview!", "date": "2009-05-05", "grade": "8.5"}
