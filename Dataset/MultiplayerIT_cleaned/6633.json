{"name": "Etrian Odissey Origins Collection: un'ottima", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/etrian-odissey-origins-collection-recensione.html", "text": "When Etrian Odyssey made its debut on the Nintendo DS way back in 2007 its multifaceted classes, its combat and the use of the touch screen to draw the maps of each level made it a classic and at the same time a tribute to the great dungeon crawlers of the past. With the Etrian Odyssey Origins Collection the first three chapters of this saga are remastered for Nintendo Switch and turn into a real history lesson on a way of making video games that stands the test of time and just needs a repaint every much.Developed by Atlus, the first three installments of the series represent one of the high points for the dungeon crawler genre of the DS era. The evolutions between one title and another (despite a change of direction between the first and second chapters) are clear and have the third chapter as a clear point of arrival, considered by many to be the best. When they came out, the first Etrian Odissey games weren't simple but over the years they have received more customization of the level of difficulty which has made them less punishing. This remaster combines a marked improvement in graphics with the modernization of both controls and interfaces to breathe new life into an experience that doesn't seem to have aged a day. In this review of the Etrian Odyssey Origins Collection we will tell you about the strengths and weaknesses of these titles (even for those who have never heard of them), the improvements made with the remastering and we will discuss the decidedly unaffordable launch price of the complete collection and individual titles. A hymn to the past To those who have never encountered them, the manual mapping mechanics of the Etrian Odyssey saga may be confusing, but that's where part of the magic of this series lies There was a time when dungeon crawlers, as well as with the computer keyboard, were played with pen and paper to create the most accurate maps possible that documented the enemies found, the secret passages and the shortcuts to get more bottom in the dungeon. Etrian Odyssey has taken that system and adapted it to the Nintendo DS touch screen and this remaster has taken it a step further by bringing it to the Switch screen. The only difference is that the two-screen console had a built-in stylus, but the Switch doesn't, so the mapping process isn't as intuitive. Atlus has done a good job of assigning the controls to the Joy-cons, dedicating the arrows to movement and the analogs to mapping, but it will take a couple of hours of trying before they become intuitive. We used the stylus from an older 3DS and the experience instantly became smoother. Of course, this is possible when playing in portable mode. Mapping a layer of the great dungeons that make up the settings for the three games isn't mandatory, but you'll soon realize that not all of your explorations will ask you to go deeper. Often you will simply need to gather resources for missions or to buy items that enhance a member of your team. Going without fail thanks to the maps you have created to find a particular enemy, a boss or resources to collect will save you a lot of time. From this point of view, the remaster has done a great job of modernization by drastically expanding the mapping tools available compared to the original games (especially the first one) and speeding up the process. Choosing to devote yourself to this series means embarking on a journey that, in addition to being an adventure with a compelling narrative (especially in the third chapter), is also a lesson in the history of video games. In fact, dungeon crawler lovers will find themselves faced with a very solid experience, with many references to the great classics of the genre and very deep character development and resource management. An abyss, a tower and another abyss Etrian Odyssey's famed FOEs make their triumphant return to the Origins Collection and are just as annoying today as they were then The premises of the three video games in this collection are more or less the same: a chasm has opened in the ground (in the case of the second chapter, however, it is a tower that leads to a mythical city in the sky) and a nearby city has decided to invite adventurers from all over the world to explore it and reap its riches. You will take on the role of a new guild that has just arrived in the city which, one level at a time, will have to make its way through mazes and monsters to reach the bottom, or the top, of the dungeon. You will start by recruiting six characters, of which you can use five, and which you will have to divide into the front and second lines for the combat phases.or. Each class has bonuses and malus and is more effective in one position than in another: we advise against putting the healer in the forefront for example, but you will have no limits in the type of characters you can select. Do you want to bring five sentinels to be almost immortal? No problem, but be prepared to spend many turns in combat, though, because despite being good at defending these characters they don't do much damage. Each character can then equip a weapon and three pieces of armor that become increasingly important as you advance of each chapter. Where you'll have the most ability to customize your team, though, is in the unlockable skills as you level up. From meteorites to area attacks through mass cures or spells that put enemies to sleep, the possibilities are endless, but leveling up, especially after the twentieth, becomes an activity that requires a lot of work. Even at the lowest difficulty levels, the experience points derived from fighting common enemies are very few but, fortunately, there is a game calendar and a day-night cycle. Many mini-bosses return to life after four days and the main bosses after 14. In the first chapter this is the only function of this calendar, but already from the second game the day-night cycle becomes indispensable for efficient progression. Value for money The main obstacle to recommending the entire Etrian Odyssey Origins Collection is its introductory price Given the non-economic launch price of these three remasters (80 euros for the Collection and 40 to purchase each of the three chapters separately) it is important to think about the pros and cons of each option. It goes without saying that if you loved the original Nintendo DS chapters and want to relive them on Switch, this collection will leave you with a big smile on your lips because the spirit and flow of the original titles have been respected, the tools and options available (especially in the first two) have been expanded, and the phenomenal music of the historic composer Yuzo Koshiro is jaw-dropping on the speakers of the Switch. If, on the other hand, you are ~only~ looking for an excellent dungeon crawler, it is better to save money and jump directly on the third chapter of the series. The first Etrian Odyssey laid the foundations of the series but, even with the graphical improvements brought by the Origins Collection, it remains a rather limited game in terms of story, character customization possibilities and, above all, extra activities to complete during or after having concluded the main story. The second introduces several improvements in the exploration of the dungeon floors, in combat and above all in accumulating experience, but even here the story leaves much to be desired, resulting in non-trivial, but certainly not revolutionary. The third chapter, on the other hand, takes all the technical innovations of the first two, adds a mass of new secondary activities and tells you a much deeper, multifaceted story with alternative endings and poignant and well-written secondary missions. Contrary to the two previous chapters, in fact, the dungeon that has appeared near the city of Armoroad is not making it more prosperous by attracting adventurers, but has destroyed part of the city causing it to sink and is cutting it off from the maritime trade that until recently it enriched her. Now the city leaders are obsessed with the dungeon and its riches which they want to use to restore Armorroad to its golden age. Etrian Odyssey 3 tells a story of strife, decadence, despair and revenge and is undoubtedly the most complete title (and the one we recommend you try) of the original trilogy released on Nintendo DS.", "date": "2023-06-01", "grade": "7.5"}
