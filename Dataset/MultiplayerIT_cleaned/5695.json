We note that there are still some major problems, but perhaps, slowly, Square Enix is becoming familiar with the mobile scene. But let's go in order. Our judgment on the mobile device version of Final Fantasy IX, a milestone of JRPG! The original is never forgotten... What place the ninth episode has in a ranking of the most beautiful Final Fantasy is still a matter of debate today, 16 years after its release. Final Fantasy IX was born as a spin off of the saga after the trio Sakaguchi/Minaba/Uematsu, the first two in particular, had been somewhat overshadowed by the resounding success of Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII, which had JRPG all over the world but which had also, stylistically above all, given way to that deviation of which we see the full and controversial fruits today. Then it re-entered the regular numbering, and this can be seen, in hindsight, as a celebration, a closure of a glorious phase before definitively venturing into unknown territories. In any case, the story of Gidan, Garnet and Vivi, told in fairy-tale, magical and adventurous tones (which at the time someone incautiously mistaken for childishness) cannot leave you indifferent even today, especially if you manage to see the reflection beneath the surface profound on the search for one's identity and one's place in the world which is its true gist. From the gameplay point of view, however, in reality the two previous episodes hadn't broken with the past at all, and Final Fantasy IX follows in the same vein, perhaps representing the sum of everything that had gone before: from the Active Time Battle to the ~classes~ (sometimes explicit, sometimes not but always somehow present) of the characters, from the system of skills related to the equipment to the Trance Mode, up to the digressions with the Chocobos who hunt for treasure and the Tetra Master, everything in Final Fantasy IX it is painstakingly studied and achieves a remarkable balance making the gameplay a boost to involvement like the story. And of the presentation: a Minaba and a Uematsu in dazzling form celebrate the saga that owes them so much in a perhaps unrepeatable, imaginative and poetic way, childish and adult just when it needs to be, without artificially pushing one side or the other just for reasons ~of box~. ...but every conversion is different How was all this good of Square brought to iOS and Android? With ups and downs. From a graphic point of view, the polygonal models stand out, as well as the characters and the backdrops of the battles. Retouches have been made to all of them, bringing up the polygonal detail but above all the cleaning and definition of the textures, especially as regards the protagonists: Gidan and his companions are vibrant, their wonderful expressions and their animations are perfectly visible and put on a show even on the smallest screens. ~Standing out~ however is just the right word, because on the contrary to the bitmap backdrops, which at the time caused a sensation, a little filtering was just given and you want for the compression used to keep the download at human levels, you want above all due to the contrast with the splendid models, the effect is really hard to swallow and is also reflected in the gameplay, resulting in some important elements being too small and not very visible especially on smaller devices. After mentioning that even wonderful music suffers a bit, but you have to have a really good ear to notice it, from compression, let's move on to the other crucial point of any mobile conversion: the control system. Fortunately, the horrible contraption of Final Fantasy VII has been abandoned, here we have resorted to the classic virtual stick plus context-sensitive button: it is certainly a wise decision, which considerably lightens the field of vision and makes everything much more practical, although it still has to manage its own intrinsic limits which, however, we cannot blame the developers. It is also possible to indicate to the character the place to go to by way of a graphic adventure, but this solution collides with the poor clarity of the seabed, as well as making use of a controller: at the moment it isThere are a few compatibility problems, which can certainly be solved with an update. For the rest, the interface has been completely redesigned for touch control: not the best of visions, but practical and immediate, and in general one has the feeling of being in front of a title finally designed for mobile, with all the pros and cons against what this entails. Last hints to some problems in the transition between the various screens, especially at the beginning of the various FMVs, and to the Italian translation which has remained the same as the original: at the time it caused discussions for the use of dialects, but in any case it was edited by people who knew about it, just think of the delicious entr'actes by Zon & Son.", "date": "2016-02-19", "grade": "7.8"}
