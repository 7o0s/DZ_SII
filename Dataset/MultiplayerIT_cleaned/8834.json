You can boast one of the best exponents of the hack and slash genre for iOS in your catalog, a brand that with the two previous releases has managed to gather a lot of acclaim while not inventing anything; simply carrying out the dictates imposed by the great classics well. And what are you doing? For the third chapter, you work hard to improve the graphic component, the controls and the technical rendering in general, and then you ruin everything, distorting the formula in favor of something new, sure, but poorly implemented. Dungeon Hunter III is all of this: the latest release of the free to play madness that has infected Gameloft, a wasted opportunity but - and here is the glass half full - also an experience from which it won't be difficult to go back after learning a couple of useful lessons. Micro transactions, big disasters The gap between Dungeon Hunter III and the other chapters of the series is huge. The exploratory dungeon structure, with the usual story of manner to act as a bland but effective glue, has been replaced by a mosaic of objective arenas, collected in a total of four worlds. Just as many are the playable classes that cover traditional roles, from the expert warrior in melee clashes to more skilled mages and archers from a distance, even if the progression has been distorted compared to what was seen previously. Instead of acquiring new objects on the playing field, in fact, killing opponents favors the accumulation of money to spend between one arena and another to improve character and equipment: as a result there is the loss of the random collection mechanic, the main dangling carrot in the various Diablo & co, sacrificed on the altar of micro transactions. The freemium model in itself is fine, but in this case having to pay to acquire credits or speed up the upgrade of weapons and armor we already have, ended up jeopardizing the sense of progression that should instead be the real source here of fun. You buy everything: weapons, potions and armor, but also skills and keys to open chests. The rather high variety of objectives and interesting initiatives such as the daily quests that stimulate you to launch the game on a regular basis need little in this sense. At the moment, any form of multiplayer is also lacking, a problem that Gameloft should still put a patch on in the short term. Playing Dungeon Hunter III there are several wrong aspects, for example the excessive amount of currency systems that complicate things unnecessarily, but it is clear that in this period the French publisher is in the mood for experimentation and it is useless to deny the presence of even interesting ideas for the future. It would have made more sense to keep the structure as always and try to sell packs of quests, pets, extra animations and so on. With the mobility and speed of use allowed by Apple devices, an auction house like the one being worked on for Diablo III would be perfect; just to say another avenue of extra monetization. As mentioned, however, it is not all to be thrown away. On the contrary, if we want to look closely, the positive aspects are also those that can be more easily treasured in the future: the graphic upgrade compared to Dungeon Hunter II is remarkable both in terms of effects and animations and complexity of the environments, while the bestiary counts many returns but also new features that increase the variety of battles. The controls are more responsive and immediate, put in difficulty on iPad 2 only by some slowdowns that occur in the most agitated situations. Ultimately, there is good under the hood, now we have to wait to understand what results this spin off disguised as a sequel will get, and hope that we take a step back or that the formula is significantly improved.
