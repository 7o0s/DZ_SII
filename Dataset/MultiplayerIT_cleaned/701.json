{"name": "Battlefield 2: Modern Combat - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/battlefield-2-modern-combat-recensione.html", "text": "It is actually strange that the Electronic Arts title is called Battlefield 2 when it is making its first appearance on consoles, but apart from this little irreverent notation, it also seems right to clarify that the version we tested, albeit daughter or rather sister of the title of successful released for personal computers, it is a decidedly different product and with its own peculiarities. The game is orchestrated in a well-defined way and is clearly divided between online and offline, didn't you think that the EA brand would arrive on our consoles without a worthy online component? The campaign is organized on the basis of a narrative plot worthy of the best thriller writers, American troops are sent as peacekeepers to Kazakhstan to promote political stability in the country. However, the Republic of China, unnerved by the deployment of forces near its territories, decides to send its own men and means to watch over its own interests. We will experience the story from both points of view, completing missions for the Americans and for the Chinese, in total 20 very varied levels interspersed with clips of the news that tell the story we are experiencing in first person in the game (and from a double of sight!). The campaign is organized on the basis of a narrative plot worthy of the best thriller writers As mentioned, in this first-person tactical shooter the missions are very varied: it will be a question of destroying certain objectives, escorting important personalities, we will use heavy vehicles to capture and defend strategic positions and we will go on a mission with helicopters in search of enemy ships to then having to shoot them down without hesitation. We will be able to choose which type of soldier to play among five categories: stormtrooper, shooter, member of the special teams, engineer and support. Each type of soldier has its own peculiarities and is able to perform certain tasks better, in addition to the fact that choosing a stormtrooper over an engineer will also change our weapons and consequently our way of approaching the game. The maps are very well studied, of good dimensions in order to give the idea of being able to move with ample freedom in the battlefield. At this point it's time to describe one of the best innovations proposed by Digital Illusions for this console version of Battlefield 2 and that is the Role Change. By pressing the Y key we will pass in an instant from the soldier we are impersonating at that moment to any other member of our line-up. It is a very simple operation, just look at the soldier we want to ~take possession of~ and press the button, which has some truly remarkable advantages: with this function we can always be at the center of the action, we can move ~at Warp speed~ for the battlefield and prepare to face the enemy with the most suitable soldier for the objective to be achieved. An excellent incentive to play, and play well, the offline campaign is given by the management system of our progress in the game, which will record our progress, making us rank up and unlocking better weapons for our troops. The only real criticism that we can move to Battlefield 2: Modern Combat is the fact that the individual offline missions tend too much to recall the online mode, with enemies suddenly reborn before our eyes or launching the assault without thinking too much (fault of the AI or almost of a too inexperienced online player?), moreover this console version has purposely veered towards a more arcade, more simplified game system, with the various bonuses on health, damage and rapid fire that certainly they make the game easier while annoying the purists of the genre. The means we have tried are controlled quite effectively, but what has left us somewhat surprised concerns more than anything else the firearms supplied to our soldiers; when we held the various submachine guns and shotguns, in addition to feeling a small lack of accuracy, we did not feel that feeling of being holding a weapon that can kill with one shot, call it a feeling of power if you want, which instead characterizes Battlefield on personal computer. Online gaming is certainly the component that Xbox and PlayStation 2 users have been waiting for since the EA title was announced: 24 online players, 13 maps and endless action. The maps have been designed in an optimal way, so as not to unbalance the game too much in favor of heavy vehicles compared to infantry and vice versa. Also forget about conquering the entire map alone with a helicopter, even the vehicles are in fact not indestructible and indeed you need to be good pilots tobe able to use them properly. Online is all about two modes: Capture the Flag and Conquest. The main and most played online one is the Conquest which, as always, foresees two factions fighting for the maintenance and precisely the conquest of some strategic points of the map; strategic points that also act as respawn centers in case of an early death. Every time we are killed it is possible to return to the battlefield with a different type of soldier of our choice, unfortunately however the possibility of Role Change that we have described in the offline campaign, for obvious reasons, has not been introduced in the online game. 24 players online, 13 maps and endless action! The battles we fought online were very fun and engaging, it's a bit too easy to follow the movements of enemy troops which are indicated by some small red indicators above their heads, and therefore can be spotted at a considerable distance. Sin. But we had the impression that the developers have made the whole game a little easier from the very first games and the deliberately arcade imprint can be seen throughout. On the other hand, the part regarding the online statics and the possibility of creating clans is well managed, as in Halo 2. Technically Battlefield 2: Modern Combat is quite good, it is absolutely not close to the glories of the PC version but in any case the use of RenderWare has allowed the achievement of a discreet detail regarding the game maps, even if it is not possible, with rare exceptions, to enter the buildings arranged on the battlefield, while certainly better could have been done for the soldiers present on the screen. The A.I. in the single game it turns out to be a bit naive in certain situations but overall it performs its task decently. Cross-platform The Xbox and PlayStation 2 versions are virtually identical, with greater image sharpness in favor of the Microsoft console. Furthermore, a small personal advantage is taken by the Xbox due to the reduced loading times compared to the Sony console. Both consoles feature online play for 24 players simultaneously across 12 maps. In both cases we had no signal delays and the games ran without too many problems. Comment Battlefield 2: Modern Combat is a title that we liked, certainly some defects are present and probably the purists, who have played the title on personal computers, will be a little disappointed by the work done by Digital Illusions. But from time immemorial, console players have been perceived by developers as more accustomed to easy and immediate action without too many technicalities, and Battlefield, you may like it or not, has been simplified precisely to meet these needs. However, it remains a solid, fun shooter, with a good single player campaign and an online one capable of giving intense hours of fighting. Pros Good single player campaign Online in 24 hours Immediate and engaging Cons Simplified compared to the pc version Technically only fair I.A. sometimes lacking Battlefield 1942 was certainly one of the most successful fps in the vast galaxy of gaming on personal computers. The title developed by Digital Illusions was so successful above all thanks to the excellent online game modes, which gave birth to thousands of warmongering clans all over the world. Battlefield has recently had a sequel, obviously improved and technically updated, which, finally and although renamed in Battlefield 2: Modern Combat, arrives on Xbox and PlayStation 2.", "date": "2005-12-13", "grade": null}
