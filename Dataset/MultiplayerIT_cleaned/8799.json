Often, however, its merits are celebrated beyond measure, being frequently referred to as the first console ~board game~ in history. This is false: Itadaki Street, of which La Via della Fortuna is part, is a series conceived by Enix even at the time of the NES, whose episodes have been released for more or less every (hugely) successful console since the 80s onwards , including SNES, PSX, PS2 and Nintendo DS. The reason why - perhaps - you have never heard of it is very simple: this is the first chapter to leave the borders of Japan. Monopoly... The mechanics of Itadaki Street are essentially those of Monopoly, a historic board game; while knowing it by reputation, many do not know its rules and objectives, so we must spend (it is appropriate to say) a few words about it. Monopoly, as the name suggests, is a financial-themed game, son of the liberal doctrine and the capitalist market; a deep and ruthless game, despite the sugary appearance, intuitive and complex - the games rarely run out in less than two hours - able to introduce even newbies to these mechanics, and these concepts. The goal is simple: accumulate a certain amount of gold coins (here, in Itadaki Street, dollars in the original) before the other competitors. On your turn you roll a die, which determines the movements on the board, and you act on the basis of the square encountered: it can be a shop to buy, an establishment already bought by others to which you have to pay duty, a surprise event, or the bank, to which you must forcibly return if you want to ~level up~ - and therefore collect coins and increase your capital - after having collected the four seeds arranged along the board. The map is divided into neighborhoods, and by investing in several nearby businesses, their value increases exponentially, something to take into consideration both to increase one's assets and, above all, to block the rise of others. Shops can be bought not only if free, but also if owned by another player, by making a suitable offer, exchanging them or expropriating them (paying them five times their value). As we would say in the mmorpg field, the real game lies in the end-game, which here begins when all the free boxes have been purchased: at that point tolls, investments, offers and sales count above all. ... and The Way of Fortune What is written in the previous paragraph is valid for both Monopoly and La Via della Fortuna; a typical feature of the video game, on the other hand, is the possibility of choosing between ~standard~ and expert difficulty~. The first of the two ends with what was described above, the second proposes another dynamic - the most important, perhaps - that is, the buying and selling of shares. Each player, on the Bank or Stock Exchange space, can buy the shares of a given district, consequently establishing his own growth plan: the value of a shop is closely linked to that of the area where it is built, and precisely on this connection creates alliances and strategies between investors. For a young layman perhaps it is easier to understand the concept of speculation if duped by Wario - and, trust me, it often happens - than by reading it in the Sole 24 Ore. The differences with the authentic Monopoly do not end here: the boards are many and varied, sometimes too large and sinuous - the beauty of the mechanics certainly does not lie in the shape of the board, at least in this case - and the events, in addition to the classic they also include mini-games. Precisely the latter allow us to introduce the main lack of La Via della Fortuna, and that is the - almost - total absence of interaction: the minigames are there, it is true, but they proceed automatically, without the player being called into question. Same thing for the rest of the product: Itadaki Street is based exclusively on the mechanics of Monopoly, without adding anything, without in any way declining the concept in a videogame key. Details The CPU, despite tricks (the impression is this, at least) a little in the roll of the dice, has an excellent AI, a feature that allows you to have fun even alone. Competitors are not only competitive, but they also intuit possible alliances which usually, in Monopoly, are stipulated orally: a large investment in another player's neighbourhood, possibly repeated, could lead the latter to improve his shops, encouraging a vicious circle which favors andboth, and that it forces the adversaries, if they want to remain competitive, to behave in the same way. A good AI is essential, because although the nature of La Via della Fortuna is devoted to multiplayer, it is not easy to create good games in this mode, both because the mechanics are not very simple, and because, above all, the games are very long. It might help online, but it's almost impossible to find other connected users; so unless there's a product boom in the next few months, it's an option we can almost consider missing from the game - through no fault of the developers, of course. There are other minor details that don't work, for example the CPU shifts are really too slow, and there is no possibility to speed them up; in addition each character speaks at the beginning of the turn and in the key moments of the game, further slowing down the progress of the action. There are so many extras, items to unlock, and we haven't even remembered how the boards and characters are extrapolated from the world of Dragon Quest and Super Mario; however the heart of the game is what we have talked about, it is accessible from the beginning, and has all the potential to last for a long time, whether the pawn is Toad or a normal mushroom.", "date": "2012-01-26", "grade": "6.5"}
