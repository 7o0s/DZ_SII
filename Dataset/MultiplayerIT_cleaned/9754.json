The PC version of the game, punctual as usual, is identical in terms of modalities, structure and gameplay to what has already been seen on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360: we have the usual free exhibition, the Champions League (reproduced this year in a more faithful than in the past), the novelty constituted by the Libertadores Cup, the possibility of playing tournaments or entire championships and the inevitable Master and Become a legend modes, the first of which offers us this time an interesting online aspect in which we will be able to compare ourselves with other players from all over the world using the squad that we have literally built from scratch. There's also online multiplayer, of course, but unfortunately we couldn't try it due to a mysterious incompatibility between our version of PES 2011 and the just released patch 1.01. Given the quality that characterized the service in past editions, however, we can assume with relative serenity that the level has remained on excellent standards this year as well. Something old, something new As mentioned above, there are some new features in the range of modes available in Pro Evolution Soccer 2011, however the most important innovations are found somewhat ~between the lines~, in the operations we perform every time we play, in breaks internal matches and clearly in the organization of the team. The graphic interface, completely renewed and now really elegant and beautiful to look at, allows us to modify the most important options quickly and intuitively, and then go down to the ~fine~ adjustment proceeding by levels. The usual choice of the starting squad based on the physical conditions of each element of the team (still one of the strengths of PES from the point of view of realism and petty strategy), in fact, moves through completely new dynamics, almost ~drag & drop~, with the positions of the players on the field that can also be changed on the fly, in an extremely intuitive way, making the presence of the predetermined modules almost superfluous. There are still some gray areas (in this case, the not very clear indication of what will be our bench once on the field), however in general the work done appears really good. Furthermore, in the lower part of the screen, we find a further series of innovations, for example the advanced setting of the strategies, which can even be adjusted in order to accompany certain fractions of the game. For example, the team can work on the counterattack in the first half hour, and then give themselves to the offside trap in the end of the first half and start the second in the name of pressing from the area. It is an element of great value, especially for the most demanding players, who in this way can really customize their game down to the smallest detail. Another important novelty is represented by the ~series of feints~. We are well aware that using the right analog stick in PES it is possible to make your player perform feints or in any case tricks. Well, now these maneuvers can be customized and assigned to the four directions of the stick, so as to allow us to use some of the tricks we usually use more intuitively, possibly eliminating the superfluous. Departing train on platform two! At the beginning there was talk of the so-called ~rails~, which have always been identified as one of the biggest limitations of the Pro Evolution Soccer series, also and above all in comparison with the latest episodes of FIFA. Konami's 2011 product release doesn't completely eliminate this problem, but it certainly takes some steps in the right direction. The first of these steps concerns the management of passes, which now have a ~loading bar~ and whose speed must therefore be dosed so that the ball reaches more or less far, or to a closer or more distant partner. The system works reasonably well, but above all it does not appear constrained as in the past: our passages do not automatically arrive at their destination, on the contrary they follow the trajectory that we impress on them via the analog stick quite faithfully and consequently they can also be wrong. At the same time, the possibility of giving more or less force to the pass, moreover in a ~demagnetized~ context compared to the players, allows you to use that type of command also to obtain deep passes. ANDspeaking of in-depth passes, it must be said that the policy (already in place for some years) of limiting their effectiveness with a view to finalizing an action has also been maintained this year, thus arriving at the classic situation of the player unmarks and runs towards the opponent's goal, after receiving a deep pass, it doesn't happen often at all. In the same way, it has become very difficult, even using ~heavy~ center forwards, to produce those unstoppable rushes that often lead to a goal or in any case a shot on goal even starting from midfield. On the other hand, the management of crosses appears simplified in some ways: the flank players perhaps sweat to get out of the way and get to make the cross, especially in the higher difficulty levels (with the opposing defenders who really don't want to let go and are really difficult to deceive), but when they succeed then there are fairly numerous possibilities to impact on the fly and conclude. Also in these contexts the work done by the developers regarding the rendering of the ~physicality~ of the players is clear, when attackers and defenders keep each other in the area or when (going back to the previous discussion) one of our attackers leaves towards the penalty area opponent, ball and chain, and is tackled by a defender. The final result is quite realistic, the defense of the ball appears plausible and therefore situations are avoided in which there are champions able to evade any marking, perhaps by exploiting their speed. And finally we come to the shots: a further element of realism is revealed in the fallibility of many attackers, who often shoot out from a few meters or are unable to adequately exploit a successful triangulation (another maneuver which in the past, however, was almost always deadly ). It can certainly be disappointing to see a brave and brilliant action conclude from an unnaturally weak shot, however in general the balance between ~pros and cons~ of this approach is positive. Going to conclude the discussion, are there still these blessed ~rails~ in Pro Evolution Soccer or not? The answer is yes, the rails are present in various situations (see when a player chases a ball, and maybe it's not even the one closest to the action) and we have to deal with it. Whether or not they represent a serious problem, we believe depends on everyone's sensitivity and expectations. Especially remaining in the PC area, where the competition only this year begins to take on the connotations of the battle (often you learn!) that has been taking place on consoles for some time now. However, Konami's efforts to smooth out these problems, albeit very late, are starting to show and can only be appreciated. Instead, we need to make a decisive ~pull on the ear~ to those responsible for the failure to update the squads, a fool that we hope will be remedied very quickly with a patch. Technical realization Let's start by saying that we tried Pro Evolution Soccer 2011 on a configuration that was not exactly at the top for logistical reasons (ok, let's also say that the writer is doing it from the conference room of the Palafiori in Sanremo, during the courses of the Accademia della Canzone... ), yet the game engine turned out to be so light and efficient as to return respectable results: at the resolution of 1600 x 900 pixels, with all the effects at maximum and v-sync activated, the new edition of PES ran at sixty fixed frames per second, dropping to just over thirty only during the wider shots of the stadium and the public, those that characterize the shots between one half and another of the match. The artistic direction of the Konami title this year looks really excellent, with the match starting with a close-up three-quarter view but which, after the kick-off, moves away and rotates to settle on the long shot preferred by most players. The realization of free kicks and corner kicks is absolutely free of uncertainties while maintaining the setting already seen in the past, while the visual impact of all replays appears enriched by some very well dosed and convincing ~blur~ effects . One of the strengths of PES compared to FIFA has always been the fidelity in the physical aspect of the players, more or less important, compared to their real counterparts; and it is an element that undoubtedly conveys the passion of the developers for the world of football and its protagonists. There are clearly some players rendered less well than others, and in those cases it is possible to modify them using an editor that has never been so complete and well done. This framework of excellence is completed by a set of animations egtremendously rich and much better placed in the context than in the past, as well as an excellent level of definition of textures and scenarios in general. A good football game without an adequate audio commentary would not be ~complete~, and in the case of PES 2011 the couple formed by Pierluigi Pardo and Jos Altafini maintains levels of excellence: if the ~technical commentary~ (let's call it that... ) indeed appears essential and sometimes not very well ~acted~, Pardo's contribution is realistic, varied and very ~colorful~ on the emotional juncture. One can perhaps complain about his relatively unconvinced high notes, but it really is the only discordant note in a performance that once again annihilates the competition.", "date": "2010-10-07", "grade": "8.9"}
