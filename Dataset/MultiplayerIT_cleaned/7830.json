Donkey Kong, a saga of four exclusively portable episodes released from 2004 to 2010 and which are linked to none other than Donkey Kong, the revival (1994) on Game Boy of the immortal classic that started it all, which added a strong puzzle component to the established platform nature. Over time, the series in question has increasingly turned towards the narrow puzzle, drawing cues from titles such as Lemmings and introducing the Minis, spring puppets forged in the image and likeness of Mario and his friends, which the player must , in the thousands of ways provided by the different games, drive to the end of the level. In 2013 the transformation is complete, and Minis on the Move (which curiously also changes the title, substituting a friendly ~and~ for the much more conflictual ~Vs.~) presents itself as a pure puzzle, in the wake, not surprisingly, of the greatest successes for eShop, of which it is proposed as the new standard-bearer. Old and new pipes Evidently, however, in the world of puzzle games it must have been said, if not all, at least a lot, if it is true as it is true that Nintendo, usually capable of developing new and original ideas, had to resort to an already existing concept for the its new title: it's been since Dr. Mario that we haven't seen a Grande Enne game so clearly inspired by a competitor's product, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The concept we are talking about is that of Pipe Mania, a 1989 title in which it was necessary to convey a mephitic fluid in a series of pipes, to be built with the pieces that the CPU gave; here we are basically faced with the same idea: the Mini (initially only the Mini Mario available, then others will be added) starts from point A and must arrive at point B, represented by the classic star, perhaps in the meantime collecting the three coins which will allow him to completely complete each level, and once set in motion he will go on to the end following the path, with the only possibility granted to the player of accelerating his movement. The problem is that the stage is divided into blocks, each with a ~piece~ of road, and that some of these blocks are absent at the start of the game; therefore, to prevent the doll from falling into the void, the player must fill the voids by selecting the right block from those available, so as to create a path that leads to the star, and which perhaps passes, as already mentioned, from the three coins present in each level. On this very simple and tested basic concept, Nintendo Software Technology, developer of the saga since the beginning, however, has developed three different modes that we are going to examine: ~Mario in March~ is the only one available immediately, and it is the one that most directly refers to Pipe Mania. The pieces to be arranged are handed out by the artificial intelligence one at a time in a seemingly random way, and are arranged in a classic mariesco tube which can contain up to a maximum of five: if the tube fills up completely without the player, by arranging one block, you free up space, it's Game Over; similarly the game ends when the Mini falls into the void. The other modes are unlocked by solving a certain number of levels in Mario in March: the ~Palace of Puzzles~ sees us from the beginning with all the pieces available to arrange, and the player's task is to arrange them in the right way, while in ~Mini Shuffle~ the pieces are already arranged but you can act on them by activating them, rotating them and so on, managing no longer just one Mini but at least two. Then there is a fourth mode, ~The Great Jungle~, which mixes the rules of the other three on a trio of levels of extension and considerable difficulty. Minis on the Move therefore succeeds in a single product to satisfy all the various philosophies of the puzzle game, from the anxious challenge against time of Mario in Marcia to the more peaceful planning of the Palazzo dei Puzzle, and from the so-called multitasking management of the Mini Scrum up to the diabolical and uncompromising difficulty of the last series of three levels. What will be your favorite challenge is essentially a matter of taste, given that they are all excellently made: it is a point in favor not just, considering the 10 Euros required by a game that from this point of view is more complete than productions which cost six or seven times as much. The 3D effect Surely made with competence, but practically invisible, under penalty of Game Over. How do you explain? The upper screen is the one that represents the progress of the level in 3D, with the Mini advancing and making all his little moves, the blocks that rotate and transform, the various special effects... Ma it is on the lower screen that the player must be concentrated: this represents the level in a very schematic and immediately legible way, and it is where one acts to place the blocks. To the show, albeit always pleasant, which takes place above, including stereoscopy, thanks to the high pace and without pauses, you will hardly pay attention for more than a moment every now and then. The last word for a plumber Don't think that for all the 180 game levels things go on always the same and only progressively more difficult: every few levels in each of the first three game modes new elements will be introduced, as per good tradition. The bomb blocks, for example, useful for correcting errors but also necessary for inserting a new block in place of one that is no longer needed; the ~garbage bin~, where you can store three useless pieces in exchange for a special one that magically transforms into the best possible solution; the closed circuits to be created if necessary which save time and allow you to reach the coins placed higher up; and again, crossing blocks, rolling blocks, various switches, keys to collect before reaching the star... The imagination of the designers runs wild during the levels and, although we will never be faced with a totally new concept in the history of video games, it is significant how much everything manages to remain stimulating with the difficulty that progresses as you get there, even before you get there. you realize it, at the high levels now typical of eShop productions. The classic coupled between high difficulty and large number of stages would be enough, even in the total absence of multiplayer approaches, to ensure excellent longevity, but the final touch to this item is given by the presence of the editor: creating new and ingenious levels becomes as usual usually a game within a game, and the ability to share them online with other owners will ensure a constant influx of new challenges over time. As if that weren't enough, there are four fun mini-games useful for breaking the pace and cooling down a bit between one stage and another: three of them are variations on the theme of the ~slingshot~ to be controlled via touch screen to hit the elements that flutter on the upper screen (to mention in this regard a nice mockery of Molyneux's Curiosity, how unaware it is), the fourth instead sees us, again via touch screen, control the height of a platform to ensure that Mario collects as many coins as possible while avoiding being hit by Bullet Bills. Where, however, it seems that NST has spared itself is in the technical/aesthetic sector, thanks to the fact that the actual action takes place only on the touch screen with a two-dimensional and schematic representation of the playing field: a pleasant graphic but nothing more, a practically useless 3D effect as you will read in the appropriate paragraph and a continuous recycling of the albeit nice sound elements are all in all understandable defects in a production dedicated to digital delivery. Perhaps the brilliant touch is missing, but Minis on the Move is, at 10 Euros, a highly recommended purchase.", "date": "2013-05-20", "grade": "8.0"}
