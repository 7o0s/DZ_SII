Available without much advertising or marketing, the expansion called in a highly ironic and long-winded Super Ultra can already be found on the Xbox One Marketplace, downloadable for 9.99 euros Dead Rising 3 Arcade Remix Hyper Edition EX Plus Alpha, for friends ~Arcade Remix~ from now on so as not to further deteriorate the writer's keyboard. The DLC is obviously free for all those who have subscribed to a season pass for the game, which already includes all published and future digital content. Capcom pays homage to itself with an over the top, ironic and self-celebratory DLC And what will the next DLC be called? The contents dedicated to Dead Rising 3 released during the winter have not really excited or exalted the general public, revealing themselves as small expansions that added little or nothing to the classic gameplay of the game and the main storyline. Capcom, probably realizing that a lively turn was needed, decided to publish this bizarre DLC all focused on self-celebration of the 90s, taking its cue from their main masterpiece, that Street Fighter II very dear to everyone, but without ignoring many others its cornerstones such as Resident Evil, Darkstalkers or Ghosts 'n Ghouls. In the DLC of Dead Rising 3, Arcade Remix, there is the whole Capcom story of the last twenty years, retraced through quotes, music and background, characters and even going so far as to corrupt the original matrix of the graphic sector by ~remixing~ it in '90s style 90, an operation that is very reminiscent of the path already taken by Ubisoft with their recent Far Cry: Blood Dragon, also redesigned in cel shading and bright colors tending towards purple, red and green. Super trendy at the time, downright awful nowadays but absolutely fascinating for the nostalgic. Arcade Remix takes the philosophy behind the game to the extreme, that is to allow the player a few hours of absolute ~button mashing~ entertainment in Sengoku Musou style, drilling thousands of zombies one after the other without stopping, without thinking, without having a shred of strategy at all. As soon as the game starts we are asked to choose between four characters, with the possibility of playing them all with a chaotic and crazy online multiplayer. There is the legendary and rocky Frank West, the sensual Annie Green, Chuck Green, and Nick Ramos all muscles and zero brains, protagonist of Dead Rising 3. It starts from one of the four selectable arenas, those of the third chapter, with a layout which immediately refers to the map of the city of Final Fight (and here we begin to get gassed) and when Ken's track from Street Fighter II suddenly attacks, one of the most moving and famous in history, we start off on the right foot. Each area is divided into five sections, structured as partially free sandboxes to explore and complete before moving on to the next (exactly like in the Musou series, as we said before). The game also tries to be a little varied, even in its ferocious schizophrenic monotony, requiring the achievement of diversified objectives in order to proceed. Most of the time it's a question of having to kill a certain number of zombies within a set time, complete with a stopwatch and beat'em up style life bar, other times we have to defeat mini-bosses or destroy some objects scattered around the level . Still other times there are bonus missions with small objectives that have the task of breaking up the action, but failing miserably in their purpose as Arcade Remix is pure adrenaline. The gameplay of the base game has been ~planed~ by eliminating many elements such as the choice and composition of weapons (here there is only the possibility of having the main weapon or taking some modified means of transport) and also all the talk about saves of the survivors. The Capcom self-celebration involves the entire game structure, not just the graphic remix and the accompanying music, always wonderful even after twenty years. There are also power ups inspired by some Capcom classics such as 1942 (you can call it an air raid), Resident Evil, Mega Man, Onimusha, but also Dino Crisis and many others. Every time we complete an objective or finish a level we unlock an alternative costume for the protagonists, and there are several really hilarious ones such as Felicia, the cat from Darkstalkers, Captain Commando or Haggar from Final Fight. In addition to the fun and certainly satisfying aspects for all fans, however, we must also talk about the more critical ones such as the fact that the DLC is able to entertain for a very short time. Its very nature purely action, without any minimum thinkI was neither strategic nor logical, it determines a rapid decline in the player's interest after a few hours of wild zombie-bashing almost all the same. While appreciating the minimum effort made by Capcom to differentiate the objectives, it is still a question of scraping together killings after killings without the slightest shame in a wildly crazy and alienating way, without even the possibility of unlocking special items, collectibles or other (perhaps a jukebox with music?). The Capcom universe could certainly have been exploited better thanks to the infinite tributes that this DLC dedicates to it. We warmly recommend it to all fans of the Osaka house, to those who loved video games in the 90s, to all those who have passed the ~antas~ and still enjoy ~games~. We do not recommend it to those who, on the other hand, want something deeper and less alienating.", "date": "2014-06-22", "grade": null}
