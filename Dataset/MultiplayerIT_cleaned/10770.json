{"name": "Avventura robotica", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/robo_a.html", "text": "Of the handful of titles originally planned by HeroCraft for iPhone, Robo is certainly the least successful. And it's a shame, because it is an extremely valid title from the point of view of the type of playful experience it could offer, ruined however by a too rough technical realization. But let's go in order. The user takes on the role of Robo, an automaton who wants to reach his beloved cybernetics, 76 levels away from him. There are many internships that make up the adventure, a truly remarkable number which in normal cases would be an indication of excellent longevity, but in Robo's it becomes an almost counterproductive fact. Because the HeroCraft product is, quite simply, a very frustrating puzzle game. Part of the blame must be assigned to a grim level design, which does not capitalize on good intuitions in terms of play structure. In each of the 76 levels, Robo's task is to reach the exit avoiding the impact with deadly laser beams, which must be obstructed or destroyed using some elements available within the scenario: there are rocks that serve block the energy beams, mirrors useful to divert their trajectory and even bombs essential to destroy them without too many compliments. Obviously, the juxtaposition of these elements is far from casual, and the leitmotif of the game is expressed precisely in the attempt to correctly exploit all the ~weapons~ made available by the developers. Here, however, the problems begin: first of all, Robo presents a level of difficulty that is far too steep, with a challenge rate that begins to get extremely serious as early as the eighth stage. It goes without saying that, given these assumptions, it becomes truly unthinkable to talk about longevity when it is not excluded that most users throw in the towel after the first handful of schemes. Furthermore, Robo is guilty of a big naivety: it is only possible to push the objects described above, so if you make a wrong move and end up leaning one against the wall, there is no other solution than to restart the level. from the beginning. A far from remote eventuality, given the bad control system developed by HeroCraft: Robo's movements are controlled by pressing the touchscreen in one of the four main directions, but the detection is not precise enough to guarantee accurate movements at the moment of need. If we consider how from a graphic point of view, Robo also shows some discrete qualities, it is evident that the disappointment for such a badly wasted opportunity is inevitable.", "date": "2009-04-07", "grade": "S.V."}
