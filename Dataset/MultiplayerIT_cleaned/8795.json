{"name": "Resident Evil: Revelations", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/98458-tempo-di-rivelazioni.html", "text": "That the 3DS has taken off from the quicksand in which it seemed to be sinking is now evident; substantial price cuts together with the release of great games headed by Mario's brace have made the console attractive to consumers, who have rewarded Nintendo with an impressive amount of consoles sold. However, to maintain the ~momentum~, especially with the imminent launch of Ps Vita in the West and the ever-threatening universe of smartphones in constant ferment, it is essential that the good titles continue to be churned out, preferably not only from the Kyoto house. For this beginning of 2012, the role of forerunner has been taken with courage and merit by Capcom, launching a chapter of Resident Evil exclusively for the three-dimensional handheld. Fear? Resident Evil: Revelations is not a portable reduction, mind you; while the story of Capcom's survival horror has touched Nintendo portables on more than one occasion, starting with the heartwarming conversion of the first Game Boy Color game that never made it to stores, it's the first time a page has been written entirely new within the narrative timeline of the main series away from home screens. An important moment that necessarily had to coincide with a worthy and valid episode, and in some respects Resident Evil: Revelations even went beyond these qualitative premises. Just the fact that the protagonists are Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, or the most loved by the fans, clearly demonstrates how Capcom wanted to get serious. The plot, chronologically placed between the fourth and fifth chapter, with a rather unfortunate coincidence for us Italians compared to the news events, takes place largely on board a cruise ship - the Queen Zenobia - on which Jill and her companion Parker Luciani find themselves looking for traces of the missing Chris. The development of the narration passes through essential elements such as the T-Virus, non-governmental organizations against the threat of bio-organic weapons of which the ~good~ ones belong (the BSAA), mysterious federal commissions for bioterrorism (the FBC) and groups of dangerous terrorists (Veltro); the end result is always the usual improbable B-Movie script, convoluted and not always clear, with twists and turns now rather phoned and caricatured characters not very credible. But in the end this is part of the charm of Resident Evil, and Capcom's will with this Revelations was obviously certainly not to establish a turning point for the franchise. Nonetheless, in the single player story mode, it is possible to appreciate a partial ~return to origins~ work as regards the balance of the gameplay: less arcade shooter, more survival horror with a staid rhythm. In reality this choice seems rather an intelligent consideration on the basis of the technical capabilities of the 3DS, good but certainly not sensational; therefore, to avoid large environments and open spaces that would have put the laptop chips on the ropes, the setting of the ship was chosen, which lends itself perfectly to this sense with corridors and rooms of rather limited size, with very rare exceptions. At the same time locations of this type leave room for encounters with few enemies at the same time, with the player who is therefore almost never outnumbered; for this reason an at least slightly elaborate artificial intelligence of the opponents would have been welcome, while the result in this respect is rather disappointing. The attack patterns for the creatures are in fact very few and limited, practically never surprising, and destined to be repeated throughout the adventure; the development of the series should necessarily pass here, since right now the combat phases of Resident Evil: Revelations are very rarely exciting or demanding, despite the possibility of shooting through a first person view that also allows you to move slowly. And considering the almost complete absence of puzzles and puzzles, the specific weight of the fights becomes even greater. Always remaining on the front of the enemies, the design that characterizes its appearance can also be considered a defect for some, although it is a decidedly subjective element; the good old ~classic~ zombies have been replaced by aberrations very similar to those of Silent Hill, with a very tangible lack of character and personality. Let me be clear, these notes certainly shouldn't suggest a disappointing single player component of Resident Evil: Revelations; the structure divided into chapters, 12 in total, like a television series is quite apt, and despite the heavy backtracking and the obvious qualitative drops of some passages especially in the case of those set away from the ship, the adventure flows quite pleasantly up to the final credits which in our case arrived at the stroke of 9 precise hours of play. Even the novelty of Genesis, a sort of scanner with which to examine settings and enemies to obtain objects, proves to be pleasant even if not fully exploited as it could have been. Those who started blowing the brains out of the undead in 1996, however, will struggle to put Revelations among the best episodes that the series has offered. The 3D effect The excellent work in the graphic field performed by Capcom also extends to the implementation of the three-dimensional effect, which is certainly one of the best applications seen so far on the Nintendo laptop in Resident Evil: Revelations. The sense of depth gives a lot to the settings, increasing immersion and involvement; the inborn flaw of needing to precisely maintain the correct angle of the console remains, but there isn't much you can do about that. It smells like dead However, many, if not all of the defects listed so far are willingly overshadowed by the sumptuous aesthetic component of the Capcom production, capable of offering a sensational example of what the 3DS is capable of doing if placed in good hands. Let me be clear, and we have already said it: Resident Evil: Revelations is a ~clever~ product, which adopts solutions that make it possible to reduce the polygonal load on the screen and thus optimize the result to the maximum. The difference between the glorious moments in the ship's cramped quarters versus the bland ones in open or wider areas is clear, as is the rare encounters with more than 3 enemies on screen at once are limited to the poorest detail areas . That said, it's really hard not to be impressed by the aesthetic component of Revelations, in some situations even comparable to that of Resident Evil 5. The polygonal models of the protagonists, for example, are simply excellent, as are the lighting effects and most of the animations. A little aliasing and not always defined textures don't affect the overall picture too much. Compatibility with the Circle Pad Pro, or Sliding Pad Pro as it is officially called in our area, is an absolutely welcome addition; despite being Resident Evil: Revelations completely playable even without the unwatchable peripheral, the latter provides both a better grip of the console and superior comfort over long sessions, and the possibility of managing the view and interaction with objects more effectively . The description of the secondary modes also deserves the right space, which demonstrate the particular commitment on the part of Capcom in an attempt to package a complete and satisfactory product even once the main story has been completed. These are the missions, or objectives to be met to obtain bonuses of various kinds, and above all the Raid mode; the latter, which can be tackled in single, local or online multiplayer, is based on fragments of levels infested with enemies to be crossed until you reach the exit. At the end of each stage, in addition to developing your character, you will be able to earn weapons and points to spend in a special shop. A stimulating and fun mode, especially if tackled cooperatively with a friend, and which tastes like something much more than a simple filler.", "date": "2012-01-30", "grade": "S.V."}
