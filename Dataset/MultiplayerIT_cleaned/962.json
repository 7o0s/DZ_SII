Sam Fisher, protagonist of the game, returns in a big way. Rarely, in a video game, have we been able to observe the main character perform such a number of actions and moves. The playability of Splinter Cell has been refined in a certain direction, that of being able to allow the player to carry out any desired action conceivable with the equipment and paraphernalia of an undercover agent. The producer of the series, interviewed at E3 2002 on the occasion of the release of the first game, explicitly said that the peculiarity of Splinter Cell lies precisely in the use of the available Items. And by the effect that the combination of them can have against the enemy or certain adverse conditions. Rarely, in a video game, have we been able to observe the main character perform such a number of actions and moves Sam Fisher, all-round agent, from assault to infiltration. The focus of ~Chaos Theory~, like the other chapters, remains the single-player adventure, in the full style of the Tom Clancy novels. Intrigues, international criminals, weapons of mass destruction and government leaders taken hostage. Bread for Sam Fisher's teeth, the military classic always ready to leave for action in any part of the globe. A tough guy. The nice addition that UbiSoft gives us is the Cooperative Mode, the mode that allows us to play as a couple with a friend and complete the missions together. Tackling certain levels in pairs, instead of alone, will feel completely different. There are numerous ~combos~ that it is possible to carry out, for example catapulting yourself over a wall that is too high, helping yourself to climb over a certain obstacle, attracting the attention of enemies while our partner knocks them out with a burst of machine gun. There is no doubt that this mode brings a tremendous breath of fresh air and fun to the genre. Unfortunately the Cubic version doesn't have an online option, sad to say. The multiplayer game connected to the network represents for Chaos Theory a strong attraction and a consistent novelty in the genre, too much not to be considered. The lack of this mode now weighs heavily on most cross-platform games that do not have it. To remedy this shortcoming and offer something different from the other versions, UbiSoft decided to take advantage of the connectivity between GameCube and GameBoy Advance. This opportunity had already been considered on ~Pandora Tomorrow~, and is therefore nothing new for the series. Even this time, however, the final result is certainly not satisfactory. The infamous ~connectivity~ turns out to be just a few nice features such as the ability to view OPSAT messages directly on the GBA screen, or be able to look at some maps, finally look at the micro camera view on our laptop. All very nice, but overall it doesn't weigh as much as a lack of online mode, honestly. We can safely say that UbiSoft has given us yet another great game. Splinter Cell proves to be not only the cornerstone of the Stealth Action genre, but also a very fresh saga and one of the best games available on Nintendo GameCube. The audiovisual sector has been exponentially improved, the addition of the cooperative mode is a breath of fresh air, new weapons and new items are the heart of the gameplay of this game and the 10 total levels of Chaos Theory will keep us busy for at least 12-14 hours. The finishing touches to the camera have been done, and now it works like a charm. However, it remains clear that due to the cuts to the levels, the graphics sector and above all to the entire online mode, this Gamecube version of Chaos Theory remains the weakest of the group. Pros: Top audiovisual department Greatly improved AI co-op mode Cons: Revamped level design Some trimmed effects No online mode When the game is hard As already mentioned at the beginning, objects and weapons are the real protagonists of Splinter Cell. Finally it will also be possible to use a war knife, in full rambesque style. The knife will be used for multiple functions, such as opening new paths by cutting paper walls, threatening, or more sympathetically slipping it casually into the carotid artery of the enemy on duty. Before starting each mission, in the briefing, it will be possible to choose the type of equipment to wear. We can opt for a ~stealth~ supply, therefore a knife, sniper rifle, pistol, or for a more aggressive ~assault~, with a machine gun and grenades. There is also a third configuration which involves the use of the most useful objects and weapons for the level faced, automatically decided by the CPU. PAs far as the graphics sector is concerned, we can safely say that we are dealing with one of the most beautiful games ever to appear on the Gamecube, and it manages to push the hardware to its limits. However, most of the levels have been slightly modified compared to the Xbox counterpart to better render the environments. As for the graphics sector, we can safely say that we are dealing with one of the most beautiful games ever to appear on Gamecube When the game is hard The size of the game levels appears, in comparison, quite small. Small outline details have also been eliminated so as not to burden the graphics engine too much. It seems clear that Splinter Cell Chaos Theory was originally programmed making the most of the Xbox hardware, only to be ~adapted~ to other consoles later. However, the choice of retouching seems right given that compared to the Xbox version there are no major differences in overall visual impact, however at the expense of less freedom of movement in the game. In the green-crossed version it was possible to cross the levels being able to choose from multiple ways, while on the GameCube, in some levels, everything is much more linear, to the detriment of the game's stealth structure. However, the audio sector remains at the top, supporting a very valid Dolby Pro LogicII. Effects, samples and music are treated to the maximum. The amount of noises and sounds is impressive, and well suited to a game of this genre. Once in a while, in fact, the audio sector is an integral part of the Gameplay. The sophisticated AI of the enemy characters can in fact hear and detect our smallest noise. In running and hiding we should be very careful not to make any sort of detectable sound, or we will be relentlessly subjected to enemy fire. The warning system, once discovered, is damned more effective than in Pandora Tomorrow, in which after a given time the enemies returned to their usual patrol. In Chaos Theory they investigate, retrace their steps, call each other, arrive in groups, separate and surround us until they manage to track us down. Chaos Theory on PS2 The Playstation 2 version of the last chapter starring Sam Fisher could not be missing, and the results can be judged as good but not exceptional. The ten levels offered on the Sony black monolith have also enjoyed a restructuring compared to the Xbox counterpart, to accommodate the lower hardware power. The results have manifested in tighter spaces and less complex levels, which therefore reduce the strategy and the longevity of the title. The same goes from a technical point of view, where the game has undergone several ~cuts~ (especially as regards the video cleaning and the management of the light sources) even if the result is still good. Unlike the Gamecube version, and equally to the Xbox one, there is instead the online mode, which establishes the goodness of a title that however does not find its maximum expression on Playstation 2, while remaining a must for all fans of the genre. Splinter Cell comes to its third appearance on our screens. From the first chapter, in which perhaps few would have bet, many things have changed. For the better, fortunately. Concept and gameplay have been able to renew themselves over the years, with additions and improvements, as well as the audiovisual sector which has made great strides. If the first Splinter Cell represented the first generation of 128bit games for better or for worse, the sequel Pandora Tomorrow the second, with Chaos Theory we dive directly into the last generation, and it is incredible to see the progress made by UbiSoft. Splinter Cell is a mature, finished saga, in some ways it represents the main trend of the genre it represents: the stealth game.", "date": "2005-04-18", "grade": null}
