{"name": "Blue Fire", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/blue-fire-recensione.html", "text": "Pour 100 grams of The Legend of Zelda (classic recipe) into cold water, bring to a boil over low heat, then pour at least 80 grams of Dark Souls powder into the pot, distributing it with large spoonfuls, so as not to create lumps. When the mixture appears solid, add a portion of Super Mario Bros., sprinkled with Super Meat Boy powder and Hollow Knight gems. Cook for half an hour and voil, ROBI Studios' game is done. Surely, given the ingredients, a delicious dish will come out that will make us lick our mustaches... Unfortunately we can assure you that the taste is decidedly bland because, as we will see in the course of the review, Blue Fire suffers from some extreme design choices, which have proved to be counterproductive. History We are in the world of Penumbra and the player plays the role of a mysterious character who woke up in the laboratory of a fortress suspended in the air, whose rooms are almost all barred and whose halls are full of strange stinging formations. At first our goal is not clear and all we can do is wander around following the directions of the tutorial. So the meeting with some key characters will begin to reveal what our true mission is, of which we will of course not tell you anything. The protagonist is armed with two swords which he uses in unison and which he can upgrade during the adventure. He doesn't have a block, but he can dodge and as the game progresses he develops different defensive powers, which help him in the more difficult fights, especially those with bosses. The creatures to face are quite varied: gelatinous insects, ghost riders, fire monsters, carnivorous plants, shadow creatures and so on and so forth. The gameplay itself is focused on exploration, with some sections that become reachable only after obtaining a certain object, a certain power or having performed a certain action, in pure metroidvania style. As you may have understood from the introduction, Blue Fire is a hodgepodge of different genres, all easily identifiable while playing. It is therefore difficult to reduce it to a single source of inspiration. From time to time we also come across non-hostile characters, survivors of the evil that has invaded the castle. The possibility of communicating via emotes, which can be purchased from statues, is interesting, which gives the whole thing a truly contemporary touch and makes the interactions more varied. However, the focus of the gameplay is another, as can be understood from the first minutes of the game. Platform sections Blue Fire is chock full of platforming sections, so much so that it often feels like you're actually dealing with a Super Mario clone, rather than an action RPG. There are platforms everywhere and one of the biggest difficulties with which you are confronted is precisely that of not falling into some abyss, ending up losing precious energy or, worse, starting over from the last statue used to save the game. Fortunately, the protagonist not only knows how to make miraculous leaps, which with the development of certain skills will become even more impressive, but he can also cling to the edges of the platforms to avoid falling off. Too bad that the whole system suffers from a certain stickiness which makes some game phases particularly frustrating, especially those of the Void. Let's explain: in Blue Fire the protagonist can enter a sort of parallel world made up of self-propelled platforms suspended in thin air, to obtain new powers. This is where Blue Fire transforms into a kind of 3D Super Meat Boy, sadly without the same great design. The objective of each of these phases is to get to the end of very difficult courses, collecting the spheres scattered on the various platforms. Unfortunately it is often necessary to make millimeter leaps, made even more difficult by the management of the camera, which struggles to render the actual distance between two platforms as it should and which often does not follow the action as it should, and by the aforementioned stickiness, with the character ending up in a vacuum even though he could apparently have clung to a ledge. However, it is not the difficulty itself that annoys, but the way in which the deaths are handled: the first sections of Void are quite short and failing is not a big drama, but the advanced ones become long and very complicated, especially when double jump occurs and a chance to run along the walls in Sands of Time style. Always start from the beginning (yes, if you fall below or run out of energy you are forced to start over from scratch, while keeping all the collected spheres, which are the least of the problems in terms of gameplay), even when maybe it was one step away fromin the end, it becomes downright frustrating. We are talking in some cases of dozens of attempts to be made before reaching the finish line and unlocking the coveted power. Super Meat Boy and clones solve thanks to very short levels, which therefore repeat very quickly, and having made extreme difficulty their focus. In Blue Fire, on the other hand, one quickly wonders who makes us suffer so much. Combat system The combat system isn't very successful either. The developers' idea was probably to create a mix between the various genres already mentioned, but the result is very unconvincing. Attacks are slippery, so to speak, and attempts to fight more technically are often frustrated by ill-judged design choices. For example, erecting a barrier to defend yourself from enemies on a very narrow platform means in many cases being bounced like pinball balls and ending up in the void, or sometimes it is enough simply to carry out a direct attack to slip underneath, perhaps deceived by the camera position, which often makes the battlefield unreadable. In the advanced stages, things become even worse and much more confusing, so much so that overcoming certain clashes is very tiring and you are never rewarded by the pleasure given by the feeling of being really improved, as happens for example in Dark Souls. Of course, the progression of the character is in some ways interesting, as are some of his special abilities that can be acquired by exploring the maps from top to bottom, but it is thwarted by a punishing design, unfortunately in the wrongest possible sense of the term, and by a deficient realization. Challenge or frustration? As you will have understood by reading the article, the problem with Blue Fire is not that it makes life hard for the player, making him die over and over again, which is certainly an interesting and very modern philosophical choice for a title of this kind, but the inability of the design to somewhat mitigate the frustration of this setup. Incidentally: when the player begins to think that he cannot overcome a certain obstacle not because of his fault, but due to the control system or faulty game mechanics, the taste for the challenge decays and little can be done to resolve the situation. fascinating scenery and some interesting puzzles or well thought out (albeit very simple) cut scenes. And it's a disappointment, because Blue Fire still has a lot to offer to those who can resist its angularity. It also has an incisive, albeit simple, graphic style and an underlying sympathy that does not fail despite the defects described. In its own way, it's also pleasant, as long as you can bear the strong feeling that permeates the whole adventure of having been developed by someone who has decided to sacrifice part of the game to the desire to make it as difficult as possible, even if in an artificial way and inadequate.", "date": "2021-02-04", "grade": "6.0"}
