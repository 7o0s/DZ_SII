Of course, a few months ago the owners of PlayStation 2 (or backward compatible PlayStation 3, in short) had the opportunity to play what is considered to be the best JRPG of the last generation of consoles, Persona 3 FES, so it's a good challenge with a game practically perfect. And so, we return to the daily Japanese student life, facing a new year full of friendships, lessons, parties, blood and murders... Pursue your true self! The story of Persona 4 begins in April 2011 when the protagonist, the player's alter ego and therefore to be named at will, moves to the quiet rural town of Inaba to live with his uncle, the policeman Ryotaro Doujima, and his little cousin. His new schoolmates and above all the supernatural power to summon Personas, psychic creatures with extraordinary powers, immediately enter the protagonist's disarrayed life: an ability that will perhaps be the only weapon to fight a mysterious murderer who is shedding blood in the village. , certainly linked to the disturbing Midnight Channel, a television channel that hides a parallel dimension in which it is possible to enter only if one is predisposed. Together with his companions and their respective Personas, the protagonist thus decides to hunt down the killer, an investigation that will last for the entire school year until the shocking epilogue... Unlike Persona 3, the new Atlus adventure offers a less epic and catastrophic plot, more intimate we could say, and no less original and disturbing. As in the prequel, ample space is given to the school and ordinary life of the characters, which is marked out through the days of the calendar, respecting holidays and real events: the player attends lessons and sports clubs, participates in extracurricular events and leisure activities in his free time, cementing his relationship with the various side characters, whether they are usable in combat or not. The entire mechanics of the Social Links are back, through which the Personas are strengthened: the subplots that characterize each character are once again small narrative works of art, which enormously deepen the microworld in which the whole story is set. Death is a hunter unknown to his prey... Persona 4 does not differ particularly from the prequel in terms of gameplay, in fact it imports the main mechanics by improving or varying them significantly, offering a more complete experience - and in a certain sense even more accessible - to every type of player. The main difference certainly lies in the management of battles: while in Persona 3 the player had direct control only over the protagonist, with the other party members entrusted to a modest AI, in Persona 4 instead it is possible to indicate exactly to each of the four members of the group what action to perform during his turn, whether it is to attack with the equipped weapon, use an object, assume a defensive position (a novelty that allows you to reduce damage) or, of course, summon your own person to launch pyrotechnic special attacks . This more traditional mechanic allows complete control of the progress of the clashes with a result that is perhaps less original but certainly also less unpredictable. On the other hand, this simplification of the battle-system is counterbalanced by the return of Weaknesses, i.e. the weaknesses that temporarily KO a fighter when hit by his opposite element, making him lose a turn and increasing the damage that can be inflicted on him, whether a party mate or an enemy. Well, while in Persona 3 it was possible to discover the weaknesses of the enemies through the scanning ability of one of the characters, in Persona 4 instead you will have to proceed by trial and error and until the weakness of an enemy is discovered it will not be memorized. Student War However, the fights are only a part of the adventure, once again marked from day to day by a very common calendar. Each day is divided into moments in which the player has the opportunity to perform various actions, such as making purchases, improving their psychophysical characteristics, generating new Personas and above all attending the numerous supporting and main characters that make up the varied and very large cast of Persona 4 : Social Links this time not only allow you to discover narrative background and obtain new Personas, but also unlock some reactions and combat skills for the characters involved.And then, of course, there is the Midnight Channel, the ~television~ dimension mysteriously linked to the murders that are afflicting the country: instead of a single, gigantic and monothematic dungeon like the Tartarus of Persona 3, Persona 4 offers a remarkable variety of settings relating to the psyche of the character involved in the relative phase of the game. Furthermore, in Persona 4 the dungeon structure itself has been made more user-friendly and less random, with save and exit points arranged ad hoc during exploration. The parallel dimension in which it is possible to fight can be explored at will, instead of only at night as in Persona 3, but the challenge is linked to the weather conditions and therefore it is up to the player to decide when it is appropriate to venture into the Midnight Channel to upgrade characters, collect the materials needed to build new weapons or try out new Personas. To make a big game, you don't need a big brush Persona 4 therefore offers numerous improvements to the already excellent Persona 3 formula, also in the form of numerous small details that make the experience more intuitive: now, for example, it is possible to move from one point of the country to another with the pressure of a few keys , rather than traversing through various screens to get back to the main map, and when merging new Personas you can press a key to see a detailed description of their abilities, inexplicably impossible in the prequel. However, the improvements are marginal from a technical point of view. Persona 4 is graphically very similar to the prequel, it maintains the same exquisitely Japanese cartoony design, expressed above all in the splendid artwork and in the exquisitely crafted animated sequences. However, the general detail of the polygonal models and of the various settings, vivid and detailed, has been increased. As already mentioned, the dungeons express personality and present a remarkable graphic variety, even if the enemies are essentially recycled from Persona 3, but after all they are rather canonical creatures in the Shin Megami Tensei series. The dubbing in general is commendable and the sound accompaniment is splendid, so rich in musical themes of various kinds, from rock to hip hop, always spot on and in most cases entirely sung, able to give the bizarre and bloody events a of Japanese everyday life.", "date": "2009-02-09", "grade": "9.2"}
