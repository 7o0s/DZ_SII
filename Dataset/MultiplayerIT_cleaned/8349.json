{"name": "De profundis", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/107898-mass-effect-3-leviathan-de-profundis.html", "text": "Perhaps one of the most controversial and discussed sagas of this generation, that of Mass Effect was a trilogy capable of making millions of gamers dream, and its conclusion created many discrepancies, so much so as to induce the development team to propose new endings extended to calm the most polemical spirits. But evidently it didn't end there. The latest expansion called Leviathan offers a brand new two hours of single player campaign, with new locations, weapons, characters, planets, dialogues and an unexpected twist. All for the equivalent of ten Euros. Will it be worth it? Darkness is impenetrable The expansion is perfectly integrated with the main campaign and requires a save before the final showdown. The story begins when Captain Shepard is called to the Citadel by Garrett Bryson, a researcher specializing in ancient artifacts, who informs him of the existence of a very powerful creature capable of countering the Reapers. However, the precious information is interrupted by Bryson's assistant, who kills him in an evident state of trance, a condition suspiciously similar to indoctrination. This yellow-stained incipit is an excellent pretext for an investigation that leads Shepard and his Normandy in search of the Leviathan, through unprecedented locations ranging from a mining station to an abandoned vessel, with a simply breathtaking conclusion in the depths of the sea. There is obviously no shortage of furious firefights, capable of bringing to mind the pleasant hours spent with the main game, with respect to which, however, not only do they not say anything new, but they almost struggle to replicate its quality. Despite the efforts made in proposing differentiated and spectacular situations (there is also a new type of mech), these are fights that never manage to escape the schematic, resulting in predictable patterns and definitively drawing a limit on the developers' ability to do so . As far as narrative and atmosphere are concerned, however, it is quite another matter, we are still faced with a product capable of literally gluing to the armchair, as well as the heroism of Commander Shepard, a character who has rightly entered the collective imagination and who will be missed by many we. Xbox 360 goals Mass Effect 3: Leviathan offers 4 new objectives for a total of 125 player points. Three of these punctuate the main adventure, which means that it will be enough to finish the DLC to get them, but beware of the bonus objective, called ~Conspiracy theorist~, as to obtain it you need to discover a certain number of clues in Bryson's laboratory. A Shepard in yellow New to this DLC are the investigation-based sections, which take place in Bryson's own laboratory and force the player to search for clues to discover the location to reach. These, in addition to breaking up the action, represent real breaths of fresh air that give back to the saga that graphic adventure component that had been somewhat lost over the years, even if everything is strongly suggested by the game itself. Also noteworthy is the entire section relating to the mining station, characterized by a memorable atmosphere and clearly inspired by Dead Space, which slows down to favor a survival horror climate. In our opinion, sections like these are never enough and are much more charismatic than firefights. There are also new parts dedicated to the galactic map. The real twist, however, comes at the end, with ten minutes of cutscenes that are nothing short of unsettling. Needless to go around it, BioWare strikes again by revealing the truth nature of the Reapers and forcing us to reconsider the same ending of the trilogy, but not questioning it. Perhaps influenced by the criticisms (in our opinion exaggerated) matured by the community, the writers have taken the path of captions, in line with the endings of the Extended Cut, thus removing a thread of the charm of the unknown that the original endings managed to arouse, but at the same time clarifying certain crucial points. We are sure however that the implications suggested by this ending will be able to create further debates. Mass Effect 3: Leviathan is probably the best single player DLC released for this episode, definitely superior to the previous one From the Ashes, which was little more than a pretext to enlist the Prothean Javik in your ranks. In this case, however, we are faced with an expansion packaged with care as one can expect from BioWare, varied, rather long and with an ending that would be a crime to miss, thus representing an almost obligatory purchase for all enthusiasts, even if the shoot sectionsThey are not distinguished by quality. A defect on which we are willing to fly over in order to experience a new adventure together with Shepard and his companions.", "date": "2012-08-31", "grade": null}
