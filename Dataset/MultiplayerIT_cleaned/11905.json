{"name": "RACE 07: Official WTCC Game - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/race-07-official-wtcc-game-recensione.html", "text": "Online communities One of the aspects on which RACE 07 aims to carve out a space in the increasingly crowded sector of driving titles is multiplayer. Since it will still be mandatory to have a connection to register the game on Steam (the days are over when the Valve platform did not allow you to play offline or gave installation problems), access the online leaderboards and play races and championships against others opponents in the flesh, in addition to being extremely intuitive, it will allow you to extend the longevity of a title that is in itself decidedly substantial. It will also be possible to connect to the best community sites without even leaving the game, given the convenient interface available. Comment RACE 07 is a driving game intended for a slice of enthusiasts capable of appreciating extreme simulations and looking for that set-up capable of saving those precious tenths capable of making the difference in single and multiplayer. Also recommended for those who are thinking of approaching this kind of driving but have never done it for fear of going crazy among a thousand options. The game could disappoint those who expect graphics in step with the times, but even so we are at acceptable levels, just look at the images to get an idea of what the title offers. Finally, the large number of licenses and circuits present should not be underestimated. Pros Lots of licenses available Excellent audio Promising multiplayer Cons Impeccable simulation Not up-to-date graphics Requires internet to work PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: Pentium IV 1.7 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 128 MB Video Card: GeForce 3 or Radeon with 64 MB Ram Disk Space: 2.5 GB Recommended Requirements Processor: Pentium IV 3 GHz or AMD equivalent RAM: 2 GB Video Card: GeForce or Radeon with 512 MB of memory Disk Space: 2.5 GB Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo 1.66 GHz processor RAM: 2 GB DDR2 Video Card: Geforce 7300 with 256 MB of memory Driving model for every taste The driving model of RACE 07 offers a level of simulation which, although it does not come close to the peaks reached by GTR 2, guarantees a certain thickness. Each vehicle has specific values such as weight, engine, power, gearbox and traction. To take advantage of your car properly, you will need to choose the one that best suits the player's driving style, then calibrating tires, suspensions, brakes, pressure and so on from time to time. A certain knowledge of simulators allows you to immediately become familiar with all these parameters inside the garage and later on the track, also to avoid ending up on dirt roads at every single corner. Those who find themselves fasting from this kind of title can still opt for an arcade difficulty level, which will allow newbies to immediately jump into the race. Immersive graphics and audio On the technical front, RACE 07 represents a bit of a step backwards compared to GTR 2. In fact, cars and circuits appear less detailed than one might have expected and the graphics engine, even at maximum settings, is unlikely to worry the most powerful configurations. On the other hand, there is nothing to complain about as far as the audio is concerned, with the noises of the cars guaranteeing a remarkable identification with the race, to which the many internal and external views available also contribute. The peripheral capable of bringing out the best from RACE 07 is certainly a nice steering wheel to match a pedal set. Even with a joypad you will not feel bad, while the situation will worsen with a keyboard, which does not have sufficient sensitivity to adequately brush the curves, especially when you launch into the most demanding competitions. RACE 07: Official WTCC Game is available for PC. The SimBins, after having given the people of simulation enthusiasts the exceptional GTR 2, have now created the second chapter dedicated to the Gran Turismo World Championship, with RACE 07. Also this year the developers have not spared themselves in terms of licenses and official championships, offering different disciplines. These are: WTCC 1987, 2006, 2007, Radical, Formula 3000, Formula BMW, Caterham and Mini. Although some of these championships are practically unknown to many gamers due to the lack of media coverage, those who are passionate about four-wheeled disciplines outside of Formula 1 will appreciate their presence. Each of these championships in turn features official drivers, brands and circuits with their respective variants, for a total of 300 cars and 32 tracks. In short, there is something for all tastes and even the most refined palates will not be disappointed.", "date": "2007-10-23", "grade": null}
