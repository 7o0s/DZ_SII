{"name": "Artifact", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/artifact-recensione.html", "text": "Valve has kept Artifact closely guarded for some time, only revealing a few features in the months leading up to its launch. It goes without saying that the most common perplexities of gamers were represented solely by the business model chosen for this Trading Card Game, sold at full price and without any in-game currency, and by the game mechanics that lead it to a step above almost all other card titles currently on the market, rivaling even the hallowed Magic: Arena. After the launch that took place a few days ago, we approached Richard Garfield's new title with caution, having absorbed the basic mechanics only from more or less short streaming sessions. However, after having spent dozens of hours on it we can formulate a judgment, leaving aside for a moment the balances of the built environment, due to the usual impossibility of reading a meta that is too immature at the moment but, above all, also given the current situation of the format that turns out to be the least interesting part of this production. Are you surprised? Definitely yes. A Trading Card Game or a full game? For just under twenty euros you get Artifact home, with an initial pack that includes two basic decks, five packs of cards to open in the hope of finding some rares that can give you dollar-shaped eyes and five tickets to participate to the various tournaments in the ~Expert~ modes. Having said that, once you enter Artifact and pass the slim menu you will find that everything you need to understand the mechanics and have hours of fun playing is already included in the initial cost: you will not need to open your wallet further to be able to become expert players. In fact, until December 14, everyone will have the opportunity to take part in the Gauntlet, a particular game mode in which six decks built with various combinations of heroes are made available to users, thanks to which they can try to accumulate the highest number of consecutive victories against other players: simple but extremely effective to learn all the basics of the game. The mechanics, as we said earlier, are anything but immediate or easy to learn, especially given the lack of an in-depth tutorial. Suffice it to say that a single game takes place on a three-lane board, aping MOBAs, and that the fights of each individual lane take place simultaneously. But obviously it doesn't stop here since each deck will contain five heroes, inspired by the DOTA 2 universe, each with a specific color and thanks to which it will be possible to cast spells and summon creeps of the same type. If your brain has already started to jam at this point, don't worry at all: Artifact is not a game for everyone, nor does it want to be that title dedicated to casual players but rather wants to go and get a specific niche of super passionate about card games and in his bossy and furious way he does it big time. It gets straight to the point because once you have assimilated and digested all the numerous mechanics, you realize that you are holding a fresh and intelligent product, one of those card games made up of continuous call and response, exciting and intriguing for the mind, where reasoning two or three rounds ahead is essential to win. After playing a game, we realize that we have spent thirty minutes or more thinking uninterruptedly about the moves to make, by virtue of not having a limit of cards that we can hold in our hand and the possibility that the opponent will respond to our every single move with a stratagem ready to overturn the whole strategy. Each round of Artifact is played by both duelists, who reciprocally exchange the initiative with each card used, until both feel satisfied or have run out of answers or mana available. The resource system does not include Magic-like lands but is closer to Hearthstone, without however placing a limit on the number of turns that can be accumulated. Fighting with a knife between the teeth, the objective is to raze two of the three enemy towers to the ground or, alternatively, to destroy a single tower and then the opponent's exposed heart, with double the life points of the tower previously destroyed. pieces. In all this chaos of content, a pinch of randomness could not be missing to make things even more unpredictable, with the allies and the creeps who will arbitrarily attack one of the three possible directions. You don't have to worry though: once you gain experience, you will be able to predict and limit the variables, with the result of guiding the games exactly where you want. Randomness occurs atAlso in the placement of the heroes and this is perhaps where Artifact shows its side the most: of the five heroes in your deck, you can only choose the order of appearance on the field but you will let fate choose which board to occupy and which enemies to face. It therefore happens that, especially in Draft, there is the risk of finding yourself with a particularly unfavorable first round, without cards to play and forced to suffer the death of a hero without being able to answer. It mostly happens to novices, still unsure of which heroes to choose in Drafts but it can also happen to experts since there is no mulligan system and an unlucky hand can always come. Art at stake Among the best elements of this Artifact there is certainly the artistic side. The presentation is simply excellent, the artworks are beautiful and even the sound, although completely in English unlike the texts, is very accurate. What is surprising are the animations of the two couriers who accompany you throughout the match, jumping between the cards, making funny faces and reacting in a friendly way to the situation on the table. It is also very positive that they never disturb concentration, remaining on the sidelines during the study phases, a truly excellent job from every point of view. Only the equipment, which is obtained through a shop available at the end of each round and purchasable with the gold coins obtained from killing creeps and heroes, did not fully satisfy us, showing ups and downs in the implementation, but it is also difficult to succeed to give a soul to simple armor and objects. Going back to the methods, we initially told you that to enjoy Artifact you won't really have to spend an extra euro. All the available modes, except the Sealed, are available for free, draft included: this is the reference section also for the competitive currently, and there will be several tournaments most likely based almost exclusively on this mode, putting the built into the background . We haven't played much with our decks, partly because we're still missing so many cards and then because we really find other formats much more fun. Card prices at the moment are largely affordable, and with the exception of some nonsensical peaks such as Ax which fluctuates between 15 and 20 euros or Ranger Drowe and Kanna which hover around 10 euros, almost all the others are comfortably below under three euros, with municipalities sold for very few cents. Nor is it true that you can't earn packs without buying them directly since expert drafts, i.e. those that require a ticket to participate (5 tickets cost 4.50 Euros and you have 5 included with the initial purchase) will refund the ticket after three victories, and they will give you a free package of four and two packages of five successes, provided of course you don't lose two other games first. So let's say that an average good player should be able to build a collection without investing more money. Tickets can then also be earned by disenchanting unwanted cards: destroying 20 of them will give you access to a tournament. On micro-transactions, prices and various tricks to spend as little as possible we'll talk about it again next week, when the market has stabilized and we'll be able to discuss it in more detail.", "date": "2018-12-03", "grade": "8.0"}
