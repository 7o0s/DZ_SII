{"name": "Oil Rush", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/98568-oil-rush-onda-durto.html", "text": "Numerous filmmakers have tried to imagine the world after a nuclear holocaust, and some of them have depicted it precisely as we see it in Oil Rush, the debut title for Unigine Corp. The team, previously known for developing benchmark software Unigine Heaven, in fact, catapults us into a reality made up of submerged lands, in which a series of militarized factions fight each other for control of the last remaining oil fields on the ocean surface. The game features a full-bodied single player campaign, a ~quick~ mode in which it is possible to tackle single missions and a multiplayer which unfortunately, however, we have not had the good fortune to be able to try, given that during our tests the number of online users was at least low. The changes compared to the version we tried some time ago mainly concern the ~side dish~, in this case the narrative implications that season the campaign, in which we play the role of a young commander who is entrusted with the task of conquering a certain number of oil platforms and to repel the many sorties of enemies. Some small optimizations have also been introduced, some new keyboard shortcuts and a more complete and understandable tutorial, which will lead us by the hand during the first stages to make sure that we have perfectly understood the game mechanics. Mechanics that are anything but complex: in most cases our goal will be to conquer all the locations on the map, while sometimes we will find ourselves having to defend certain units or to resist for a certain period of time waiting for reinforcements. Oh black sea In each level we start from a platform we already own and we must gradually ~expand~ to take control of all the other locations. This is not a simple operation, because our opponents will also do the same thing, that is, they will send units to attack us as soon as their ranks are ~large~ enough. There are different types of platforms, each specialized in the production of different units: from jet skis, light and fast but not very resistant, to boats with their powerful missile launchers; from helicopters, ideal for defending an area, to planes with their rapid sorties; and so on. Each unit has strengths and weaknesses that must be kept in mind when we send a lot of them against a target. A general rule may be to always put together groups formed by different vehicles, so as to cover each area of expertise, but unfortunately this is not always achievable. There is also another element to take into consideration, namely the fact that production is limited to a certain number: the stations will not continuously produce jet skis, ships and so on, but at a certain point they will stop and we will have to make do with what we have. The careful planning of each maneuver therefore appears to be very important, in order to ~sacrifice~ the least possible number of units. When our platform has produced a certain amount of vehicles and these move in a circle around it, protecting it from possible assaults, we can decide to send all or part of these troops (100%, 50% or 25%) to a location enemy. The maneuver is very simple to perform, just select one of our bases with a left click of the mouse and then select a target with a right click. At this point the indicated forces (which can also be divided by category) will move towards the goal, they will reach it, they will try to destroy its defenses and finally they will conquer it, adding it to the list of our ~properties~ and thus making it a new one. production base. waterworld In Oil Rush the ~money~ is obviously represented by oil, which is extracted through special platforms and which allows us to build defense positions for the bases (machine guns, cannons or missile launchers, which can be upgraded to several levels) so as to better face any assaults, but also to use the special abilities that are unlocked as the minutes pass and the acquisition of experience points. Some of these abilities allow us to view the enemy units that are still hidden in a certain point of the map, to speed up the production phases of our platforms, to upgrade vehicles in various ways and even to apply ~malus~ to enemies, making them more vulnerable to attack. All the possibilities that the game makes available to us must be exploited to the fullest, but in general the concept of numerical superiority expressed by the vast majority of RTS remains valid: create a large army and the opponents will hardly be able tostand by. Remember, however, to never leave the bases unguarded, because the enemy (unlike you) will be able to follow secluded routes and reach undisturbed the very platform you thought was safest of all. Unfortunately, these situations generate continuous reversals in the face and stalemates that can last even hours, in the worst case, so much so that in such situations it is always better to start the mission all over again and pay more attention to the details. When we tried the beta there was one element, in particular, that aroused our concern, namely the strategic map in the lower right part of the screen. In fact, it is possible to play the entire game by clicking only on this schematic representation of the scenario, reducing the whole experience to something much less spectacular and engaging than the original intentions of the developers, who evidently wanted to throw us into the heart of the action, let us witness the battles firsthand. Witness the fact of being able to follow your units during an expedition (by pressing the F key), through a close-up view, and in any case to always keep an eye on the areas of the map in which a clash is taking place. Played on a PC up to the situation, Oil Rush also presents a respectable cosmetics, with a discreet use of DirectX 11 for the representation of water and surfaces, excellent fluidity (on the test configuration we were anchored at 60 fps at a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, with all effects maxed out and v-sync on) and a good variety of scenarios. Nothing to tear your hair out about, but staying in the vein of real-time strategy, you can't complain.", "date": "2012-02-01", "grade": "7.8"}
