This new tie-in of the saga created by George Lucas is chronologically positioned between the end of the first and the beginning of the second film trilogy, telling us an unpublished but well written and exciting story, which sees the involvement of Darth Vader and the genesis of a completely new character, an apprentice who is assigned to carry out missions on behalf of his dark master. LucasArts' idea was to create a video game in which the Force could be used in a completely new way; on consoles, this objective was achieved brilliantly, with spectacular sequences which, however, are contrasted by gameplay that is not up to the task. For the mobile reduction, entrusted to the expert hands of THQ Wireless, it was obviously necessary to change everything and look for an equally valid and original structure. There are two game modes available: ~story~ and ~arcade~, with the latter simply allowing us to replay one of the nineteen stages completed within five chapters. Each phase is punctuated by sequences through which the plot develops, characterized by on-screen texts localized in Italian, while the actual action surprises with truly original mechanics. The Force Unleashed, in its mobile version, is not in fact a third-person action game: it is to all intents and purposes a ~casual game~, in which you have to perform various key combinations to defeat the enemies that gradually we will face. At the top of the screen we can see a pattern that closely resembles the numeric keyboard, and it is precisely by using the latter that we will be able to draw shapes and carry out our attacks. Our character is in the center of the location and his opponents approach him from every direction, each with a symbol on his head: to defeat them we will have to reproduce these symbols by acting on the keys from 1 to 9. It is clear that going forward in the stages the drawings to be reproduced will become more and more complex and the enemies more and more numerous, but we will have the possibility of using a series of special abilities that go beyond the simple attack. Again, these are moves that are performed through the formation of symbols: a ~V~ fills our Strength bar for the first time, a segmented curve fills it a second time, and so on up to the final powers. Each level of Strength corresponds to a different special move, especially in terms of results: there are those of an offensive type and those of a defensive type, and the alternation between one and the other helps to add a pinch of strategy to the gameplay . The technical realization of the game is excellent, for once also as regards the sound sector, which can count on the MIDI reinterpretation of the original Star Wars soundtrack. The graphics are quite accurate, with well-drawn characters but a little lacking in terms of animations. The locations are colorful and varied, but it must be said that these are single screens and therefore not who knows what work has been done to make them. Finally, the control system is based on the use of the numeric keys and is really simple and immediate, but on some terminals there is a lack of response to the inputs when the music ~rewinds~: a defect unfortunately typical of many Java applications. PRO Innovative game mechanics Technically well done Good level of challenge... AGAINST ...but finishing the game is a matter of little Quite limited The sound gives rise to annoying slowdowns", "date": "2008-10-07", "grade": "S.V."}
