Starting from the re-edition of the first chapter we told you about last summer (the review of the first Crysis Remastered on Nintendo Switch is already available for reading), Crytek brings back the remaining two in this period on all the main consoles on the market and on PC chapters of the franchise, that is Crysis 2 and 3. Those who had already purchased the remaster of the first Crysis, among other things, can buy the two sequels individually, paying them a little less than expected (20 euros each); all the others, if they wish, can opt for the en plein of the entire trilogy. Specifically, we returned to the topic with a very specific objective: to analyze the conversion of the Crysis Remastered Trilogy on Nintendo Switch. Which, surprisingly, turned out to be much more solid than we expected. The conversion of the three Crysis Crysis Remastered Trilogy, visually, has its why also on Nintendo Switch Crysis Remastered Trilogy offers the remaster of Crysis 1, 2 and 3, all titles that, as you will remember, were released before 2013, in the middle of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 era, as well as on PC. Consoles on which, among other things, it's not that they ran so exceptionally, on the contrary: if anything, the experience of the Crysis franchise in the collective memory is linked to the PC world, with the almost legendary anecdote of the first chapter of the series used a little ' as a benchmark to test the capabilities of your machine; just think how ~heavy~ and rich it was, already in 2007, on a technical level. It was more than obvious to wait for the conversion of the Crysis Remastered Trilogy on Nintendo Switch with a minimum of skepticism: how would the hybrid console by Nintendo ad accept not one, but three chapters, without going to nuclear fission? Instead, it seems that Saber Interactive has carefully analyzed this particular situation. Because it is obvious that the remaster on Nintendo Switch had to be approached in a different way from the one (already available) on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One S and One X, and so on. The keyword, as always, is: compromise. Without compromise we would have gotten nowhere. Here then is that any ambition linked to very high definition and 4K has been renounced, as has been done without 60 fps and (again) ray-tracing and too resource-intensive particle effects. However, this does not mean that Crysis, Crysis 2 and Crysis 3 are ugly to look at, quite the contrary. From the point of view of mere numbers, the resolution is around 720p, which can reach 900 in TV mode (therefore with the Nintendo Switch well inserted in the dock). The frame rate, on the other hand, is fixed at 30 fps, almost always solid and without particular jolts. Obviously there have been a couple of more agitated situations or with a greater number of enemies, where we have noticed slowdowns, but how could it have been possible to expect otherwise? Rather than what has been lost, it seems to us instead that we must insist on what has been recovered, perhaps even improved. Obviously Crysis Remastered Trilogy on Nintendo Switch is not as beautiful to look at or solid as on PlayStation 5 or on the similar PC re-release, but it is still superior to the original titles released on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. And indeed, even in portable mode, the open environments of the first Crysis remain very pleasant; the equally well-groomed Crysis 2 corridors; the stalking, bow in hand, of Crysis 3 still immersive. In short, if you were expecting a disastrous situation, think again completely. Still a special series The atmosphere of the first chapter of the Crysis Remastered Trilogy can't be beaten To this day, and despite the myriad of FPS published in the last fifteen years, that of Crysis Remastered Trilogy remains a still special series. Either for the charm connected to its game world, or because a sufficiently large audience by now knows the name ~Crysis~ itself and immediately connects it to a product that has marked, in its own way, the history of the genre. Of course, things have changed over the years, and we don't just think of graphics and a technical sector, once the spearheads of the title, but today almost the minimum that can be questioned in similar productions. What changed, from Crysis to Crysis, was also the structure and the experience itself. island inhabited by hostile forces. Crysis introduced the Nanosuit, which granted the protagonist superior speed, fine/night vision, incredible resistance to blows and bumps, as well as temporary invisibilityorane. The open and vast environments offered the possibility of establishing your own path, an ever-changing approach to objectives and eliminating enemies. The clashes with the vehicles of Crysis Remastered Trilogy shouldn't scare you: you have the nanosuit Crysis 2 substantially changed the formula, proposing instead a path on tracks, as well as much more contained and less explorable levels than in the past. It was a necessity also due to having to relate to the world of consoles in parallel to the PC one. Most, in fact, today remember Crysis 2 as a half misstep in the franchise. Crysis 3 recovered the soul of the eldest son a little, albeit with the necessary compromises: so yes we returned to a very guided narration (and moreover very short, 5 hours were enough to get to the titles of thing) but also at wider and less discounted. Not to mention the introduction of the bow, undoubtedly original and, above all, functional to the stealth mode of the gameplay. As you can see, this variety is still tempting today, considering that all of this is offered in one package with a sensible price.", "date": "2021-10-31", "grade": "7.5"}
