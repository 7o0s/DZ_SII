We are not interested in ~principle~ extra gameplay issues, here the cost certainly has its weight, but what is important is to establish whether the content of this Annihilation package is as good as that of the previous DLCs released. And the answer is undoubtedly yes. Standard equipment for the usual 1200 Microsoft Points. Four ~classic~ maps, plus one zombie, Shangri-La. Top secret Hangar 18 takes us to the United States and more precisely to the notorious Area 51 for a map that seems to wink at, but without exceeding, the clashes from medium distance, especially inside the hangar, even if there is no shortage of points to lurk and areas from which you can enjoy a good line of sight on very large portions of the level. The map is chock-full of easter eggs and conspiracy theory references that have been floating around the super-secret military installation for decades. The plane we see coming out of the hangar is the legendary SR-71 Blackbird seen in the Black Ops WMD mission, inside the base we pass by alien corpses and even, when the weapons are silent, we can even hear their voices. A possible direct reference to a bug on the Villa map is the orange that gravitates inside an electromagnetic device. As per Treyarch tradition, it is an ~average~ map, both in terms of size and versatility, and seems to be made on purpose not to dissatisfy any type of player. From one super-secret American installation to another, in Soviet territory, where instead of the aliens, we find ~only~ nuclear missiles about to leave their underground bunkers. Nothing to complain in terms of level design for Silo: large spaces, escape routes and good verticality with different structures on several floors to explore and a tower from which to ~camp~, but without a doubt it is the least ~peculiar~ map of the package. we have seen far too many missiles in flight, just think of the one leaving in Launch. Same speech as Hangar 18, medium map, good for everyone. Xbox 360 goals Call of Duty: Black Ops - Annihilation offers five achievements, for a total of 150 points, all related to the zombie mode Shangri-La. They are practically all related to the use of the new features, such as killing a certain type of zombie or using the new special weapon. Free time If we were violently catapulted into the fifties with Nuke Town, Drive In brings us back even more forcefully to the years of Fonzie and Richie Cunningham, setting clashes from a very short distance (but with a couple of interesting places to snipe, such as the cinema) in one of the symbolic places of those years, the Drive In to be precise. If Silo seemed rather anonymous, the opposite impression was made by this colorful and well detailed map. Here, too, there are several goodies scattered around the map. In addition to the cinema and bowling, the area also includes a games room, in which there are several cabinets ~inspired~ by previous Treyarch maps and games. We can also find a sort of Operation Wolf in the World at War version, complete with an MP-40 to shoot with. So far Annihilation has not offered very extensive maps, the last one however, Hazard is decidedly large, quite vast and capable of enhancing players who are particularly skilled with the sniper rifle. We are in Cuba, in a resort/golf club, and one of the paths is the protagonist of this map since it is a real no man's land to go through, zigzagging between the various elements of the scenario, in which one is at the mercy of snipers stationed. There is certainly no shortage of secluded passages, but the maximum of the tussle is all in the fairway of the hole. The zombie map closes the package, which has always been the real icing on the cake of the dish cooked by Treyarch. As usual, the American developer didn't just vary the setting, but added a whole series of new weapons, bonuses and enemies, something that is always welcome and never too much appreciated. This time we are in full jungle, in the mysterious mythical city of Shangri-La. The map is quite large, labyrinthine, full of caves and traps, overflowing with zombies, humans and in the form of monkeys. To defend ourselves from the waves of undead it will be possible, for example, to use, in addition to the usual arsenal, the new 31-79 JGb215, a rifle capable of shrinking enemies, or to modify a nice Claymore mine to make them launch, together with the steel marbles, also some bamsharp boo. To be eliminated from a distance the napalm zombies, and the screaming ones, capable of blinding the player. It goes without saying that cooperation is highly requested, and here too there is no shortage of goodies and easter eggs scattered around the map.", "date": "2011-07-04", "grade": "8.0"}
