The guys from Krillbite Studio tried to provide us with an answer in this sense, with an unusual and somewhat alienating first-person adventure. The funding needed to convert the idea into reality comes from the Kickstarter audience, through which the young Norwegian team was able to obtain the 200,000 dollars needed to propose the project on Steam in 2014. The last twelve months have instead served to realize a conversion destined for the PlayStation 4 Store, although the launch was delayed due to some technical complications. Developed through the famous Unity engine, the game has been progressively updated to adapt the lighting system and the functioning of the physics to the console ecosystem, but also to refine the sound rendering and try to maintain a high level of emotional involvement. If there's one thing Among the Sleep cannot be denied, it's its consistency in conveying a very specific message and in keeping with this type of interpretation. Therefore, the gaps that we had already had the opportunity to bring to light during our test of the PC version remain evident. The communicative effectiveness of the first moments helps to identify oneself with the little protagonist and in his tormented birthday night, to understand the reasons for those disturbances converted into dreamlike images. Conversely, the initial impression is distorted and thwarted along the way, when one becomes aware of all the potential that has not been exploited as it could have been. The impression that arises at the end of the almost two hours of play renews the belief that the developers did not want to dare to the end, and it is as if the young protagonist's childhood fears weren't the only ones to be part of this project. The presence of puzzles, the interaction with objects and the support of a second character could have been enhanced and would have spared us that feeling of tedious incompleteness which, on the contrary, makes its way without a break, until the fleeting arrival of the end credits . Among the Sleep puts us in an unusual perspective, but the gaps are felt Playstation 4 trophies Among the Sleep trophies are ten in total and are linked in particular to the collection of all the drawings hidden in the levels. The stuffed animal saves your life The introduction of Among the Sleep takes us back a bit in time, it touches sensations which, in the mind of an adult, are now dormant in the unconscious and are part of faded memories in the folds of time. We identify with the young protagonist as he lies on the high chair in the kitchen, the mother who spends sweet words for him and is adding the last decorations to a cake with two candles. It's birthday, we are the center of attention. Not even the time to enjoy a couple of bites and someone knocks on the door. We are then hurriedly brought back to the bedroom and placed in the box. We need to experience the world through the perspective of a child, with all the limitations of the case. You can't run too fast or for too long, you crawl faster, the objects around you seem exaggeratedly large and the rooms dispersive. And there is the unconditional imagination, the one that is able to make a soft toy talk or to make the small closet an inaccessible place, full of tunnels to explore. But then the real nightmare begins, darkness devours the colours, we feel that a dark presence is on our trail and wants to capture us. The teddy bear that we carry with us becomes a kind of refuge and guide, by holding it to your chest it is possible to use it as a torch and illuminate short portions of the scenario to understand where it is best to go. A journey begins to bring the child back to his mother's arms and the goal must be pursued by solving a series of puzzles within three different dreamlike areas with threatening and hostile outlines. It is precisely at this point that Among the Sleep lends itself to obvious limitations, not being supported by mechanics that keep interest alive or make you want to understand what could happen shortly thereafter. Everything translates into actions that are too direct, placed on rigid tracks, simple to decrypt and repeated several times without variations worthy of the name. Even the talking teddy bear that we carry around acts more as a narrator and comments on what is happening without ever giving a real contribution from the point of view of the gameplay, as instead it would have been advisable to do, if only the Krillbite boys had been able to dare moreover.", "date": "2015-12-08", "grade": "6.5"}
