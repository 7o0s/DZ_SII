Those who are passionate about competitive games have seen the explosion of phenomena such as Hearthstone, Legends of Runeterra and Magic: The Gathering Arena, but there is a fringe of players who are not interested in competition and prefer instead to take refuge behind single player mechanics , equally challenging and stimulating. Among the titles capable of reaching very high peaks, introducing interesting and original mechanics, we certainly find Slay the Spire, but also the more recent Monster Train with its expansions, titles capable of captivating fans with short game sessions but so engaging as to transform them then in matches of hours and hours. Particular products, in short, but which have made mathematics, calculation and possibilities into solid pillars on which to build incredibly fun play systems. MonteBearo has created a new iteration for the genre, a title that is not only fun to play but also extremely beautiful to look at. Let's find out if he can take the throne in our Banners of Ruin review. Bears, wolves and mongooses are the new heroes Each race has its own characteristics and abilities. Banners of Ruin immediately intrigued us thanks to its very particular graphic style. The game is set in a medieval alternate universe where humanity does not exist and instead the evolutionary chain has let bears, mustelids and other forest animals acquire an upright posture and gain the use of speech. Our initial party, made up of a mouse and a Brown Bear, will thus begin his incredible journey between fights and mysteries and we will have to wisely choose the moves available among those available to allow him to overcome unscathed, or almost unscathed, the various challenges that they will stand in front. Let's make things clear right away, Banners of Ruin is a complex game, especially for those who are new to the genre, and you will almost certainly fall during the first game due to the unfriendly mechanics that will immediately try to put a spoke in your wheels. The actions at your disposal of attack, buff and defense alternate seamlessly in your hand as the turn passes, but the real complexity lies in being able to survive the various phases of the game despite adverse luck not always making you draw the actions you will need. Thus it will happen to suffer damage from which it will not be able to defend us in any way and the ability to react to these unfavorable situations will be the key to not making you fail miserably. The damage suffered by your group, unfortunately, drags on from fight to fight and, since you will have to face dozens of them before coming face to face with the final boss, surviving will not be at all obvious, also counting the permanent death of your characters as an additional malus to always take into consideration. The game tries to put a piece of it by offering cures on your path, but a decision to do so will mean necessarily having to give up another prize. Between one duel and another, your progress will in fact be marked by three simultaneous choices, options that usually lead to deepening the plot, obtaining new cards or enhancing them with extra effects, options that are anything but obvious to have given the great foresight required to continue without too many hitches. Unlike other similar titles, in fact, we found very few options for modifying the deck by removing excess cards, with a real risk of reaching the end of the run with an excessive amount of unuseful or even unusable cards, making the clashes even more complex. An entire party to manage Humanity has given way to bestial forms Although you always start with only two characters, it will not be uncommon to be able to recruit other mercenary champions to add to the group during your journey, perhaps with passive powers and extra cards useful for your strategy. Usually, these new heroes can be hired through the use of the fel money collected after the fights and used at will within the formation. You can thus decide to place the most delicate or wounded warriors in the rear and provide shields and heavy armor to those in the front line to absorb a greater number of blows. During the preparatory phases you will be able to manage the positioning as you see fit but once you enter the battle only specific cards will allow you to do so, very powerful skills if used on your opponents because, in fact, they will interrupt any of their actions for the next turn. Movements between ranks functionIn short, nano as real counter spells and abusing them could make the difference between an early defeat and a glittering victory. Permanent death won't make your life easy. Also very interesting is all the mana management which, instead of being shared among the whole party as often happens in these titles, is managed individually for each soldier using special stamina points, as well as the equipment cards, supplied with the purchase of new weapons and armor, to be used exclusively with the hero who is actually holding or wearing them, for solutions that can offer further levels of strategy. If from an aesthetic point of view, as we said initially, Banners of Ruin hits the target unfortunately they leave the animations of the cards to be desired, often reduced to small sudden movements of the camera or little more, as well as the presence of some excessive bugs capable of sending crash the game: minor defects that we hope will be quickly corrected with the next patches.", "date": "2021-08-04", "grade": "7.5"}
