{"name": "MX Rider", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mx-rider.html", "text": "What beautiful stunts! After a nice and pleasant presentation here we are in front of Mxrider, a game that offers many resources in terms of available modes. The gist is classic: with your own bike (more or less elaborate) you have to win the international championship and the other selectable challenges. The title leaves aside the simulation setting, preferring a more arcade one. Forget vehicles that break, wheels that wear out and other such characteristics. Everything you have is there. A motorbike and a rider (who usually gets dirty with mud). You have to run, brake a little when cornering and possibly finish first, with all the economically advantageous consequences of the case. In fact, depending on the final positioning of each race, the player will be rewarded with cash prizes, which can of course be spent to buy more powerful motorcycles, super-powered engines, tires that ~burn the road~ and other similar gadgets. During the race, the execution of tricks (i.e. acrobatics) is essential, thanks to which it will be possible to increase the performance of your bike in real-time. A small indicator at the top of the screen indicates the percentage of flying madness performed and, consequently, the more you perform, the better the performance of the controlled vehicle will be. As far as the control system is concerned, it must be said that the Infogrames game defends itself well, albeit without touching top-level peaks. Keeping the bike on the track is a rather simple feat even for novices, and taking a hairpin bend is child's play. Just tap the brake button lightly. Interesting is the inclusion of two keys dedicated to deceleration, one for the front braking system, and one for the rear one; even if you end up using only one Surely MXrider will not fail to entertain and excite all those who love this extreme and dangerous sport, despite not being a masterpiece and having its multiple defects. The latter are to be found both in the overly arcade game structure and in the general difficulty which is settled on low levels. Honestly, more is expected for a PS2 game, especially judging by the thickness of the latest titles on the market. The eye wants its part In MXrider both the riders and their bikes are equipped with a good technical realization. In fact, the textures appear well colored and defined, even if the number of polygons on the screen is not that high... The same considerations cannot be made, however, for the animations which suffer in too many moments of the game. Twenty-five or thirty frames per second are no longer enough nowadays, unless there is an abnormal amount of moving triangles and graphic effects of all kinds. The settings boast a good depth of field of vision, thus leaving out cosmetic defects such as pop-ups, etc. A note of demerit goes to the virtual audience made really in an approximate way, through the use of the mythical and flat sprites (they seem to be trending lately  GT3? ). We note the presence of small tricks such as the good shadows of the solids and the mud raised by the rotation in the puddles of the tires. From a cosmetic point of view, therefore, the Infogrames product is nice but not without defects. Here, it seems that the programmers did not try too hard to make the motion engine of the black monolith ~work~, as a game like this could have run very well even on the Dreamcast. Go-go mode. MXrider is a title that offers many game options. There are the Freeride mode (where what counts are the trick points), Championship (all the racing season), Sfida (a series of tests to pass), Multiplayer (in which it is possible to challenge a friend) and the inevitable Options thanks to which you can set different game parameters. A very appreciable addition is the possibility of growing one's virtual alter ego in the world of motocross thanks to the first of the aforementioned modes. In fact, before competing, you will have to choose not only the name of the rider, but also the clothes and the bike to use. These can be up-graded thanks to the god money earned in the various competitions. Interesting is the inclusion of some of the most famous royal teams on this planet such as Husqvarna, Suzuki and KTM. In addition, the game features the entire roster of professional riders thanks to the possession of the FIM license. The championship season is very long and it will take a long time to finish it. Plus to top it all offthe game requires solving the challenge mode which offers thirty missions and trials with increasing difficulty. Do you like rock? The musical accompaniment of MXr is rock and cute too. Unfortunately, during the race, the beautiful songs lose their importance to make room for a massive buzz of nervous mosquitoes that turn out to be the sound effects of the engines. Not that the rumble was reproduced badly, on the contrary! The fact is that even in reality, off-road motorcycles emit this annoying/fascinating (depending on your taste) buzz. The rare commentary by the English reporter does not seem very convincing and is very similar to the English news broadcasts that were broadcast on the radios of the 1940s. His repertoire, then, is quite poor in expressions. Leaving aside some small flaws both in terms of graphics and gameplay, we are faced with a nice title without too many pretensions that honestly does its duty. In other words, to immediately amuse all fans of this discipline who prefer an arcade setting to a simulation one. The possibility of playing in two via vertical split screen adds a few points in terms of longevity. If, on the other hand, you are looking for a game that brings all the technicalities of a simulation to the fore, then look elsewhere. Pros: Quite fun Simple control system Cons: Not recommended if you're not a fan of the genre Very arcade Dirty jobs There is little to do. Motocross is a sport suitable only for those who like to get agitated in the muddy puddles that this discipline offers. Luckily, thanks to our beloved Playstation 2, we can finally whiz around on two wheels while staying dry on the bottom. But what joy! Unfortunately in many years of video games, there have not been many titles capable of doing justice to this fun sport, and so there is a lack of a real yardstick in the genre. Will this Mxrider be able to make us spend hours and hours of pure and healthy fun? And will we gamers be able to rediscover the same emotions that motocross can give?
