{"name": "Project  Sylpheed - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/project-sylpheed-recensione.html", "text": "Nostalgia, rogue nostalgia The latest episode of a saga born on the Sega Mega CD, Project Sylpheed arrives to bring a breath of fresh air to the Xbox 360 toy library. The Game Arts production, distributed by Square Enix, presents itself as an exquisitely Japanese-style war simulator, which plays continuously with the nostalgia towards the famous Japanese robotic sagas, Macross in the first place, and all the irresistible iconography that represents them: visual hyperbolisms, imaginative offensive weapons, a strong narrative vein punctuated by the numerous cutscenes. The player finds himself in the role of Katana, driving the Delta Saber, escorted by the giant spaceship Acropolis (does that remind you of anything?), along 16 missions of increasing difficulty. Katana is not alone on this journey but is supported by an elite team (TCAF) which Ellen is also a part of. Allied pilots, who can be given orders in real time, update the player on the objectives to be pursued, the combat situation, and much more, through an efficient log system integrated into the graphical interface. Each mission is divided into two distinct parts, and each presents a different task, from the simple destruction of enemy fighters, to the escort of allied cargo, if not the Acropolis itself, up to the adrenaline-pumping rescue missions. Having taken control of the Delta Saber, we will be able to move freely in space, while a very efficient hud will indicate the objectives and the relative distance, whether they are enemies or allies. The Acropolis is always available for resupplying weapons, a maneuver that can be easily performed by approaching the ship and pressing the back button. This is one of the most important operations to learn, as enemies vary in number and nature, and the equipment quickly proves insufficient to deal with them. The (medium name) controls represent a successful hybrid between arcade immediacy and simulator complexity, although they are quite simple to learn, they engage practically all the keys on the pad. A little original system of shields, which can be restored over time, protects the fighter from external dangers, but a particularly serious series of damages causes it to break, to the detriment of the vehicle's main energy. Once this is finished, the inevitable game over will follow. As with weapons, shields can also be repaired instantly by returning to the Acropolis. Power is nothing without control The thrusters for the movement can be managed entirely with the back analogs, pressing the right trigger advances like in a racing game, while a double pressure activates the turbo. In this way it is possible to move at very high speed, but the operation will weigh on the fighter's shields, requiring careful use. A double press of the left trigger will stop the engines completely, a very important maneuver when you need some leeway to attack, without the fear of crashing into some enemy cruiser. The x key is used for weapon selection, our shuttle can only load three types at a time, namely a simple machine gun on the front, a laser cannon on the bottom, and homing missiles on the rear. The most important of the lot is represented by the heat-seeking missiles, stupendously pyrotechnic as in the best Japanese anime, so efficient as to induce the player to use only those. There are also some special shots, actually quite specious. The paraphernalia is managed after the completion of the mission, with the possibility of upgrading the objects with the credits accumulated during the game (the assignment is evaluated on the basis of the ranking achieved), this is a rather important section which has an impact above all for the most adrenaline-pumping parts that we will describe later. Looks like Robotech! Graphically Project Sylpheed is a pleasant title, colorful and with strictly squared shapes, as befits a true eighties anime, lights and explosions saturate the player's senses, a considerable amount of polygons draws gigantic space cargo, asteroids and imaginative ski constructions -fi. But the effect, in fact, saturates quickly, causing a certain intrinsic monotony to the scenario (space or in any case very open areas), and it doesn't take long to understand that this is not a properly nextgen engine. A framerate that is certainly not indifferent to the most chaotic scenes and certain questionable textures do the rest. In this respect, therefore, it does not go much beyond the sufficiency, especially in high definition, Xbox 360 is capable of very different performances, but the strong artistic coherence that characterizes the game manages to partially compensate for the deficiencies. The cutscenes are well done, wellshot, long and enriched by an interesting story, we are not certain at the levels of a Final Fantasy, but the Square Enix production has brought undisputed advantages in this sector, such as being able to have one of its historic musicians, Kenichiro Fukui (Einhander), for the soundtrack. Many other problems are perceptible in the playability, rather methodical and not very diversified. The player is required to attack the enemies highlighted by the interface, enemies that in most cases remain distant and anonymous pixels, considering the low effectiveness of the machine gun, we end up using the infamous homing missiles. The attacks on the big battleships are decidedly better, moments always characterized by strong spectacularity, but they remain. Although new and more dangerous fighter squadrons are introduced as the levels progress, the method of eliminating them always remains the same. These junctures of repetitiveness are suddenly broken by the timed missions, which help to increase the pace but are sometimes frustrating, often due to the lack of information given to the player (it is necessary to carefully follow the pilots' logs, which appear lightning fast in the interface) . The difficulty undergoes a rather unexpected surge after the routine work of destruction, and the paraphernalia chosen and upgraded in the hangar in the debriefing proves to be decisive. Last but not least, the impossibility of saving during a mission, usually divided into two parts and which must be completed in full in order to get to the coveted rescue, does not help. Completely absent the online options, from multiplayer to rankings, given that Project Sylpheed is a strictly single player title and a co-operative network mode would have been a huge icing on the cake. The game is spoken in English, with Italian subtitles, however deactivated by default in the options. Goals 360 Project Sylpheed has 24 objectives, half of those found in recent titles, but the points obtainable are always 1000. The easier ones are unlocked simply by advancing in the campaign, even at the easy level. Definitely though, this is not a title dedicated to fast point hunters, be warned! Comment Project Sylpheed is a rather unusual title in the 360 toy library, which will surely find a certain response among fans of the Japanese robotic series, but which will put everyone else's patience to the test. The playability, especially in the first missions, proves to be uninspired, excessively methodical and slow, not accustoming the player to sudden and disproportionate accelerations, which however represent only the exception. Entering the game, the situation improves, starting from the technical realization, pleasant but lower than the standards of this hardware. The problem, after all, is that there is nothing terribly wrong in Sylpheed, but neither terribly good and perhaps, considering the progenitor, it was reasonable to expect something more. A typically summer product, to be swallowed up quickly while waiting for the real bigwigs, which however we recommend to all fans of ~old school~, demanding and long-lasting games. Pros Apt anime atmosphere Pure Square-style presentation Demanding and long Cons Technically only acceptable Can be boring in the long run Very frustrating timed missions Katana Faraway's thoughts rush through her head as she prepares to chase the enemy fighter in the chain of asteroids. Only he and his trusty combat craft, the Delta Saber, lost in deep space. He fondly recalls the carefree days of the academy, where he dreamed of becoming a pilot by training with his two best friends, Margas and Ellen. But since then too much water has passed under the bridge, a bloody war has dragged him down there, in the middle of nowhere, to see his comrades die in a spiral of explosions, blinding rays, and wreckage scattered without a tomorrow. A cruel and absurd war, which led him to confront Margas, who had gone over to enemy lines after the destruction of the home planet Acheron. Katana can no longer think about friendship, the past, dreams and ideals, all that remains is to fight to save his life and that of his companions.", "date": "2007-07-10", "grade": null}
