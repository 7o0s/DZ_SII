{"name": "NBA Ballers: Chosen One - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-ballers-chosen-one-recensione.html", "text": "Direct sequel to the chapters for Playstation 2 and Xbox, NBA Ballers and NBA Ballers: Phenom released almost four years ago, this new episode called Chosen One is the next-gen version once again produced and developed by the American software house Midway Games. We can say that this series can be compared closely to what FIFA Street represents for football games: arcade action, speed, immediate controls and lots of rule breaking. The graphics have now improved, in spite of the gameplay which unfortunately seems decidedly too similar to the ~old gen~ counterparts. Player Characterization and Story Mode NBA Ballers: Chosen One has a single player mode in which it is possible to create a basketball player from scratch to place him in a team that participates in a new tournament with the best representations of the NBA. The characterization is not as deep and detailed as in other sports titles (such as Electronic Arts), but still satisfactory in most points. The assignment of skill points, just like in a sports role-playing game, does not take place as it usually does through the manual assignment of specific values, but automatically based on how we played the game and what techniques we used rely more. if we prefer penetration into the area and crushing the ball, we can become little Michael Jordans in a short time Player Characterization and Story Mode By trying the three-point shot many times, our player gradually becomes stronger in this specialty; on the contrary, if we prefer penetration into the area and crushing the ball, we can become little Michael Jordans in a short time. The system, very interesting and intelligent, would work well if the calculation of the points was actually balanced and balanced. In reality, the assignment is often arbitrary and the CPU makes us advance by much fewer points in the most used specialties than in others. The story mode is a collage of episodes without a real plot or connection between them: it is a question of facing six chapters, within which we find 1 vs 1, 3 vs 3 challenges, free throws and three-pointers. Before each race the announcer Chuck D. introduces the event, but without linking with the previous and the next. There is no real sense of progression in the game, just the feeling of having to overcome one challenge after another, without being placed in a larger context. Lots of good ideas thwarted Most of the games in Story Mode are played following the rules of ~normal~ basketball, with the exception of some tedious variations such as the ~no take back~ one. The latter means that after a basket it is not necessary to restart the offensive game action by letting the ball leave the three-point line, but it can be played immediately from under the basket. This factor takes away a good part of the tactic and transforms matches into a boring wait for the ball under the net: once you have taken the lead it is very difficult to be overcome by implementing this simple strategy of the easy basket. A rule invented to speed up and give a show to the game which basically had the opposite effect, in practice. Almost like in the good old NBA Jam, even in this NBA Ballers it is possible to activate devastating combos Lots of good ideas thwarted Almost as happened in the good old NBA Jam, even in this NBA Ballers it is possible to activate devastating combos, by pressing some keys in the right timing, ever greater score multipliers are activated. This game system is the juice of the Midway title: making the most combos is the best way to increase your score. After the combos, three levels of special shots are activated: the first allows you to more easily dribble on your opponent and steal the ball; at the second level, super-shooting and super-defense are activated; in the last stage you can perform the most spectacular and destructive dunks, practically impossible to stop. Also in this case, we are dealing with a good idea which however is frustrated by a far from brilliant realization: in fact, after the activation of any special level, a five, six second cut-scene automatically starts, which is cannot disable or delete. This factor completely disintegrates the spirit of the game which is that of wanting to be fast and frenetic: each game will be full of scenes to watch without being able to move them forward or interact with the game. Final comment NBA Ballers: Chosen One is not the worthy heir of its predecessors. Although it faithfully reproduces the frenetic and fast gameplay, its realizationtion is undermined by some truly inexplicable problems, as they can be easily eliminated with a few tricks. We are referring to the interesting but absolutely arbitrary scoring system, the cut-scenes that cannot be eliminated every time we perform a special move, and a not particularly brilliant artificial intelligence. The technical realization is worthy of a few positive notes, it is not surprising and does not bring anything new to the panorama of sports games. A basketball game that is basically always fun to play in the company of friends, but it's definitely not enough to make him deserve flattering marks. Pros Fun in multiplayer Audio compartment Cons Growth system In-game cut-scene CPU artificial intelligence Xbox 360 goals Like every Xbox 360 game, this new chapter of NBA Ballers also offers the player the canonical 1000 points to conquer. Completing the six chapters of the story mode, a fairly quick undertaking, gives 340 points, with another 100 additional points in case we decide to complete the challenges for a second time. Another 100 points will come by activating a third level super move in any game, while winning 25 online races brings another 135 points. The objectives are not many, and consequently each of them is decidedly full-bodied, as well as not very difficult to obtain. Graphics, audio and artificial intelligence However, NBA Ballers: Chose One is not only Story Mode, but like any sports title it has options for multiplayer game: it is possible to play two against two with four connected joypads, or through the internet, but in this case alone. Obviously the artificial intelligence problems that the CPU suffers from are not present in these cases: playing against the computer it will not be difficult to notice strange behavior in the opponents: easy shots not completed, counterattack actions interrupted by back passes and flaky defenses are all order of each game. From a graphic point of view, the quality is decidedly below average, settling on rather low values due to the low number of polygons used, the effects that have already been seen too many times and the even more wooden animations of the previous versions. The player models are good, albeit with a few too many washed out textures Graphics, audio and artificial intelligence The player models are good, albeit with a few too many washed out textures. The final test, as every NBA-inspired game requires, is to take dear old Shaquille O'Neille to make comparisons between the digital version and the real-life counterpart. Many details are missing, but the characters are clearly recognizable and well drawn. In 2008, after having witnessed the technical marvels of the Electronic Arts and 2K titles, much more is expected to be able to favorably impress the players, who by now have a well-trained eye for the graphics of this generation. The audio component is excellent, with a good variety of songs and music, many different effects sampled impeccably and a commentary that does its duty.", "date": "2008-05-09", "grade": null}
