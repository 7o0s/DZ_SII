{"name": "Quattro volte Forza", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/94101-forza-motorsport-4-quattro-volte-forza.html", "text": "The genesis of Forza Motorsport was truly atypical. Rarely does a brand built essentially at the table succeed in convincing the critics, but above all the public. Before Microsoft, SEGA GT had tried, without success, to stem the incredible success that Sony was having with Gran Turismo, a series that had changed the way players approached the racing genre, which the general console public, also at the hands of SEGA itself was mostly familiar with arcade-style titles animated by a handful of courses and cars. The hundreds of cars, hours behind the wheel, tracks available to digital pilots had marked a very clear turning point in the way of conceiving the approach to driving simulators, a point that no one else seemed able to grasp. Turn 10, starting from 2005 on the first Xbox, and every two years, has tried to fit into this love idyll by creating a real alternative to the Polyphony brand, clearly drawing inspiration from it, but not slavishly aping it. Taking an obvious cue from it, but following its own path and conquering many fans. After only two years, the third chapter comes out on Xbox 360, Forza Motorsport 4 and, although it looks like an evolution compared to the previous episode, more than a change, this time too it is a solid stance in the world of virtual four wheels. I'm starting over with four In 2009, with the third chapter, Turn 10 decided the most radical turning point for the series, marrying a structure, for the single player career, which puts the player in front of a series of events to face feeling free to choose the car and the most congenial situation, with the common denominator of accumulating credits and experience points to level up, unlocking titles to add to your tag, rather than a series of badges to add to your nickname. The only objective on the driving simulation level, thanks also to a large number of customizations, is to provide an immaculate environment in which to give vent to one's desire to drive hundreds of dream cars in the best possible conditions (this time they are more than 500 from 80 different manufacturers), without worrying about obtaining licenses and without having to go through dozens of preliminary races hoping to be able to get behind the wheel of a dream car: everything, almost, immediately and with the desired degree of difficulty. This choice was confirmed in the Forza Motorsport 4 World Tour with dozens of events, spread over ten seasons, on hundreds of different tracks, in twenty-six settings (but already at launch there will be a new one to download). Once again, by disabling a greater number of driving aids (ABS, simulated steering or not, manual gearbox and real or aesthetic damage, etc.), the percentage of bonus experience points at the end of the race and credits to buy upgrades or new cars. Of these we are given one, out of three to choose from (instead of just one as in FM3), every time you level up and every time you complete a race the degree of affinity with the brand of the driven car increases , so as to have greater discounts in the purchase of the modifications. Each car belongs to a class and is distinguished by an increasing number, indicative of the goodness of the various technical characteristics. By upgrading the car, even automatically if you don't want to try the dozens of customization submenus, this number grows until, in fact, you move on to the next category. At the beginning of each round of the World Tour we are offered three different races, which change by selecting another car from your garage, without ever stopping: Forza Motorsport 4 always offers an event proportionate to your skills and fleet. This at least in the first half of his career, given that from then on you necessarily start to move up the class, therefore having to deal with the high cost of the cars to buy and with the need to choose your moves wisely. After about 25 hours of play and after passing 8 of the 10 available championships, tackling, among other things, 12-player, mixed-class, autocross and topgear challenges, in which you have to knock down a set of pins within a certain number of laps of track, we found ourselves without having unlocked the achievement that is given for running on all tracks, with only 4% of events covered, and about 2 million credits earned. Considering that the most beautiful cars cost from one to two million credits each, this gives you an idea of how long it takes to play to see all that Forza Motorsport 4 has to offer, just in the offline career. Forza Motorsport 4 brings with it the collaboration with Fanatec a frilland branded, which, finally, does not regret the similar products of Logitech. Solid, ready to set up and easy to connect, it has a respectable force feedback and an attractive design, especially for the grip part where you hold it (and leaving aside the glossy plastic upper part). Excellent therefore, except for the price, since it costs 250 without a manual gearbox and pedal set, for which you need to reach more than 400 in total. Evaluate your passion... Of simulation and artificial intelligences The first thing that catches the eye is that there are no difficulty levels, other than the degree of driving simulation you want to tackle. Turn 10 has deepened its artificial intelligence algorithms to have foreseen four levels of the same, distributed over the ten seasons, and which moreover adapt to the degree of skill of the player who can choose the level of reactivity of the opponents only in quick races , but not in career. The obvious advantage is that the AI, which was already one of the flagships of the series, here takes a further leap forward with cars that slow down to avoid each other when in slipstream, which clearly perceive the presence of the player on the track, without overwhelming him with the unrealistic, as much as feared, little trains and which react to the pressure of the other cars, even making mistakes when entering and exiting corners. In advanced seasons, really, the attitude of the other cars is absolutely natural, but it remains, however, rather soft, so much so that with a little foresight it is possible to win most of the time. Obviously, by deciding to take advantage of the possibility of rewinding time after a possible mistake, resetting curves and trajectories, which as before can be done at will and which amplifies the pure driving pleasure project carried out by Turn 10, but which could make those who, perhaps, would have preferred a career advancement cadenced by tests to be won compulsorily turn up their noses, so as to increase the sense of challenge. At the end of a season, in fact, there is nothing more than a mini grand prix, made up of two heats at different times of the day, which are passed even without reaching the podium. This leads to less points and less money, but it is clear that the driving force behind the experience is the desire to discover all the tracks and drive as many cars as possible, with an approach that may not please everyone, as already in FM3, but here perhaps something different could be thought of. Certainly if you deactivate the rewind, the picture changes completely also because the times in the charts clearly indicate when they were made using this expedient. The driving model has also been adjusted, without being distorted, with the Ferraris, for example, which remain drivable even in the most extreme situations, but with other manufacturers such as Pagani, Ford or Bugatti, just to name a few, for which the precision required in driving and control becomes much more mandatory than in the past, while Forza Motorsport 4 remains a world that can be dominated with the right practice, while deactivating all the aids. Increased the ~weight~ of all cars, when you go over 300kmh you have to be much more careful where you end up with the wheels, when you want to lean on the curbs and when to open the gas and how far. With the damage activated, then, you can lean on other cars when cornering, but you can risk finding yourself with an undrivable car after a couple of crashes too many. What is most important, and striking, is that, after dozens of hours, the driving pleasure remains very high, leading to one race after another, and that the races and careers originating from these can never be identical. Finally, the night races and, above all, the weather conditions, if not variable, at least rainy, were notably absent, despite the fact that they were loudly requested by the fans. It's probably goodbye to the next generation of consoles, made necessary by the unwavering 60 frames per second, but for some the lack will be felt. Kinect Autoview Another novelty is Autovista, or the possibility of exploring, walking around them, opening doors and climbing on them, a series of 'top' cars, reproduced with incredibly detailed models, with information on the technical characteristics narrated by Jeremy Clarkson of Top Gear, transmission UK cult. In addition to a handful of cars immediately available, new ones can be unlocked by passing a specific test driving them, without however being able to add them to your fleet. Exploration in this mode can also take place thanks to Kinect, which works with pinpoint accuracy as you lean in the directions you wantdirect the camera. You won't do it more than a couple of times, but it's still a very nice possibility to show your friends, as well as that of driving the cars in single races or in fast laps, mimicking the grip of an invisible steering wheel and with the guide that regulates the speed of the car by itself. Here too the accuracy of the motion sensor is excellent, but it remains little more than a pastime. The speech of the voice commands is different, all in Italian, and with surprising precision and speed. With these you can go in a flash to any part of the menus, jumping, with an intuitive system and faster than with just the pad, from the race to the set-up, rather than from the showcase in which to buy and sell cars to the part community. However, the thing that makes the difference in the use of Kinect is the head tracking, or rather the camera that orients itself following the movements of the player's head, even minimal ones. Especially combined with the steering wheel (see box) and the view from inside the cockpit, this option adds a new degree of identification and you find yourself tilting your head in curves, showing that part of the windows and windshield that you would never see with a simple pad. not making us regret the old workstations with three contiguous screens from the times of SEGA's Ferrari Challenge. Rivals to the end One of the flagships of Forza Motorsport 4 is everything that has been built around the community and connected possibilities. This time, in addition to the photos, videos can be shared to be uploaded to Forzamotorsport.net and, as in the past, the auction houses are back to sell and buy the legendary customizations of the bodywork, the settings of the different car models, obviously the machines themselves. Turn 10 has managed to reach the number of 16 drivers at the same time on the networked track and with the usual plethora of settings ranging from limitations on car categories, to the track, to the camera to use, up, of course, to the racing modes and at the number of laps (up to 50 with possible pit stops, therefore), all with a very clean code and without any delay, even if obviously we have not had the opportunity to try the online game at ~full speed~. The juiciest news are those of the Rivals mode and the introduction of the Clubs. The first, which gives experience points and credits exactly like online races and career, allows you to try your hand at a large series of themed challenges, trying to break records after records. The system puts us in front of the ~ghost~ of the player closest to us in the world rankings, or that of friends or other users wanted in the lederboards. Once a time has been beaten, the defeated player will be notified thanks to the revamped message center, triggering the inevitable revenge. With the clubs, on the other hand, the community is strengthened even more, given that members can share setups, liveries and cars, thus making the costly resort to the last credit easier, which has been accentuated in this chapter. Clubs can communicate, challenge each other and coordinated participation in online competitions and enjoy dedicated leaderboards that take into account the victories of individual members. Xbox 360 goals After the ten seasons of the World Tour, played with Kinect and made some challenges to rivals, you should find yourself with about 500 points of the 1000 expected. After that, it's a matter of playing for a long time, but almost sure to get full loot. 15 points, obtained by importing a save from Forza 3 and related liveries and various data. Dazzle yourself From a technical point of view, Forza Motorsport 4 is dazzling and ranks among the most beautiful things seen on Xbox 360 on a par with Rage and Gears of War 3. 60 frames per second, fixed, in any situation, even when we are online found with 15 other players in a pile of car bodies in one of the four extra modes in which, in various versions, you have to play hide-and-seek divided into two teams (a sort of football will also be available on day one). The fluidity of Forza, even amidst exploding metal, splinters and reflections on the rear windows is unshakable and despite a sense of speed that is still increased compared to the third chapter, with R1 cars that make you hold your breath when you are about to going into a bend, while trying to slow down from over 300kmh. What makes the difference, however, are the models, all redone and very detailed, as well as the interiors (with some exceptions, of course, on 500 and more cars) and the lighting and HDR system that extend right down to the smallest details of the sheet metal and the instrumentation, bouncing the light that comes from the asphalt, combined with the backdrop that is reflected on the bonnets, as well as the opponents' cars.
