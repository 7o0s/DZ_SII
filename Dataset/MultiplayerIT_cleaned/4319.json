The Epic Games title, making its debut on iPhone and iPad with the Battle Royale mode, has already established itself in the charts on the App Store, generating 1.5 million dollars in revenues in the first seventy-two hours. In short, if the good morning starts in the morning, it is clear and evident that there was really a lot of anticipation for Fortnite on smartphones and tablets. But how exactly does the game perform in this new portable dimension? From a technical point of view, an excellent job has been done, if we consider that the contents are the same as those present on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, net of a frame rate that does not go beyond thirty frames per second and some simplifications below the profile of sight distance and effects. In short, nothing transcendental: the visual aspect of the game appears fundamentally unchanged, as well as its extremely simple gameplay: once the mode has been selected in single, in pairs or in a team made up of four elements, you spend a few moments in the lobby before board a flying bus (well yes), from which you parachute onto the surface of a huge island. All one hundred users leave without any equipment, so they will have to be clever and lucky enough to quickly find weapons, ammunition and perhaps some objects to improve resistance or restore health inside the houses and structures present in the scenario. After that it will be open warfare, with the aim of being the last ones alive. A possible feat? Battles to touch As illustrated in the review of the console version, the Battle Royale constitutes the simplest and most immediate part of the Fortnite experience, so much so that it appears rather evident how it was introduced in an experimental manner, without any link with the mechanisms that govern PvE (of the all absent on mobile, in any case). Therefore, there remains the possibility of activating a construction mode with which to create walls, floors and ramps on the fly, but in PvP this aspect is declined for the purposes of combat and, above all, defense: if you have glimpsed an opponent and there are no buildings in the places to hide behind, you can create objects on the fly to take cover from enemy fire. The approach is all too democratic, as we have already said, and the equipment will be what we will be lucky enough to find once we touch the ground, even if the system continually pushes us to search and we will clearly be able to take possession of the users' weapons that we will be able to eliminate. Staying alive until the end, or in any case ending the match in a dignified position, is also a question of strategy: the battle area will continue to shrink by the minute, forcing the entire group to find themselves in a well-defined area of the map , where clashes will be inevitable; but we will be able to anticipate the thing by going immediately to the center of the scenario and perhaps waiting for the others to arrive, so as to take them by surprise. Compared to PUBG Mobile, the lack of vehicles is felt a lot, but it is above all in the controls and in the general feeling that Fortnite appears a little behind the Bluehole title. The arrangement of the touch controls on the screen is good and there are some very useful automatisms (see the double tap for the automatic run), but the fire system is also manual in this case and does not return very positive sensations. Yes, there is the excellent intuition of the double tap to fire instead of another button, but the functioning of most of the weapons, with single rate of fire or short bursts, does not go well with this approach: the introduction of 'autofire certainly could have helped. In this perspective, cross-platform multiplayer unfortunately ends up being something to be avoided rather than a resource, given that mobile users are clearly disadvantaged and cannot boast the same responsiveness and precision as those who play on PC or console.", "date": "2018-04-03", "grade": "7.8"}
