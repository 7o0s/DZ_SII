{"name": "TrackMania DS - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/trackmania-ds-recensione.html", "text": "TrackMania has made itself known over the years through fun and exciting PC games, creating a base of enthusiasts and followers who still communicate and exchange tracks created by the editor on many fan sites of the series. TrackMania is a Windows-derived title developed by the French Nadeo, who for this portable edition made use of the experience in racing games of Firebrand colleagues, already authors of GRID, Ferrari Challenge and Need For Speed: Undercover, all for Nintendo DS . Thanks to this deep hardware background, the new TrackMania can therefore boast a respectable cosmetics. As for the part played, there are obviously some differences with the Windows counterpart, let's find out together. Dedicated to those who enjoyed assembling the Polystil track The strength of TrackMania has always been the extreme speed and intuitiveness of the driving style: light-hearted, arcade, no frills, fast and fun. This is not a racing simulation, and you understand it right away by observing the totally abstract, unrealistic and plausible structure of the track design, all extremely devoted to spectacularity and acrobatics. Throw in Mario Kart, mix it with F-Zero, a sprinkling of any touring car racing and seasoned with an editor that closely resembles the way we built car tracks as children: this is TrackMania. The game is divided into three distinct modes that characterize it at each release. Run, platform and puzzle. In the first, you race through four difficulty levels in three different environments: stadium, rally and desert. So goodbye tropical islands and blue coasts, the small Nintendo DS game cartridge doesn't have enough memory to contain all the original stages. The race is a timed challenge in which we are committed to beating three different times. The best one makes us win the gold medal, while overcoming the others we win silver and bronze. By unlocking medals you progress in the game and conquer new tracks. The playability is surprisingly good, thanks to the excellent handling of the cars that react well to the commands. Too bad for the lack of any analogue type control: the old digital cross is a pain that afflicts any game on the small Nintendo portable, especially the driving titles. It is difficult to create, impossible to share. The commands given by the directional cross are not the best, but Nintendo DS has other arrows in its bow: a double screen and a touch; However, Firebrand Games has not managed to exploit these two hardware peculiarities in the slightest, relegating only a poor stopwatch and the display of objectives to the lower screen, nothing more. All hope had been placed in the game editor, real fun for fans of the series who have always ventured into daring creations of tracks and tracks. However, the definitive test did not bear the desired results, as using the touch screen is actually more difficult than one might have imagined, thanks to an impractical system for moving the camera and the consequent poor precision of the drawing we want to do. In practice, to rotate and zoom the view it is necessary to hold down a backbone and simultaneously move the stylus, while to go forward and backward it is necessary to operate a command placed on the right, decidedly inconvenient compared to the traditional use of the mouse and keyboard. The situation is made worse by the fact that there is no real tutorial that explains step by step how this mode works and its potential to be exploited, and everything is left to the skill of the player. Furthermore, the fact that TrackMania DS does not support internet connection via Wi-Fi connection does not allow users to be able to exchange their creations, a factor that has determined the success of the series since its inception. Sharing is the basis of experience There is a local Wi-Fi mode, however, which allows us to exchange data and challenge a friend next to us. A welcome option but definitely more difficult to use. Also, an online leaderboard of times would have benefited the longevity and overall challenge of TrackMania DS, but to our regret we have to note that this hasn't been included either. By selecting ~platform~ we see ourselves catapulted into a sort of super mario racing version. The goal is to reach the finish line by overcoming a series of obstacles through checkpoints: it's a trial & error in which we have to complete each track using as few lives as possible and taking advantage of the intermediate save points. The game like this is much more competitive than timed races and definitely requires manual dexteritysuperior, but never frustrating the player. The last mode available in the game is the puzzle one, which is essentially a variant of the editor: the map offers us a starting point and an arrival point, it is our task, using the numbered pieces provided, to be able to build a track that let us guide you from start to finish. Unfortunately, the difficulty in managing the editor also manages to ruin this mode, which is in itself very interesting and captivating. Technically, the development team's experience makes itself felt, proposing a polygonally solid game, rich in elements on the screen but above all fluid and fast, the most important feature for an arcade title like this. The music is decidedly anonymous and is proposed with loops that get boring very soon, and moreover it is not possible to eliminate them through the audio options. Comment TrackMania DS is a solid and fun racing game, equipped with a good technical sector (except for the absolutely forgettable music) and a purely arcade feeling, perfect for a portable console like Nintendo DS. However, the basis of the success of this series is a deep editor, re-proposed today with too difficult and impractical controls that undermine its intuitiveness and speed in creating. While managing to tame the touch screen, however, there is no way to share our works, a real shame. As well as the lack of any online ranking, a factor that would have further increased the challenge. TrackMania DS is a good game, but recommended for those who are not fans of the series: those who have returned from the PC experience will certainly find it too limited. Pros Fast and frantic Proven gameplay Many tracks and medals to conquer Cons No online mode Anonymous and annoying music Editor difficult and without tutorials", "date": "2008-12-23", "grade": null}
