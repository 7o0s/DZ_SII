No, not the video game magazine and not even the U2 guitarist; and it's not even about the Canadian wrestler who made his entrance into the arenas to the tune of ~Metalingus~ by Alter Bridge. We're talking about the excellent puzzle game released in 2010 on mobile devices, in which you put yourself in command of a cube that had to ~roll~ within increasingly intricate scenarios, collecting certain objects along the way and finding turn the exit. A very enjoyable puzzle experience, which however does not come from nothing and rather comes from the desire of Two Tribes to try their hand at these particular geometric shapes. The release of another ~cubic~ title on Steam, RUSH, dates back to a short time later, and exactly two years later, the game debuted in digital format also on Wii U. How were the cubes used this time ? Let's say right away that it's not up to us to control them directly, nor is it our job to explore the levels; but we must make sure that the objects all reach their ~goal~, marked by the same color, by placing modifiers that vary the natural direction of their movement. Let's see how. Tantalizing, full-bodied and fairly difficult, RUSH stands as a really nice puzzle game Mandatory direction The RUSH experience begins with a short tutorial which illustrates how the gameplay and controls work, completely entrusted to the stylus and the touch screen integrated into the GamePad, with the view which, however, can also be adjusted by acting on the left analog stick of the controller . Rotating the image is often a fundamental maneuver to have a precise vision of the conformation of the levels, which each have various starting and ending points for the colored cubes, animated by their own and unstoppable movement, which we can only convey. How? By placing modifiers on the boxes that make up the scenarios, whether it be arrows (which definitively vary the motion of the cubes), translating carpets (which simply move the cubes from one box to another, leaving the direction of movement unchanged ), signals that ~sort~ the traffic (by sending the cubes passing over them first to the right and then to the left) and so on. The geometric shapes protagonists of the game also follow precise rules, that is, when they encounter an obstacle they stop and always proceed to their right, and it is clear that to solve the puzzles from time to time we will have to take this aspect into consideration as well. On PC the game worked via mouse, in a very immediate way, but on Wii U it is not possible to enjoy the same precision in placing modifiers, which translates into having to rotate the screen to get the maneuvering space necessary to tap with the stylus. In any case, the control system is sufficiently valid in terms of what we are asked to do, also because the action does not take place ~live~ but rather consists of two distinct phases: one of construction and the other of unfolding, as in some famous ~trial & error~ style puzzle games. Big challenge Completing the first levels of RUSH is quite simple, but the degree of challenge increases gradually (albeit with some quite evident ~jump~) and new ones appear at each completed stage, enriching the various categories and adding more difficult, for a total of over seventy different challenges. There are moments in which the solution to a puzzle is immediately evident, others in which it is necessary to proceed with attempts, pressing the ~play~ button located at the top of the screen to see what happens and start over if the cubes should come into contact or fall into the void. Despite this, the nature of the title developed by Two Tribes seems unable to generate episodes of frustration, perhaps due to the brevity of the puzzles, which can moreover be restarted without losing the progress made, indeed keeping all the modifiers in their place because they one may simply move on in search of an effective solution. In short, you have a lot of fun and the challenge is anything but trivial, especially in the more advanced stages, when the complexity of the scenarios and situations reaches particular peaks. The Wii U version also enjoys an undoubted advantage over the original for PC, namely the fact of being able to play on the GamePad only, with the TV off, without any problems and without the need to manually set this mode. In practice it is possible to start the console without turning on the TV, sprawled out on the bed and enjoy the experience offered by RUSH cas if it ran on a handheld.", "date": "2014-01-12", "grade": "8.0"}
