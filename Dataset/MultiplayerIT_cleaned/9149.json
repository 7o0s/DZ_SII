SEGA's approach to the genre therefore also influences the creation of Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty for iPhone and iPad, which is presented as a ~gestural~ action game very similar to Mirror's Edge, and which sees the hero of the Second World War lashing out against HYDRA agents with the goal of finding and defeating their leader, the Red Skull. After a short ~animated comic~ style cutscene, as has been so fashionable for some time now, the game throws us into the middle of the action and, through a series of suggestions in real time, explains how to carry out the various moves that are part of Captain America's repertoire. Unfortunately, the beginning is not the best, since the ~suggestions~ above appear suddenly and break the rhythm of the gameplay to say the least. In short, a very annoying approach to which a more elegant alternative could certainly have been found. Patriotism avalanche As with the iOS reduction of Mirror's Edge, our character basically runs from one part of the scenario to the other, facing any possible threat without stopping. The control system is completely based on the touch screen and is mainly of the ~gestural~ type: to run to the right, you have to drag your finger across the screen in that direction, and do the opposite to run to the left. The movement can be stopped with a double-tap of the touch screen, but this rarely happens. When approaching an obstacle, swiping up causes Captain America to perform a jump, while swiping down results in a slide. If we jump towards a platform or pole, the character will automatically cling to it and at that point we will be able to ~drag~ him to the next destination. It's even possible to run up walls and from there launch yourself towards a new platform, as in the aforementioned Mirror's Edge. The point is that in Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty there are also enemies to fight, and that the ~always run~ approach does not go well with this element, especially considering that the controls are often unreliable. One slide near an opponent and our character will charge him with the shield, while combinations of several gestures will produce rather spectacular and effective combos. However, these are operations that in many cases fail and which therefore turn into very frustrating situations, with the character forced to stop for a hit immediately and quickly get rid of an enemy in order to resume running. The throwing of the shield, fortunately assigned to a normal touch button, sometimes allows us to solve some phases without problems, but it is somewhat the exception that proves the rule. And it's a shame, because the technical realization of the game is not bad, with fairly detailed and animated polygonal models, a decent level design and even the interesting gimmick of hidden objects to recover.
