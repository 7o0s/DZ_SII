{"name": "Earth Atlantis", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/earth-atlantis-recensione.html", "text": "Earth Atlantis draws on different sources of inspiration to deliver us a free roaming shooter set in a post-apocalyptic future, where the oceans have covered the planet and are dominated by gigantic and deadly creatures. In the role of a novice monster hunter, our task will be to board a powerful submarine, choosing the vehicle from those available, and hunt down a series of bosses within a single, huge freely explorable map . The mechanisms that regulate the gameplay of the title developed by Pixel Perfex are simple: you can move using an invisible virtual stick placed on the left side of the touch screen, while touching the right side allows you to turn the submarine to the right or left. The movement is not limited in one direction or the other, but it is possible in this way to proceed more quickly and have a greater portion of the screen that is revealed before our eyes, so as to be able to intercept certain threats in time. The automatic fire can be enhanced by collecting certain power-ups released by destroyed enemies, which make the shot wider and more bidirectional. A set of precious objects, marked on the map exactly like the bosses, also add extra weapons to our equipment, such as depth charges, homing missiles or disruptive torpedoes. Making the submarine ~grow~ before colliding with the bosses is an absolutely fundamental practice, even if in this sense the degree of challenge grows very gradually: the first sea monster will not be too difficult to eliminate, but going forward we will find ourselves fight against creatures that are not only gigantic, but also capable of firing bullets in abundance and in every direction, recalling in some ways the atmospheres of the classics of the bullet hell genre. Graphics and modes What makes Earth Atlantis a very special title is undoubtedly its ~monochromatic~ graphics, which seem to reproduce the aesthetics of ancient diagrams and maps, or alternatively the screen of a Game Boy. It is an approach that is very striking at first, although the novelty effect does not last that long and soon gives way to a sense of repetitiveness typical of productions that make this type of choice, renouncing colors as a visual element of detachment and variation. There are aspects of the interface that are practically amateurish, such as the generic font used for the indications or the effects of the explosions, which are nothing more than a residual animation of the polygonal models that represent the many hostile units to be faced. Despite this, it must be said that the large map that forms the backdrop to the main mode of the game has numerous elements that ~move~ together with the scrolling, also being three-dimensional, and therefore create a feeling of depth that we thought was missing at first. It takes about four hours to complete the Earth Atlantis campaign, after which it is possible to unlock a second mode, Hunt, in which we will have to grapple with the same mission but with very limited time, frantically. Although generally opposed to too short and reductive approaches that often characterize games for iOS and Android, it is still true that the times of mobile gaming are radically different compared to PCs and consoles, and in this sense we save ourselves from sections that are excessively long only due to the presence of checkpoints that allow you to restart the game from a precise point. However, the search for the right path between barriers, obstacles and hordes of enemies that never stop arriving did not really excite us and we believe that the recent Galak-Z: Variant Mobile is a substantially superior product from this point of view, as well as for as regards the feeling of the fights, in this case inconsistent and devoid of any emphasis on impacts.", "date": "2018-07-23", "grade": "7.0"}
