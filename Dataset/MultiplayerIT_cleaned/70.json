General review Shall we quickly recap the story? In the case of Watch Dogs Legion: Bloodline it is useful! Watch Dogs is a game about hackers, and manipulating electronic systems is an integral part of its gameplay. The first game had some great ideas, a fascinating set design, but its gameplay was still too immature to really make an impact. Then it was the turn of Watch Dogs 2 which, despite a decidedly over-the-top cast, finally managed to fully express the concepts introduced with the original. We will never get tired of saying it, remembering it and repeating it: Watch Dogs 2 is a gamer. The open world system is not central, it never wanted to compete with other titles from this point of view, and it gave its best in the real missions: it is a sandbox in all respects where you have a goal and you have to use gadgets, insights and intelligence to overcome the challenge. A hoot! If it weren't for the general too light-hearted tone and its speck characters, today we would all agree on how funny and profound it is. Be the protagonist Watch Dogs Legion Bloodline: Aiden Pearce is back, but he doesn't seem particularly happy ... And then there's Watch Dogs Legion, where you can recruit and play with everyone in London, but it's the same idea that made it too impersonal for some. Watch Dogs Legion: Bloodline tries to fill the hole left by the absence of a real protagonist by bringing back the spotlight Aiden Pearce, the star of the first game, together with Wrench, the latter directly from Watch Dogs 2. Not one, but two protagonists , and we will be able to play with both even if it is the first one who will spend more time in front of the camera. Even their stories are similar to those of their respective games: Aiden has a problematic nephew with whom to rekindle relationships, while Wrench will do everything to confirm his innate dislike, even if this time it is a side of his character that is deliberately exalted to laugh about it. A hero and his nephew Watch Dogs Legion Bloodline: Two protagonists meet for the first time Watch Dogs Legion: Bloodline is also set in London, of course, and the events told in this new content take place after the terrorist attack that kicks off Watch Dogs Legion, but before the definitive rise of DedSec in which the user will have a decisive role. In this period of time, Aiden will leave his loved / hated Chicago to reach London and thus remain entangled in a new very ugly affair. The current enemy is represented by a new high-tech guru who is trying to transform his automatons, limited by insufficient AI, into sentient beings like a human; to do this, however, he will need the BicaBridge, a system developed by Broca Tech. This is the premise that sees Aiden grappling with his first London mission, and that will lead him very soon to cross his path and his objectives with those of Wrench. No time wasters Watch Dogs: Legion Bloodline. Weird to see Aiden on Tower Bridge, isn't it? However, it remains the undisputed number one in the choice of coats. Watch Dogs Legion: Bloodline wastes no time and goes straight to the point: no fillers, no mini-games, no activities that can distract us from the dozen main missions and as many secondary ones present. It might seem like a great opening for an action-packed two-person adventure, but in reality Bloodline isn't all that exciting, letting Aiden's dramatic existence take over. On the one hand, this choice has a positive aspect, especially for those who have followed Watch Dogs from the beginning, given that Bloodline definitively closes the Aiden chapter and in an all in all discreet way; on the other hand, however, it does not allow the DLC the necessary space to offer the usual exponential growth in the skills and tools that the two characters will have at their disposal. For Wrench it is not a big problem, his role is more dynamic and fun, but with Aiden who, as we have said, is the real protagonist of the package, this structure soon proves to be very limiting. Artificial intelligence MK2 Watch Dogs Legion Bloodline: MK Bots are fearsome, but quite dumb. Precisely for this reason, providing it with human intelligence does not seem like a good idea at all. Especially through the most varied and entertaining side missions, straby doing some small news we will get into our hands, but nothing that can sculpt the gameplay in the way we would like, with the result that in the vast majority of cases we will end up with an Aiden Pearce devoted to stealth. The problem? In the game stealth is not so well done. From this point of view, the big news is represented by the dear old SpiderBot, equipped with a new function that allows him to fly like a drone and to attach small objects to himself. But be careful: although it may sound like an opportunity to vary the approaches, thanks to the design of the missions, most of the time the drone will be our only possibility. Among the opponents, these MK robots naturally stand out, which will be temporarily disabled through electric traps and explosives, and then repeatedly hit from behind, right where their most delicate battery is housed. Go talk to... Watch Dogs Legion Bloodline: Wrench deserved a better characterization than the one received in Watch Dogs 2, the whole game would have benefited from it. Watch Dogs: Legion Bloodline was born from a good idea, that of bringing back the protagonists of the two previous games, but collides with a wavering direction and therefore damned ineffective. Not even the turbulent relationship between Aiden and his nephew manages to save an adventure that ends out of breath, and despite a couple of occasions in which it finally seems to mesh. And then enough with these ~go talk to...~, which always end up in a crooked chat of barely a minute, which certainly isn't worth the journey through London traffic, especially when these characters are all hyper-connected and could interact quietly remotely!", "date": "2021-07-10", "grade": "7.0"}
