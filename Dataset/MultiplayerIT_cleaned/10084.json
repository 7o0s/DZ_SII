{"name": "Galassie di platino", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/76239-infinite-space-galassie-di-platino.html", "text": "If there is a recurring theme in Japanese anime, it is that of the boy who faces a great adventure and who ~matures~ over time, after passing a certain number of tests. Another great narrative stereotype is that of the time leap: in a first series of episodes we see the protagonist at a young age, grappling with the problems of adolescence, who finds himself in spite of himself facing situations bigger than him; after a particular saga, then, the setting moves about ten years into the future and we find the little boy now grown up, who has become the man we imagined and who sees things from a different perspective, while retaining the distinctive features which made him likeable. Masashi Kishimoto has resorted to both of these solutions for his Naruto, but the examples are many. Infinite Space, the brand new RPG for Nintendo DS developed by none other than Platinum Games, bases its narrative structure on these concepts, presenting us with an initially shy and awkward protagonist who then grows up and becomes a leader. His name is Yuri, and he lives on a planet where space travel has been banned by a despot. By scraping together his savings, the boy manages to hire a ~launcher~ (a sort of space courier) who can take him away from there and let him observe the universe up close. However, things go badly when Nia lands on Ropesk, after a clash with the planetary authorities. By putting into practice the notions learned on the job, Yuri manages to repair Nia's ship and together they evade King Panfilov's surveillance. Once they reach the nearest space station, the two talk about the precious ~epitaph~ that Yuri received as a gift from his father and which according to legends has the power to change the nature of space. How this is possible and what the mysterious object's relations are with the space gates is something we will discover during the course of the plot, which develops literally for dozens of hours and which, while revealing itself to be engaging and interesting, puts us in front of a long series of clichs and stereotyped situations, with which RPG enthusiasts will get married but which will inevitably leave the ~laymen~ of this videogame genre dumbfounded. Objection! The gameplay of Infinite Space consists of three distinct phases. In the first, which looks a lot like the various episodes of Phoenix Wright, we have to dialogue with other characters in search of information as well as new ideas to continue the adventure. Better to explain well: do you know the graphic adventures of the past, in which it was necessary to interact with any person present in a scenario and ask him all possible questions in search of the only information that interested us? Here, this is what practically happens in the Platinum Games product, which from this point of view proves to be extremely impractical and tending towards an experience full of dead spots and long, very long waits. In fact, it may happen that a dialogue just mentioned does not produce the desired results (for example the appearance of a new possible destination on the map) and we move on to a subsequent phase, ignoring the importance of what we have not yet done and invariably remaining stop until we understand the error (let's call it that). With these assumptions, the dialogues are soon transformed into a cumbersome and almost automated procedure, aimed at dissecting all the topics available for each character rather than enriching the plot with some facet worthy of interest. It must also be considered that the dynamics that revolve around this ~adventure~ phase are always the same, with the various planets that are often distinguished only by name but offer us the same selection of places where we can go in search of ideas. It is clear that a Nintendo DS game could never offer the background of a Mass Effect, but the work of the developers in terms of the richness of the scenarios leaves much to be desired. The second phase of the game concerns the customization of your fleet. One of the strengths of Infinite Space undoubtedly lies in its numbers, with hundreds of modules that we can mount on our spaceships and as many characters that we can bring into our team, assigning each one a different task based on their characteristics (but the choice will almost always be ~piloted~, it is useless to think about it too much). The assembly of the modules is a less immediate procedure than one might think, which one willingly undergoes in an attempt to make one's vehicles more competitive. The results in battle are then seen, even if the system of upgrades hasnot just some flaws at the interface level, we can't even immediately realize the advantages or disadvantages inherent in the acquisition of a particular object to buy ... Galaxy Express The third and final stage of the game is the one that revolves around space travel and combat. New destinations gradually appear on the map and you just need to tap with the stylus to select them, then a second tap to leave. The journey itself is shown in real time, using two different views: on the upper screen we see our spacecraft from the outside, while on the touch screen we see a suggestive cross-section of the control room. The planet we are heading towards is slowly approaching, but generally these sequences do not hide any surprises nor do they require any interaction on our part: after having witnessed the scene a couple of times, we will tend to press the button to accelerate it and thus make the our fastest and most painless journeys. During the journey we are almost always involved in a random fight, which takes place according to a hybrid system but basically based on the classic turns. In these cases the interface shows us a power bar on the left side of the touch screen, then a series of options (initially three) that we can choose to attack in a normal and ~heavy~ way, or try to dodge the attack enemy. The roster is completed by two buttons for moving the ship forward or backward, useful for putting some distance between us and our opponents, or on the contrary to get closer and increase the accuracy of the weapons. The bar empties according to the order given, but automatically refills after a few seconds. The problem is that a few seconds can be enough to suffer massive damage, so we have to make the best possible choices also based on our conditions, and possibly flee from a clash if our fleet is battered. The space stations are the only place where we can get back on track (automatically and without any outlay), the problem is that the game doesn't show us the residual energy of our ships when we can choose whether to fight or not: a another rather gross flaw. Technically there isn't much to say: the character design is clearly Japanese anime-style, decently made but not exceptional, and the animations are almost completely absent. The ~real~ game phase appears well done but far from spectacular, also given the intrinsic repetitiveness of the sequences that distinguishes the genre.", "date": "2010-04-12", "grade": "7.0"}
