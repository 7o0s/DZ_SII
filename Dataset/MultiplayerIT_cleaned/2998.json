{"name": "Warhammer 40", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/warhammer-40000-mechanicus-recensione.html", "text": "In the bleak darkness of the far future there is only war, and Warhammer 40,000 products made under license, most likely. In fact, for some years now, Games Workshop hasn't bothered much about preserving its intellectual property by giving the possibility to many development studios to access stories and characters of inestimable commercial value. The Warhammer brand is in fact known all over the world, and the atmosphere of the entire universe relating to the hobby has meant that it could be declined in every existing videogame genre. We've seen good quality action with Space Marine, slow and thoughtful hack 'n' slash like Inquisitor Martyr, top-notch RTS like the first two Dawn of War and even stat-based and number-based strategies like Sanctus Reach become more than simple licensed titles, but rather productions capable of walking with the sole strength of their games. Bulwark Studios then tries to slip into a market niche already abused for this setting but with a few sparks capable of lighting the fuse of interest. The review of Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus speaks in this case of a turn-based strategy that strangely sees the space marines disappear from the scene, of which frankly we were also a little tired, to make room for two incredibly deep and interesting races like the Adeptus Mechanicus, of course, and the nefarious Necrons. After a successful launch on PC, the title returns today in a new edition also including the Heretek DLC, looking for an adaptation for human home technology. Hunting for servoskulls The two factions involved, although they are not among the most played in the physical edition of Warhammer 40,000, have a respectable background and have their roots in the darkest past of the forty-first millennium. You will take control of some extremely extravagant characters that perfectly encapsulate the beating heart of Warhammer, in a perfect mix of religion, technology and blasphemy. The Adeptus Mechanicus is in fact constantly looking for alien technology to study and with which to increase its power, however feeling obliged, as a faction, to have to respect the will of the Omnissiah - the machine god. Thus stumbling upon a Necron tomb will be the trigger for a new war, with your decisions that can quickly change the fate and morale of the troops on the battlefield. The story, but above all the narration of the events, of Mechanicus is one of the strongest points of the production and the story will absorb you to such an extent that it is by itself a more than sufficient stimulus to continue in the game to try to reach its end. In short, it doesn't often happen that you feel compelled to continue in such a game due to the way of telling the events but here, all enthusiasts will really find what they are looking for. Thus, identifying ourselves in the techno-priests of which we will obtain full control, we will be driven to scrutinize every nook and cranny of the dark levels that await us, in search of knowledge and not death. Faith, as we know, can then be interpreted and the comparison between the various views of the Techno Priests on the cult of the Omnissiah will give rise to interesting dialogues and clashes of thoughts that leave the player with the correct path to pursue, with the implications applied to subsequent battles . Purge the xenos From exploration and dialogues we then move on to turn-based strategic combat. From a simple command bridge we will have an aerial view of the playing area and a chessboard on which to move our soldiers. The structure is quite classic and closely resembles titles such as Xcom or Mutant Year Zero, however renouncing the avalanche of statistics and numbers that have always delighted fans of the genre. In short, there is much less mathematics in this production than you might expect and the bulk of the work will therefore be done by the strategy, positioning and management of attack orders, given that even the covers have been almost completely abolished. However, each tech-priest is equipped with various equipment, which can be changed from mission to mission, and also with skills that will allow you to adopt different strategies to achieve the various objectives. Overall, everything works properly even if all these simplifications to the formula risk making Mechanicus a simple form exercise for those who eat strategic ones for breakfast. By completing levels we will then acquire experience points useful for developing and leveling up the core of your army, so as to change its appearance reflecting the various technological modifications and showing the alien world the true power of technology. The title bears in dote a good technical sector with animations that do their duty without ever impressing and is accompanied by atmospheric music that never bores, even during the long planning shifts.", "date": "2020-07-17", "grade": "7.5"}
