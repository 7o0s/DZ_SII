To direct it there are two names known to those who hang out with the less famous JRPGs but, at times, more interesting than many famous titles, namely Tomohiko Deguchi, already father of the aforementioned Grand Knights History, as director, and Chizu Hashii, also a veteran of Vanillaware, for the artistic part; but if the work of the second, which we will analyze in detail further on, is already clearly visible, how the first will have behaved, this time with his MonoChro study, produced by Spike Chunsoft's old foxes and brought to the West by the usual NIS America ? Surprisingly well, we can anticipate you. Discover Grand Kingdom, a strategic RPG that never ceases to offer game ideas! Just a band of mercenaries The narrative premises of Grand Kingdom are as simple as they are vaguely realistic: in a medieval fantasy world, a hundred years have now passed since the fall of the great Uldein Empire, and for a hundred years the four nations that arose from the collapse, namely Landerth, Fiel, Valkyr and Magion, fight tirelessly for absolute domination of the continent of Resonail and the creation of a new Empire. Such a long war, however, wears you down, the regular armies are on their last legs, and here mercenaries come into play, armies with no values other than those of money and military prestige, who lend their work once to a contender, from time to time, depending on which contract pays off the most. Just at the head of a band of mercenaries will be you, noted for your combat performance by the Guild, the largest association of soldiers of fortune in the world of Grand Kingdom, with your entry in which the game opens. The plot that unfolds from here on is essentially short, uninteresting except towards the end, all in all banalotta. The nice thing is, however, that you can completely disregard it or use it as a mere pretext to gain experience and thus dedicate yourself to the dozens and dozens of other things that this title has to offer you, so many that it is difficult both to mention them all in the article, and to follow in drafting a precise order of ideas. Which then, if you like, is also the same feeling you get once you finish the short tutorial and have access to everything practically all together: an overabundance of content that overwhelming, a disorientation from which it takes some time, but definitely worth it. A basic unit, you can manage up to six of them, is made up of four soldiers, who you can hire and discharge at will, subject to the availability of the moment for hiring and the achievement of the limit of 50 total elements. There are seventeen different classes of warriors, from the classics of the genre up to particularities such as the Challenger, a sort of engineer armed with barrels with a thousand effects, summarily divided between specialized in melee, in distance, in white and black magic and in support , and the beauty is that going forward in the specialization you understand the profound differences even between those classes that at the beginning seem identical. Yes, because as the levels increase, in addition to deciding which feature to improve, you learn new skills: some are passive, others active, to be assigned to a button on the pad and used in real time in battle, with real combos to be structured as efficiently as possible for the soldiers on the front lines, and varied and balanced arsenals of moves and magic for the others. Not to mention that it is then possible, under certain conditions, to change the class of the characters, maintaining the skills and improving the characteristics but losing the levels, for a substantially infinite and multifaceted leveling and management of the units, which constitute one of the points of greatest attraction for who loves this kind of mechanics. Friendly fire Mechanics that, it goes without saying, require a large dose of grinding, which would be a disaster if there weren't variety and fun in the actual gameplay. The variety is already present in the choice of quests: in addition to the few that advance the plot, there are those that are competitive against other teams of real mercenaries but commanded by the CPU, those that are entrusted to you by nations (we will deal with these two aspects better in the next paragraph ), and the ~free~ ones for collecting resources and experience points. Even the objectives proposed by each single quest are of the most varied, although thenin essence, everything takes place on a sort of board that represents the region in which you find yourself, on which your ~pawn~ moves one square at a time with a limited number of turns always except in collection missions, which once reaching zero causes the quest to fail. Then on the board there are crossroads, chests, various obstacles, surprise events, resources, hidden roads and many secrets, merchants, doctors, in short, all in the name of abundance and variety of situations, without forgetting the pawns that represent the enemies, a once you come into contact with which, finally, the actual combat takes place. Which takes place with a side view that recalls the old scrolling beat 'em ups from the hall, a turn-based structure but an action development: you can move along three parallel lines, and both the movement along a single one and the passage from one to the other the other causes the movement bar to gradually empty, and then move on to strokes governed by a second bar; however, if you have some movement conserved, you can use it to deal more damage. Said of skill planning, this is especially important in the context of combos for characters equipped with a white weapon (by the way, it is useless to specify that all the equipment can be customized both by purchasing it and by finding it around, with the various weapons, armor and accessories that not only modify the stats but also the aesthetics of the units), which are not limited to a simple ~button mashing~ but require skill, for example in hitting an enemy thrown into the air with the right timing. Skill that also comes into play in ranged attacks - a cursor moves along the line and it's up to you to exactly center the opponent - as well as in preventing your shots from damaging allies: the concept of friendly fire is present and is one of the few limits of the combat system, as it is not always easily understood before launching the attack whether or not this will involve other party members. Finally, the system of objects, or spells, which then behave as such, with the most varied effects and to be placed on the ground, is interesting: a trap for enemies, for example, must be placed where it is thought that the opponent will pass, while a magical area that boosts attack should be where it's easiest for our swordsman to reach on his next turn, for an extra layer of strategic depth. Playstation 4 trophies They are 46, of which 5 are secret. The remaining 41 are divided into 24 bronzes, 15 silvers, 1 gold and platinum. Some are related to the main campaign, but many are related to maximizing units and their abilities or particular ~completist~ skills. There are those who reward you, or ~mock~ you, for particular actions in the field, be they heroic or unintentionally funny, and those available for those who will come across the many secrets scattered here and there for Resonail. Master a colorful 2D world Not forgetting the notes on friendly fire and considering a certain difficulty of management, at least initially, of all the elements on the screen (but this is a general trend of the game, due both to its complexity and to the interface and tutorials that could certainly have been done better ), in short, even the combat is very, very fun, requiring, if you don't want to resort to the classic way of extreme leveling, the right match between strategic planning, tactics and skill with the pad. Considering the audience to which the game is aimed, we could have stopped here too, after all with 50 units to develop and manage, the hours that await you are already many. But no: because there is a whole asynchronous online section which is still, for those who are predisposed, more interesting and long-lived than all the rest. Your team can enter into a contract with one of 4 rival nations, and for a period of time ranging from one to five wars (each war lasts eight hours on average, but there are also longer events), participate in the development of a real persistent world in which the four kingdoms lose and conquer regions all the time. Not directly, because here you can only give your unit generic orders and then it will behave according to its characteristics, but, apart from the online rankings, the feeling of increasing one's prestige, one's influence over a nation, essentially the Your own fame in a real online world is priceless. And it does not remain on paper: each nation, characterized in a different way, offers its particular objects both to buy and to produce, its research and development to contribute to, its quests, in a whirlwind of situations in which the most talented can , in theory, davIt is true to become legendary heroes and become more important than the nations themselves, wisely playing their cards both tactically and politically. This is an aspect of the game that has obviously just started, but with enormous potential for the more constant ones: we will see how the community will develop, as well as how the microtransaction system to which all this lends itself will work, and which fortunately is limited for the moment to cosmetic changes. Cosmetics which is the last aspect that remains for us to deal with, although if we wanted to go into detail we would still have a lot to write: the game is practically all in 2D, having to deal with the release also for Vita (cross play and cross expected saves, but not the cross buy). But it is a splendid, rich, very colorful 2D, with manga-style illustrations, although not particularly original, always fascinating and in the portraits of the characters and in the depiction of the settings, not to mention when you then pass on the battlefield with its thousands of elements on the screen and its fluid and spectacular animations. The sound was also promoted with full marks, with traditional but varied and well-composed music, especially for the dubbing which also in English (Japanese present but obviously difficult to judge by those who do not know the language) always remains above the standard for this kind of productions , as quality but also as mere quantity. Finally, all the texts are also in English, which, given the already reiterated complexity of the whole and the imperfect intuitiveness of the interface, could cause some problems for those who don't know it well.", "date": "2016-06-20", "grade": "8.6"}
