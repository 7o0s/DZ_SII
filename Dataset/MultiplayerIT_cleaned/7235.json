However, as often happens, the grafts soon end up revealing their price, i.e. the dependence on a drug that allows the body not to reject them. This substance is produced by powerful corporations who decide to raise its price, to the point that many people can no longer afford to buy it. Ben Saxon and Anna Kelso, both special agents equipped with cybernetic grafts, find themselves in the same situation, that is, they are running out of stocks of Neuropozin; and it is precisely at that juncture that the story of Deus Ex: The Fall begins, set before the events of Human Revolution but strong in the same futuristic setting, stylistically characterized by the predominance of amber. If you have read the detailed review of the mobile version, you will already know what we are talking about: a first person shooter with RPG elements that materialize above all in the interaction with non-player characters, devoted to stealth mechanics but decidedly not at ease when the The action becomes direct and you have to face your enemies head on. In short, a spin-off of more than fair quality, but which Square Enix wanted to bring to PC without making particular revisions of the formula. Which resulted in quite a debacle. While starting from a good foundation, the PC version of Deus Ex: The Fall disappoints in almost every respect The Fail There are absolute values and relative values, and as you well know, the evaluation of a game is closely related to the platform it runs on, its potential and its limits, even systematic ones. This is to say that if Deus Ex: The Fall on iOS and Android devices offered good entertainment all in all, accompanied by a technical sector up to the situation and reactive and precise touch controls, this does not mean that translating the game as it is on PC was presented as a risk-free operation. The sale price on Steam, equal to 9.99 euros, appears all in all adequate to what the playful offer is, albeit short (the campaign is completed within two or three hours), if we consider the current promotion which includes the Game of the Year version of the original Deus Ex in the purchase. However, there are flaws, which indeed appear from the very first moments, in the form of commands without a real calibration, whether you use the combination mouse / keyboard than the Xbox 360 controller. Managing the view, therefore turning around and aiming, turns out to be a slow and cumbersome maneuver, which we need to get used to and keep in mind when we decide to approach an enemy. The defect proves to be even more serious when, after having set the sensitivity of the controls to maximum to limit its impact, one tries his hand at one of the hacking minigames to access the many closed doors scattered throughout the levels. In fact, if you play with the controller, these applications become impossible to manage due to the excessive ~speed~ assigned to the analog stick, so it is a must to keep the mouse close at hand and use it in these circumstances. God of cities The problems with the controls of the PC version of Deus Ex: The Fall sadly further accentuate the game's original shortcomings when the path of stealth action is abandoned for whatever reason in favor of a more direct approach. Collision detection is in fact bad, with portions of the scenario that extend invisibly intercepting our shots, but above all the management of weapons and fire appears cumbersome, with annoying uncertainties when shooting. It's a real pity, because as long as we remain hidden things work fairly well, net of the controls, but the situation precipitates if we are noticed and we therefore move on to an open confrontation. This inevitably transforms the experience into a sequence of trial and error, which in turn shows the side of structural deficiencies of weight: the campaign is finished using only two or three tools, despite the amount of weapons and upgrades to which it is in fact possible to access, and there is practically only one boss fight (a very bad one) in the final phase of the adventure. The framework of limits and shortcomings that we have traced so far is completed by a technical sector which could have its reason on smartphones and tablets, but which on PC, however without advanced settings (you can only choose resolution and antialiasing level, as well as activate vertical synchrony or not), appears a little too simple and in manybadly sketched breakers (see enemies ~sliding~ from one location to another). On the test configuration the game shot at over two hundred frames per second, which speaks volumes about the complexity of the polygonal models and scenarios.", "date": "2014-03-25", "grade": "5.0"}
