At first sight it is a clone of the famous Counter-Strike mod of HalfLife. A first person shooter, which will make you impersonate a specialist in the military art (you will choose between an explorer, a sniper, a soldier and a specialist). Unlike the usual multiplayer fps, three teams (red, blue and black) can play in each map and each team will have different tasks. In the ~Island_Sub_Pen~ mission you will be transported to an unidentified island in the Philippine Sea: the Russian submarine Krasnopetrovsk, which recently disappeared in the Pacific Ocean, has been detected by spy satellites in a secret base located there. The local militia is believed to be in the employ of a shady faction, which has secretly financed the sub's defection, including the entire crew. The submarine is equipped with state-of-the-art cruise missiles which are believed to contain nuclear warheads. The game The blue team will have to locate the submarine, climb aboard and download the data from the central computer, using the portable device supplied to the scout. The red team, on the other hand, will have to locate and destroy the submarine by placing a charge of C4 in the control room. The last team (the black team) will have the task of protecting the submarine and the data contained in the central computer. When you start the map you will have to choose which team to join and which military class to impersonate, bearing in mind that each class has different characteristics (but okay?). Once the mission has started, you will have a few seconds to be able to choose which weapons to take (there are really a lot of them, even if to tell the truth they all look a bit the same). Once you leave, it will be up to you to set your tactics (with bots in the case of an offline game, you can issue orders such as having them follow you, to cover and so on). Once one team has achieved the objective (or killed the other two teams), the round is replayed. Each round won't last more than a minute, so even in the worst case (should you die first) you won't have to wait too long before you come back to life (actually, there's even the option that allows those who died to resurrect after any number of seconds). But let's start with the (almost scientific) analysis of the game. GRAPHICS and ENGINE The game engine leaks everywhere. Although the graphic quality appreciable from the screenshots may suggest a good realization, as soon as you see the graphics in motion, Team Factor will seem more like a product created by amateurs than professionals. The animations of the character models are nothing short of ridiculous (for one thing: everyone seems to be running with a stick stuck where the sun doesn't shine). Clipping errors (horrors) are commonplace. If we think that this engine, which in terms of graphic quality is a couple of years old, is also very heavy and requires a super pumped computer to be played without suffering its heaviness, we can only admit that the programming work was badly conceived . [C] ,11# Just to rage: never seen such stupid bots (but with exceptional aim), they get stuck everywhere (pathfinding at very low levels) and it will happen that they either don't notice you from 1 meter, or they start shooting at you from 2 km. Among other things, the game is set up in a way of dubious intelligence: once mortally hit you will have a few moments to continue shooting (needless to say that in this way all 1 vs 1 clashes always end with the death of both soldiers and that it is very annoying not to know immediately if you have killed the enemy in the case of, for example, sniping). PLAYABILITY The game features two modes, online and offline. As mentioned above, the artificial intelligence of bots is completely non-existent: this does not mean that you will have fun playing Team Factor offline for a couple of hours, just enough to see and learn the 12 maps included in the game. Besides offline play does not offer. This video game was born as an online game and it is online that gives the greatest satisfaction. The most innovative idea is the RPG mode (only available in the online game at a realistic level). At the end of each fight, how you played will be evaluated and 6 parameters will be updated (strength, resistance, concealment, enemy detection, aim and breath control). Each time you participate in this mode you can gain or lose points that will help differentiate players. The biggest limitation of the online mode is the presence of three teams (the fights are often reduced to the melina, so as not to face two teamsat the same time; in fact, the winner is the one who manages not to find himself between two enemy fires). I noticed a slight latency in the responses of the movements (but this could be due to the game ping; even offline the ping is around 50 milliseconds). LONGEVITY' As mentioned, the longevity of the offline game is a couple of hours. As for the online mode (especially thanks to the rpg mode) you can get passionate and play without getting bored for some time. The very high number of weapons available (there are about fifty of them, the good number of maps included in the game (12) and the possibility of downloading new ones (the manual says that more will be available on the official site) contribute to balancing the mediocre technical realization of the product.To signal a concise manual of 20 pages and a nice poster with the list of weapons (figures and characteristics) and the topography of the 12 settings present (useful in the early stages of the game). Conclusions Team Impact is a frustrating game (full of bugs and programming ingenuity), really made in an amateur way, but based on a very fashionable genre today and with a couple of interesting ideas (the aforementioned rpg mode). Does the game reach enough? In my opinion not. One could easily overlook the graphical and programming flaws, but the insufficiency derives from the fact that this game competes with a host of multiplayer military FPSs in front of which the miserable Team Factor sadly pales (and I quote Counter Strike, Operation Flashpoint and Ghost Recon; and I didn't count the newer titles). The introductory hat A couple of months ago, at the end of Smau2001 and the Multiplayer convention, TheNurse and I found ourselves in a Milanese pub discussing everything and nothing over three beers with Kimlandil. I remember precisely that one of the topics of our discussion concerned a sort of deontological code of the reviewer: I maintained that there are bad videogames that must be classified as such (and I add mercilessly), the other two, however, maintained ( being in fact right) that the complex role of the reviewer is to underline the positive and negative aspects, express personal comments and try to make the reader understand what type of gamer can appreciate that particular product. In this case I am dealing with a product of dubious quality, but following the advice of the two aforementioned editors (who are certainly more experienced than me) I will try to analyze Team Factor objectively... ...but you will have already understood I won't sing its praises.", "date": "2002-06-29", "grade": null}
