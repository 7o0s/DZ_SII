{"name": "Sparatutto o picchiaduro?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/73960-battle-blasters-sparatutto-o-picchiaduro.html", "text": "A shortlist of six warriors who stand out for their resistance, speed, firepower, type of attack and special moves face each other in as many stages, in what at first glance looks like a classic fighting game. Yet this is not the case: Battle Blasters draws on beat'em-ups for the presentation and the basic idea, only to present itself in all respects in the form of a vertical shooter. In fact, the two characters who have to compete cannot come into physical contact due to an insurmountable obstacle (usually a chasm), so they fight from a distance shooting everything they have at each other, including a unique special attack for each of them. Described in this way, the gameplay of the original title developed by Little Guy Games seems extremely simple and basic, but in reality it hides an unexpected thickness, which is revealed in the marked differences between the usable warriors, as well as in a calibration of the difficulty that really changes the cards on the table already when you pass from the default ~easy~ level to the ~normal~ level. Fire at will If Battle Blasters is already striking for its freshness and for the proposed mix of action and strategy, it is the touch screen control system that really makes the difference. With the action visually represented vertically, our character is at the bottom of the screen and moves left and right by dragging his sprite with his fingers. The attack system includes offensive and defensive maneuvers: in the first case, we can draw rapid lines that start from the character and go towards the enemy to obtain rapid but not very powerful beams, while a slower and more precise gesture translates into a more slow but definitely more powerful. Both types of attack are regulated on the basis of the energy bars found on the left side of the screen: the first represents the energy for quick attacks, the second (divided into ~capsules~) the most powerful blows. Some characters have a greater number of powerful shots or in any case a weapon that fires two at a time, others perhaps fire one at a time but can perform a ~fan~ attack maneuver to have a better chance of hitting the target . To these two attacks is added a unique special move for each character: there are those who throw a knife, those who fire two powerful shots of energy, those who still create a sort of ~barrier~ from which rapid projectiles then depart, and so on. saying. As mentioned, the gameplay is based as much on the offensive as on the defensive phase: in addition to dodging the enemy's blows by moving, we can cancel them by shooting bullets of equal power in turn or activate an instantaneous energy shield that repels the attacks and sends them back to the sender . The latter possibility requires a certain precision, but it must be absolutely mastered in order to be able to face the more advanced difficulty levels. Amiga style The main game mode sees us start with a single character available, finish the game and gradually unlock the others. There is also a multiplayer mode for two people on the same device, which clearly takes full advantage of the multitouch functions and works really well. As far as the visual approach and the solutions adopted are concerned, Battle Blasters closely resembles some of the classics of the Bitmap Brothers, the historic team of developers who brought titles such as Speedball and The Chaos Engine to the Amiga: the top view, the design of the characters, the artistic use of bitmap graphics and the quality of the animations. All elements that shine in their own light in Battle Blasters, taking a sort of moral revenge against 3D ~at all costs~ and showing iPhone and iPod Touch owners that it is still possible to do great things in 2D, if there are the talent and passion. The characters in the game move convincingly, their energy attacks create spectacular trails and the battles take place within stages that are not very rich in elements but certainly functional to the action and well differentiated. Some warriors boast a more original look than others, but in every case the final result is commendable. It's just a pity that the sound commentary, so powerful during the introduction of the matches, then ends up diminishing and losing impact during the actual action.
