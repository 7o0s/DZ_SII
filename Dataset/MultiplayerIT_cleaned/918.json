{"name": "Cossacks II: Napoleonic Wars", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cossacks-ii-napoleonic-wars.html", "text": "Officer and gentleman Arrived now years after the last title in the series, Cossacks II: Napoleonic Wars deserves attention for several reasons that bring it one step ahead of previous releases. First of all it is a real-time strategy game not without interesting ideas and secondly it is currently the only strategy game that stages the Napoleonic wars of conquest. The singular historical fresco is not a factor to be underestimated, after a decade there are bloody clashes between Saladins and bizarre British regents, not to mention the endless simulations that the reports of the Second World War have given us. By virtue of that void that passes between the two-handed sword and the howitzer, we can certainly rejoice in the innovative and elegant war scenario proposed by Cossacks II. If you have always wondered what mysterious thought was at the basis of open field clashes, where hundreds of men shoot at each other without moving a step from their position, now you will finally have the opportunity to understand how much fine strategy goes behind those group shootings. Etiquette Wars If we look at Cossacks II from above we can first of all appreciate the consistent size of the game map, so large that it can accommodate several villages; precious objectives to be secured with cannon fire. On this extensive landscape, as for most of the strategic, there are two distinct elements but intimately dependent on each other's functioning: resource management and the actual battle phases. In this sense Cossacks II fits into the vein with some very interesting variations. The key to resource management is to occupy the settlements on the map to obtain gold, coal, food, iron and more while trying to prevent the enemy from obtaining the same type of supplies. From this it is immediately clear how strategic control of the roads and access routes to inhabited centers plays a key role in the success of supplies. Your laborers will only take care of collecting wood and stones, but this does not affect the centralization system of raw materials, which are stored in your base where you can invest them in support units and new buildings. Such streamlined management of resources allows you to concentrate on the movement of the units present on the battlefield, which need food and gunpowder in order not to lose their autonomy. Cossacks II fills a huge gap in the strategy market and offers an experience accessible to the general public From the point of view of the real battle Cossacks II proves to be much more meticulous and detailed; in this regard, two main elements must be considered, which are the displacements and the fire confrontations, on which the bulk of the work is carried out by the infantry, in accordance with the era of the unstoppable Napoleon. You will therefore have to carefully choose the marching formation considering the level of effort sustainable by the unit and the level of morale, which if it were to fall below a certain limit would lead to the disintegration of the platoon, which would disperse disastrously. As far as open field comparisons are concerned, the winning strategy consists in calculating the most suitable moment to open fire on the enemy, bearing in mind that a musket is not a Remington and takes a long time to be able to fire another single shot again. . Luckily, colored area markers give you an idea of range versus shot effectiveness, so the red perimeter becomes the ideal distance to get the most casualties. However, we can assure you that decimating the enemy requires a careful strategy that balances movement, supplies and timing. The balance between the management of your army and the artificial intelligence of the computer is good, as the CPU will give you a hard time pushing you to waste the round of shooting while trying to break the unit of your army, even if in single player mode the difficulty reaches some too abrupt tension peaks, without an adequate gradual increase in the commitment required to return to the fort on one's own feet. It could therefore be summarized that beyond the control of raw materials, the bulk of the game consists in routing the enemy units while trying to starve them or deprive them of gunpowder, a far from simple undertaking anyway. Red flag will triumph Napoleon stopped in Russia and he wasn't even the only one, but don't worry because Cossacks II doesn't forcefully bind you to the fate of this man of great (moral) stature. I actually choose themgame titles deserve an in-depth mention because they offer interesting possibilities that end up benefiting the longevity of this title. The weakest mode is the single-player mode, where a sparse rather cobbled-together story serves the sole purpose of making you switch from one scenario to another as the British army, eager to contain the French bluecoats. Although far too demanding, it is still an excellent gym to dive into the much more interesting campaign for the domination of Europe, the true heart of Cossacks II in our opinion. The scenario is set up in a similar way as a leading concept to that which characterizes the series of strategic games such as the recent Rome: Total War. Of course we are very far from the depth offered by that type of game, but the basic idea offers a very attractive variant. It is a turn-based campaign played on the map of Europe, where after choosing a nation among the six available you will have to engage in the conquest of enemy territories. At your disposal you will not have more than a single army to move on the game map and your only concern will be to fortify the territories in which the army is not present. Of course all the clashes are played in real time as is the case for the single player campaign. The most interesting strategic element lies in the fact that the availability of resources on the battlefield depends on the supplies accumulated during the game rounds on the map of the Old Continent. However streamlined it is fast, there is still an even more immediate alternative which consists of the classic skirmishes, playable both against a human player and alongside him in a team, a particularly fun alternative to experiment with. In addition to this mode, a campaign is available between players connected to the network who compete on behalf of their nation, trying to conquer small slices of an opposing nation against the backdrop of Napoleonic Europe as always. Spangles and muskets Cossakcs II is not a riot of technique and the two-dimensional game engine could make the most impatient turn up their noses, but the detail of the units and the pitch compensates for this shortcoming very well. The animations are fun and give further vitality to a natural scenario that still breathes under the breath of the wind, between beautiful bright green plains and very detailed villages. Not to forget the presence of movies recreated live in which you will see actors in the flesh miming the action that is performing the unit selected on the screen at that moment. This is certainly a very welcome and original detail, diminished only by the parallel comparison with the unlistenable, toneless and at times annoying dubbing. Too bad also for the lack of stability of the game which tends to periodic crashes sometimes accompanied by a drop in the frame-rate in cases of high presence of sprites on the screen. However, it is not easy to close in a clear and clear way on the experience offered by Cossacks II, because despite many maneuvers being wooden and perhaps too frequent, the fluid management of the economy leaves you ample room for playability on your army, guaranteeing you time to concentrate on the purely warlike aspects, which are certainly the funniest part of the game. In any case, the judgment is positive, because Cossacks II fills a large gap in the strategic market and offers an experience accessible to the general public. Comment We must give Cossacks II the merit of presenting a less frenetic gameplay than many titles of the same genre, with innovative solutions even if not without defects. Beyond the war mechanics, it cannot be said that the game dives into a historical reconstruction as faithful as the tradition of strategy based on real events would like, but it compensates by making distortions less evident and rewarding the player with a fascinating game system . Weak points still remain and the single player campaign suffers from a somewhat hasty planning, but this does not change the final judgment: Cossacks II is an accessible title open to all, which deserves to be discovered for its particularity (at the moment uniqueness) and which cannot fail to make fans of the Napoleonic period or real-time strategists happy. Pros: New historical scenario for the genre Unique and fascinating gameplay Usable even by an inexperienced audience Cons: Too many maneuvers to perform A few too many bugs Technically it doesn't spark", "date": "2005-06-10", "grade": null}
