The title developed by Flying Lab Software is not one of the latest news on the videogame scene, in which it peeped for the first time about three years: it was in fact January 22, 2008 when it was launched for the first time. At the time, like many of its peers, PotBS required the payment of a monthly subscription to play, which, however, leapfrogging to the present day, we no longer have to worry about, given that developers and publishers (Sony Online Entertainment for Europe and the USA) have decided to make the game free starting November 22, 2010. About a month and a half after the big step, we took the trouble to try this game which has seen its formula completely renewed, embracing the so-called freemium: free basic content with the possibility of making microtransactions to purchase additional content and /or access an ~enhanced~ version of the normal account by paying a monthly subscription. But the PotBS game mechanics are now completely appreciable even without spending a cent, so if after reading this review you want to play, all you have to do is download the client and launch yourself into the Caribbean sea. There's a Frenchman, an Englishman... As per the self-respecting tradition for an online role-playing game, the first step to be faced in PotBS is that relating to the choice of the character, for which we find ourselves first of all choosing the faction, then obviously going on to create the look. There are four sides present, three of which are almost similar to each other, namely French, English and Spanish, while as the last faction we find that of the Pirates, certainly the most fascinating of the group, and there is no need to explain why. In case you want to choose to be part of one of the three nations, the game also asks us to select the career level for your character: a Navy Officer in command of his crew, a kind of ~legalized~ pirate hero as a Privateer or a free trader as a Freetrader. If instead the pirate adventure is what we want, we can choose between Buccaneer, similar to the Freetrader of the nations, and Cutthroat, comparable instead to the Privateer of the three factions described above. Depending on the chosen career, it is possible to have bonuses in some aspects of the game: for example, the Navy Officer can access ships and armaments that are closed to others while the Freetrader has a greater positive impact on fleet management. Going one step further, we arrive at the moment to give our character his own appearance: the editor is done quite well, and it is possible to choose from a good range of parameters which in turn boast a good variety of elements, which make thus offering the right chance of not seeing replicants of the same model around, even if the influence of films like Pirates of the Caribbean is there and it shows. In any case, if after some time the look of your character no longer satisfies you, you can always choose to go to the tailor to change his appearance a bit. Fifteen men on the dead man's chest, yo ho ho! The game mechanics of Pirates of the Burning Sea require the player to go through an initial acclimatization phase, which is decisive above all for deciding whether it is the type of game you want to face, given that on balance the Flying Lab creature looks like one of the Most multifaceted MMORPG on the market. Fortunately, however, you are introduced to a system of initial quests also intended to act as a tutorial, ranging a bit between all aspects of the game which in any case require a fairly long learning period. From the point of view of character growth, we find the usual level system, now familiar to every online role player, through which you can obtain skill points to spend on your character and for naval battles. In the same way in which the skills are divided we find the fights, divided between those between ships and those to the sound of the sword with one's enemy face to face. The cannon fight in the open sea is certainly the most spectacular aspect of PotBS, as well as the one realized in the best way, where tactics become practically everything: in fact, one must be careful of the winds, knowing at the same time which type of armaments to use ( there are not only the classic cannonballs) to decrease the various parameters that distinguish the enemy ship. A bit subdued compared to the battles between ships are instead the melee ones, che neither add nor take anything away from the game, but they certainly don't go down in the annals as instead the battles on the open sea remain to be remembered. An important component of PotBS is the game's economy, which is entirely based on the production carried out by the players themselves, who can then sell the goods to others or keep them for their own use. If participating in the economy is not expressly required by the game, missing out on this opportunity means giving up an important part of the mechanics, given and also considering the presence of Societies, a sort of what we would call a guild in other online games, in which players they can organize themselves. Returning to the economy, this is also closely connected to the PvP system, with which the factions divide the ports present in the game, which in turn are able to guarantee the possibility of accessing specific goods that can only be obtained by controlling a specific port. Precisely the battles for the ports are among the most exciting moments that can be experienced by playing, starting from their preparation which begins days before the start of the actual battle and which involves the majority of players. Between sea and land From a technical point of view, before making any considerations, one must however keep in mind that we are in the presence of a game that arrived on the market about three years ago now, and which therefore, despite having been able to renew itself over time, retains some graphics of the elements dating back to 2008. All this translates into a visual impact that certainly does not make the billions of polygons its strong point, however going to play everything in the setting and in the involvement, which the developers manage to guarantee while showing obvious limits in the graphic sector. If the animations of the characters are often to be forgotten, the Caribbean shown in PotBS are made of pulsating life and are exactly like those we would expect to see in a film set in the 1700s. better, giving the player the opportunity to enjoy their ship in exotic landscapes to be discovered. If the graphics show ups and downs, the sound completes the objective of focusing on involvement, giving life to the cities with all their sounds and noises and also offering a respectable soundtrack, not surprisingly offered as a bonus for all pre-orders. time of the game's release.", "date": "2011-01-26", "grade": "7.8"}
