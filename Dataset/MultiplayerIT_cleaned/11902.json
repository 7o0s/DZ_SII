{"name": "Football Manager 2008 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/football-manager-2008-recensione.html", "text": "The Football Manager series - and even before changing brands when it was called Championship Manager - has always been a strange sort of videogame paradox. In fact, we are talking about a more than ten-year saga that resists stainlessly at the top of the sales and quality rankings. And this without screaming graphics, a noteworthy soundtrack, not even a textured polygon that moves by mistake, nor the ball bounce. We are talking about a saga that year after year becomes more and more complete, profound and - apparently - far from those market dictates that would like increasingly simple and simplistic titles, able to be mastered in a short time even by the most distracted of players. The Sports Interactive team - led by Miles Jacobson - is the cornerstone capable of demonstrating that where there is attention, love and passion for one's products, there is no law of the market that holds. Hoping that this lesson will also be learned in other videogame fields, we are thus preparing to present you Football Manager 2008, yet another masterpiece - we already feel like writing it - which will nail millions of new living room technical commissioners to their desks. Football Manager in pills For all fans of theoretical (and spoken) football, those who on Sunday are divided into Zemaniani and Trapattoniani and from time to time appeal to the blindfolded goddess of Fusignano, Football Manager represents a real football Bible, able to give more adrenaline and excitement of any random Pro Evolution Soccer. Football Manager is a football manager capable of embracing all phases of managing a team with the exception of the purely financial part. This means that once you have selected the team to train (and here the numbers could make your head spin) the game opportunities offered by the title start from the selection of your players and tactics then moving on to the transfer campaign (also in this case not it will be difficult to find in the proposed database, an old teammate who used to play with you in the pupil category and is now an honest C1 half-back), the selection of the technical staff (physiotherapists, assistant coaches or scouts), the training methods, the management of the locker room, the relationship with the media, with the fans and with the other coaches through an infinite series of other little big facets that will make you stay two in the morning, cursing for the delusions of grandeur of one of your young promises who does not want renew the contract to go and play abroad in a Premier League team and seeing you desperately looking for a fluidifying full-back with good foot who can request an engagement in line with the dictates set by their management. Not to mention perhaps the discontent in the locker room caused by the last purchase not well accepted by the old senators of the team on the eve of a second part of the championship that sees our uncomfortable seat, pardon, bench, getting hotter and hotter. To every minimal and imperceptible action of the player corresponds a reaction in the events of the game. A few mouse clicks and you forget to play, to simulate: Football Manager is the essence of football, its digital simulacrum. The news Unlike the 2007 edition which, albeit marginally, had brought new game possibilities (such as the possibility of having confidential and privileged relationships with other clubs), for this FM2008 the developers seem to be mainly concentrated on two other aspects: ergonomics and the level of immersion. Beyond the (almost) entirely revised game interface, which reminded us of the feeling of the latest Apple products, after a couple of rounds even the most elderly players will risk being surprised how much they can no longer do without the new contextual shortcuts proposals. Being able to read the report of one's scouts regarding our next opponents and already having a button available to see the recordings of the salient actions or being able to comment on the man to stop gives the player a sense of total control capable of taking him even further into the gaming experience. For all novices, Sports Interactive has seen fit to introduce Help cards that will try to explain to the player what he can do and how. This attention to newcomers is possible from the moment of creating the first game, where by default the more technical options and terms are hidden in favor of a series of Wizard-style screens. Again from this point of view (but this time even the regulars of the series will be able to derive real benefits) FM2008 does its utmost trying to makeere even clearer and more evident the effects of our work on the bench. Now, for example, there will always be a post-match commentary that will judge the performance of our team based on the expectations of the press (previously it was only done in the case of televised matches) also highlighting key players from both sides and - above all - we will have a direct line with the fans to get to know, from time to time, the criticisms, hopes and compliments of the curve. This philosophy has then been adapted to our relationships with management, enabling us to better understand our employers' judgment of progress on and off the field of play. Football Manager is the essence of football, its digital simulacrum The news Still speaking at the level of the game interface, we particularly liked the presence of a new screen totally dedicated to the transfer market where all the offers in progress, both received and made, are summarized, thus allowing us with a single glance to have a idea of the situation. Likewise, the new calendar view (now Outlook-style) and the new information center denote a further step towards the ease of navigating and organizing information. This is a truly crucial element, speaking of a title that makes the wealth of information one of the many strong points. Then there are unexpected introductions, such as the possibility of changing the size of the playing field to adapt it - within the limits set by the regulation - to the characteristics of our 11, or such as the use of Facegen technology to reconstruct the faces of the players and staff, so much so that we will see them age over time... Although partially revised, the financial management of the team remains detached from our work. FM2008 provides us with a new series of information and details regarding the financial state of the club, but apart from the unprecedented possibility of agreeing with the team the prizes for achieving the season's objectives (league or cups) the management of the coffers of the team will remain in the hands of others. Field coaches Much emphasis has been placed on the new Match Flow created by the developers for FM2008, defined by themselves as the biggest change since the introduction of the new Match Engine. In a nutshell, now the approach to the match has been further schematized by introducing a series of sequential and mandatory steps before being able to get to kick-off. We are not talking about any real innovation introduced, however it is yet another step towards simplifying the game interface, although - undoubtedly - someone could complain about having to make at least 4.5 clicks before being able to get to the moment of the initial whistle. Even if it's the summer friendly against Roncobilaccio. Once we arrive on the pitch, very little will have changed, if not for an enrichment of the comments and game actions and for the fact that - finally - we will be able to make changes of player and tactics in real time, during the course of the match, thanks even in the presence of a mini-screen showing the progress of the meeting. It is difficult to make judgments on the results of the matches here, the idea we have is that - while remaining the best engine on the market - the average results are still too rich in goals and that it is more ~difficult~ than expected to draw. After all, given the complexity of the data and the innumerable conditions of use, we imagine that radically changing the match engine could be an extremely risky operation with possible, extremely unpredictable consequences. We therefore await with curiosity that this restyling proves to be fundamental for the justification of a new chapter in the series. Also given the ever-increasing television vocation of the title, we wouldn't mind perhaps seeing the highlights of the championship matches no longer with the usual 2D view but with a renewed graphics engine, capable of definitively emulating Domenica Sportiva. But it really is the proverbial needle in the haystack, because finding aspects that can really be improved in this latest chapter of Football Manager is increasingly becoming a pure exercise in style. loading and saving have now been significantly speeded up Field coaches Certainly, if the graphic aspect appears sparse but sufficient for the intent, the audio represents a real sore point of the entire production. For example, the possibility of using an internal MP3 player does not yet exist and - above all - the chants and sound effects that accompany the matches are monotonous, so sparse that sometimes they will beannoying. Speaking of the game engine, finally one of the last walls of the series seems to have been knocked down: loading and saving have now been considerably speeded up, so much so that they appear almost instantaneous and even the processing pauses between one turn and another seem to be been further decreased. These elements, combined with being able to decide the size of the database and the level of detail, also allow those who don't have a particularly powerful PC to be able to customize the gaming experience to the fullest. PC - System Requirements Note how the same disk can be installed both with Windows and Apple systems (~miracles~ of Java technology). Thanks to the possibility of selecting the level of detail of the simulation, by selecting a single nation and a couple of leagues, the minimum requirements appear plausible. As more leagues are selected, RAM and processor will be of great importance. Depending on the analysis of the system during setup, the program itself will suggest the recommended settings. PC Minimum Requirements Processor 1.2 GHz 256 MB RAM Sound Card compatible with DirectX 8.1 Windows XP/Vista 1024x768 32bit display 750MB HD space Minimum Requirements Macintosh Processor Power PC - G4 1.2 GHz or Intel Core Duo 1.8 GHz 256 MB RAM Mac OS 10.3.9 1024x768 32bit display 750MB HD space Recommended PC Requirements 2.2 GHz Processor 1 GB RAM Recommended Macintosh Requirements Power PC G5 2 GHz or Intel Core Duo 2 GHz processor Mac OS 10.4.9 256 MB RAM Comment Football Manager 2008 is confirmed as an excellent title, capable of satisfying all fans. Of course, if we want to be picky, this last chapter seems to have wanted to stop a little on the ~surface~. In fact, if we exclude the updated database and little else, all the innovations made look more at form than at substance. However, the changes are numerous and concern almost all sections of the game, if it is true that power is nothing without control, Football Manager 2008 stands out for making the game interface even more malleable and direct for the purposes of management of the impressive amount of data that can be managed at any time. For the rest, the feeling of the game remains unchanged. The ~yet another round~ syndrome is getting stronger and - above all - all the aspects of football simulated by this title could play their own game. Whether you enjoy discovering young talent in teams from lower leagues, or you prefer to dedicate yourself to polishing the fine balance of athletic training rather than devising game schemes to be applied during matches, Football Manager will never disappoint you. It is not an epochal turning point, but yet another step towards perfection. Pros Still the best around Unparalleled level of detail Virtually flawless Cons Those waiting for an updated match engine will be disappointed Once installed on your system, there will hardly be time left to devote to other titles", "date": "2007-10-24", "grade": null}
