Many players have focused on the poor state of the PC version plagued by cheaters and practically unplayable due to a user base that, week after week, has dwindled to truly reduced figures. Others have continued to complain about the general instability of the servers that periodically seem subject to long moments of offline or are the scene of numerous bugs that Massive Entertainment is still struggling to fix. At the same time, however, no one can deny that the developer has supported his jewel with great constancy and sacrifice which, in the opinion of the writer, is among the most underrated third-person shooters of this last generation. The stream of patches has been constant and often resolving, at least on consoles, and the addition of new content, albeit contested on multiple occasions - how can we not forget the chaos that followed the release of Missing in Action, the first foray - frequently offered something to do for even the hungriest gamers. New York Underground fits into this scenario, the first real paid premium DLC that Season Pass holders found themselves promptly installed a few days ago and that everyone else must buy from the various stores for 14.99. All except PlayStation 4 owners who, for a matter of time exclusives, will have to wait until August 2 to be able to download and install it. But before going into the details of this substantial update, we can immediately tell you that Ubisoft seems to have taken the right path. Yes it is true, some problems now seem to have been grafted into the game structure but between the new random mission generation system, the new equipment, the adjustments to the difficulty and the Dark Zone and the original incursion, the substance is really all there . And for all palates. New York Underground is a DLC that we would like to recommend to all owners of The Division First the frills The main novelty of the DLC are obviously the dungeons that give the add-on its title. To all intents and purposes, it is a question of tunnels, abandoned underground stations, underground construction sites, foundations of skyscrapers and more generally of an intricate system of passages and intersections, all rigorously indoors and with a labyrinthine flavour. To access this maze of corridors it is necessary to go through a new social hub, the terminal, placed at the back of your base of operations, with access immediately next to the seller of the rewards to be redeemed. Within this environment there are a couple of new vendors for very high-level weapons and equipment that can be purchased with Phoenix credits, the new non-player characters that allow access to the daily and weekly tasks introduced with the previous 1.2, but above all the entrance to the room that contains the table for planning operations and the subway station that allows you to embark and reach the mission after setting it. Precisely this last element is obviously the beating heart of New York Underground and branches out into a whole series of innovations involving the basic structure of The Division. First of all there is the new underground level (with the cap set at 40) which joins the main one and the one relating to the Dark Zone and which allows you to unlock a series of bonuses and malus relating to the operations we want to carry out and above all to put the hands on the unreleased equipment included in this DLC. And then there are the operations: these are missions created on the fly in a procedural and completely random way and which we can configure and activate in just a few seconds in the new hub. The result is an experience dedicated to replayability given that, however basic it is always and only a matter of killing enemies or, at the very least, defending someone or something, the geography of the scenario and the composition of the opponents change continuously. During the configuration phase we will be able to choose one of the four difficulty levels, carry out matchmaking on the fly and activate up to five different perks, called directives, which increase the difficulty of the mission and its reward in experience. These directives activate a series of disadvantages for the player (the disappearance of the mini-map, the loss of the ammunition left in the magazine when reloading a weapon and so on) which reminded us very closely of the skulls of Halo but which can only be enabled by leveling up in the underground rank and spending a currency that can be collected by carrying out the operations themselves. It is also possible coLink up to three consecutive missions together, greatly extending our stay in the dungeons and gaining more experience. The system is really elementary to master and works extremely well, also thanks to the excellent matchmaking system, allowing the player to calibrate his involvement based on the time he has available and giving him the opportunity to always bring home some rewards. Each operation ends with a boss and a container to open and, by leveling up, you earn an additional personal chest that can be unpacked in the inventory and allows you to receive a piece of equipment consistent with our character's level. Precisely on the armor and weapons front, it is important to point out that the new score is now set at 268 and 229 respectively, but the most interesting thing and which highlights Massive's great interest in player feedback is that through New York Underground, The Division returns to having its two souls PvE and PvP better balanced where until a few weeks ago (before the introduction of 1.2), the passage in the Dark Zone was practically mandatory if you wanted to equip your avatar in the best way before facing the raids. However, it is equally important to point out that the whole new area has evidently been designed for team play in teams given that the average difficulty of the dungeons is so high as to make it, in the opinion of the writer, extremely difficult to face them alone, even for lower difficulty levels. We will not go further on the weapons and the five brand new sets but suffice it to say that there is truly an abundance of unpublished loot. And of course, PvP enthusiasts will also get their money's worth with the addition of the new Dark Zone Headbands that offer a more than desirable challenge for players above gear level 231. then the substance To further meet the desire for PvE of the many players who appreciate the cooperative component against the computer of The Division and justify the availability of a new high-level loot, the new heroic difficulty level was introduced with patch 1.3, immediately available for all owners even of the base game. It will therefore be essential to face the main missions, the raids already available and the brand new operations with a very close-knit and well-equipped team to aim for top-level equipment. As for The Dragon's Lair, the new raid introduced with New York Underground, we will have to wait until next week to be able to face it in heroic mode. And, since we've started talking about it, it's time to focus precisely on this important new content because it well represents Massive's desire to satisfy its user base. While remaining far from the best experiences seen in Destiny, there is no doubt that this raid marks an important detachment from the previous two, Missing in Action and Clear Sky, due to the addition of some dynamics that finally force players to dialogue and cooperate, momentarily leaving aside managing constant waves of enemies. Let it be clear that we are not dealing with anything revolutionary but this is certainly the first step in the right direction. The raid can conceptually be divided into two parts: a very action-packed first section where the team has to limit itself to managing numerous groups of Purifiers until it reaches an open section controlled by four armored soldiers of the faction. We can consider them intermediate bosses with lots of loot in tow. Once this area has been cleared, we will be able to enter the most original component of the challenge: an indoor section where our goal will be to destroy a truck equipped with a huge flamethrower. The peculiarity of this section, which only at first superficial glance can recall the encounter of Missing in Action being equally set indoors, with an indestructible vehicle with normal weapons and the constant presence of enemies, is the dynamic that allows us to defeat the boss. The team's goal is to move a huge refrigerated tank from the bottom of the large room to the top of the truck and then make it fall. To do this, four pairs of buttons located on opposite sides of the room must be pressed simultaneously. And when we say ~simultaneously~ we mean at the same, precise moment: an operation that forces players to dialogue in order to synchronize and to activate a form of cooperation that goes far beyond simply healing each other and targeting the same enemy. Isclear that we cannot cry out for a miracle and, once the practice has been digested, it will become quite automatic to move in unison but, considering the gameplay of the previous two incursions, it is obvious that this variation on the theme bodes well for what can be introduced with the future DLCs. Too bad, at this point, for the constant instability of the servers which made us struggle a lot in completing this challenge and the new operations.", "date": "2016-07-01", "grade": "8.0"}
