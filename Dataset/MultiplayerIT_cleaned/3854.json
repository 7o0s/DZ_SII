{"name": "The Raven Remastered", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-raven-remastered-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "In early 2013 King Art Games published on Steam, with the support of The Adventure Company, the first episode of a completely single player investigative adventure known as The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief; the next two installments would arrive a few months later, thus completing an adventure clearly inspired by the best works of Agatha Christie, the British writer and playwright well known throughout the world for her crime novels. Last summer THQ Nordic proposed a revised and corrected (remastered) version of the game, known as The Raven Remastered, on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC: now it's also the turn of porting to Nintendo Switch, because clearly the catchment area of the hybrid console is constantly increasing and for many players it is a practically new title. After all, Nintendo Switch is a console already full of platformers, fighting games, RPGs, but there aren't many investigative adventures like The Raven Remastered: in our review, we explain why you should give its return a chance. Plot It is 1964 and the Orient Express is crossing Switzerland carrying a precious cargo: one of the two rubies known as the Eyes of the Sphinx. The planned destination is Cairo, where he will be the protagonist of a prestigious exhibition known worldwide. The other ruby was unfortunately stolen a few days earlier from the British Museum in London by a particularly famous, skilled and elusive criminal known as Il Corvo; among other things, a Corvo revived, since his bitterest enemy, Inspector Legrand, had shot him dead a few years earlier, after having surprised him at the crime scene. But the protagonist of The Raven Remastered is not an important personality of the caliber of the Raven or Inspector Legrand, but a nice middle-aged Swiss police officer, Anton Jakob Zellner. The narration begins with Zellner aboard the Orient Express, in the company of Inspector Legrand (not inclined to make friends and accept his collaboration): will the precious ruby be able to arrive in Cairo safe and sound? Or will the Raven once again manage to elude any security? Captivating narration and characterization are the two spearheads of The Raven Remastered, two aspects that could allow anyone to buy the remastered version of The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief neglecting any other more neglected or less successful detail, especially on the technical side. Zellner is a figure inspired by Agatha Christie's Poirot, a detective who is not only sympathetic but also very credible, who immediately allows the player to fully identify himself: he has no experience as a detective, but possesses considerable acumen, a lot of perspicacity and a trained logical spirit -deductive thanks also to the reading of numerous mystery novels, mentioned several times during the game. The Raven Remastered is in fact, among other things, a great and successful reference to a precise literary and cinematographic genre: that of the detective story, which through a slow beginning, an increasingly pressing progression based on evidence and investigations and a conclusion partially dramatic (but often with a happy ending) wants to bring the reader / viewer to the resolution of a single case. The satisfaction that derives from it, after having succeeded without external help, is truly remarkable. Gameplay In the first part of the review we told you a little about the ideas, themes and progression behind The Raven Remastered, now it's time to say a few more words about the gameplay: what exactly should the player do? In the most classic of point and click productions designed and developed for PC, the player controls Zellner within various game scenarios and environments, interacting with everything available: objects, other characters, or your own inventory. In the early stages of the game, for example, we find ourselves inside the various compartments of the Orient Express and have the opportunity to get to know the other characters present (a baroness, a Swiss doctor, Legrand, a violinist with alcoholism problems, and many others): to continue and move to the ~next level~, thus carrying out our investigations, it will be necessary to listen to them, ask them questions (preset and not at crossroads), try to solve their problems. The characterization of the characters makes them very believable and the well-made English-language dubbing (now with Italian subtitles) makes it extremely pleasant to listen to their speeches, which are never banal and to which attention must always be paid due to useful details that could sooncome back in our favor. By collecting certain objects scattered almost everywhere, Zellner can also combine them within his inventory in a very ingenious way: for example, a scissor used with a pencil could get you some graphite, perhaps useful in the 60s to discover the presence of fingerprints on a train window. Naturally, The Raven Remastered also has its weak points, and proves to be uncertain especially in the technical and graphic sector: the restoration work achieved its goal with dignity, but with some obvious sacrifices, perhaps due to limited economic resources. The facial expressions and expressions of the characters, for example, have something awkward and not very credible; furthermore, the animations of the protagonist and the supporting characters aren't exactly the best places to look for the skills of the programmers. Even some movement of the protagonist within the scenarios occasionally proves to be awkward, and it is certainly not the fault of his age close to retirement; we also noticed some graphic glitches, however never too annoying. On the other hand, the transition films are bad and completely forgettable, all remaining identical to how they were six years ago: the result is an evident graining effect, above all thanks to the merciless comparison with the new game graphics brought to 1080p.", "date": "2019-01-21", "grade": "8.0"}
