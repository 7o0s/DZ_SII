{"name": "The Quarry", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-quarry-recensione.html", "text": "When you make a name for yourself with a certain work, it's a given that your audience remembers you above all for that work and that they look for it in everything you do. It is an obsessive compulsive attitude towards entertainment, typical of our age, which gives great security to the public, therefore apparently inevitable, barring major historical and social upheavals. Thus each production of Supermassive Games has been compared with that Until Dawn aroused a lot of interest in horror fans, so much so that the disappointment for the lack of a real sequel created by the English team has become increasingly evident over the years. But here we are now, because we finally have that Until Dawn 2 that everyone wanted, as we will see in The Quarry review. Until Dawn 2 The Quarry is very cool, technically In fact, if we changed the title to the game and called it that way it would be not only appropriate, but almost legitimate, given the events it tells and how it tells them (net of a greater general ease). The 10-hour long story of The Quarry takes place over one night and sees a group of teenagers struggling to survive the supernatural forces that infest the charming children's campsite of Hackett's Quarry. The season is over, the little ones have returned to their homes and their tutors, Kaitlyn, Abi, Emma, Jacob, Nick, Ryan and Dylan, are packing their bags to leave too, prompted by an increasingly anxious Chris Hackett, the camp manager, who can't wait for them to disappear. Except that one of the boys, motivated by the typical love impulse, decides to sabotage the return to civilization in order to be able to stay at least one more night in the campsite, so that he can try again with the girl of his dreams. The prospect that the seven don't leave immediately sends Chris into a rage, who leaves to look for a solution, advising the seven to lock themselves in the cabin and not to go out. Naturally, our men do exactly the opposite of what they have been ordered to do, thinking they are in no danger. Unfortunately for them they will regret it bitterly. Will they be able to survive until dawn? We won't give you any more details on the story, since it's kind of the fulcrum of the whole experience, but it's fair to discuss what the general narrative structure of The Quarry is. Already by reading the plot and by the references to Until Dawn you will have understood that we are dealing with a horror of the slasher genre (the director of the game compares it to Scream), with teenagers isolated from the rest of the world who face mysterious assassins, trying to bring skin at home. The supernatural element is introduced during the prologue, of which Supermassive has released a full video before launch, in which we can see two tutors come to a bad end as they try to reach the campsite. So the adventure starts slowly, introducing the spectator, pardon the player, to the characters and their relationships in about two and a half hours of preparation for the party, to then begin the macabre dance that will decide everyone's fate. Teenagers who find themselves alone in the fight against evil Note the presence of a stellar cast of actors, starting with David Arquette (Scream), who plays Chris, passing through Lance Henriksen, who boasts an impressive amount of roles in the horror genre (House 7, to name one at random) , up to the boys, played by the likes of Ariel Winter, Siobhan Williams and Justice Smith. In short, we are faced with a large-scale production, which aims very much to interest those who live on bread and juvenile horror films, so much so that the very tones of the screenplay are extremely flat on the genre. Impending tragedy yes, but jokes can never be missing, even when you're about to die. Interactive movie Some characters are successful The Quarry is a naked and raw interactive film with the story proceeding by crossroads, in which every choice made by the player involves changes to the plot, sometimes imperceptible, other times more blatant, but always manifest in the destiny of the protagonists. In reality there would be debate about the nature of these crossroads, managed in a very classic way, despite the fact that there are a large number of them. So the player is faced with situations whose outcome he cannot know in advance, which often lead to unexpected and unpredictable events, which can even lead to his death. The game specifies that there are no right or wrong choices and that in essence you should just enjoy the story, but in reality this is not exactly the case. Of course, you can enjoy the game and accept what happens without batting an eye, but it is the game system itself that generatesrchize the validity of branches based on the effects they have on the characters. Haven't we already seen each other in another horror film? Incidentally, when the latter die, it is made clear that they have made mistakes, so much so that in many cases it is possible to easily reconstruct where to go and act to change the situation, because the basic goal is to make as many young people as possible survive , with the perfect match that sees them all emerge unscathed from history. Precisely for this reason the player is led to think functionally about his decisions, that is, he evaluates them in relation to the achievement of the objectives, certainly not as simple narrative turns. It should also be added that sometimes the consequences of choices made in very distant chapters are paid, which in any case require you to redo most of the game to change your choices (the possibility of not skipping the movies is very penalizing, in this sense). At that point it is better to accept the story as it comes and, perhaps, play it all over again to unlock the alternative paths. In an era in which there have been many experiments on the indie scene on how to break this type of management of narrative crossroads in video games (or how to question them), it is a bit strange to see them used in such a conservative way by a production like this big. But let's imagine that Supermassive's goal was basically nothing more than to package a good TV series, certainly not to revolutionize the genre. Much more movies than video games Some landscapes are very beautiful The direct interactions between the characters and the scenarios are few and have a purely narrative function. In reality they are almost superfluous in the economy of the gameplay, so much so that they can be deactivated without major regrets, by selecting the cinematic mode to simply follow the story, as if we were faced with a television series. Note that cinematic mode is selectable even if you have started a game in interactive mode. The choice made by Supermassive in this sense is very clear, so much so that each chapter that makes up the adventure has a duration similar to the others, as if we were dealing with episodes of a TV series, rather than a system for structuring a video game narrative. The ending itself leaves the doors open to further developments of the story, to the point that, during the end credits, we thought of a possible season 2 of The Quarry instead of a sequel, a slip that alone should make it clear how to ends up living the entire game. Interactions are few and far between After all, as mentioned, the interactions are really reduced to the bone: the crossroads to follow are chosen; some closed scenarios are explored by making the selected character reach the always well-highlighted points of interest (net of some problems with the camera, which manifests itself above all when using a controller); from time to time you collect some objects, but don't expect a real inventory: in case something is needed during a scene, it will be used automatically or you will be given the opportunity to use it in a narrative branch. In the most excited sequences there are also the classic quick time events, which require you to press keys at the right time, whether they involve action or movement. In case you are hunted by some creature, the game can also ask us to make the character on stage hold his breath, to make him believe he is dead, until the danger has passed. Some scenes are suggestive Also there are times when it is possible to shoot. Here too, never believe that you are faced with a kind of masked FPS, because these are narratively well-contextualized sequences, in which you aim by pointing the torch from a third-person view. The shooting itself sometimes doesn't produce the intended results, but it's an actual story action. Don't even expect to go around looking for weapons and ammunition in the classic survival horror way, because you were definitely in the wrong game. Everything here is in the service of the story. An adventure to replay The actors were scanned perfectly For the rest, the player can consult the register where all the clues found on the field are collected, but just to try to summarize what is happening and get some clarification on the mythology built by the authors. The only objects that have a real playful function are the tarot cards, very sparingly hidden in the various chapters, which are used during the interludes to predict moments of the characters' future. Basically they are suggestions for the player given by a disturbing fortune teller chbeloved Eliza (do you know the Curator of The Dark Pictures and Dr. Hill of Until Dawn?), which serve to make people understand how to behave in some key scenes in order not to let a given character die. As mentioned, The Quarry is perfectly aware of what he wants to be and that's why he invests all of himself in narrative design and in trying to give the player the desired experience. So everything is customizable, from the difficulty of the quick time events, to the presence or absence of certain interactions. In cinematic mode it is also possible to give general indications on how you want the events to unfold in order to limit direct interventions during the story to a minimum. To say, Supermassive is so keen not to frustrate anyone that it has also provided for the possibility of rewinding some sequences three times, in case of an error (it must be said that it is a feature that is unlocked after finishing the game at least once). Does the main artwork of the game remind you of anything? In conclusion, the playful fulcrum is in the system of choices, which not only manages to make the story unique, but implies the possibility of replaying the entire adventure several times, to see all the possible turns, provided that it is liked that it has been told. Yes, because The Quarry's real problem lies precisely in what it tells. As already mentioned, the characters are living stereotypes straight out of genre films. Some dialogues are flat, while the acting of the virtual actors, although sometimes astonishing in strictly technological terms, in others denounces a certain detachment from the lived situation, probably due to the difficulty of modulating certain expressions, which we imagine would have required much more development time . Thus we find ourselves in very tense scenes with characters who seem to express very different emotions from those that would be more appropriate, almost as if they were a parody of themselves, also thanks to the director's lingering on close-ups, with editing cuts that are sometimes wrong the connections of the dialogues. Some dialogues aren't great, but in general they work Plus there's the issue of fear: frankly The Quarry does very little of it. The fact that all the moments of tension are narratively contextualized and that therefore there is no real confrontation with the unknown, but only an almost passive fruition of the tension, makes it difficult to be caught unprepared. The story itself resorts to several such clichs, so much so that some moments become very recognizable, which of them would like to be scary. The very mechanics of holding your breath don't work very well, because it's clear right away that either a window of escape will open, or your breath will run out and we'll be dead. So it just becomes a matter of timing to find the right moment to escape. Conclusions Unsettling That said, we don't want to sound too critical of The Quarry. In fact, those who loved Until Dawn and want to play Until Dawn 2 may love it. Technically we are dealing with an excellent title, which shows graphics that at times border on photorealism. The character models are all very accurate (vital for a story that thrives on close-ups), the animations are excellent and the various graphic resources used to build the scenarios are ultra-detailed, so as to create credible and very beautiful environments to look at. at least when you can use the controller to look around. The lighting system also works really well and allowed for a very tense and convincing overall atmosphere. In short, if you like the idea of experiencing a Scream-like horror with the possibility of influencing the progress of the story, then The Quarry is your game. Far from the survival horrors a la Resident Evil and from the adventures a la Syberia: The World Before, it is an experience that brings the video game very close to the television series, so much so that we would also see it well as a crossroads series on Netflix and the like.", "date": "2022-06-10", "grade": "7.5"}
