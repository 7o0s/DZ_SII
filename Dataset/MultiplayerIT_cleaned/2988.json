{"name": "Destroy All Humans!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/destroy-all-humans-recensione-remake.html", "text": "Who does not remember Destroy All Humans! it is because he evidently lived the 2000s of gaming in the wrong way. One of the main exponents of experimentation, when video games didn't cost a trillion dollars and it was possible to produce AAA honestly and sustainably. Precisely during that splendid period, among the various cults that the medium gave us, a place of honor was certainly held by Crypto and his conquest of planet Earth. Some fifteen years later and thanks to that good Samaritan that is THQ Nordic, we are finally able to go back to ~analyzing~ conservative Americans of the 1950s. For this review of Destroy All Humans! we therefore got off the pedestal of today's great production, we forgot how tragic it has become to experiment and we lost ourselves solely and exclusively in the fun of a spot-on and perfect remake for this sad and sultry July. All at an extraordinarily welcome budget price. I am Crypto-137 and the Earth is now ours The plot of Destroy All Humans starts from the most iconic of the foundations of Hollywood cinema, made up of alien invasions and conservatism, propaganda and the fight against communism, all filled with a dose of irony that gives the title another plus point. We play Crypto-137, an alien traveling from the planet Furon with the aim of conquering the Earth and recovering from humans the root of his DNA, instilled in us thousands of years before. Undecided on the entity of the sentient form of the planet, divided between the ~muuu~ of a cow and the ridiculous whimpering of a farmer from the hinterland, the slavery of the human being passes through about twenty abundant missions and a lot of devastation, be it at land or aboard his own flying saucer. It would clearly be a pretext to say that Destroy All Humans! can give you important narrative moments, but it is equally true that the will of the title is only to win your laughter and exaggerate as much as possible, taking to the extreme the stereotype of a 50s America lost between the prom queens and the war on the communist reds. In this sense, the newspaper clippings at the end of each mission, caricatured and misleading, can be the emblem of an ironic but at the same time accusing narrative of a way of making information and propaganda that tends to hide the truth to tell what is most people hope to hear, riding the fashion of the moment. During the scarce ten hours necessary to conclude the campaign you will be able to go around six different maps, from one end of America to the other, until you find yourself in front of the House Bianca and the iconic Lincoln statue. Between a village fair, a fake Area 51 and similar Men in Black called Majestic, Destroy All Humans will be able to fill your time in the best way: having fun. Sorry if it's too little! Analyze and Disaggregate We are in the era of remakes, there is no rain on this. And among the many titles that are offered to us again, it seems strange to see one that does not aim for great graphics and which, already at its original release, could count almost exclusively on a brilliant idea and a very important underlying fun. Destroy All Humans is a hymn to the purest destruction, the one so dear to the famous ~juggle~ of the GTA, but declined behind the stereotype of an alien invasion and therefore even more apt. During the twenty abundant missions that you will face, you you will never find yourself changing the pattern of action too much. The goal always remains to recover as much human DNA as possible, while trying to foil the plans of the army and the mysterious Majestic. To do this we will have the destructive firepower of Crypto at our disposal, who will be able to count on both his innate abilities and a devastating arsenal, on foot as on board his flying saucer. Whether you shoot with the Zip-o-matic, Disruptor, Analyzer or Sonic Wave, the result will always be to destroy and eventually recover furon DNA. Although everything was already enough to have fun as we did fifteen years ago, the team that worked on this remake has seen fit to modernize some aspects and deepen others, giving even more value to the work done. The years are making themselves felt on the weight of such backward titles and for this reason it was decided to greatly streamline some elements that would have been cumbersome. Where it was necessary to switch manually every time you wanted to use a weapon or a specific skill, now each key on the pad is used properly to avoid this confusion, even mapping the directional arrows with Crypto's psychic powers. Through the backbones it is instead possible to apPlay the classic weapon wheel and choose which one to use to carry out your invasion. Also from the point of view of the use of some skills, we have tried to eliminate frustration, without ruining the design of the original. Now when you take human form you can still pick up items and jump, thus avoiding having to change shape every time. You also no longer have to search around for ammo of any kind. With the simple press of a button it will be possible to transform the smallest objects into instruments of death, thus easing the search for magazines for the disruptor and other weapons. As if that weren't enough, the movement has also been revised, with the addition of a button responsible for shooting which, if held down, allows us to generate a skateboard under our feet and float for a few seconds. All these changes, and also others that we prefer to let you discover, they go hand in hand with the addition of optional objectives of the missions and an immoderate increase in the upgrades that can be carried out. If in the original there were only eighteen upgrades, here we have even reached sixty-six, all of which can be purchased by continuing in the campaign and accumulating tons of DNA. On the other hand, this remains the fulcrum of the fun, forgetting our main task every now and then and descending with the flying saucer on one of the freely explorable maps, so as to kick off hilarious and, at times, even challenging clashes. Between missions of destruction aboard the flying saucer and absurd requests such as using telekinesis to throw radioactive cows into the lake, Destroy All Humans! it will be able to entertain you constantly, as long as you still know how to accept unpretentious moments of leisure and anchored to a simple and immediate gameplay, without too many frills. There are obviously some critical issues, which are the same as fifteen years ago. The areas that can be explored are far too few and everything can obviously be repetitive, there is no doubt. On the other hand we are talking about a game with many springs on its shoulders and for which the team has struggled to find alternative solutions and review some aspects. The truth is that expecting a flawless masterpiece would be wrong from the outset, ruining an experience that instead makes immediacy its strength, today as then. Is it also a good remake? Time passes for everyone and Destroy All Humans has also gotten a nice facelift, just like the American middle class that mocks so much during the entire course of the campaign. This remake does not make a miracle as regards the aesthetic aspect, some textures are still today in very low resolution and the polygonal count and the AI are certainly not top of the class. It is true that those who still know how to have fun with a title like this leave these details aside and at least enjoy the total reconstruction of the models and environments, which allow Destroy All Humans! to put on the screen a damned exhilarating glossy 50s America. As for the sound, it is useless to expect miracles. The original dubbing is of average workmanship, as are the effects, except for a few sporadic cases that have been particularly taken care of. The reality is that while you're playing Destroy All Humans you won't give a damn about how beautiful the voices of the protagonists are, because you'll already be thinking about the next brain to extract and accumulate.", "date": "2020-07-27", "grade": "8.0"}
