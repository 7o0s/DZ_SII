{"name": "Adventure Pinball", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/adventure-pinball.html", "text": "Butit reminds me of something For the uninitiated, the graphic engine chosen for the Adventure Pinball here is that of Unreal Tournament, the masterpiece of Epic Megagames (now sold at the crazy price of 19,900 lire, DVD package) which is still very popular all over the world today. by virtue of a decidedly vast gaming community. After you have installed it (don't worry, less than 150 mb of installation!!!), as usual, the setup program will proceed to configure the graphic settings in the best possible way in proportion to your machine. The minimum system requirements include a P2 266 mhz, 32 bm of ram, a 4 mb non-accelerated video card (stop laughing!!!) and the CD contains Directx 8, indispensable for the correct functioning of the package. Digital Extremes recommends a P2 400 with 128 mb of ram and a 16 mb accelerated video card compatible with 3dfx Glide or Direct 3d from Microsoft, recommended configuration to play more than worthily and a P3 700, 128 mb of ram and a video card 32 mb to play it in a divine way (yes, the disease called Black And White affected me too); with my P3 500 (still for a few weeks), 256 mb of ram and 32 mb GeForce DDR from Creative I played at maximum detail at 1024x768x32 with more than good fluidity (between 26 and 30 fps), rarely undermined by a few snaps. The programmers have inserted a very large number of textures, given that the tables at our disposal are nine and each of them has various sub-tables all to be discovered; the setting chosen is that of prehistory and the unfortunate person on duty is Ooga, a caveman who will really need our ability with balls (er..^_^'): on more than one occasion he will have to deal with currents of lava, angry tyrannosaurs, waterfalls and only our skill with pinball machines can get him out of trouble or open new ways out for him. Graphically we can therefore consider ourselves satisfied both for the quality of the graphics and for the quantity of polygons and textures on the screen, without forgetting some delicacies such as the excellent flow of water (historical strong point of the Unreal engine), the puffing of a volcano or the transparency effects inserted here and there in the various pinball machines. As for the sound side, I hope you have (at least) a Sound Blaster Live 1024 with Cambridge Four Point Surround to enjoy the magnificence of the environmental audio, represented there with absolute excellence: it is truly magnificent to hear the flow of the waters on your left, on the other hand your ball bouncing everywhere, guaranteeing a different sound depending on the point of contact and the position of your head, practically the same sonic magnificence of Unreal Tournament and its ~ancestor~. pinball mania!!! We talked about nine pinball machines, each of them with more than one secret to discover, bonuses or whole new areas, but also about the help we have to give to the caveman Ooga; Are you wondering what does this have to do with a pinball machine? The answer lies in the most important game mode of Adventure Pinball, the story mode, on the other hand, even if you wanted to try the tables one by one, you would notice that the vast majority of the latter are beautiful and inaccessible, so willy-nilly you will have to hand, complete the objectives that will gradually help Ooga to survive as long as possible and find his way out of the level, until you have successfully completed all the tables present in this little Digital Extremes gem. Once this is done, you will have nine excellent pinball tables all to yourself and if Pro Pinball Big Race Usa already ensured incomparable fun with a single table, what should we say now of these nine tables, one more beautiful and varied than the other, all almost perfect? Well, the answer is simple: more maps, opss, tables; think about it, how many extra maps are there for Unreal and Unreal Tournament? An unimaginable number, the same (or slightly less) that the undersigned expects from the gaming community that will certainly be formed, after all, there are now many of the makers of extra maps for Unreal and Unreal Tournament so I recommend that you already keep d Keep an eye on the game's homepage (https://www.pinball.ea.com/ ) for future downloads. Conclusions: must have game! I could end this review by saying that anyone who loves pinball machines must ABSOLUTELY buy Adventure Pinball but it's good to make a brief summary of the features of this title for those who don't like them (the world is beautiful because it's varied, isn't it?): excellent graphics (overtested, one might say), excellent ambient sound, sky-high fun and excellent playability (to surpassand record after record you will spend the night, for the usual ~last game and then that's it~), supported by a longevity never seen for a pinball game without forgetting that the undersigned is deliberately neglecting the possibility of exponentially increasing the longevity of the game with future tables extra, basing all its praise on what you find in the DVD package of this little masterpiece. And the arcades were deserted Short nostalgic intro In recent years, since consoles and computers have achieved a considerable evolution in terms of technical performance, arcades, which have always been crowded by hardcore gamers, have experienced a serious crisis and, before them, the pinball machine market. If up to a dozen years ago it was not improbable to find some nice pinball machines between a platform and a fighting game (generally from Bally Midway or Data East, to name the latest big ones in this sector), now finding a pinball machine (even from some year ago) is like playing a lottery game, given the changed situation of the so-called arcade centres. It could be said that as the coin-op, gradually evolving, has supplanted the classic pinball machine, in the same way the home video game has surpassed its arcade ~cousin~ in terms of use and popularity, leading to an inevitable crisis in the sector and inducing operators to insert more and more billiard tables and table football alongside coin-ops whose probability of success, in case of conversion, for the home market is decidedly slim (any reference to Walk The Dog by Sega, by, errr, dog sitter, it's purely intended). So what can a pinball enthusiast do? Forget the good old days? Forgetting those magnificent early 80s pinball machines, for example the one whose theme was a game of bowling or the western one? Replace Ken Masters' bgm from Street Fighter 2 in the homonymous (and fantastic) pinball machine? Remove from collective memory the Batman board, the best example of a film tie-in for the sector concerned in this paragraph? No sirs! By virtue of the aforementioned power of current gaming machines, both consoles and our beloved PC, every now and then some nice pinball machines pop up with which to delight in breaking the record signed just now with great joy!!! Having had a PC for almost 2 years, the only pinball machine (worthy of mention here) I tested on a computer was Pro Pinball Big Race Usa by Empire, an excellent pinball machine with a taxi driver theme (Hit Maker, creators of Crazy Taxy and its imminent sequels for sure they loved it madly ^_^), penalized however by a single table however magnificently well implemented. After the release of the latter in the Halifax budget series, this Adventure Pinball: Forgotten Island, created by Digital Extremes and distributed by Electronic Arts, sneaks up on the horizon (apart from the demo that I recommend downloading from our files area). who, as usual, smelled something appetizing", "date": "2001-05-09", "grade": null}
