{"name": "Rogue Trooper - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rogue-trooper-recensione.html", "text": "There in the smurf village In truth, Rogue Trooper has very little to do with the Smurfs (you didn't realize that, did you?), except that you'll be driving a blue dude and both start as comics. As Rogue, a member of the aforementioned G.I., you will have to be able to find out who caused your troop to be massacred by revealing their assault plan. In a world (Nu-Earth) in which two factions (the North and the South) have been at war since time immemorial, you will have to be able to extricate yourself from various rather ~fiery~ situations until you get to the bare truth at the end of the thirteen game levels (and epic music with a lot of falsetto chorus would be good here... oh well, it's not a fantasy game and it's better to leave it alone). But you won't be alone in your suicide mission; in fact, you will always have with you three fellow soldiers from whom you extracted the biochips from the dying bodies: Gunnar, mounted on the rifle (helps aiming), Bagman, mounted on the backpack (allows you to carry and generate ammunition and creates new upgrades) and, finally, Helm , mounted on the helmet, (allows you to tamper with the electronic safety systems). In addition to them, from time to time, you will be joined by friendly characters who will help you in some sections. Mediogame Rogue Trooper is a solid third-person action game with a Tomb Raider-style view. The first start delivers a perception that accompanies the player throughout the course of the adventure: that of asepticity. There's nothing wrong with the game, but... On a graphic level we are dealing with a good product if we consider the console versions and only sufficient if we consider the PC version. The scenarios have a good amount of detail (especially the city ones which are the best) and the character models are really well done, the tanks a little subdued, which look like cardboard boxes with two turrets stuck on top. Fortunately, they meet little (only a handful of times) and you don't pay too much attention to them, taken as you are by having to dodge enemy blows. The best textures are those of the PC version (obviously) even if something more could have been done in terms of models, so as not to make those who own the most pumped computers feel too much the weight of the now old-generation consoles. Cutscenes are made with the game's graphics engine and are generally decent in quality. Too bad that not much has been done to endow everything with a ~strong~ style as the transposition from the comic would have deserved; a lot of substance is missing from what appears to be a work carried out with great competence and nothing more. Above all, the city levels could have been made better in terms of characterization in order to try to give them a touch of uniqueness that, as they are, they are unable to have. the first start delivers a perception that accompanies the player throughout the course of the adventure: that of asepticity Mediogame As tradition has it by now, the first level also acts as a tutorial: we will thus learn to move, shoot, use cover, change weapons, use sniper mode, collect scrap, build upgrades and ammunition plus all the others elements that make up the gameplay which, overall, is quite rich. The control system is the now canonical one for the genre and can be quickly mastered. It doesn't take much to enter the game which, thanks to its original source of derivation, manages to be ~narrative~ even in the action phases (thanks above all to the interventions of the three biochips mounted on the equipment which do not spare themselves from constantly making jokes and give suggestions on what to do). Mediogame There are numerous subgames present that break the main action scheme. Often and willingly, in fact, it will be necessary to use anti-aircraft guns, heavy machine guns and other gadgets of the kind, to deal with armored vehicles, submarines and other large beasts. Some levels will be real complete digressions from the standard action (for example the dogfight). Rogue's gaming past Rebellion's Rogue Trooper is not the first video game dedicated to the comic by Gerry Finley-Day and Dave Gibbons published by 2000 AD. Already in 1987, Piranha made an adaptation of the work for Zx Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64. It was a monochrome action game with a rather slow pace. A product that is only discreet overall but with a good impact. In 1990 it was Krisalis who reduced it again to a video game, this time for the Amiga and Atari ST, Rogue and associates. Again the result was only a decent two-dimensional action game which, however, was not to be despised. [C] The 1987 8-bit Computer VersionThe 1990 16-bit computer version [/C] Different genres The gameplay of Rogue Trooper is the result of the reduction of several genres. Playing, we realize that the developers have tried to put a bit of everything into it: platform-like phases set in caves and ruins, stealth phases, Operation Wolf sections and so on and so forth. What comes out is a mix that in some cases is very effective, while in others it leaves the time it finds. For example, the stealth possibilities of Rogue can be safely ignored since enemies have a tendency to discover us even if well hidden and since there are no useful indicators to avoid getting caught. Other possibilities that can safely be ignored are those of the special actions menu: what's the point of putting a silencer on the rifle if everyone hears when we shoot anyway? What's the use of holograms if you end up colliding face-to-face with enemies anyway? In short the dressing of the supporting structure seems superfluous when not completely useless. Calculate that we finished the game without using these features and without feeling the need for them in any situation we even get to forget that they exist. Luckily the action is of a good standard and the management of firefights (with exploitation of cover) is excellent. It's fun to shoot enemies from behind a barricade or do blind fire to force them into hiding so you can catch your breath for a moment. Different genres Even for the different weapons available to Rogue, the speech is more or less similar: some are useful and fun to use (think of the standard machine gun, sniper rifle, mortar and missile launcher) while others are completely useless. Let's take the shotgun for example... when to use it seriously and continuously? Its best effects are produced, of course, from a short distance... but, given that the game is set mostly in medium-sized scenarios and outdoors, it is ultimately useless. The same can be said for mines; we felt the need to use them on just a couple of occasions. Like vultures The most interesting element of Rogue Trooper is certainly the lack of ammunition and various objects to collect for the levels. You got it right: there are no medkits hidden inside barrels, there are no ammo spinning at the top of an abandoned skyscraper and there are no power-ups hidden at the bottom of a collapsed alley. All inventory is managed with a simple but effective system: the transformation of scrap into what we need at the moment, be it an upgrade, a medical kit or an ammunition pack for our favorite weapon. Scrap can be collected in two ways: by finding small caches hidden throughout the levels, or by examining the corpses of enemies. Yes you practically become vultures; what can you do, it's the hard life of the blue soldiers. the inventory is managed with a simple but effective system Like vultures Returning to talk about characterization, one cannot fail to notice how it would have been necessary to work more on the story and on the characters so as not to lose, in the transition from comic to video game, the elements of social criticism and the description of the dystopia in which they live our heroes. In short, it is not nice to say it, but once again, from a more strictly ~artistic~ point of view, the video game pays the price by trivializing a work with good depth. In the change of language, a great many of the original echoes in which the Civil War was mixed with elements of the Second World War in a society close to that described by Orwell in 1984 have been lost. something deeper that also projects this medium towards a more ~expressive~ and truly adult phase (it's not enough to beat up old ladies to be adults) of its history. A starting point like Rogue Trooper could have been an excellent opportunity to churn out something profound, instead of the usual story of heroes seeking revenge. Cross-platform Rogue Trooper is a uniform title on all gaming platforms (PC, Xbox and PlayStation 2) for which it was made. The only notable difference is represented by the better textures of the PC version, which make the game visually a cut above the console versions (although, proportionally, this is reversed). For the rest it must be said that all three versions are completely localized in Italian (menus, subtitles and dialogues) and that the translation work is really very good (well, for once you won't regret the English version). Final comment Rebellion, former authors of Snhyper Elite and Judge Dredd: Dredd Vs. Death (two of the many titles to their credit), have packaged a good action game that, without standing out in any aspect, manages to do its dirty work. Despite everything we would have liked a greater characterization of the world (too flat in some cases, too stereotyped in others) and greater longevity (it lasts about ten hours). Despite this, we cannot crush a product made with all the trappings of the case. We just... can't get rid of a strong sense of dissatisfaction with something that could have been there but was, in fact, omitted. Yes, in short ... that extra creative flair that makes a simple video game a masterpiece. A solid product almost granite in its highly professional construction. Now it's time to decide whether that's a compliment or not. Pros Solid action and plenty of variety Great inventory management Fun while it lasts Cons Mediocre overall characterization Some elements are only hinted at and could have been better implemented A bit ~flat~ There in the smurf village Lasts the life of the smurfs. The insecurity has forced them to do absurd things like sacrificing themselves and becoming an ice cream flavor or going to the gym, taking steroids and becoming part of a combat elite ready for anything. Papa Smurf, embracing an ultra-liberal vision of the world suggested to him by his new partner Gargamel (the two, despite being officially enemies, had already made numerous secret agreements before the turning point), decided that the previous balances were no longer adequate to face the challenge with the future and here we are, talking about the military career of Clumsy Smurf who, rendered useless in the food chain by the new political / economic structure of the village, has decided to enlist in the G.I. (which stands for Genetic Infantryman). Always better than me that I'm forced to hit commented Smurfette.", "date": "2006-05-31", "grade": null}
