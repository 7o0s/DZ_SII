But when we are faced with certain games, in our opinion we cannot speak only of a mere commercial operation. After all, being able to replay certain masterpieces for many users can also be a way to regain certain memories or a certain type of entertainment, while for newbies it can prove to be an interesting method to discover and enjoy what they have lost since the last generation of console. This time it's the turn of Naughty Dog's action-adventure saga with platform elements to deserve its own Blu-ray edition. Jak and Daxter Trilogy is in fact a collection containing three great classics for PlayStation 2 of the caliber of Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy, Jak II: Renegade and Jak 3. The aforementioned series, for those unfamiliar with it, has always been characterized by a playful structure very similar to that of other genre products, which for the record should be placed in the category of action-adventures with platform elements, and which therefore at first sight it could seem not very original also due to the settings, style and gameplay. However, it has often hidden a series of characteristics and a particular pace of play, we would say almost cinematographic by evolution, capable of giving the whole a depth and involvement as few other equal titles have managed or still manage to offer. What has just been described is reproduced in an identical way in this collection, with the addition of support for trophies and a 720p high definition graphic treatment that even boasts stereoscopic 3D. But let's proceed in order and therefore let's get to know or, if you have already played them on PlayStation 2, rediscover these three little jewels. Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy The game features the reckless Daxter, who transforms into something between a weasel and an otter after falling into a basin containing a force of nature called Echo, here in an evil and dark-colored form (like we will see later this energy is also present in positive versions), and the friend Jak, who is the de facto character controlled by the user, a young man with improbable hair. To be able to get Daxter back to normal, the two cronies must face a path that from their village, Sandover, will have to take them north in search of the wise Gol, the only individual who can dominate Eco energy in such a way as to be able to return to the victim his true appearance. But things get complicated and the adventure begins for the pair of heroes. Adventure that winds through about fifteen levels designed in such a way as not to force the gamer to compulsorily complete them before being able to continue towards another area. As in any good self-respecting adventurous platformer, the main purpose of each mission is to get rid of annoying enemies, including bosses, solve small puzzles and collect objects, especially batteries, which are actually luminous globes capable of providing energy. To embellish a gameplay that is still able to satisfy the finest palates, there are then many sub-games that fit perfectly into the backbone of the main adventure, varying some aspects without however breaking the rhythm or distorting the playful context. These missions where you can fish, ride some kind of anti-gravity bike and much more, they are not placed there at random, in short. As far as Jak's skills are concerned, he can mainly use punches and kicks, although thanks to the positive energy of some types of Echoes, of different colors according to their functions (there is the one that restores energy or the other which gives the ability to hit one's enemies with balls of fire, etc) can also acquire other temporary skills. But that's certainly not all: the curious protagonist is also able to swim, cling and jump, subsequently making a spectacular double jump by pressing a special button which can also prove useful for ending up ~Mario-style~ on the heads of enemies to eliminate them. To complete it all there is a technical realization that apart from the age, is still able to satisfy the players. Certainly high definition cannot work miracles in this case, especially due to flat and poorly defined textures, but all the same it is nice to look at vast scenarios with variegated conformity ranging from tropical beaches to lava rivers, the representation of the flow of time that occurs through the alternation of day and night on the screen, as well as the change in weather with effects such as rain, snow or distheat transfer, with a brilliance and fluidity never seen before in the original. The music that accompanies the two heroes throughout the adventure is also good, even if we don't have a memorable soundtrack, and the dubbing entirely in Italian. Playstation 3 trophies Jak and Daxter Trilogy offers more than a hundred trophies divided more or less equally between the three games (therefore there are three Platinum available). To obtain them you have to satisfy specific requests, from the simplest ones related to the collection of a certain number of batteries or objects, to the more complex ones that require you to defeat a specific boss or win a series of races, and so on. Jack II: Renegade Despite being a direct sequel to the first episode, Jak II: Renegade is actually a very different product from it due to the tones of the story, which becomes darker, and to the game structure, which in some points resembles a free roaming even if limited in interaction with the surrounding environment. In fact, for the plot we have a new futuristic setting that sees the two heroes end up by chance in a futuristic metropolis called Haven City. Here they are locked up in prison and experiments are carried out on Jak for a scientific project called the Dark Warrior. The aim is to transform the unfortunate guinea pig into a ferocious monster in the service of the local dictator. Fortunately, his friend Daxter, who had managed to escape two years earlier, returns to free his companion, who by now with an ugly soul decides to take revenge at all costs on those who have hurt him. Hand in hand with his inner change, Jak obviously also undergoes the physical one, which consequently affects the gameplay. In fact, the hero can transform into a creature with various special abilities by collecting that Dark Eco in the course of the various levels which in the past caused him physical damage, but which now makes him more powerful by loading a special bar. Which is very useful for dealing with the new enemies introduced in the game that are otherwise more difficult to eliminate than those present in the first episode of the series. A variety of firearms, assault vehicles and other futuristic trinkets are also introduced to aid Jak in his work of destruction. This transforms the playability of the title by orienting it more towards a shooter and action component rather than a platformer, even if there is no lack of ad hoc sessions in this sense. Finally, as in any good genre title, a series of mini-games have been implemented that world after world will complicate the experience, while making it more varied. As far as graphics and audio are concerned, the speech made for The Precursor Legacy also applies in this case: thanks to the HD treatment everything appears visually more fluid, chromatically bright and pleasant, but with all the pros and cons of the case, such as for example the highlighting by contrast of some bare textures. The sound, on the other hand, is almost perfect, especially as regards the excellent Italian dubbing. Jack 3 Thus we arrive at the third chapter, originally released in 2004. Also in this episode the series does not lose its style in some ways cinematic for spectacularity and direction, and restarts at the plot level by reconnecting precisely to Renegade, with Jak exiled in the desert outside Haven City , now divided between the Liberation Front, the Metal Heads and the Kremizi Death Bots, following the accusations leveled against him by the Grand Council of having fomented a revolt. Thus begins an adventure that will take the nice green-haired character and his inseparable friend Daxter initially along boundless desolate areas and then through a thousand other vicissitudes. As for the technical aspect, speaking of gameplay we have a character control system that works quite well and apart from a few camera problems like the original, everything on the screen happens in a fluid and natural way. We have rather some modifications in some of the game mechanics which, contrary to the other two titles in the collection, see the platform component almost completely disappear in favor of other more purely shooter and action elements, even if there is no shortage of typical racing sessions adventurous, with many cars of all types and all sizes that take shape in a showroom. Proof of this is that the protagonist can use even more weapons, more vehicles and even more moves thanks to the addition of light powers to his already substantial set of skills. There are also unlockable elements during the adventure, among which the ability to customize your alter ego at will by choosing from a good number of variables, such as the enlargement of the head and the rsemi-fluorescent goatee motion. For the rest, on a conceptual level, the game structure, apart from the ~platform~ sessions as mentioned, remains practically unchanged compared to its predecessors and therefore lacks real innovations. The technical sector can count on very accurate graphics and which certainly appear to be the most beautiful among the three titles in the collection, and on excellent audio in which once again an excellent dubbing in our language stands out.", "date": "2012-03-09", "grade": "8.7"}
