As soon as the game is started, the sense of deja-vu assails us irrepressibly and, going forward in the crusader campaign, it does not abandon us until the end. NeoCore, the developer to whom we owe the handsome King Arthur - The Role-playing Wargame, another real-time strategy game whose battles are inspired by the Creative Assembly series, knows how to handle the material and certainly didn't have major problems adapting to the new title the work already done. The launch is revealing, because we were able to play without problems even if we didn't play the tutorial. The troop selection controls are the classic ones, the power relationships between the different units in the field ditto. We were so comfortable with Lionheart that we almost thought we had started an old game The Fierce Pretzel Obviously the staging is always the same: there is Richard the Lionheart and there is Saladin who give it to each other with panache in the holy land. If you want some information on their stories, open a history book that space is scarce here. The descent into the field takes place without too many frills: having chosen one of the two available campaigns, which obviously allow you to take the sides of both factions, you are immediately in command of the armies. In fact, compared to the titles mentioned, the pre and post mission tactical sections are almost completely missing, which are limited to a few configuration elements of the armies we will talk about. In other words, in the campaign of the crusaders it will be necessary to conquer the sixteen kingdoms that make up the dominion of Saladin, gloriously entering Damascus, while in the campaign of Saladin it will be necessary to recover the stolen goods and drive the Pope's envoys back to the land of Albion (where Robin Hood awaits ). It should be specified that the second campaign is more difficult than the first and that, therefore, it is advisable to face them in order, to practice the game mechanics and prepare for the more difficult battles. From the point of view of the armies, the two factions change little and if you have played any other strategy with a similar setting in recent years, you will not struggle much to understand the potential of archers, heavy infantry, light infantry and cavalry. Of course, there is no shortage of special troops and support troops, which greatly increase the configurations of the army. Other introductions that incorporate some of the innovations of recent years are the growth of the level of the units, which become stronger by winning battles, and the possibility of finding artifacts around the maps. The siege The battles that make up the game are generally well studied and give an idea of the developers' great ability to interpret the battlefield in a dynamic way. The situations you come across are the classic ones, so expect to assault strongholds, to fight in the open field, to have to exploit the terrain to compensate for the numerical disadvantage and so on. Generally we are faced with situations that are controllable and less confusing than the genre, with great advantage for those who like to have a clearer vision of what is happening on the field. Sure, the battles feel a lot less pitched than in any Total War, and the spectacle of armies impacting and spreading across the battlefield is missing, but overall we liked the tighter setting. The most interesting part is that of the sieges, with the possibility of defending the captured strongholds by building war machines of various kinds (towers, spikes and so on). Here too we are faced with a work of great wisdom that will satisfy the most hardened strategists, but it is still difficult to get excited about something that, deep down, we know well because we have already experienced elsewhere. Until the sun goes down From a technical point of view, Lionheart is a title that maintains itself at high levels. Zooming in on a battle allows you to enjoy well-defined troops, with good animations, who fight in a realistic way. Sure, something more could have been done from the point of view of historical reconstruction, but in general we can't complain. The landscapes are also very beautiful, as much as this can count in such a game. The sound effects are noted only for their functionality and do not affect the standards we are used to. It should be noted that there were too many returns to the desktop, a problem that also afflicted King Arthur. It didn't happen very often to us, but honestly we don't have a pronunciationI said kind words when we got stuck near the end of a battle we were winning.", "date": "2010-11-26", "grade": "7.0"}
