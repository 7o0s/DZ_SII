{"name": "Sam &amp; Max Season Two: Ice Station Santa - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sam-amp-max-season-two-ice-station-santa-recensione.html", "text": "Merry Christmas Sam & Max! As per consolidated tradition, the adventure begins inside Sam & Max's office - now adorned with the most significant memories of Season One - from whose window a malicious toy robot appears, of such dimensions as to cause destruction and panic , but with a decidedly developed gab and the bearer of a philosophy between Kirkegaard and 80s pop musicians. Defeating the nefarious mass of metal will not be a difficult task, while far more shocking is the revelation that the fearsome war machine is none other than a macabre gift from Santa Claus himself. Intrigued by the attentions of the bearded protagonist of the festivities of millions of children, the police dog Sam and his trusty rabbit Max decide to travel to the cold expanses of Lapland, where they will find a very different reality from the one told by fairy tales and legends. A violent and possessive Santa Claus as an enemy: a valid starting point for the complex of puzzles that will follow, almost always focused on the discussion and creative reworking of previously acquired data, rather than on solving complex or bizarre puzzles. In general, the little more than three hours of duration of the adventure will flow pleasantly, without ever exceeding in difficulty and offering, at times, short sessions more arcade and related to reflexes, such as for example a revised and corrected version of the festival classic by country in which to knock down the moles that come out of the various holes in the cabinet with a hammer. Many non-player characters have been recycled from the past, making it possible to meet again the various Soda Poppers, Bosco, Sybill and the head of Abe Lincoln, while it is still too early to be able to say which of the new entries - with the sole exception of Stinky's Diner , diner already present in the old Hit The Road - will remain in the cast of subsequent episodes. The latter, by the way, promise to be once again linked by a thin line: a first clue, without wanting to reveal anything about the plot, calls into question Easter Island - the setting of the next game - and its famous sculptures representatives of the heads, available in the Santa Claus gift catalog. Between the lines of the narration, during a more than enjoyable experience, one cannot fail to read the criticism brought by TellTale to the current consumerist structure of modern Western society, with the elves once busy in the construction of gifts now subjected to a authoritarian and inhumane regime, partly supplanted by penguin babies, cheaper and not covered by health insurance. Panoramic laughs Technically Sam & Max Season 2: Ice Station Santa does not differ from what was previously seen. The engine is the same, as is the colorful and super deformed style of the characters and settings. The rooms inside Santa Claus' house are full of details and, in general, the new areas are more varied and articulated than in the past. The interface has not undergone any changes, remaining comfortable and always able not to clog the screen with useless frills, while it cannot fail to be pleased to hear about the new support for widescreen viewing, which however presents some problems when used in a window. The music and the dubbing, entrusted to the respective authors of the past, are once again one of the strong points, especially if the not excessive proportions of the project are taken into consideration. Comment Sam & Max: Ice Station Santa is the perfect continuation of what we saw a few months ago from the last chapter of Season 1. The puzzles blend perfectly with the story and the delusional events of the two freelance policemen, while the few hours of play balance with the usual budget price with which the title is sold online on the official website. An obligatory and awaited purchase for those who have already loved the previous appearances, a good reason to get to know this magnificent series for everyone else. Pro The Baddest Santa Ever Ironic, demented... brilliant! Technically very pleasant Cons The structure is always the same: take it or leave it Duration (justifiably) limited PC - System Requirements Minimum Requirements Processor: Pentium 3 800 MHz RAM: 256 MB Video Card: 3D 32 MB Disk Space: 240 MB Recommended Requirements Processor: Pentium 4 1.5 GHz RAM: 512 MB Test Configuration Processor: Intel Pentium 4 3.4 GHz HT RAM: 2GB Video Card: NVIDIA 8800 320MB From mysterious object to revelation, from videogame disappeared to almost monthly reality. Sam & Max is a brand that has had an unstable, almost psychotic progression, as if to act as a reflected image of the two protagonists, little virloud and unfriendly. After waiting for years, last season saw the release of the six episodes that marked its rebirth, this will instead be the springboard for a possible and absolutely desirable confirmation, between increasingly hilarious puzzles and situations bordering on the paradox. Ice Station Santa therefore opens up yet another new detective course for this atypical pairing, promising to repeat the success achieved and tackling current and living issues in an even more sarcastic and bitter way. The danger that a sort of monotony may arise will perhaps be the only obstacle to a gallop that, as you will be able to read in the following lines, seems to never want to end.", "date": "2007-11-09", "grade": null}
