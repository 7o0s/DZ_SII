An expansion that introduced Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th to the roster of characters and three unreleased skins for as many fighters, who joined other packs of previously released costumes. In the case of the cinematic serial killer bundle, it was the Horror Pack with three new skins for Mileena, Ermac and Reptile, respectively those of Vampira, Pharaoh and Kraken. Following this path, the development team now ~gives~ us Tanya, together with the Klassic 1 Skin Pack package. The latter, let's face it right away, leaves something to be desired when compared to the previous one and the Samurai Pack, stylistically and technically much more beautiful to look at, even if the nostalgic ones will still be able to enjoy the original costumes of the first Mortal Kombat for Kano, Sonya and Liu Kang. The Tanya Bundle, the one we review in this article, can be purchased individually, i.e. outside the Kombat Pack, at a price of 7.99. New Mortal Kombat X DLC Brings the Deadly Tanya and Three Classic Costumes for Kano, Sonya and Liu Kang From Edenia with fury The highlight of the offer obviously remains the character of Tanya. First appearing in Mortal Kombat 4, the daughter of the Ambassador of Edenia returns to the arenas of Mortal Kombat X better than ever. Even if from an aesthetic point of view it sometimes gives the feeling, albeit well done, of being less refined than the other fighters on the roster, while otherwise it is animated and characterized with care. In terms of gameplay Tanya can be defined as a versatile character, interesting to play thanks to her powerful long-range attacks and the ability to cover distances with ease, arriving on the opponent in an instant. Ground movements are agile and when these work in combination with teleportation skills, especially aerial ones, it can be devastating. She's not the strongest fighter in the game and doesn't unbalance relationships within the roster, but her fighting styles provide some strategic options that, when used correctly, can make Tanya a tough character to play with and very rewarding to play. Like the other Mortal Kombat X fighters, the ~new~ warrior has three different fighting styles available, which can vary her moves, including combos. The first variant is called Kobu Jutsu and sees the girl base a large part of her attack actions on the fast execution of blows with her hands, each holding a tonfa, the traditional weapon of Chinese and Japanese martial arts, and on flying wheels that lead her to dive down from the sky with deadly lunges, always taking advantage of the aforementioned weapons that she can also launch against the enemy. Kobu Jutsu's combos are not complicated to execute and the special moves, whose names Gutting or Dragon's Tooth give an idea of what to expect, easy to learn. The second option is the one called Dragon Naginata and gives more weight to the combination of single and double kicks, to be alternated or performed in combination with a long stick. With this combination Tanya vaguely recalls a cross between Kilik in SoulCalibur and Yoshimitsu in Tekken. Finally we have the Pyromancer variant which places a lot of emphasis on the use of fire, with flaming spheres to be launched in two different ways from a distance, both in flight and at half height, and other ~hot~ moves. Pyromancer also gives the character the so-called Shroud of Darkness, a move that allows you to wrap the opponent in a purple halo that allows Tanya to inflict an additional 10% of damage with a subsequent attack with a ~ball~ of fire. Extremely violent, as always, the Fatalities. Bloody Boots sees Tanya literally smash through the chest and face of defeated enemies with the heels of her boots after pinning them to the ground, planting tonfas in their hands. With Trivella Edeniana instead he grabs the arms of the unfortunate from behind, to then point both feet on their back to break through it, cross it and come out on the other side of the body with the heart in his hand and the remains of the entrails on him. The Brutalities operate in the same way, with the heads of the antagonists detaching from the body due to a violent flying kick under the chin, from bottom to top, or with the crushing of the chest under the weight of Tanya's body, and etc. For the rest there is little else to add except that this package is similar to the previous one with Jason Voorhees, so you shouldn't expect much from a quantitative point of view. This puts us in the difficult position of being able to recommend its unconditional purchase without taking into account ccertain factors, such as for example the willingness or otherwise of the player to want to collect everything related to the basic product, or the availability or otherwise of the Kombat Pack and therefore the logic of considering it as part of a much wider offer. For us the usual speech applies: if you are a fan of Mortal Kombat X like the writer, and you want to further expand the roster by adding some classic costumes and a new character, then this DLC is for you. Otherwise, you could opt for the single purchase of the character, the skins or avoid spending.", "date": "2015-06-28", "grade": null}
