In fact, the title developed by Playsoft welcomes the player patiently, with a complete tutorial that illustrates the dynamics of a stage, teamwork and the inevitable strategic component. And this is precisely the core of the experience proposed by the Polish team which, through a campaign made up of twenty-three events, supported by multiplayer-based challenges, will see us give directions to our cyclists so that they score the highest number of points during each individual race, eventually crossing the finish line first. Gameplay Tour de France 2021, our team has detached the others. Let's start by saying that Tour de France 2021 The Game is simply the updated version of a title that has been available on the App Store and Google Play Store for some time, which like many other sports, see for example PES 2021 Mobile, has turned into a real its own platform to be enriched and optimized from season to season, introducing new content based on what happens in real races. It is therefore difficult to perceive any concrete differences from the previous edition, especially in terms of gameplay. The mix proposed by Playsoft is inspired by card battlers to provide us with a deck of contextual actions, from escape to shooting, from pace to supplies, from waiting to recovering fugitives, which lend themselves to every different situation. Tour de France 2021, escape is not easy in some cases. Starting from a two-dimensional view of the event, which only vaguely tries to reproduce the characteristics of the stage in question, we will therefore have to set up these actions where necessary so that our team is able to get the cue needed to win, overturning any moments of crisis thanks to a tactic that can count on the support of a virtual assistant at any time. It is possible to speed up the flow of the action, but it only makes sense to do it during the easier and more obvious challenges. Otherwise we will need all the leeway possible to act quickly and avoid ending up at the back of the group, play our cards at the best moment and obviously pay attention to the residual physical resistance of our cyclists. Structure Tour de France 2021 The Game, a look at the sports facilities. Set in a similar way to that of a trading card-based strategy, the structure of Tour de France 2021 The Game will see us move between one race and another within a sports structure to be upgraded, in Farmville style, with the inevitable waiting times and the possibility of drastically reducing them only by carrying out microtransactions. As a good freemium, the game tries to monetize the speed of progression and from this point of view the approach appears decidedly traditional, with upgrades that prove to be fundamental for becoming competitive on the road (from cyclist training to buying new bikes) and an action energy indicator that limits the number of consecutive races we can tackle before stopping and waiting. Technical realization Tour de France 2021, the interface shows the team members and allows you to speed up the action. Virtually indistinguishable from the previous edition, Tour de France 2021 The Game can count on a pleasant bitmap graphics for the representation of the athletes and scenarios, which change a lot from one event to another and give a good dose of visual variety to the experience , which otherwise would be rather repetitive and inconsistent. Unfortunately, the interface appears a bit confusing in the menus and takes some time to digest, while the musical accompaniment we found really mediocre, with a repetitive and poorly executed main theme , between badly damped snare drums and arrangements in frantic delay compared to the rhythm.", "date": "2021-07-01", "grade": "7.0"}
