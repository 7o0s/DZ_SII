{"name": "Gotta Feed 'em All!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/166984-yo-kai-watch-gotta-feed-em-all.html", "text": "The reason why it took almost three years to arrive here, while in Japan the series is about to see its third release, we will find out a little in the course of the article, a little explained by recalling the curriculum vitae of the manufacturer, the fact is that Yo-Kai Watch in the motherland has become in a short time a real mass phenomenon second only to that Pokmon from which it is so (but not too much) inspired. Of course, much is due to the perfect marketing operation that involves, and the same will happen here with video games, television series, toys and mobile apps, but is it conceivable that such a success arises from a title of less than excellent quality? Come on, we're still talking about Level-5! Finally also in Italy the Yo-Kai Watch phenomenon: it is not at all a simple clone of Pokmon! A phantasmagorical summer We are in Valdoro, the Italian name of a town which is however clearly inspired by the population centers of Japan, and little Nate - or his female counterpart if you choose this one at the beginning of the game - is grappling with the summer holidays and everything what they have to offer. A competition between friends to see who catches the most beautiful and rare insect, for example: while wandering through the woods surrounding his town, Nate comes across a gadget dispenser that looks identical to those still found today in all the shopping centres, but what is a machine like this doing in the middle of a wood, very close to a temple? And what is that voice that pushes ours to operate the machine? It's about Whisper, a spirit locked up in there by a priest two hundred years ago. Apparently a simple ghost, Whisper is actually a yo-kai, a spirit of the Japanese tradition: with a very varied appearance but mainly related to some animal, yo-kai have lived next to us since the dawn of time, but only they occasionally interact with humans. Their nature is generally neither malevolent nor good: basically they are mischievous and fickle like so many creatures of both Western and Eastern traditions, but their behaviors rarely cause real harm to men. From time to time they can also favor them, and then there are those few but fearsome bad yo-kai, whose purpose is to bring death and destruction to the world of humans, as Nate will soon find out: thanks to the Yo-Kai Watch that provides him with Whisper, ours is in fact able to see and interact with these creatures, starting with the same ~ghost~ who proclaims himself the protagonist's guide and butler. From here begins a story divided into episodes exactly like an anime, and which actually resembles a children's anime in many ways: the first missions have apparently very trivial objectives, such as ending an argument between mom and dad, helping the friend Sandrone to find a ring lost in a pond, to bring back important documents lost at the station to his parent. But discovering that a yo-kai is hiding behind each of these little incidents will allow the protagonist, and the player with him, to become familiar with the game world and with the creatures to prepare for what will be the real challenge proposed by the plot. The 3D effect Undoubtedly rendered very well, stereoscopy gives its best in the exploratory phase, when it gives depth and body to scenarios that are already very beautiful and full of details. Given the particular aesthetics, typical of Level-5, however, we also suggest that you experience long moments of play by depriving yourself of the 3D effect, which also slightly affects the frame rate: thus all the anime nature of Yo-Kai Watch will come out, full of of references both to the works of Studio Ghibli and to many children's cartoons of the past, with which the older children among us have grown up. The Jibanyan Army Unlike the more traditional JRPG Pokmon structure, Yo-Kai Watch provides a single city and its surroundings to be explored in an absolutely free way, with new areas that are unlocked both by progressing in the story and by upgrading the title watch. which starts from a rank E and can go up to S. The yo-kai, the true heart of the title, also have a rank ranging from E to S: there are more than 200, 230 collectibles plus some bosses too bad to become friends with the humans, and if some of these will certainly become part of your team for script needs, and others will be obtainable only through side missions, fusions, Slot-kai, fights, only locally, with another player and Streetpass functions, most meet in the classic search and combat mechanism. Here Level-5 intended to detach itself quite clearly from the formula that inspired it, with all in all commendable results although not impervious to criticism. The yo-kai hide in numerous sensitive points of the scenario (by analyzing which it is also possible to collect objects and collect insects and fish) but the clash must be sought using the radar function of the Watch, which warns us of their presence and their rank. Once found they will try to escape, and if we manage to keep them under the lens of the Clock Lens for a few seconds, the battle will start. Here there is an initial inconsistency: some creatures are more difficult to catch than others (for example those that fly are generally more difficult than those that walk) without this then translating into an effective reward for the extra effort. But the most striking difference compared to Pokmon, and the vast majority of games of the genre, lies in the actual combat, with the yo-kai acting on their own initiative depending on their nature, be it more aggressive, rational and so on , which, however, can be modified through special collectible books. The real strategy lies in composing the party of six spirits, of which only three fight at the same time; however, it is possible to change them in real time according to a wheel mechanism which makes it even more important to compose your group well according to your preferences based on the characteristics of the yo-kai and taking into account some rules, such as the one that provides bonuses if you bring together two or three creatures of the same tribe. During the fight you can then act directly by unleashing, after filling the appropriate indicator, the Energimax moves, which have effects of different kinds: to perform them it is necessary to play a small minigame on the touch screen, the same mechanism provided for the purification from a negative status , which will also give a few more experience points. Always in real time, it is possible to use healing objects as well as determine a target on which to concentrate one's shots. It is a somewhat strange concept, evidently devised to differentiate itself from the various Pokmon, which if at first makes the clashes a little confusing but very frenetic, in the long run tends not to create a real connection with your roster and furthermore, sufficient experience level, battles become very easy and passive; however, the system gives its best in boss fights, which are decidedly more demanding than average. Between strategic choices, formation changes, Energimax and purifications, the most important fights are always frenetic, fun and spectacular. GTA Valdoro At the end of a battle, there is a chance that the defeated yo-kai will ask you to become friends and join your team, a possibility that increases if you feed it during the battle with its favorite food among the many available in shops and streets of Valdoro. However, the routine that governs this process seemed erratic to us: we happened to enlist a spirit after the first meeting without feeding it, and vice versa having to wait about twenty battles before making friends with another one whose favorite dish we had identified. All this makes fights and enlistments, after a while, quite tedious, reserving the collecting part only for the most avid completionists, perhaps in some more relaxed sessions after the end of the main storyline. In the meantime, however, there are plenty of things to do: the map is huge and complex, full of secrets ranging from small hidden chests to huge and dangerous dungeons. From time to time a huge Oni, a creature always from the Japanese tradition but with an evil nature, appears on the game world and you have to escape him, and there are many other small activities that we will leave you the pleasure of discovering. Not to mention the presence of numerous sidequests, almost all very fun and which reward with many experience points, useful objects and sometimes a completely new yo-kai: however, these suffer from a lack of the map, which, although it clearly marks each objective, reserves a direction indicator only to the current objective of the main story, and also does not label various streets and points of interest, leaving exploration and memory to show the player where to go. Counting the very heavy backtracking and a rotating camera only up to a certain angle, the generally pleasant exploration also becomes a bit boring and repetitive at times, until you discover the possibility of teleporting from one point to another of Valdoro, which however happens rather later in the game. However, don't be misled by the few flaws that we wanted to clearly point out: Yo-Kai Watch is a titoextremely funny and that begins to show its side to some criticism only if you want to go beyond the actual plot, which in any case lasts about twenty hours. Sufficiently different from its inspirer, it is indeed a title for children, but not even that much: the all-Japanese humor that pervades it will also be highly appreciated by the older ones, especially by those who have seen anime such as Doraemon and the like, of which it incorporates many characteristics. Above all, the characterization of each yo-kai is noteworthy, which however is only the tip of the iceberg of a realization which, both on an aesthetic and technical level, is in all respects on par with the classic Level-5 productions, and therefore we speak of very high levels. It is a three-year-old game which, however, exploits the Nintendo 3DS in a fantastic way: the scenarios are full of details, the graphics are clean thanks above all to the exceptional textures that give the classic Studio Ghibli atmosphere, some glimpses are spectacular and full of atmosphere, and the battles full of effects, fast and spectacular, truly at the top of production for the Nintendo portable. The sound also offers some memorable tunes but above all we would like to mention the superb localization in Italian, one of the reasons why the titles of the Ch-ku studio take so long to get out of Japan. Not only the tons of text, but also all the speech (including songs) and even some textures have been translated into our language, with a considerable and very valuable effort on the part of those who worked on it, above all to make the numerous puns and jokes various intimately linked to Japanese culture. One of the main reasons, but certainly not the only one, to reward a production that is not without shortcomings, but which is in all respects the most valid alternative existing to his majesty Pikachu. We'll see if it's a phenomenon in Italy too, but it's to be hoped since, it seems, the sequels correct several gaps in this first episode.", "date": "2016-04-20", "grade": "8.6"}
