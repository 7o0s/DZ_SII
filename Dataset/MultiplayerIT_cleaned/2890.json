{"name": "Pirates Outlaws", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pirates-outlaws-recensione.html", "text": "It was 2019 when Pirates Outlaws arrived on Steam and, after years, the interesting roguelike deckbuilding is finally ready to land on consoles too, precisely on Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 (as well as on the current generation via backwards compatibility). It is also already available on iOS and Android as well. Starting March 29, 2023, you can go on an adventure in the pirate sea, where many enemies, regions to explore and decks to discover await you in a video game that will easily recall recent classics of the genre, above all Slay the Spire. However, let's not waste any more time and let's get straight to the point in our review of Pirates Outlaws. On boarding In each game of Pirates Outlaws we will be able to explore the seas, choosing the path Pirates Outlaws, as it is easy to guess from the name, offers a pirate setting. With our map we will have to explore archipelagos, made up of islands full of pirates, inns where to rest and ships to be attacked to obtain treasures. The narrative substrate is somewhat limited, but as is typical for deckbuilding roguelikes, there is no need for much else. Controller in hand, the structure is very similar to that of the aforementioned Slay the Spire, the simplest example for a comparison. For each game we will have a map, a starting point and a series of interconnected paths: we will be able to decide in which direction to go and therefore which area to explore next, whether it is a battle or a safe place to rest. Unlike Slay the Spire, each move has a cost of ~navigation points~: if you run out of them, you take damage. They can be obtained at the taverns by spending money, so it will always be important to restock at the right time and to keep track of what we have in our pockets. In general, there is always a need to choose the path in advance, seeing where we can go with the next moves, to ensure that we always have access to taverns to heal and markets to upgrade cards. In fact, there is as much strategy in card battles as there is in moving around: it is an excellent design choice as it is well balanced and, without ever putting us in too much trouble, it rewards us for being attentive and focused. The map also indicates which boss we will face at the end of each path and, once all these enemies have been discovered and understood, we will have to think about the best way to form our deck of cards to be as advantageous as possible against the opponent on duty. The bosses are many and often unique, with interesting though sometimes unbalanced mechanics. Luck is in fact essential in many situations and a pair of unlucky hands can make winning impossible. That's a statement that holds true throughout the game and every single encounter, but it's clear that against a powerful boss it's even more noticeable. There will also be some simple events in Pirates Outlaws, with rewards of various kinds Not unlike Slay the Spire, it is easily possible to play many hours without ever actually completing a region, even the simplest of all. At least, the overall progress is rapid even without achieving an actual final victory. Every few hours you get a new character (and there are several, all different) and very quickly you unlock two additional modes and higher difficulty levels than the basic mode already described. Extra Modes allow you to play a little differently. The arena allows you to fight enemies in waves, with a break between one fight and the next to perform various actions, such as healing, obtaining cards and more. This mode mixes all the content from the base game for more variety. Instead, the tavern allows you to create a deck by choosing predefined packages before each fight, so as to test our knowledge. These are great ideas for playing the same video game differently. Pirates Outlaws sword and pistol The turn-based fights are mostly based on the use of bullets, but there is no shortage of free cards in Pirates Outlaws However, we have not yet talked about the core of the game: the clashes with the cards. Our character will have to face one or more opponents in each battle. Enemies will indicate above their head the type of action they want to perform, such as attacking, creating a shield that absorbs damage, or applying bonuses/penalties. On our side, we will have five cards in hand and we will have to perform the same type of actions as our opponents, with one difference: various attack and defense moves cost ammunition, which must be recharged with dedicated cards. Unlike games that give each round a fixed number of points from shang, Pirates Outlaws asks us to have a balanced deck with cards with no cost, others that spend projectiles and recharges. The beauty of this system is that sometimes it is possible to play several rounds in one go, thanks to cards that make us draw and reload in sequence. The bad news is that if you run out of shots and don't draw reloads for a couple of turns, you can't do anything and often this means dying. Pirates Outlaws is completely in English, but you don't have to read much Pirates Outlaws aims for this high-stakes system, which makes the experience potentially very enjoyable or on the contrary a little frustrating. Luck is really a key factor, so if you prefer video games where you feel like you're always in full control, you better move on (see Inscryption's review, for example). As already mentioned, however, progress is constant and new characters are unlocked regularly. They are varied and above all they are all based on unique mechanics, often very fun to exploit. One of our favorites is the Cursed Pirate, who grows more powerful each time a curse card is added to his deck (which are generally best avoided). Then there are characters who with each attack roll a coin to decide whether to do double damage to the enemy or suffer a recoil, as well as a character who has a bear on his side who fights with us. There's even a pirate hen, seriously. The variety of characters, enemies and environments is great in Pirates Outlaws Also considering that there are a significant amount of skins to unlock for each character and various challenges to complete, we assure you that if you enter the Pirates Outlaws ~loop~ you will have to play for dozens of hours without any difficulty. The console control system is well done and we didn't miss the mouse and keyboard. Finally, a quick stylistic note. Even on a graphic level, the variety is not lacking. The style is simple, but enemies, arenas, cards and characters are all very different and pleasing to the eye. The soundtrack didn't particularly impress us, but it fits the setting and is never repetitive.", "date": "2023-03-28", "grade": "8.0"}
