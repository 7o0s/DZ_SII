After playing several hours, even online, in the third chapter of this successful racing series, we couldn't tell you if a player who is passionate about FPS or Platform, playing Forza Motorsport 3, will turn into a lifelong motor enthusiast. Certainly, however, if you like cars and everything that goes around them, the new Turn 10 game rightfully places itself in the Olympus of the best driving games ever released, and before you have seen all the content that is been included in the two DVDs, weeks of uninterrupted play will have passed. A sea of asphalt The best aspect of Forza Motorsport 3 is undoubtedly made up of all that series of tricks that ensure that anyone can have the gaming experience that best suits their tastes, starting from the possibility of dedicating themselves only to tuning and painting the bodyworks, with an even improved editor, reaching the possibility, as in the past, of entrusting the driving to a driver managed by the CPU who faces the most difficult races. The features that made Forza 2 so successful are back, but with more cars (400 from 50 different manufacturers), more environments for the different tracks to race on and the new feature of being able to rewind the scroll of time, repeating a corner that has been irreparably wrong as many times as you want during the same race. This feature, which might seem like a simple expedient to lighten the load that weighs on a pilot's shoulders in the most tense moments, turns out to be, from the point of view of a simulation game like Forza, a real keystone for the growth of the experience. In fact, as the games go on, it is natural to deactivate more and more driving aids (all types can be activated, up to intervening on the intelligence of the opponents and on the degree of realism of the damage), knowing you can turn back time so you don't have to repeat a race dozens of times just because you get hit at the last corner or because you go off the track after finally deciding to turn off the ABS to see if you're in really capable of handling a car hurtling down a track. The only consequence is a symbol that accompanies the time achieved on the track and which will let the other players know that not everything that has been done well is the result of our ability. Disabling the aids, however, leads to obtaining a higher multiplier for earn more credits to invest in car upgrades, new cars, decals and styles made by other players, or even the trims for different cars. To do this, in addition to turning to the packages created by the team, there is the online auction house where you can already find dozens of different bodies, cars and setups and for which you can participate in upward auctions just like on ebay , with a message that warns us promptly whenever our offer is exceeded by another player. Curiosity Where Forza really gets its nails out is online. The code is perfect and allows you to play it up to the last corner with seven other players with total absence of lag and always leaving the feeling of total control over the cars. Once in the waiting room, if the race has already started, it is possible to watch the competition as spectators, alternating dozens of views and shots. At the end of each match, points are collected which increase one's ranking, which is different from what one has offline. Here are the ways in which one can try his hand: Circuit - raced with cars belonging to the same class on circuits such as Le Mans Oval - You race on oval tracks to go full speed ahead Acceleration - Competitions with a standing start, like a dragster Street Races - This is where city courses find their place with streets closed to normal traffic Skidding - Whoever scores the most points by skidding around the bend wins And there is, of course, the possibility of saving replays, photographs and creating small videos to share thanks to the official site. A sea of racing In addition to earning credits, at the end of each race experience points are earned which increase the level of the driver, who gets a car as a gift for each step of the 50 available, and that of the car used, which, at each step of the 5 provided for each model, allows you to areal discounts for accessories to buy. Here too the ~for everyone~ nature of Forza Motorsport 3 is overwhelmingly manifested, given that for the laziest it is possible to buy the upgrades necessary to become competitive in a specific car category with the simple push of a button, while fans of tuning will have something to indulge themselves by going to make their dream car, and then maybe resell it online. This spirit is also respected for the single player career, given that there is no obligation to follow any pre-established scheme, given that the calendar of events to be tackled changes according to the type of machine you decide to use, with the game it offers types of races compatible with the chosen car, allowing the player to care less about those car models that do not suit him. As the seasons go on, the shortened versions of the courses give way to the full ones, up to real tours de force made up of long, fast and rather complex laps of the track, with HDR used artfully to blind the player when finds himself running against the sun, preventing him from identifying the right trajectory to take. The only comment that can be made to Forza Motorsport 3 is that neither night races nor those in the rain have been included, in such a realistic context in which among the dozens of tested cars there has always been the sensation of having to use different approaches and driving styles, depending on the characteristics of the cars. A special mention goes to the different weight distribution, depending on the model, which obliges the choice of careful strategies at each bend: with a super-equipped Lotus, however fast it may be, launching into bends to the sound of the doors is never a good idea. idea, if you don't want to end up spinning in the gravel on the side of the track. The video review Xbox 360 goals The thousand Strength points are all easily obtainable by simply playing through the single player campaign and interacting with other users with the auction house. It will take some time, but it will fly off rather nimbly. All frames of Forza The Forza Motorsport 3 engine has been rewritten from the ground up, according to the team, and the results can all be seen. The game uninterruptedly grinds 60 frames per second, even in the internal view of the cockpit (although not as rich in details as the more enthusiasts would have liked) and, even if there is some Aliasing problem, i.e. the notorious ladders, the cleaning, overall competence and brilliance leave you speechless in various situations. Not to mention the great sensation of speed you get with the more powerful models and which is really unusual for such a fluid game on consoles. The damage returns even more realistic in the consequences, but if on the one hand the effect that these cause on driving stability is evident, the same cannot be said of the aesthetic spectacularity, given that most of the time they result in a few dents and scratches on the bodies, which crumple slightly even after a 360 rollover, with at most a few bumpers that remain on the asphalt. The audio is also excellent both as regards the sound effects - but we would not have expected anything less - and for music ranging from very different musical genres and with various pleasant surprises to listen to between one curve and another.", "date": "2009-10-19", "grade": "9.4"}
