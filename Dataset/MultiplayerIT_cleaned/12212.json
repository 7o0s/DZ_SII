{"name": "Driver L.A. Undercover", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/driver-la-undercover_a.html", "text": "The protagonist of the game is a Tanner with a totally renewed and decidedly cooler look, who is called by the local police of Los Angeles to go undercover in the criminal structure of the city. From these premises the approximately 30 missions of the game unfold, which see the user engaged in activities that are all in all conventional: chases, escapes, shootings and many (very many) passages by car from point A to point B. Each assignment is divided into four small steps, structured in such a way as to facilitate immediate use, at the end of which a performance evaluation and a corresponding sum of money are obtained. Step by step, cars and modes can be unlocked for the free-ride section available from the main menu, which considerably extends the life of the product. The money raised can then be spent on upgrading your vehicle or repairing it after an accident, but also on bribing the police to get out of the way for a while. Much of the time in Driver L.A. Undercover is spent behind the wheel, but there is no shortage of shooter-style on-foot sections that help break up the pace (actually rather bland) of the game action. If up to now the painted picture regarding the Gameloft product seems rather positive, we have to wait until we get to talking about the technical realization to identify the major sore points. The ~fake~ 3D of the game (cars and backdrops are two-dimensional, and the distance of the horizon is extremely imitated) is not convincing, first of all due to the poverty of the scenarios: in fact, the city is made up only of perpendicular streets, with some bare polygonal block that appears every now and then to revive (so to speak) the general monotony of the seabed. It goes without saying that driving in Driver L.A. Undercover isn't exactly the most dynamic and stimulating activity on the planet, confined between long straights and 90 bends which, moreover, the game engine doesn't handle very well, together with collisions and trespassing on the grass. Several problems also emerge in terms of frame rate, stable only on the most advanced devices, and with regard to the surrounding elements, which are really poor: just to give an example, the cars that populate the streets are all the same, without even a chromatic variation. Despite the obvious problems, Driver L.A. Undercover is certainly not an unplayable title, and indeed it could excite aficionados of the genre, but looking at the global results, Gangstar's 2D formula seems decidedly more effective. PRO Good amount of content Quite varied gameplay AGAINST Unfortunate technical realization Pretty boring driving sections", "date": "2007-06-10", "grade": "S.V."}
