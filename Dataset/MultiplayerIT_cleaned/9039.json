{"name": "Un missile in fuga", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/94054-the-last-rocket-un-missile-in-fuga.html", "text": "Tested version: iPhoneThe numerous games available on the App Store demonstrate that it is quite simple to sketch a pixel art graphic that recalls the cult of the past, just as anyone can add a chiptune tune that drives the most nostalgic retro gamer crazy; maybe it doesn't take long to fish out a now out-of-date genre, with rigid mechanics and deliberately obsolete controls. Yet, despite everything, it is extremely difficult for an average developer to be able to effectively blend all these elements, to create today a pearl with a retro charm capable of stimulating sensations that have been dormant for a long time. Shaun Inman, an indie developer from Tennessee, has shown that he's done his homework by releasing The Last Rocket on iPhone and iPad, a charming puzzle game with a pleasant 'old school' feel and ultimately original game mechanics . Explosive mixture The idea behind The Last Rocket is simple right from the narrative premises: a long intergalactic battle has finally come to an end and all unused missiles are about to be disposed of in a ship ready to fall into a star. This would normally be excellent news, but it happens that the unfortunate player finds himself impersonating one of these rockets which, animated, must try in every way to escape from the spaceship before it's too late. In each of the 64 rooms, the aim is therefore to reach the exit door that leads to the next scenario, a not easy goal considering that the protagonist's movements are extremely limited: in fact, the missile can only launch in a straight line or reverse its direction, while the only way to move laterally in flight is to end up in the air vents scattered here and there in the level; You can also 'walk' on the surface if you wish, but you will find rare opportunities to do so and most of the time it will be to adjust direction before a cast. It goes without saying that each scenario is chock full of traps ranging from the usual spikes to deadly laser beams, and the player's skill lies in predicting every change of direction and preventing the missile from being hit. As the levels progress, the difficulty and the number of traps gradually increase, but unless you want to collect all the gears on the screen it is very unlikely that you will get stuck in a particular puzzle, and it is perhaps the lack of really elaborate puzzles to represent one of the less successful aspects of The Last Rocket. However, as the number of air ducts increases, the player is led to increasingly complex reasoning, since an unexpected move is enough to end up in the wrong channel and see your missile wandering like crazy in a completely different direction. It doesn't help a control system which, although most of the time it doesn't create problems, sometimes proves to be the main cause of accidental deaths: a single touch on the screen is enough to launch in a straight line, while to move sideways or walk on the surface you need to scroll a finger in either direction. The problem is that often the game does not detect this last input correctly, launching the rocket at a laser beam when you just wanted to move it a little further to the right. Nothing that makes the experience frustrating, mind you, but that still weighs in on the more advanced levels, when the player is asked to think faster and faster and use his fingers dexterously. Earlier we mentioned how difficult it was to find games that have an excellent retro aesthetic and equally excellent chiptune music and then mix them together and obtain an absolutely unique nostalgic feeling. Well, Shaun Inman did it brilliantly, proposing a graphic that, despite the simple animations and a color palette limited to green and yellow, is characterized by a splendid and lively pixel art, as rarely found on the App Store . In the same way, the work done for the sound component has obtained so much appreciation from the players that the author had to satisfy them by publishing the 12 chiptune songs on the official website.
