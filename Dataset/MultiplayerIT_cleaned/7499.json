This time the collaboration involved the Californian team NimbleBit, in charge of creating a version of Tiny Tower completely set in the galaxy far, far away. The result is Star Wars: Tiny Death Star, a free to play management system that incorporates the same and identical mechanics of Tiny Tower, leaves the interface intact and is limited only to replacing graphics and texts: the goal is to create the most impressive Death Black. Maybe avoiding this time that the rebels blow it up... Tiny Death Star mixes the mechanics of Tiny Tower with the Star Wars universe Aren't you a bit short to be a Bit-tadino? As already anticipated, Tiny Death Star is nothing but Tiny Tower revisited in Starwarsian theme. For this, those hoping to pulverize Alderaan, capture the Millennium Falcon with a tractor beam, or come face to face with Rogue Squadron should look elsewhere. One plan after another, the goal is therefore to create a commercial empire made up of restaurants, services, shops and refreshment areas, hiring the Bit-tadini who gradually decide to move into the residential halls of the Death Star. Just like in Tiny Tower, even in this case each Bit-tadino has different skills and a dream job, and so the player's goal is to sort the various employees into the jobs where they are most productive, evicting the incompetent and creating space for new recruits. Optimizing one's time therefore becomes a priority, but in addition to hiring characters and restocking goods to shops, the main activity of the player is to manage the elevator, which is essential for transporting visitors in exchange for a tip. Like all free to play management software, the shops of your Death Star continue to accumulate money even when you are not playing (albeit more slowly), and so the entire game economy is based on continuously repeating the same and identical actions until you have enough credits to buy a new level or to replace the elevator with a faster and more effective one. In short, those who have played Tiny Tower know well how much the formula proposed by NimbleBit can indeed represent a real drug during the very first game sessions, but at the same time end up expiring very soon in a frustrating cycle of ups and downs, actions that are always the same and increasingly frequent push notifications. However, it is evident how much care and dedication the US developer has tried to respect the Star Wars franchise and its fans: all the Bit-tadini are based on characters and races from Lucas' galaxy, while the various rooms are inspired by places and planets well known to enthusiasts. Thus it happens to see a Nautolano running on the treadmill of a gym, a Mon Calamari managing a spa, a Bothan taking care of a karaoke and the head of a Tauntaun hanging on the wall of a museum. There are also iconic locations such as the Rancor arena, the Emperor's room or the Mos Eisley tavern, complete with Greedo sitting at one of the tables. The same goes for the characters, given that it will often happen to receive a visit from special Bit-tadini, such as Boba Fett, Han Solo, Obi-Wan, Leia and Luke. It must be said that if the vast majority of the contents are taken forcefully from the old trilogy, there is no shortage of settings, races and characters that appeared in the prequels, such as Kaminoans, Geonosians and... Gungans (yes, unfortunately there is also Jar Jar). Every time a new race, a new character or a new setting is unlocked, these will be recorded in a small album complete with accompanying information. To add a pinch of variety, but not too much, we think the small missions assigned by Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader, which ask you to complete a series of requirements, such as building specific rooms, hiring a certain number of employees or supplying own shops completely. What in Tiny Tower was called Bitbook in this case becomes the HoloNet, but the substance is the same: it is a sort of small social network in which the various Bit-tadini publish updates on their life in the Death Star, reports with colleagues or difficulties at work. Too bad that this time too it is an addition without real use, when instead we would have liked to see it more integrated into the gameplay and mission system. From an aesthetic point of view, however, the Force flows powerfullyand in those few pixels that make up characters and backdrops: everything is extremely funny, just as lively and amusing is the arrangement of some of the best-known musical themes. It's really a pity that the humor of the dialogues almost completely wears out in the first few minutes of the game.", "date": "2013-11-12", "grade": "7.8"}
