Do you want to relax and invest your time in some simple and non-stressful activity? Or are you always looking for a challenge? Do you prefer to maximize your every action? Or maybe you just continue doing the minimum necessary? It doesn't matter what your answer is, because Dorfromantik can be played any way you like. Whether you are looking for a relaxing game in which you create a bucolic landscape or a strategic puzzle game where you think about every move, the small but large game from Toukana Interactive has something for you. After a period of Early Access, the developers have released version 1.0, available from April 28, 2022 on PC. Let's see all the details in our Dorfromantik review. One card at a time A small Dorfromantik board How does Dorfromantik work? The idea is very simple. The game starts with a single tile, which you place on a board. To the right, we have a column of tiles. We can see the tile we are about to place and the next two. The objective of a game is usually to score points by placing the tile in the best possible way. Each tile is basically a piece of a landscape and, on its six sides, can have a series of elements, such as trees, a cultivated field, barren land, water, houses and more. If the newly placed tile touches squares with equal sides, it scores more points. Also, some tiles will trigger missions, such as ~create a forest with a certain number of trees~ or ~a cornfield with enough squares~ and so on. Completing missions allows you to obtain additional tiles and avoid ending our game too soon. In fact, in the classic mode, we have a limited number of tiles and our ultimate goal is a ~simple~ score hunt, before they run out. You must therefore optimize your moves to survive as long as possible and at the same time get more points. It might seem very trivial at first glance, but there are some limits, such as streams or rails that cannot be connected to different squares. Some missions also ask you to create thematic areas with an exact number of tiles. If you want to set world records, in a nutshell, you have to play very carefully (and maybe be helped by a little luck). Mode You can also play with infinite tiles in Dorformantik As we said, however, Dorfromantik is not just a game for those who want a challenge. On the contrary, there are many possibilities for light games. First of all, you can simply disinterest in making real records and play to calmly unlock various objectives, which accumulate even between multiple games, such as placing a certain number of tiles or obtaining a certain number of points. These macro-goals allow you to unlock graphic variants of various game elements, such as lavender fields instead of wheat fields. These aesthetic elements can change the graphic style of the game a lot, passing from spring to winter environments for example, so as to always make new games fresh. In a few hours various elements are unlocked, so even if you are not looking for high-level challenges you can still have the feeling of being getting something from your sessions. Then there are completely Zen modes, such as the creative one. In this version, Dorfromantik sets no limits. We have as many tiles as we want, we can discard them and there are no scores. You can therefore approach the game as if it were a blank canvas and you are a painter who wants to create a huge work of art made up of houses, woods, rivers with boats, railway stations from which trains depart and more. The graphic shades of Dorfromantik can change Then there are quick modes, with objectives that can be completed within a matter of minutes, for those who may not want to spend too much time on the game. Score hunting can in fact take away dozens and dozens of minutes without difficulty. Also pleasant is the fact that, once a game is lost, the map is not canceled but can be moved to creative mode, so as to continue one's creation. Then there is also a difficult mode, for those looking for a serious challenge, and a completely customized mode, which allows you to choose the type of tiles to appear and how often. You can also choose the level of challenge of the missions and high details, to create the experience that best suits you. Art You can create a small world according to your taste in Dorfromantik As you may have understood, the core of Dorfromantik is to allow the player to chooseexactly how to approach each gaming session. Plus, it's visually delightful. Even unintentionally, simply playing in classic mode will generate a beautiful landscape in which villages, woods and rivers blend perfectly. The background music is also pleasant without being dominant, creating a relaxing atmosphere. It is clear that there are no particularly complex game mechanics. We're not talking about a resource management or 4X strategy game. The development team confirms that they have no plans to include these types of modes. There won't even be multiplayer: perhaps this is the only lack, as it would have been very interesting to create landscapes in a cooperative way, or compete to see who reaches a certain score with the same set of tiles. However, these are only our fantasies and show that we would like to play Dorfromantik in many different ways, because the basic idea is very simple, but very pleasant.", "date": "2022-05-12", "grade": "8.5"}
