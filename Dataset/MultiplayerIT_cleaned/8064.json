We liked the 11 bit studios title very much, both on PC and on iOS devices, even if in the latter case the developers have opted for a somewhat reduced interpretation of the experience, eliminating the missions set in Tokyo and the characteristic of the commander who, on foot, guided the vehicles towards the various objectives and was responsible for collecting any power-ups, all tasks left in the hands of the users via the touch interface. Well, the sequel, Anomaly Korea, is finally ready, and we can immediately say that it is a slap-up production. Made in this case only for mobile platforms (therefore no PC and Mac, unless you change your mind), the game offers twelve increasingly intense missions and an extra mode, ~Arte Bellica~. The latter is made up of six particularly difficult levels, each based on a different upgrade, which must be completed strictly without losing a single unit. Not a feat for everyone, in short. The war against the machines The mysterious metal towers that landed on Earth in the first episode of the series are back, and this time their target is Korea. At the end of a nice cinematic introduction, Anomaly Korea does a quick command recall and introduces us to the mechanics that fans of the game are already familiar with. As in a ~tower defense~ on the contrary, in each map we control the path of a platoon of vehicles that must move between streets besieged by hostile positions, with the aim sometimes of eliminating all enemies, sometimes of reaching certain areas of the scenario. The touch interface is very clear and functional: in the upper right part of the screen there are two icons that allow us to pause the action and set the route (instantaneously switching to the strategic view of the map) or manage the troops, buying new units or by upgrading existing ones if we have enough money. There are obviously some innovations compared to the original chapter in terms of vehicles, see for example the Horangi tank, capable of firing energy shots and loading a special projectile based on destroyed targets, or the Dragon, an armored vehicle equipped with powerful flamethrowers , lethal from short range. New upgrades also stand out, such as the one that amplifies power and attack range and allows us to make our units extraordinarily effective for a few meters. Likewise, new enemy units appear, some of which are really difficult. Hard to last The solutions adopted by 11 bit studios in Anomaly: Warzone Earth are therefore enriched in various aspects and the developers have also managed to increase the variety of missions, with a substantial extension of time only in the final part and a truly deadly last level, which we are managed to complete only after several attempts (always keeping the intermediate difficulty). Unfortunately, it's when the action heats up that certain interface mechanisms end up stepping on each other's toes. Maybe we need to quickly activate an upgrade to repair units and therefore we select it from the left of the touch screen, but at the same time an object to be collected appears on the map and, in an attempt to take it, we involuntarily waste the special ability in a deserted area of the scenario . These are relatively rare situations because the game often gives us time to think and therefore to make the touches correctly, but the fact remains that they occur precisely when we have so many guns on us, irreparably triggering episodes of frustration for a game over that could have been avoided. We must also add that twelve missions, in the end, are not many: the first episode had fifteen despite the elimination of the internships set in Tokyo, so it was reasonable to expect a little more in terms of duration, also because the ~Art~ mode Bellica~ offers only a series of challenges for their own sake. Finally the technical sector. The graphics have been improved in terms of detail, with settings that are really beautiful to look at but inevitably heavy to manage, and on a third-generation iPad you can see some shots during the briefings, when an overview of the location is made. Beyond this minor inconvenience though, you can't really complain: a job has been doneexcellent and even the audio sector is up to the task.", "date": "2013-01-08", "grade": "8.8"}
