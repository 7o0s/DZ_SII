{"name": "SSX 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ssx-3_a.html", "text": "Downhill domination For those unfamiliar with the EA series, suffice it to say that it is undoubtedly the most extreme version of snowboarding, at the antipodes of what Microsoft offers with Amped; SSX is the apotheosis and at the same time the celebration of exaggeration. Playing the EA Big effort means tackling crevasses, jumping ravines, jumping off peaks with a slope dangerously close to 90, it means tackling ramps of insane heights to make inhuman jumps, to be seasoned abundantly with stunts that no one sane could conceive. SSX takes the snowboard as we know it, turns it inside out, and gives it back to us, observing us with a mocking smile. It goes without saying that, at this point, simulation fanatics can finish reading at all costs, aware however that they are thus missing out on one of the funniest productions of recent years. Compared to the previous chapters, SSX 3 offers an astonishingly revolutionized main game mode: in summary, the player is called to choose his alter ego from a group of characters, only to then try his hand at what is a real challenge against the nature. The final goal is to ~conquer the mountain~, as the name of the mode in question suggests; the entire game is in fact set on a huge peak, which is in turn divided into 3 peaks. Each of the latter is divided into sections to be tackled, starting from the summit up to the valley. The peculiarity of all this, which is also one of the most successful ideas of the team of programmers, lies in the complete freedom of ~navigation~ inside the mountain; in other words, the various slopes do not become the scene of the action subject to their selection through the classic menus, but on the contrary they can be reached ~with the snowboard on your feet~ without interruption. Let's explain ourselves better: after being deposited by the helicopter on the tip of one of the peaks, and after having descended the first section, you can continue freely until you reach the next section. Where ~A~ represents the first runway, and ~C~ the second, the connection ~B~ between the two is not represented by a menu, but by a further short section that can be traveled on. To what has been described are added the numerous crossroads, which also serve as a choice for the different types of competition; for example, it may happen that you have to choose between continuing the descent to the right, going to face a speed race, or to the left, where a challenge based on tricks and evolutions awaits. To the two different playful proposals offered by SSX 3 just mentioned, a third is added, the freeride: as the name suggests, the purpose in this case is to collect all the snowflake-shaped icons scattered within the settings, but not only. In fact, during the descent it will be possible to encounter light beams which, once crossed, will offer more or less short missions capable of ranging from crossing gates scattered along the track, to slalom descent, to killing puppets, to collecting objects and so on. An exceptional variety therefore, certainly capable of setting new standards within this vein, but which however would be completely useless if not supported by playability up to par. Fortunately, this is not the case with SSX 3. Stalefish forever The result of an optimization process that started from the first chapter of the series, SSX3 can count on playability with sensational solidity and brilliance. Whether it is a question of obtaining the maximum possible speed by focusing solely on the track, or rather of carrying out the most spectacular evolutions, the control system designed by EA Big responds to the orders given by the user without ever betraying. When comparing the various platforms, it is clear that this has been studied and designed with the Playstation 2 pad in mind; nevertheless, a few more hours of practice are enough for Microsoft and Nintendo users to gain the required level of familiarity. The behavior of your boarder, for his part, represents a perfect compromise between the crazy spirit of the series and the need to still give the feeling of actually being in the middle of snowy expanses. For this reason, if landing perfectly balanced after 50m flights seems like the most natural thing in the world, at the same time the player fully enjoys the differences between the various types of surfaces, whether it is fresh snow, packed snow, ice and so saying. Although perfectly enjoyable even in its racing sense, on the occasion of the already mentioned races to see who crosses the finish line first, it is evidentthat one of the cornerstones of SSX 3 and of the entire series is the spectacularity of the tricks; this last chapter fully falls within the philosophy of the ~bigger and better~ so dear beyond the ocean, in fact proposing animations so absurd and elaborate as to force you to look at any other snowboarding game with a different eye. Especially with regard to the ~ubertrick~, the American designers have indulged themselves, going to conceive truly indescribable evolutions. As for the technical aspect, SSX 3 also manages to reach levels of excellence in this case from practically every point of view; the engine created by EA Big is a real colossus, capable of offering environments rich in details, with brilliant textures and a phenomenal visual depth. Above all, the perfect use of streaming from disk is surprising, which guarantees a continuous flow of data without which it would not have been possible to present the mountain as a single entity, and not as an unrelated series of slopes. To enhance this technical solution intervenes what is probably the clearest and most evident demonstration of the talent of the EA programmers, namely the descent from the top of peak 3 to the valley of peak 1; translated, it means half an hour of continuous play. Yes, you read that right: half an hour, 30 minutes marked by the on-screen timer during which it actually seems difficult to concentrate on one's performance, overwhelmed by the exceptional nature of the experience offered. Evidently not satisfied with all this, the team responsible for the project added a series of special effects capable of modifying the setting before their eyes: these can be the crash of an airplane that knocks down trees and houses or rather the blow of a cannon, a remnant of the world war, which knocks down the vault of the gallery we were about to enter or a snowstorm of unusual violence. Aware of its own abilities, EA Big even wanted to mimic Nintendo and its long-awaited 1080 Avalanche, proposing ~its~ version of the avalanche behind the unfortunate player. The absolutely majestic sound system deserves a dutiful mention: the monumental quantity of songs present is in fact cemented by the presence of probably the most credible DJ we have ever heard, thanks to the exorbitant number of different phrases he is able to pronounce. The online mode, present only for Ps2, represents an added value that should not be underestimated, capable of further increasing the already high overall longevity. We conclude by dedicating the last few lines to the possibility of personalizing one's own rider: we realize that the text is literally stuffed with superlatives, but even in this case it is difficult to describe otherwise the ability to change not only its appearance in a radical way with dozens and dozens of different elements, but also the characteristics (to be improved by buying them for money) and even choosing which uberricks to perform from a large list. Stalefish forever Comment SSX 3 is a real gem, a title whose purchase is practically a must for anyone who has at least the slightest interest in this type of production; the intelligence and talent of the EA Big team have made it possible to create a game capable of bringing with it a real step forward compared to the previous episodes from every point of view, smoothing out the imperfections and adding ideas and elements that are simply spot on from the first to the last . In conclusion, what emerges is a product capable of leaving its mark, as well as one of the best games ever to appear during this generation of consoles. Pros: An exciting gaming experience Technically excellent Control system almost perfect Cons: Online only on Ps2 Some objectives perhaps too difficult Electronic Arts undoubtedly represents one of the most important and powerful software houses in the world: capable of moving absolutely gigantic amounts of money in the space of a year, owner of numerous labels and licensee of names of absolute appeal, the US giant has churned out some of the titles that have been most successful on the latest generation consoles. Among these, certainly one of the best ~original~ series is SSX, a spectacular and over the top snowboard game that has, among other things, consecrated the talent of the EA Big team. Three years after the release of the progenitor on Ps2, the American label offers the third chapter of the successful franchise, very simply titled SSX 3.", "date": "2003-11-14", "grade": null}
