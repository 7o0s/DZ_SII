{"name": "Chuzzle Mobile", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/chuzzle-mobile.html", "text": "To give life to a quality puzzle game, you basically need two things: a good idea, and a quality team capable of making it better. On this last aspect, with Chuzzle Mobile you can be more than calm. The game was in fact made by PopCap Games, authors of authentic blockbusters known by millions of people such as Bejeweled and Zuma, and therefore in terms of experience not inferior to anyone. And for the idea? Let's start with a brief description: Chuzzle, which has already been available for PCs for a couple of years, puts in front of the player a grid of creatures in the shape of small balls of colored fur with eyes (the chuzzles). The goal, as per tradition, is simply to bring together at least 3 balls -not necessarily in a row- of the same color, to see them burst and thus fill the score bar at the bottom of the screen. Once full, you can access the next level. Obviously managing to explode groups of four or five chuzzles, or creating combinations, you will get more points to reach the goal with greater speed. Unlike the aforementioned Bejeweled, in this case, however, it is not allowed to move the balls individually; on the contrary, the only way is to act on an entire row or column, by scrolling it up or down. There are some particular situations, such as the appearance of chained balls that block the entire line, or huge chuzzles as big as four normal ones. However, the fact that there is no time limit nor any type of penalty for useless maneuvers makes the PopCap Games production a little different from standard puzzle games; Chuzzle Mobile can in fact be as relaxing and fun for some, as uninspiring for others. Fortunately, the programmers have introduced four game modes with which to try their hand, and capable of providing an excellent variety to the whole; in addition to the classic one, in fact, you can choose the difficult one, the zen mode (without limit) and the puzzle, in which it is necessary to replicate a pre-established figure with the creatures. There is also a trophy room, to be filled by achieving particular objectives. The technical aspect is also very accurate; in addition to colorful and well-made graphics (the creatures that cry as you are about to exit the game are priceless), with the chuzzles characterized perfectly, the sound is also of quality thanks to spot-on and never annoying music. PRO Very funny Curated in every respect Good longevity AGAINST Uninspiring for some Not very original", "date": "2007-06-18", "grade": "S.V."}
