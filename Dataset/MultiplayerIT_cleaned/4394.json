To fully answer this question would require all the space we have available for this review, and even more. The twenty-first century seems to want to experience more and more nostalgia for the years in which the Internet had not yet penetrated all aspects of our lives, leaving the doors of the imagination wide open while technology and society took giant steps in their evolution. It is no coincidence that we still like so much about that decade there are the stories that were told to us during it, when everything seemed possible. Stories that often featured simple boys as protagonists, involved in fantastic adventures such as those experienced in ET, The Goonies, Stand By Me and so on. In recent times, the fire of nostalgia for 80s ~teen movies~ has flared up again with Stranger Things, a television series that the creators of Crossing Souls were undoubtedly inspired by, together with the films we mentioned earlier. All this preamble to say that after about a year from the appetizer granted to us by the Spanish team Fourattic, the time has finally come to give our definitive opinion on this adventure with strong nostalgic hues, funded at the end of 2014 via Kickstarter. I remember one summer The narrative component is naturally one of the foundations of Crossing Souls, set in a small town in California in 1986. If you belong to the generation that made the films we mentioned in the introduction into cults, you will already know more or less where this is going: we are at the beginning of summer, in the company of a group of friends who, after making a macabre discovery, find themselves in the midst of an extraordinary adventure, halfway between political conspiracy and the paranormal. The ~crossing souls~ that give the title to this game are in fact those of its protagonists, who will soon be able to obtain the power to merge the world of the living with the Duat, the underworld of Ancient Egypt where the souls of the dead. An extraordinary power, capable of attracting the attention of the evil Major Oh Rus, who together with his henchmen intend to exploit it to satisfy his thirst for conquest of the whole world. Being very careful not to reveal anything else about the plot, what we can say about it is that despite its derivative nature it manages to maintain its own identity, displacing the player precisely in the moments in which the clichs seem to have the upper hand. In this way mature and non-trivial themes manage to coexist with the many elements inherited from the historic adventures of the 80s, alternating between moments marked by a certain level of drama and others in which easy irony reigns supreme. The composition of the quintet of protagonists also belongs to the classic schemes: the first is Chris, leader of the group with a generous heart but a little too impulsive. To accompany him we find in order of appearance Matt, a figure corresponding instead to the stereotype of the bespectacled nerd, able to make up for the lack of physical prowess with his intelligence and his inventions (he is equipped with a laser gun and rocket-shoes). Big Joe, on the other hand, is the strong guy of the group, useful when there is something heavy to move or to get away with a fistfight, while the penultimate figure is Beverly Marsh (just to bring up It too) of the situation: Charlie, a girl with a strong character struggling with a problematic father, on whom more or less everyone seems to have a crush. The last of the group is Kevin, Chris's brother apparently skilled only at bursting chewing gum and throwing farts: he too, going forward in the story, will however be able to make himself useful in a very particular way. All for one, one for all After starting as Chris, the first hour of Crossing Souls is spent getting to know the other elements that make up the gang. Once all five characters are collected, the player continues to control only one on-screen, with the ability to switch between them at any time. When there is a need to climb, for example, it is necessary to make use of Chris and his skills, while to make long jumps between one platform and another it may be necessary to resort to Matt and his special shoes. From the early stages in which we become familiar with the game, we are gradually faced with more complicated situations, which we can get out of by making the protagonists collaborate. Even if there are some puzzles, Crossing Souls is closer to the world of platformers than to that of graphic adventures, thus setting its own dynamics on the ~trial and error~ mechanismr~ which was common in video games of yesteryear. Nothing impossible, mind you, we are still in 2018 and the patience of gamers is no longer what it used to be: the best that can happen is having to retry a fight against a boss a couple of times to learn the patterns properly, or start over boss a series of jumps before arriving at the desired point. Between one development and another of the plot there is no way to get bored, also thanks to some mini-games that also pay homage to some video game genres of the past: let's not go further, so as not to spoil the pleasure of discovering for yourself what it deals with. Wanting to find fault with the dynamics of Crossing Souls, we can say that the Spanish trio of Fourattic could perhaps have organized some phase to make the protagonists of the game collaborate more deeply. As for the puzzles, the player has as many options for the fights as there are characters (minus one): while we have already talked about Matt and Big Joe's abilities, Chris has a baseball bat at his disposal with which to repel blows, while Charlie is equipped with a whip useful for getting out of situations where multiple enemies present themselves. The latter very often come from the realm of the dead, thus being able to enjoy particular abilities. The various bosses are all quite inspired and fun to face: don't expect impossible opponents to beat, given that as already indicated, the difficulty peaks reached by the video games of the era from which Crossing Souls is inspired are not reached. Nostalgia for the author The romantic charge of Crossing Souls finds a very valid ally in the technical sector of the game, completely aligned also from this point of view to the 80s. The emblem of all this is represented by the room of Chris and Kevin, shown at the beginning of the adventure: a perfect photograph of what could have been the corner of life of any teenager, with a console attached to a CRT television , posters of Michael Jackson and the Ghostbusters (there are many references to this and other films from the same period) and a pair of walkie talkies for remote communication. The pixelated graphics take us back to the old graphic adventures by LucasArts, with an almost obsessive attention to detail. From the animations to the elements on the screen, it can be seen that the three guys from Fourattic have dedicated a lot of time to refining the look of their creature, particularly inspired also in the music entrusted to Chris Kbke and Timecop1983. For the dialogues there is no speech but everything is shown on the screen in English, leaving room for some animated cutscenes for the most intense moments of the plot. Even if you play on PC, keep in mind that the developers themselves recommend the use of a controller to obtain better precision in the movements, as well as greater simplicity in managing the commands.", "date": "2018-02-22", "grade": "8.0"}
