{"name": "Harvest Moon Magical Melody - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/harvest-moon-magical-melody-recensione.html", "text": "The Harvest Moon series, created by Yasuhiro Wada more than ten years ago on Super Nintendo, has reached its umpteenth chapter, after having appeared on practically all consoles, passing from the Game Boy up to the next-gen machines, with the online chapter expected for next year. Harvest Moon: Magical Melody is a game released two years ago on Game Cube, now adapted to the ~miracle~ console Nintendo Wii thanks to the developer Marvelous Interactive and Nintendo itself. The game, poorly distributed in our continent due to the lack of success of Game Cube, can therefore find its own dignity and proper visibility thanks to this conversion. Let's find out together how the new and innovative features of Nintendo Wii have been integrated! The series goes back to its origins The series is one of the historical ones, although it is basically a niche one. The large group of enthusiasts who follow it, however, have never abandoned it and the producer of the Natsume series now produces more than one chapter per generation. Harvest Moon is a perfect mix between a management and a role-playing game, centered on life on the farm and in social relationships with the various characters present. The genre is very particular, just like every Natsume game, for example the fishing rpg Legend of the River King and Legend of the Sea King on Nitendo 64. The objectives of Harvest Moon: Magical Melody are basically two: carry on your own farm, including dealing with the neighborhood, and awakening the ~Harvest Goddess~, who was reduced to stone after the inhabitants stopped believing in her. During the game it is necessary to collect and collect the notes that make up the melody that can awaken the divinity. Harvest Moon is dotted with mini-games in every corner: thanks to them we can unlock achievements, collect notes or improve certain aspects of our rural activities. The bucolic country life has never been so full of things to do: you start very early in the morning and end up in the evening lying down in bed. Bucolic country life has never been so full of activity The series goes back to its origins At the beginning we were given the option of choosing where to live: next to the river, near the town, or in front of the sea. Deciding where to start farming greatly influences the game, for example by changing the fertility of the soil, the climate and the availability of fish and other raw materials. Compared to the Game Cube version, inexplicably, the possibility of being able to choose the female character has been eliminated: with all due respect to the fairer sex, it will no longer be possible to marry one's prince charming, but we will have to settle for the beautiful Katie. Marriage is just one of the many social aspects involved in the game. Just like in Animal Crossing, you have to manage the neighborhood and relationships with many characters around our house. Through the excellent window menus, every parameter is constantly taken into account: how much they love us for example, but also our health, the level of growth of the various crops, fishing and livestock. With this chapter, the series goes back slightly to its origins, leaving the user with greater freedom of choice and customization of the character, activities and location. The perfect rural life simulator Great freedom has also been granted for the interior decoration of the house, for which the player will be spoiled for choice, being able to buy, sell, move furniture and accessories in a very similar way to what was experienced in Animal Crossing by Nintendo. Over time, our house gets bigger and bigger, until we get two floors and more space for the surrounding land. Particular attention was also given to the cast of characters, varied and well characterized despite the total absence of audio speech, to which the text (in Italian) is once again preferred, framed by comic balloons. Curious the possibility of cooking food using vegetables, meat and eggs fruit of your own sweat. The village where Harvest Moon takes place is located between the hills and the sea, with a pretty river flowing right next to it. It is initially very small, but new characters and shops start to open over time once we are able to produce more supplies and agricultural products. The heart of the city is the square, where festivals and meetings are set up, while in the suburbs there are houses and shops selling all kinds of objects, from animals, seeds, work tools and more. Longevity, graphics and sound The Nintendo Wii version of Harvest Moon: Magical Melody does not exploit much of the innovative potential of the console. The basic controls, the movement of the character and the choices throughRso the window menus are made through the combination of the analog stick and the A key of the remote control: in short, using the old GameCube pad would have been the exact same thing. Moving through the choice menus using the analog is decidedly frustrating, if we think that it would have been possible to implement a simple pointer on the screen, much less tiring and infinitely faster. There is no real ~progression~ in the game, it is a sort of ~Sims~ in which there are no clear objectives or particular missions: you just have to live and increase your crops. The lack of a strong storyline or announced objectives could bore more than one person: Harvest Moon needs time, a lot of time. We will only find out that we have unlocked a particular achievement after completing it, not before. From the point of view of the technical realization, we must say that the years that Magical Melody carries with it can be felt by everyone. Already at the time of its release on the Nintendo Game Cube it was not one of the most graphically striking titles, much less today on the Wii. The style is the colorful and cute one of super deformed cartoons, very similar to what has already been seen in MySims, an Electronic Arts title released this winter. There aren't a ton of polygons on screen, no effects, and textures are decidedly subdued. The graphics are still nice and colorful, suitable for the game genre, but after two years it would have been reasonable to expect at least a small aesthetic upgrade, given that it still runs at 50hz. As far as music and sound effects are concerned, there is a scarce variety of sounds and very simple songs with endless loops that get boring very quickly. Also from this point of view, Marvelous could certainly intervene. Comment Harvest Moon: Magical Melody is a good chapter in the series, but it turns out to be a listless conversion of the original GameCube, furthermore undermined by inexplicable problems such as the absence of a pointer on the screen and the partial use of the Wii remote in the rest of the game. The gameplay goes back a bit to its origins, thus giving the player more possibilities to change the surrounding environment, home and character. In the Wii version the female character has been eliminated and no graphic or sound improvements have been made. Much more could have been done, but the game is still nice, enjoyable (even with these controls) and recommended for every fan of the series. Pros Unique game genre and gameplay Increased customization options Lots of things to do and manage Cons Removed the female character Outdated graphics Frustrating controls It is also possible to upgrade our work tools: as we use them, the experience in their use grows, and therefore efficiency increases hand in hand. Activities in Harvest Moon aren't limited to farming and ranching, but also include fishing and mining, both performed with the flick of the Wii Remote. The secondary activities of the game, as previously mentioned, also include the search for musical notes, obtainable by discovering new places, producing a certain amount of products to sell, but also after bizarre tests such as staying up all night. Once you reach 50 notes it is possible to awaken the Goddess of the Harvest, who has the ability to give us strength and health when we need it. Animals include horses, cows, chickens and sheep, as well as domestic pigs and dogs. Harvest Moon takes place over a period of time that lasts for years, divided by the marking of the four seasons, well characterized by the ever-changing climate.", "date": "2008-04-08", "grade": null}
