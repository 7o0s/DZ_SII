Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out a cent. There's a new sheriff in town, and he's made up his mind to capture and lock up all the strays. However, a brave golden retriever decides to escape the noose and makes a real escape for freedom, which soon involves other dogs; a group race opposed by police cars, who set off in pursuit with sirens blaring. Developed by Big Pixel Studios, Off the Leash therefore presents itself as a different endless runner from the usual, characterized by a top view and a control system based on a simple combination of tilt and touch commands. Indeed, it is necessary to tilt the device for our dog and his friends to change direction within the scenario, in order to avoid obstacles that could produce defections among their ranks, while touching the screen results in a slowdown of the run and in a ~compacting ~ of the group, essential when the pitfalls are many or you want to collect a particularly useful upgrade. As often happens for this kind of product, along the way we will in fact find a large number of objects, mainly coins and food. The former are used to purchase bonuses, customizations, scenarios and the all-important whistle which, by calling the terrible ~big dog~ (an actually gigantic dog), will give us the opportunity to resume the game after the police checkpoint he will have stopped us. Food instead produces an increase in the pups ~level~, filling a gauge that affects movement speed. Wow! Considering that the structure of Off the Leash does not consist of a single ~survival~ style race, but in a classic checkpoint system, it is clear that the collection of certain objects becomes essential in order to cover ever greater distances. Every now and then a chilli pepper happens which, swallowed, gives us a momentary boost forward, or a clock that gives us a few extra seconds, or even a magnet to take coins in an easier way. Once you get used to the controls and obstacles, it happens that one game leads to another and the experience with the game really begins to take, supported by an achievement system that adds value to our performance and sets three goals every time to be completed in order to proceed to the next list. The free nature of the product certainly makes downloading it advisable, even if there are some dynamics that force you to put a hand in your wallet, at least for the 79 cents needed to purchase the 50,000 coins needed to unlock the second scenario. In fact, reaching this amount of tokens in the normal way would really require a huge number of attempts. Finally, a few words on the technical sector: the graphics are well designed, with a very nice and spot-on style, and make good use of colours; while the sound accompaniment, despite being limited to a single song, is well done and engaging.", "date": "2012-06-02", "grade": "7.8"}
