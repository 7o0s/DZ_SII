However, if for home consoles the no-holds-barred fight between Fifa (which at least tried with the Street series) and Pes has cannibalized every experiment in this sense, on the contrary, on mobile platforms a more fun and immediate, while still remaining in general far from the concept of pure arcade. In this perspective, Soccer Superstars supports the much more famous mobile versions of Fifa, Pes, Real Soccer or X2 Football on the App Store; although all these games have in common the denomination of football, we can safely define the title in question as an ~atypical~ exponent of the genre. In the balance between Holly and Fifa Once you start the application, simply by looking at the initial logo depicting a typical Japanese manga-style character, you immediately realize how Soccer Superstars isn't your usual serious soccer game. Entering the main menu, however, you will immediately find all the familiar elements related to productions of the same genre: in addition to starting the actual game, you can therefore choose to change the game options, watch the tutorial or enter a tiny editor, only useful for changing the name of the players, all totally made up. However, where Soccer Superstars amazes is in the incredible variety of game modes present, truly comparable to those of a ~serious~ football game: you can therefore select the classic friendly exhibition match, the cup, the complete season (complete with managerial elements), a fun scenario mode in which we will have to reverse the fate of compromised matches in a few minutes and even a sort of professional league, called My Season, in which to create and grow your own digital alter ego in football. Alongside these choices, the practical ~Recent Match~ function should also be mentioned: by selecting it, in fact, it will be possible to resume the last match left pending, even after some time, without the need to go and load it manually, remembering which type of competition it was in. present. If up to this point the differences with any other football title seem to be really minimal, the first peculiarity that will make you change your mind about it is as soon as you enter the pre-match menu, regardless of the chosen mode (except in My Season and in the scenarios): for to reinforce the starting eleven it will be necessary to select one of four super players (two immediately available plus two others that can be unlocked by continuing in the game) to join the team, able to perform special shots that are difficult to intercept by the goalkeepers. Each super player will have a type of shot that he can use for a maximum of 2 times in the same match; as an example, the robotic super player will be able to hurl a fireball of unprecedented power while a pretty young lady will carry out graceful and acrobatic flying conclusions. After all these juicy premises, grappling with the actual game it was reasonable to expect a highly entertaining and playable product; however, Soccer Superstars responds to these characteristics only partially. The controls are delegated to a rather small virtual stick on the left, which is flanked by the traditional buttons for passing and shooting positioned at the bottom right; only for super players will the additional S key be available, which will activate the super shot. Technically speaking, if on the one hand the choice of comic graphics, simple but nice in the old isometric side view, appears to be apt, from the gameplay point of view we are faced with a hybrid product, not easily classifiable. A game that should make the show and the ease of scoring actions its cornerstone actually requires a not negligible tactical commitment; although this is not necessarily a bad thing, analyzing it from a purely simulation point of view it does not compare in the least with the other titles on the App Store, due to non-existent physics and barely sketched artificial intelligence. The control system, while not shining for precision, allows you to master the players quite well, especially after the recent update released which has improved both the management of the passes and that of the shots. Even the audio sector fully represents this strangenessambivalence: the repetitive and unoriginal jingles of the menus in fact clash decisively with the sound effects taken from the playing field, certainly not excellent but still quite acceptable. Finally, it is a pity for the lack of online modalities, not even locally, and for the presence of only national ones, characteristics that would have guaranteed an improvement in the longevity and general quality of the title.
