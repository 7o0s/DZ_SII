{"name": "Mega Man Powered Up", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mega-man-powered-up.html", "text": "Young outside, old inside Mega Man Powered Up presents itself as a sort of remake to the nth degree of the first title in the series, which originally appeared on the NES almost twenty years ago. For the few who do not know the history of the little blue man, it is enough to know that it is the progenitor of the platform / shooters, a real milestone also characterized by a decidedly unconventional level of difficulty. Mega Man Powered Up therefore takes all the innate characteristics of the classic Capcom and pours them onto the PSP in two different modes, appropriately called ~Old Style~ and ~New Style~. As it is legitimate to guess, the first makes available to the user the exact same levels of the original, with updated cosmetics but vintage music and sound effects; the second, on the other hand, offers internships with a renewed design, two unpublished bosses and more, and for this reason it definitely proves to be the most worthy of attention. As we said, the levels have been redesigned both in terms of display - in order to make the most of the PSP screen - and above all in terms of their structure, enriched by a whole series of areas that were previously unreachable for Mega Man: this is because the New Style mode contemplates the possibility of being able to play as the eight bosses of the game, provided you defeat them without the help of special weapons. The exploitation of the peculiar abilities of the various characters therefore plays in favor of the replay value, but with some serious limitations: the downside in the use of the bosses lies in fact in their inability to use any other weapon other than the default one, with also evident repercussions in the enjoyment of the fights. Beyond this, however, the gameplay of Powered Up perfectly follows the classic Mega Man, without therefore even trying to reconcile the clear split that has always characterized the impressions of users in front of the Capcom series: also in this case it is therefore about love or hate, either for the extremely old school play structure of the game, or for the high level of difficulty (despite the inclusion of three different steps in this sense). Building the future As mentioned in the introduction, however, Mega Man Powered Up is not a slavish remake, but adds interesting modes alongside the two main ones described above. First of all, the full-bodied Challenge Mode should be noted, which offers the beauty of 100 challenges of various kinds: under the command of different characters, you are called to complete missions ranging from the simple achievement of a flag by jumping from one platform to another up to others that require you to eliminate a certain number of enemies within a set time, and so on. Here too the level of difficulty is not exactly affordable, with challenges capable of putting skill and patience to a serious test, but from Mega Man one certainly could not have expected otherwise. However, the real ace up the sleeve of the Capcom product is the level editor, which allows you to create a scenario from scratch and - listen, listen - share it with other PSP users via the network. Characterized by a discreet ease of use and interface comfort, the editor offers the possibility of using a vast series of elements, many of which can also be unlocked during the actual game. But more than the purely creative side (it is not certain that all users are interested in producing stages) what is striking about this aspect of Mega Man Powered Up is precisely the discourse relating to sharing via database, which paves the way for intense uploads and downloads of content for good peace of global longevity of the title. It seems clear that the Capcom work is a real boon for fans of the series, despite a cosmetic realization that could make even the most avid fans turn up their noses. In fact, Powered Up shows itself with a super-deformed and childish polygonal style, with bright and lively colors and an all too accentuated tendency to minimalism. A decisive change from the usual canons of the franchise, which is not too convincing either stylistically or technically, due to slowdowns that are not justifiable given the extreme simplicity of the cosmetics. Different speech for the sound, with music from the original NES that join convincing remixes and sound effects up to par, to close with a cartoonish dubbing and over the top enough. Comment Mega Man Powered Up certainly represents one of the best examples of remakes, and in this statement lie the strengths and weaknesses of the Capcom production. In fact, if credit must undoubtedly be given to a title capable of skilfully blending old and new, at the same time it is not always easy to turn a blind eye to the actual limitsof an almost twenty-year-old play structure. Precisely for this reason, Mega Man Powered Up is a title that younger users would perhaps struggle to appreciate and which therefore seems to be indicated exclusively for lovers of the saga. Pros Classic gameplay Excellent longevity The level editor is a little gem Cons Uninspiring graphics Difficulty level always high It's the same game as twenty years ago Mega Man is one of the most shining examples of respect for tradition. Faithful to the nature of his debuts, the little blue Capcom man has always remained firmly anchored to a hard and pure two-dimensional play scheme, limiting the digressions in 3D to accessory elements or to projects parallel to the main series. And Mega Man Powered Up does not betray this philosophy at all, proposing some important innovative aspects but substantially carrying on the banner of a very old school gameplay ", "date": "2006-04-24", "grade": null}
