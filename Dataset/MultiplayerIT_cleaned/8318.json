{"name": "RTS mordi e fuggi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/108623-starvoid-rts-mordi-e-fuggi.html", "text": "Since the very beginning, strategic players have really come in many types. Warfare, management, social, Japanese, Western, turn-based, real-time, and grid-based. And many other types, all characterized by a certain learning curve, many missions and a calm and studied approach to avoid wasting an hour and a half of the game for a badly born tactic. To put it simply, Starvoid is exactly the opposite of everything you've come to know and take for granted. One of those titles that are either appreciated for the purpose they have, or irrevocably hated. It's not the technique, the cost, the playful sources from which it draws or whether or not it belongs to a genre that weigh on the scale of satisfaction. Simply, it can be summed up as a hit-and-run real-time strategy game. Intrigued by this obvious oxymoron? The new title published by Paradox Interactive and developed by Zeal Game Studios draws heavily on the western strategic tradition, compresses it and serves it in a sauce that takes the videogame genre to which it belongs from a very particular point of view. The fulcrum of each game session will focus on the commander chosen for the game, who just like a walking headquarters will have the task, through resources that recharge over time, of summoning the most varied troops to win the match. If the commander is killed, all the troops are automatically defeated and will restart from the starting point. A very simple basic concept. Or not? The commander? It's in the last row Any old-fashioned wartime moralist would pale in the face of a strategy based on keeping the commander at the very back of the platoon, yet much of the tactic will be based precisely on preventing the Commander from being taken by surprise and surrounded by enemy troops . Of the 4 commanders already created and available, each one, in addition to a unique design, has a class that distinguishes it and on which their abilities revolve. Kelly, curator and engineer; Cleburne, the melee stormtrooper; Grace, lightning fast ninja; and Alberto, equipped with heavy ranged artillery. In addition, it will be possible to create a limited number of Commanders that satisfy every type of aesthetic taste and equipment. Reading what has been said, one might erroneously think that everything revolves around these figures, in reality it will often happen to consider them almost a burden, precisely because of the double bond that binds them to survival in the field. Since these personalities are the only way to create units, vehicles and cyborgs, getting caught up in the urge to unleash special abilities and moves could be very harmful. In short, rely on the troops available. Among so many military forces to choose from, the important thing is to remember to study them well because, like any self-respecting strategic, each unit has speed, equipment and way of fighting different from each other. The possibility of making them evolve adds a fair amount of depth and variety to war tactics, also benefiting from being able to test them on the fly in a quick match and immediately understand if the chosen strategy goes well with the chosen units and evolutions. Usual challenge? The map-mode pairing used by Starvoid is a poor match, as it almost seems that the design of the map has been modeled only to satisfy the geographical and environmental terms related to the mode to which it is connected. It is therefore impossible to choose a mode and untie it from the environment in which you want to play, which makes the visual repetitiveness frustrating. Analyzing the types of game proposed, there is little to get excited about as there are only three: Battle, Sabotage and Team Deathmatch. In the Battle the objective is to capture, in ten minutes, the Extraction points and to defend them, with the only peculiarity of having to follow a specific order, having to give priority to the capture of the closest ones and then possibly widening and going to threaten those further away. This concept leads to apparently useless time passing before engaging in the clash, given that each team will be busy putting the stakes in their own area and then trying to advance. In Sabotage you start with a specific number of accessories called RedKits, useful for corrupting places of interest near the enemy base and earning points. It is possible to earn more RedKits by defeating opposing units and commanders, the important thing is to find the right balance between attacking without risking and running around the map full of material, given that it will be enough to be defeated to give everything to the enemy and leave him precious seconds to reach the half. Team Deathmatch is nothing more than what the no already indicatesme: each team collides in a hyper-frantic battle to the death, since the respawns have been structured to take place right in the middle of each clash. A somewhat questionable choice for a way to paraphrase the field battles of the past, where armies met to give each other a thrashing. A few hitches Unfortunately, since there are not many players still available, it will not be uncommon to find yourself bogged down in matchmaking where for minutes you are left alone running around the map waiting for enemies, and given the online-only nature of the title it is certainly not a good thing. It has happened to be in the middle of the fight and being catapulted out of the room due to stability problems, or to be clearly outnumbered by a team management system that does not work as it should, thus making matches practically impossible to win . However annoying, the problems listed weigh less given the fast nature of the title, which allows you to play games at will. Lots of accessories, weapons, trinkets and objects that can be unlocked with credits and the experience accumulated with others that can unfortunately only be purchased for a fee, which is somewhat out of tune with the nature of the game since, not being an F2P, it has its own basic cost of 9.99. Although the amount of graphics on the screen is minimal, some occasional frame drops raise an eyebrow and the imperfect management of troops via the mouse also raises the other, sometimes causing defeat precisely due to unit selection problems.", "date": "2012-09-19", "grade": "6.8"}
