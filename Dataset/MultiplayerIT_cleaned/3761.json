{"name": "Generation Zero", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/generation-zero-recensione.html", "text": "Generation Zero undoubtedly starts from an intriguing incipit: we are in Sweden, in an alternative 1989, and we discover that something disturbing has happened while we were on a boat trip. There is no one left on the streets, the houses are empty, some vehicles lie abandoned and threatening presences move among the trees or in the middle of the fields: quadrupedal robots who are alerted by the slightest noise and attack anything that moves using a machine gun . Unfortunately this is only the proverbial tip of the iceberg, because the mechanical troops that have invaded the country are not only very numerous, but made up of even bigger and more dangerous machines, armed with blades and missile launchers. Surviving their attack will not be easy, in a desperate attempt to understand what happened and where they all ended up: we will be alone in dealing with a particularly large and evocative scenario, which measures over ten square kilometers in its entirety, or we will be able to choose to tackle the adventure cooperatively with three other users, transforming the experience into something very similar to an expedition and adding a certain strategic depth to the gameplay. Whatever our approach, there will be quite a bit of walking. Atmosphere and interaction After playing Generation Zero during the Early Access period on Steam, we expected the introduction of a narrative structure capable of making the most of the idea behind the adventure. However, the authors decided otherwise, dismissing everything with a few lines of text during the first few minutes and projecting us into the same situation, near a house apparently abandoned in a hurry, while in the distance the lights of a police car are visible stop in the middle of the road. A few moments to familiarize yourself with the system that regulates the loot: it is possible to access the vast majority of buildings and collect objects of various kinds directly or by rummaging inside boxes, crates, containers and trunks. In this way you can find weapons, ammunition, useful accessories (for example binoculars or appendices for pistols and rifles), medical kits, radios and flares of various types: tools that take on a certain importance when there are many enemies and it is possible to distract them with lights and fireworks. The use of the inventory has unfortunately remained quite cumbersome, the immediately available slots are sufficient to carry a lot of stuff but the assignment of certain resources to the hotkeys (d-pad directions, using a controller) it has to be repeated every time supplies run out and it becomes frustrating to have to repeat the operation again and again when it comes to medkits, which cannot be consumed at the same time as the inventory check. When the backpack is full you have to leave something on the ground, but nothing is wasted: the objects remain available to our possible companions or in any case to those who will join the game, an eventuality which however never occurred during our tests with the final version of the game. The scenario, as mentioned, is huge and also quite evocative: boundless plains, coasts overlooking the sea, rocky and forested areas, small urban gatherings and even some tourist attractions. In short, it seems that the developers have reproduced specific places in the country, but without a clear idea of how to make the most of them to set a story of this type. In fact, what you will find yourself doing most of the time in Generation Zero will be walking, covering large distances without the possibility of using vehicles and without this being justified in any way (that is, by an electrical signal that has set all the motors out of order). Furthermore, once near the urban areas, it is difficult not to notice how the houses are all identical to each other, divided into very few typologies that are repeated to the bitter end and undermine the interest in exploring them. Furthermore, there are no living characters who are not our possible companions, and the missions are limited to exploration assignments for the collection of clues and information. Combat system and enemies Between one walk and another you will inevitably come across some enemies. The placement of the robots follows a principle of progression that sees only the quadrupeds in the first areas, after which the reconnaissance drones, the giants armed with missiles and then again the enormous bipeds that are seen in some of the game's artworks begin to arrive. To eliminate them we will be able to use the different weapons found around: pistols, shotguns or sniper rifles, machine guns of various sizes but also explosive objects, whichwe will be able to place them as traps to be blown up if necessary. The sensors of hostile units are sharp, but it is possible to fool them by ducking and moving slowly, keeping a distance, in a sort of stealth approach. The problem is that no advantage is gained from it: the experience points are earned by completing the fights, and although even the escape is rewarded, the unlocking of the upgrades for the character is already slow on its own and does not require further uncertainties. After the first eight hours, moreover, we had unlocked very few improvements, trying to prefer physical resistance and health over the use of weapons and engineering skills. In short, it is clear how the Generation Zero experience was designed to entertain for a long time in a sort of perennial endgame, and the size of the map is clear proof of this. The problem is how time is spent, because finding yourself walking across long stretches of road without encountering anything along the way doesn't correspond to our personal idea of fun. But let's go back to the combat system: our character can equip three weapons by selecting them from the inventory and use them to defeat enemies. With a sniper rifle it is possible to eliminate the robots from a great distance, hitting their battery, but when hostile units approach it is better to take up a more immediate weapon, for example a shotgun, and move quickly to avoid frontal charges or the volleys of machine guns, which actually follow fairly predictable trajectories. Artificial intelligence is unfortunately not the best, indeed it happens all too often that the machines get stuck somewhere or that they are unable to understand that we are behind a shelter and cannot hurt us, ending up being targeted without problems other than the amount of ammunition at our disposal. Graphics and sound After introducing us to the initial menu with an exciting electronic song, Generation Zero presents a simple editor for creating the character (the presets appear generic and with an old-gen flavor, unfortunately), after which we find ourselves projected into the map. The rendering of nature and the lighting system undoubtedly represent the flagship of the production, which thanks to the Apex Engine is able to offer truly suggestive panoramas, a convincing day / night cycle and a great atmosphere. Do you know theHunter: Call of the Wild? It is practically identical, so much so that in some moments it happens to identify with the character, lost in the middle of nowhere, with the wind blowing and perhaps the rain falling, while in the distance you can see houses which, however, are manned by hostile robots. As anticipated, the creation of urban gatherings and insipid bunkers betrays a frankly excessive copy-paste work, and there is a great desire to dive back into nature, which however fascinating as it is, soon turns out to be unsuitable for the context, too dispersive, too wide in its expanses so that it can be covered on foot, obtaining a bit of fun. Only fatigue is felt, mental rather than physical, and the game over is welcomed as a real curse: unless you have an adrenaline syringe, after the knockdown we will have to select a location where to respawn and retracing the path that brought us to the point where we were defeated, also finding enemies we had already eliminated. On the test configuration the game runs at 1440p with all effects maxed out and a solid 60 frames per second, but if you want you can opt for 2160p using a dynamic solution that performs fairly well, scaling the resolution to maintain the established frame target . Among the most interesting visual options there is undoubtedly the screen space reflection, which projects the real reflections of the environment around us into puddles: deactivating it, the effect is replaced by simple cubemaps. The design of the robots is interesting although not very original, while the concept of persistence is used very little: the fights tend to end and it is therefore rare to find an enemy after some time, finding the damage we have inflicted on him previously. Beyond the initial music, the sound accompaniment appears essential.", "date": "2019-03-20", "grade": "5.0"}
