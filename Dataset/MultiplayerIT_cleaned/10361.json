{"name": "Fatale!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/71093-fatale-fatale.html", "text": "Act I First there is the wait. Iokanaan is in his cell: the cistern of Herod's palace. It's dark, the only light comes from a grate from which it is possible to glimpse a woman dancing. Exploring the environment you will find writings on the walls. At the bottom of the screen fills a bar divided into seven segments, one for each veil. With each veil that falls, an inscription appears on the screen that remains in the position of the point of view of the character at that moment. These are words taken from Wilde's work. There are crates and the atmosphere is very humid. You feel that something is about to happen. The wait is long and unnerving. It really feels like a prisoner. The seventh veil falls and the dance ceases. After a few moments, an executioner dressed in black enters the cell. We run away but he reaches us by cutting off our heads. It cannot be avoided. Act II We are on the balcony of a very rich building. Salom is high above a fountain decorated with a star. She has her elbows resting on the railing and looks thoughtful. A long transparent veil covers her head and falls on her back. I am wearing precious clothes that strongly recall the homonymous painting by Moreau. The chest is uncovered and the nipples are clearly visible to argue the classic nature of the representation. Age is uncertain but she does not look like a grown woman. To his right is the head of the Baptist resting on a plate with a rose next to it (according to Catholic tradition, the thorns of the roses appeared after the original sin and the shape suggests the chalice used to collect the blood of Christ). To Salom's left is a split pomegranate (symbol of the inseparable alternation between day and night, of the passion and resurrection of Christ, but also of the church itself and of the inseparability between temporal and spiritual power). The user must look for the lit lights scattered throughout the area and turn them off (just hold the cursor over them for a few seconds). Each light corresponds to a detail of the scene. Evidently there was a party with music and revelry. The seven veils of the fatal dance are scattered on the ground and trace a reading path of what happened and that we could only guess in the cell. Exploration is deliberately difficult (it is also repeated in the instructions, therefore it is a programmatic choice), while by pressing a few keys it is possible to focus on a point of the picture and view a summary of the lights out. In addition to Salom there are two other characters: the executioner of the Baptist and a woman we know nothing about (she looks like a servant from the way she is dressed). The space is visually captivating. Also for MAC A very small note to point out the fact that Fatale is also available in a Macintosh version, at the same price as the Windows PC version (7 US dollars). Act III When all the lights are turned off, day comes on and after having been submerged in the sun's rays we arrive at the third and final scene, where a Salom radiated by the light dances sensually in front of the fountain under the balcony following the rhythm of frenzied music. Here the viewer can only observe the scene by zooming in and letting himself be carried away by the graceful movements of the princess, indifferent to having just had a man beheaded. The dance moves are perfectly reproduced (it is no coincidence that the choreography is supervised by a professional dancer, Elonore Valere Lachky). When the dance ends you are given the option to start over or go back to the desktop. Curiosity Oscar Wilde (1854 - 1900), Irish poet and playwright, wrote 'Salom' in French in 1893 for Sarah Bernhardt, probably the most famous actress of the late nineteenth century together with the Italian Eleonora Duse, who staged it in Paris. The text was later translated into English by an anonymous person, after Lord Alfred Douglas, Wilde's lover, proved unable to produce a valid version. The French premiere was in 1896, while in England the opera could only be performed freely from 1931 due to censorship problems (Victorian society was not particularly libertarian). Epilogue Fatale is an interactive painting with some videogame nuances, much closer to The Graveyard than to The Path. The only real activity required of the user is an exploratory one. There are no enemies to take down or puzzles to solve, just observe. With an hour or less you can get to complete it, but time counts for little. Obviously, like the previous works of Tale of Tales, this too lends itself to all the classic criticisms ranging from ~it's not a game~ to ~they're just mental blowjobs~ and so on. If you are looking for a video game understood in the classic sense, then avoid trying it and don't be interested in it because Fatale is definitely not for you (we do not say it with snobbery, but we reiterate that you will not like it). The others can give it a chance, however, starting from a couple of objective assumptions: first of all, you need to know English well to appreciate it at its best, given that the texts scattered above all in the first part are taken from Wilde's Salom and are not very easy to understand (actually the original text is in French, read the box for general information on the work); furthermore it would be better to have a minimum knowledge of art to appreciate some elements of the representation which otherwise risk leaving one indifferent.", "date": "2009-11-25", "grade": "S.V."}
