{"name": "Buona la terza!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/81811-fable-iii-buona-la-terza.html", "text": "Fable is the game that most closely embodies the nature of its creator, Peter Molyneux, a visionary game designer who has added his name to some of the most innovative titles in history, even before the novelties they brought, for the way these were announced. Yes, because Peter Molyneux is so attached to the projects he follows that he wants to talk about them for months, sometimes years, before they come out, often when they are still little more than thousands of lines of game design on paper, written thinking more about the game of dreams than to the real possibilities offered by the technology in which they are born. The first chapter of Fable, released on the first Xbox, collided heavily with this way of doing, the victim of a huge hype and thousands of announced features, of which none (or almost) peeped out in the final version. With the second it went much better, with fewer declarations and many clearer ideas. Fable 3 comes out today, on the wave of the denial of the fact that it should be the end of a trilogy, rather the continuation of a journey in a new land, the one on the border, less and less marked, between action, (light) role-playing and life simulation. A land where we spent the last intense week of play, with great, amused, pleasure. The Official Guide Multiplayer.it Edizioni is happy to actively participate in the launch of the game by proposing the Official Guide also in a collector's version, to have practical access to all the quests, locations and objects scattered throughout the world of Fable 3. In addition, the code to download an exclusive tattoo. Revolution! Fifty years have passed on Albion, the Kingdom seems to be experiencing a moment of relative calm after the death of the protagonist of the second chapter, the Hero who ferried this green land in full industrial revolution with the first steam engines and factories populated by men, women and children hunched over the assembly lines in an attempt to carve out a place in the sun in the industrial district of the mythical Bowerstone, capital of the region. Logan, the eldest son of the Hero, rules with a hard fist, perhaps too much, generating a growing discontent among the citizens. We have the task of taking on the role of the second-born, male or female, determined to subvert the order of things in an attempt to oust his brother and lead his people towards an era of new prosperity. The first part of Fable 3 tells the story of the escape from the castle and the contact with all the different tribes scattered throughout Albion, who ask for proof of our good faith and real will to change things, like in a real electoral campaign, in which it is necessary to gain consensus and make promises that sooner or later will have to be accounted for. This campaign translates into a series of quests, aimed at solving contingent problems of the population, all solvable with the moral freedom that has always distinguished the saga, and with a series of choices that inevitably influence the evolution of events. In the meantime, you learn about a world, told with some locations that build a setting that is now a hallmark of the series and that has no equal in the panorama of current video games, for the care and style with which they are made. It thus becomes an obligation to play with the camera to enjoy a series of places that project the player into a parallel universe in which monsters and strange inhabitants react in an increasingly believable way to our gait and to the way we decide to behave, even if the code sometimes he loses his pace by staging somewhat rambling situations. The missions have a common denominator, namely that of the fights, in which you juggle with firearms, magic and white weapon shots, each of them used with one of the buttons on the pad, with a system that entrusts variety to progress of the Hero, with increasingly spectacular moves and animations that adapt to the movements of the different enemies and the surrounding environment. After the escalation of events that leads to the Revolution, you find yourself ruling Albion in an attempt to repel the final assault of a tremendous and dark force, trying to juggle all the promises made in the election campaign (which closely resembles the story of the development of Fable and Molyneux's statements), the need to accumulate the funds necessary to support an adequate army and the construction of a private life that is finally an integral part of the game structure. The squaring of the circle Once Lionhead, already from the second chapter, had granted the player the opportunity to get married, build a real estate empire and start a family, the problem remainedto why a player should do it. Working as a blacksmith - this time you can also make him play the lute and the mechanics are those of Guitar Hero, in which you press the keys in time - buying houses and shops allowed, as now, to accumulate money in a dizzying way, but in a game that has never boasted thousands of items to buy, no one really knew what it was for; interacting with the inhabitants could lead to curious love affairs of any kind and to a series of themed quests, some of the funniest in the saga, but with almost no results for the actual action part. In short, there were two parallel planes that never met, with the feeling that so much creativity was wasted and that few were willing to waste time on it. To be able to bring all these elements on a single track it was enough to get rid of the accumulation of experience for the growth of the Hero, now linked to the conquest of the seals of the Guild of Heroes, which are spent along a dreamlike path, wrapped in fog, punctuated by a series of gates, which represent the main passages of the plot, behind each of which there are chests that must be opened by spending the seals themselves, which contain the evolution of the Hero's skills, new spells to use and combine and the social expressions necessary for the development of the different relationships. Each time you interact with a denizen of Albion, you earn seals. By pressing RT, while selecting an NPC, you can know what is the maximum number of these that can lead us to earn and, if it is greater than one, it means that, by making him some flattering, he will overcome the state of neutrality, entrusting us with a quest / favor (generally linked to the finding or delivery of an object), becoming our ~friend~. The third stage, which is that of a lover, is reached by continuing to interact until the possibility of proposing marriage, setting up a house and having children. The conversations and dialogues that arise between the characters are, at times, hilarious and you find yourself in a whirlwind of kisses, caresses and farts, now very famous and increasingly choreographed, which earn their place in the game world. Just as there is the accumulation of money, above all for the part in which Albion must be governed, trying to keep (if one wishes) the promises made during the Revolution with the problem of the social and economic cost to bear (closing the factories for preserving the environment can have a big impact on the state coffers), which can be tackled by balancing the accounts by merging the assets of one's assets into the Real ones, thus allowing us to keep the most correct conduct possible. This part, however, would have deserved more space and dedicated quests, given that it is the most innovative part of the game and given that, once the plot of our role as Regents is exhausted, there is nothing left, as we can no longer manage taxation and social policies. The choices made, among other things, can lead to the radical variation of some game areas, which greatly increases the longevity for those who want to see them all, for a title that in any case is not completed before an interval between 17 and 20 hours. We see the attempt made by the team to underline the most touching passages of the plot with greater attention to the interlude scenes, but the fact remains that Fable will remain famous for the irony of the tones and the pleasure of the experience as a whole. given that once again the dramatic involvement remains superficial and that, even the ending, closes the story, for now, but in a hasty manner. You can continue wandering around the world collecting objects, completing quests that are still open and opening chests and secret doors, but, undoubtedly, much of the bite is lost once the main story is over. Curiosity The life of a Fable character can lead, after a ceremony that can take place in different locations for the rental price, to marriage. After pampering your partner, you can bring him near a bed and decide to have a sexual relationship which, if not protected and favored by heterosexuality, leads to becoming fathers/mothers. Then you have to take care of the family, take care of the house, repair it and be seen every now and then, on pain of divorce. Or you can take your wife, take her to work in the factory, pocketing more money for the kinship bond and wait for the message announcing her death from fatigue. At that point, a carer can be paid to look after their offspring who, otherwise, will end up in an orphanage. For example. Weapons, spells and potions The thing you find yourself doing most often, however, is fighting around Albion. The system remains the same as before with one pad key for each delland skills, with A to run and dodge enemy attacks, and with animations that underline the state of development of the Hero (there are five levels for each skill, for as many chests), adapting to the lay of the land and the behavior of enemies, until we see our character jumping obstacles and shooting himself in the back with absolute ease. When necessary, the digital cross makes its appearance, giving the possibility to throw the potion to stop time (it is no longer a power), to summon monstrous creatures to our aid and to heal oneself. There is no user interface, except for the few indications just described, no character statistics, and the menu itself has disappeared, since pressing Start ends up, in the company of the trusty butler, in the Guild Shrine, where you can change clothes 'dress and paraphernalia, with weapons that develop, reflecting your style of play, and which are enhanced by completing a series of challenges, such as ~Kill 150 human enemies to get this bonus~, rather than others. This extreme simplification, you can't manage more than one save at a time, which forces you to replay everything if you want to see the possible scenario variations, it certainly allows anyone to play Fable 3 and have fun, but of course, it can create problems for those looking for a higher level of involvement and who do not look favorably on an overly action-packed drift of the saga, which in the second chapter had a couple of sections, particularly successful in terms of emotional involvement, which have no equivalent here ( see Malatorre ed.). For its part, Lionhead has worked hard on dungeon design, introducing many more environmental puzzles than in the past, amplifying the sense of exploration, but Fable remains a very easy game, where you can expect to get to the end without dying. not even once and unlocking the related achievement, from the very first time. This is not, necessarily, a defect, given how much fun it is to explore the game, to fight and interact with NPCs, but it is inevitable that identification also passes through a level of challenge and a sense of apprehension that is here been sacrificed by virtue of the coexistence of a series of elements that make Fable 3 a unique experience, for better or for worse. Xbox 360 goals After finishing Fable 3, expect to have between 500 and 600, earned by developing all skills and solving all major main and side quests. The achievement of the objectives related to the social aspects, this time, comes more naturally, since there are more reasons to dedicate yourself to them, while to get to 1000 you have to collect some items well hidden in the seabed, open all the secret doors and chests and play online with your friends. It will take some time, in short. Fairytale rays Albion grows, the maps become vaster and, where other engines show a more brutal display of power, here, among the sunbeams and leaves blowing in the wind, feeling, trivially, in a fairy tale is a sensation that recurs all the time game. Furnishings, gears and light effects enrich caves and houses, and if the style is that of a cartoon, rather than the hyper-realistic one of other productions, the fact remains that you are immediately at home and that certain animations of social expressions are been studied to the millimeter, between dance steps and passionate kisses. The character no longer fits left and right in the backdrop and the work that has been done on the dubbing of the dialogues, all in Italian and excellently recited, serves to help a complex picture, in which all the different factions in the game sometimes collide, with NPCs not always reacting as one might expect. Exploration is encouraged by dozens of hidden objects and the trusty four-legged friend follows us everywhere, running and wagging his tail non-stop. The system that allows you to take the other characters by the hand and take them for a walk, even against your will, works properly, so much so that there are perhaps too many quests that are based on it, but some missions are really daughters of the creativity of a team, among brightest in the current video game landscape. After the daring implementation of the co-op in Fable 2, this time Lionhead presents itself with the possibility of interacting in the worlds of other players, saving money, being able to get married and having children. The camera is free for both, except in the case of the local coop, finally leaving the door open to all-round adventures between friends.", "date": "2010-10-26", "grade": "9.0"}
