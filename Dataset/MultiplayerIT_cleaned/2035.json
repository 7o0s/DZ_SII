The speed of the movements, the quality of the game and the specific options make Agassi Tennis Generation an important point of reference among current tennis games. This says, on the back, the game box. Perhaps to achieve that goal they should have started with menus worthy of the name. The graphic aspect of the latter is truly chilling and certainly does not invite you to continue or sift through the various options. But since we are heroes nothing can stop us. The options are few and all stuff already seen. However, I don't feel like I'm going too hard on this point.. let's say that we are on the standard of tennis games released in recent years. Let's start analyzing the graphics of the real games then, hoping that it will give us something better than the menus. Hardware requests are quite high and this can only give us hope. Hopes immediately betrayed. The playing fields, while not too bad, don't have anything relevant. The graphic detail is rather low and there are no huge differences between one field and another. The players aren't terribly done, but their expressions can't be said to have much of a human. The animations are quite credible on a purely 'stylistic' level and much less on a 'dynamic' one. In practice it means that the animations of the players would be even more beautiful if they were seen on a field of flowers for a walk or a jog in the middle of nature than on a tennis court. But let's leave this speech to the gameplay that will come later. The 'special' effects are not many and rather trivial. The usual stuff like tennis players' footprints or a little bit of dust here and there. The whole thing gives a rather strange, almost surreal impression. It seems to be somewhere else sometimes, rather than on a tennis court. Mathematics is an opinion, more often than not Returning to a more general discussion, I didn't understand too much the choice of making 10 tournaments available. The 4 of the Grand Slam and the 9 of the Super Nine make 13, but I admit that I'm not Rino Tommasi or Bisteccone Galeazzi and I could also get confused or ignore recent changes (?). I have always longed for a tennis game (perhaps even decently made) in which I can pursue a career similar in all respects to the real situation. This practically only happened to me in Roland Garros 98, which even though it had a few too many flaws in the gameplay, is still the most fun tennis game I've played. Virtua Tennis, on the other hand, has never driven me crazy, but in fact it is the reference point of current tennis games. Judging by the graphics it would seem that that ATG crown can easily be forgotten. But hope is the last to die and we continue with the examination (??) of the Cryo stock. Gameplay we said, and gameplay it is. Only Agassi can be used in career. Questionable choice, very much. Of course, the other tennis players are fictitious and often more rackets on Sunday than aces of the ATP circuit and I must admit that, even though I never loved him, I never moved away from the bald protagonist. There are various shots as usual. Just as usual, they could have spared them. The difference is often not even seen and, even when you notice it, you quickly understand that you will always use the same one. I often tried to suddenly change tactics and quickly convinced myself that always using the same one was the best thing. To give you an idea of the level of the opponents, realism and artificial intelligence I tell you that the first 3 games I lost with a double 6-0 and the fourth I won 6-1 6-2. This is not because I've bumped into various tutorials (which don't exist) but because the opponents alternate spells worthy of the best Edberg (yes, I've always been a fan of his) with nonsense worthy of an Italian tennis player (any one of the few in the top 100 of the world..make vobis). A question of movement As mentioned before the movements are often awkward. It took me hours to figure out how to hit a blessed ball and when I found out it didn't excite me much. Replays are something best avoided. The game modes are limited to say the least. Quickmatch, Arcade and Agassi Career. Basically a quick game with default settings, all the Grand Slam tournaments plus Belgium (?) and Agassi's career. Yes, by Agassi because you can only play with him. Shall we go to sound? As you like, but I warned you. We are at levels like Massimo_Caputi&Giacomo_Bulgarelli in Fifa, if not worse. Mal common half joy .. it's actually quiteIt's hard to find a PC sports title with convincing audio. But unfortunately here the gaps are also elsewhere and a less ridiculous handling of the comment would have been more appreciated. The 'ambient' audio is more convincing, if nothing else. Of the 32 players, few are saved and hardly anyone is characterized even minimally, except with different facial expressions. Longevity is rather limited and only saved, thank goodness, by the Career mode. The ability to keep you glued to the monitor of this title is perhaps even less than the time it will take you to learn how to win some points. Andr, andr, is it really you, andr? I always find it difficult to throw the cross on a game definitively, but here it's even more difficult to do the opposite. No, we're definitely not here. The game is old and cheesy graphically, comical with regards to the audio, unconvincing with regards to the gameplay in general. There are none of the extras, the menus and the general care of the title is really poor. A license of this caliber wasted in this way is a bit sad. The Aqua Pacifics will certainly be good, but they didn't prove it here at all. The average player will really struggle to enjoy it, if he is not armed with great patience. As said at the beginning and as easily understood, it is not clear how Agassi managed to grant himself to such a title, if not unsuccessful, at least very very dubious. It would take Cryo to come up with something different to regain credibility. It didn't happen like that. Not recommended, highly not recommended for the average player, especially if not passionate about tennis. The latter, on the other hand, could find the title playable overall, given the scarcity of tennis games in circulation. If you have a good mouth and are more focused on the arcade than the simulation, this title might also like it. But let's hope that the Aquas make up for it soon, perhaps with an Agassi Tennis Generation 2003 worthy of the name. See you soon! A hot title Agassi Tennis Generation is certainly a successful title, very practical and effective. However, if I inform you immediately that I'm not referring to the game, but to the real title of the latest Aqua Pacific effort, you will have a legitimate doubt about what I'm about to tell you. To say I've been waiting for this ATG for a long time would be a little improbable; certainly, however, when I found it in my hands, a small hope of finally seeing a tennis game worthy of this sport had flashed through my mind. Unfortunately Agassi is a great tennis player, he has a nice little family with another great tennis player from the past (Steffy Graf for those who don't know), he has money to burn, he does a job that everyone would like to do and he has fans all over the world . Certainly, however, he must understand very little about video games, otherwise he would never have released a license wasting it in this way. In any case, let's go in order..", "date": "2002-08-03", "grade": null}
