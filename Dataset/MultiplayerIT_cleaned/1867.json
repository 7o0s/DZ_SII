{"name": "WRC II Extreme", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wrc-ii-extreme.html", "text": "Mud, mud and more mud The Evolutions coders watch amused in the shadows, self-satisfaction is evident. Being able to boast a vast field of vision means setting up replays in the name of video orgasm, it means being able to glimpse a placid mountain village long before it is overwhelmed by our roaring four-wheeler. And all this as we hurtle down an endless set of steep serpentines. This is WRC2. Ugly, dirty and mean. For our part, we are happy to benefit from the visual festival offered, but there remains a slight bitter aftertaste in not finding similar familiarity with the productions of other European Sony teams (This Is Football? Formula One?), which are still desperately trudging after the mysteries (for them) of the Emotion Engine. Patience. The Game But let's go back to the game, indeed .. To the pre-game. Here too the atmosphere is that of a graduation party: lulled by the Chemical Brothers' Star Guitar we delight in exploring numerous menus that leave very little to dissatisfaction (but the desire for originality could remain thwarted): official licenses, stables, numerous fmv to justify the use of the large silver support, competitions, modes and avalanche tracks. More of everything. Evolution aims to put an end to the search for the definitive simulation, and close the door on the competition. Too bad for the non-implementation of 60hz, and even more for not having taken the interesting involuntary suggestion of Eden Studios for the innovative career mode of V-Rally 3. For the rest there is not much more to expect, one could order a Lucan, but it's best not to get too distracted by the new help system the programmers have come up with. Having eliminated the unfortunate ~soap~ effect of the prequel in favor of a reasonable decrease in steering sensitivity, we can enjoy a more simulative and realistic experience, or almost. The already mentioned resistance of the cars to steering imposes an iron and not very permissive driving, a pity that this greatly inhibits the forking of precise trajectories through controlled drifting - an indisputable delight of the new Colin Mc Rae - who does so much rallying. Patience. All this fundamentalism, however, shows the side to some contrasts, such as the questionable dynamics of some collisions of the cars with the elements on the edge of the track (the cars magically become cork), or the low incidence of the latter on the bodywork. A significant flaw, as it negates the sensations offered by a Colin3, with his mudguard-deprived Ford fighting a difficult stage without the consolation of a nearby checkpoint for repairs. Patience. These are the few shadows of a title intended for celebration, solid, complex and challenging to last over time. But above all Ugly, dirty and mean. Comment WRC II Extreme is the right consecration of Evolution Studios after the promising test ride of the first chapter. Improved from practically all points of view, it represents the best playful expression of rallying on PS2, at least the most faithful to the spirit of this discipline. A rigorous title, in some ways more to be respected than enjoyed, recommended almost exclusively to fans of the genre. For the casual racing lover, the choice must be carefully weighed. Pros + Unstoppable graphics engine + Comprehensive and challenging Cons - Invisible damage - Not suitable for non-enthusiasts There are no better words to describe a production that brutally mocks the colored tracks of a Sega Rally (or, in recent times, Shox) with its photorealism driven by an engine that defining brutal is an understatement. Abstain the violets, this is a discipline for tough men, here we have to get dirty from head to toe, while we fear that our television set could explode at any moment and smear our room with Mud. Mud reigns everywhere in this rude racing game, from the menus to the race, the feeling of dirt is always tangible. WRC2 is tough, indeed very tough. The cars available, faithful reproductions of the real counterparts, await the input of the pad menacingly on the starting line to rush madly along winding, rigorously dirty circuits. And the dual-shock suddenly becomes hearthquake-shock, ready to cancel the player's tactile sense with devastating earthquakes, while the navigator suggests the curves to be tackled with impetus and psychotic rhythms, while the grim graphics engine grinningly rattles off mountains (appropriate term) of finely textured polygons, proud of its unassailable 50fps. Shoot our monster at warp speed, aWe arrive at the first corner sensitized by the gentle drifts of the aforementioned Sega Rally (or, in recent times, GT3), only to find that the steering resistance is more marked than expected. The overhang approaches, total panic. This is a tough man's game.", "date": "2002-12-20", "grade": null}
