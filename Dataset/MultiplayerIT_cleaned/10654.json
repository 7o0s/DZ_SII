Roundup of stars: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson. Written and directed by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. The lights go out in the hall and the curtain falls: this is how the new adventure of the Ghostbusters begins, absent from the cinema scene since 1989 (Ghostbusters II) but still firmly in the hearts of their fans, a position reinforced by gadgets, comics, cartoons. The success of the two films directed by Ivan Reitman was extraordinary and the four New York Ghostbusters have long been a true media icon. For years there have been rumors of a notorious sequel and while Hollywood hesitates, Sony offers it directly in videogame format: with the complete collaboration of the original cast, Ghostbusters: The Videogame takes the form of a true narrative sequel to the cinematic bilogy. The player takes on the role of a new recruit for the team nicknamed simply ~cadet~ and the plot unfolds around us starting from an emanation of ghostly energy connected in some way to an exhibition of Gozerian art (for those who don't know remembered, Gozer was the deity the Ghostbusters faced in their first adventure). Our brave heroes immediately begin to investigate but to block their way they will find dozens of angry ghosts and old acquaintances, from the gigantic Marshmallow Man to the slimy prosecutor Walter Peck: even the old ghost librarian who appeared at the beginning of the first film is reintegrated into the narrative with a decidedly important role, and there is no shortage of cameos by Slimer and Janine, which complete a delightful picture. The story develops linearly through fully dialogued cutscenes (in the review version they are in English, but some users have confirmed to us that the version in stores also has them in Italian, with most of the original voice actors) which enrapture the player/spectator with the scathing irony and skill of the four protagonists. In reality, Ghostbusters: The Video Game is a mix of clichs taken from the first two films: some jokes are decidedly similar and certain plots are a bit forced, not to mention Peter Venkman's new love interest, a beautiful archaeologist voiced by the actress Alyssa Milano; yet, Ghostbusters: The Video Game is tremendous fun and the player is satisfied with the adventure from start to finish, rocked by very fit old friends. Fans be warned. Curiosity In a period in which the multiplatform is more and more sovereign, temporal or even regional exclusives are starting to go into fashion. As in the case of Ghostbusters: The Videogame, for which Sony has secured the exclusive and temporary publication of the game on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2 and PSP as far as Europe is concerned. The PC and Xbox 360 versions should make their appearance on our continent by the end of the year. Specters and Rifles Ghostbusters: The Video Game is proposed as a sort of third-person shooter in which the main weapon can only be the legendary proton rifle of the Ghostbusters. Its main function is to weaken the toughest ghosts until they can be connected with the flow of energy and push towards the canonical traps, into which the enemy will be sucked. This mechanic is made decidedly fun and faithful to the original concept of the films, thanks also to very precise and reactive controls: facing a ghost and capturing it is decidedly satisfying. The linearity of the stages, however, must not also imply a certain monotony of the gameplay: on the contrary, the variety is guaranteed by the upgrades that Egon will periodically provide to our proton backpack, up to enabling three additional features. At the end of the game, the simple press of a button will allow us to replace the basic proton flow with beams of freezing energy, photon machine guns and even the infamous green substance encountered in the second film: the various capacities of the proton pack are often used in a painstaking to solve simple puzzles, and can be further enhanced through a special menu. What makes this structure truly original is the way in which the HUD has been implemented: all the data relating to our alter-ego such as its vitality and the remaining charge of the rifle are shown directly on the proton pack, always visible, through special colored bars. Firing a proton stream and knowing when to cool down the rifle, i.e. reloading it, is one of the key situations in Ghostbusters: The Video Game, and all of this information is provided to the player without any on-screen graphics, making the game feel even more like itto a movie. The use of sensors to detect ghosts, on the other hand, takes a bit of a back seat, although it allows you to acquire important information on creatures and find nice Easter Eggs. In short, the game is there. The sometimes unbalanced difficulty is perhaps the most serious flaw of a decidedly solid and captivating gameplay, aimed at fans and beyond: often original and inventive, Ghostbusters: The Video Game is able to amaze when you least expect it. Playstation 3 trophies Ghostbusters: The Video Game offers fifty bronze trophies, four gold trophies and one platinum trophy. To obtain them it is necessary to complete the game by examining certain aspects such as capturing ghosts, multiplayer modes and weapon upgrades. Not all tie-ins come out without a hole If the single-player campaign wasn't enough for an avid fan, the guys at Terminal Reality have thought of implementing a decent multiplayer mode in Ghostbusters: The Video Game. There are six possibilities in multiplayer, passing through games such as Destruction in which it is necessary to destroy as many targets as possible or Containment in which you only win by capturing more ghosts than other players in a limited time. There are also two cooperative modes, which allow you to carry out some tasks or a series of missions with other online players, drawing from the game scenarios. Each mission won allows you to increase the player's Ghostbuster rank, climbing a real online leaderboard. A convincing game, then, but how does it perform from a technical point of view? The CG cutscenes that tell the story by proposing a computerized version of the famous Ghostbusters are excellent, truly faithful in appearance and movements; However, the same cannot be said of the non-interactive sequences that exploit the game's graphics engine, in which the polygonal models of the characters often converse with a few animations that express their state of mind. Nothing tragic however: the engine behaves decidedly well, offering really accurate animations during clashes and explorations, and a visual rendering that impressively recalls the original films, considering then that places like the Sedgwick Hotel or the inevitable headquarters are revisited, full of silly but fun Easter Eggs. A rather evident screen-tearing and some drops in frame rates slightly lower the visual quality of the title, which however remains quite high. On the other hand, nothing to say about the audio sector: the original soundtrack of the films directed by Reitman also accompanies us in this adventure, even if perhaps it would have been necessary to introduce some musical tracks that would increase the variety. On the other hand, it is impossible to discuss the mammoth interpretation of Murray, Aykroyd and associates, who are nothing short of grandiose.", "date": "2009-07-06", "grade": "8.0"}
