And complete, the FPS Bohemia is not even at launch, as the first part of the campaign will be released in October through a free DLC. This means that, for now, the only single player content already included in the package is made up of tutorials, training courses and simulated scenarios. But the Bohemia title is incredibly complex and has an intuitive editor on its side that allows you to quickly create single player and multiplayer scenarios. So much so that it has already allowed the community to upload over 46 pages of content to the game hub of the Steam Workshop service. ArmA III is the solid foundation of a future that promises wonders War without borders ArmA is a brand dedicated to simulation and greatness. There is no destruction of Battlefield but, on the other hand, there is an immense playing area, greater than that of any other shooter, which with the third installment of the series also extends below the surface of the sea. We are talking about sidereal distances involving fights that enhance the excellent ballistic component of the title and enhance the role of the means. These, often necessary to carry out approach maneuvers or even just to reach a target that can be up to twenty kilometers away, enjoy a greater sensation of adherence to the ground compared to what happened in the past. But this factor does not simplify the control which is decidedly realistic and, in the case of aircraft, quite complex. The simulation, on the other hand, is a founding element of the title that limits the videogame omnipotence to which a large part of the users of the FPS genre are accustomed. Helicopters start up very slowly, cannons are not particularly effective against infantry, extreme maneuvers are often inadvisable, and it is not possible to charge an engineer platoon to repair an aircraft while it is being repeatedly hit by the enemy. The result is a shooter that does not facilitate heroic actions, making their eventual success much more satisfying, and allows units of different types to cooperate in an atmosphere of caution and tension that is consistent with the realistic setting. Despite this, ArmA III is not an unapproachable monster, but it is full of fundamental commands for survival and must be approached with the awareness of having to face a steep learning curve. The player must not only learn to fly, steer, evade and calculate drifts and ballistic anomalies, but must take measurements with the simulated movements of the soldiers who can assume different positions, such as sitting which allows the sniper to aim accurately even without lie down, but which forces him to deal with the joints which, unlike what happens in less realistic titles, do not allow rapid movements or sudden rotations when lying down or kneeling. Furthermore, in the ArmA series it happens to die with one shot, the engagement distances are often very high and the ballistics of rifles and cannons, as we have anticipated, are simulated with extreme care. It's no coincidence that, even if the campaign didn't make it in time for launch, the team has already implemented several showcases in the beta that recreate precise situations and guide the player in the overall understanding of the gameplay. In the tutorial section, expanded with activities set on the island of Altis that became available with the launch of the final version of the title, there are entire scenarios that guide the player through the novelties, such as the underwater dimension and, in parallel, show the creative possibilities of the editor. Long missions complete with saves and animated introductions that somehow compensate for the lack of the campaign and work as complex tutorials. For example, in the case of the training courses, it is possible to face challenges of increasing difficulty while the NATO test field, with dozens of vehicles all packed together, allows you to test your configuration and fine-tune the visual settings. Extremely varied settings that allow for millimeter calibration and to maintain good graphics performance even on mid-range systems. But it is undeniable that ArmA III expresses itself at its best only when it becomes possible to breathe the atmosphere of the Greek islands, glimpse a column of carts in the distance and admire the lights of a battle fought in the middle of the night in all their splendour. The glance, even at maximum detail, is not comparable to that of thethe PC version of Battlefield 3 or 4 but the models are excellent, the lighting is great and the draw distance is extremely high. All elements that, combined with high graphics settings, can make even the slowest and most disappointing game, fought at random by players who will probably abandon ArmA III in a couple of weeks, intriguing, provided you appreciate the formula. With our configuration the title has an acceptable fluidity, even if not exciting, with the automatic settings which, in our case, mix medium and high settings in 1920x1080 resolution. By lowering the resolution it is obviously possible to raise the bar and as a result, in exchange for an inevitable loss in terms of definition, a more lively and natural way of playing is obtained. Obviously it's up to everyone to find their own compromise unless, of course, they own a decidedly high-end system. Pillars and promises Defining and evaluating ArmA III is a difficult task. It is a title in progress, incomplete but already immense and which requires several hours just to be approached. Of course, the offer does not lack the classic modes of the FPS genre, but just looking for a flag in a 270 square kilometer map is like participating in scout camp training when it is possible to play the role of a general in great maneuvers. No wonder then that the most played modes are the open ones, with RPG and Wasteland dominating the server list. Modes that are extremely free and not particularly suitable for public servers, where players meet who have no intention of respecting the tacit or explicit rules of this type of gameplay. But with the structuring of the community there will be more and more opportunities to join groups that aim to simulate realistic war situations or that recreate entire military campaigns in detail or those clans that aim to exploit the high simulation rate of the title to give a pinch of more pepper to competition. All scenarios that are based on three pillars which are the gameplay, the graphics engine and the editor. Elements finally matured with the launch of the title and which will accompany the player during the evolution of an experience which is just at the beginning but which can already be enjoyed on several levels thanks to the various game modes in which you find yourself giving orders to entire squads, team up with dozens of human or virtual companions, and rely on computer-controlled allies for enemy location tracking, cover, and healing. Currently not all the graphic effects are at the same quality level, there will still be balances in quantity and there are several glitches, typical defects of any production of this magnitude. Furthermore, although the optimization is better than that of the past chapters, the frame rate fluctuates a lot depending on the situation and in some lighting conditions the image loses depth. But the overall yield is still amazing, between realistic rain, credible smoke effects and dozens of units controlled by a still imperfect but versatile artificial intelligence, which is capable of coherently managing various units with different roles. And the whole thing, we recall, is placed on a huge map that can simultaneously host large-scale clashes located tens of kilometers from each other. To this we must then add very important improvements concerning the audio sector, full of realistic and very high quality samplings, and the tactile feedback of the weapons, the movements of the characters and the behavior of the vehicles which, although still crude, has nevertheless made a step forward. Furthermore, we certainly cannot forget the implementation of the underwater environment with huge carefully designed backdrops that enrich the game dynamics and the overall depth of the experience. At this point we just have to talk about the editor (not a real modding tool, but functional for creating missions and scenarios in the Bohemia sandbox) which is much more intuitive and full of options than in the past. With just a few clicks we are given the possibility to set, in detail, the behavior of the enemies controlled by artificial intelligence and to quickly set up sequences of objectives, helicopter attacks or mixed situations that enhance the high balance of the title. Basically, in a few hours, it is possible to create a complex scenario to play alone or with friends, sure that, given the immensity of the map, the same battlefield will give rise to hundreds of different situations and outcomes. We can therefore say that those three pillars we have been talking aboutthey are quite firm just now. The server of your dreams probably doesn't exist yet, the multitude of vehicles and armaments promised by Bohemia is missing, the custom multiplayer games send the engine optimization to hell and the single player is still a promise whose absence is counterbalanced by some scenario generic. But when these elements finally fall into place we can safely say that they will rest on an extremely solid foundation, more solid than that of ArmA II, which has however given birth to very high quality modifications and projects.", "date": "2013-09-16", "grade": "8.2"}
