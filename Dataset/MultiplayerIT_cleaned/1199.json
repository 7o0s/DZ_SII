{"name": "Burnout 3: Takedown", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/burnout-3-takedown.html", "text": "All around the world In an evident state of grace, Criterion didn't just further refine the gameplay formula of the best arcade racing game in recent history; instead, he also wanted to dispel the classic figure of the ~good game that doesn't last long~, inserting a truly massive World Tour mode within the play package. Backbone of the single player side of the title, this winds through three continents (United States, Europe and Asia) which form the backdrop to the tracks and the related competitions of which it is composed. The player is free to tackle the races substantially in the order he prefers, using a convenient map (the so-called Crash Nav) on which the available events are highlighted. Completing them with at least a third-place finish will unlock new ones, while getting the gold medal will give you access to a huge series of bonuses and various prizes, in pure EA style, culminating with the granting of the most powerful cars and bizarre of the game. The World Tour is made up of a number of different disciplines, namely Single Race, Grand Prix, Eliminator (every lap the last car is excluded), Flying Lap (a frantic Time Attack), Confrontation, Road Fury (where the the goal is to carry out a certain number of Takedowns), a Special Event and the inevitable Clash, or the mode introduced by the prequel in which it is necessary to launch into road junctions and cause as much damage as possible. In Burnout 3 this section is not only expanded from a quantitative point of view (there are as many as 100 different scenarios available), but also from a purely spectacular and choreographic one: the authors of this improvement are the aforementioned impact time, the presence of a series of bonuses to collect in the middle of the work and a new option called Crashbreaker, which allows you to blow up your car - with the necessary consequences - following a certain number of collisions. In short, where in Burnout 2 very often one had to rely on luck to score high scores, in this third episode the whole process depends much more on the user's ability to provoke clashes and manage the motion of the car's carcass. own car, making it all the more fun. The goodness of this and all the other modes making up the World Tour (with the partial exception of Eliminator, subdued compared to the others) makes the single player side of Burnout 3 a very satisfying and engaging experience, varied at the right point and decidedly long-lived compared to the standards of the genre. Especially if the player wants to get all the gold medals available, a highly recommended undertaking given the value of the unlockable elements and yet far from being a walk in health, due to the considerable aggressiveness of the opponents, especially in the advanced stages : in this sense, it can be frustrating to note how sometimes rival cars ~cheat~ managing to remain glued to their tail despite impeccable driving behavior under the banner of the most unbridled turbo. And there are three. After the freshness of the first episode and the exceptional quality of the second, the Burnout series returns to the screens of Xbox and Playstation2 with the difficult task of proposing a sequel to a title defined by many as the best arcade racing game ever. And he tries, with blows, with this Burnout 3: Takedown. Online crashing Burnout 3 has a decent multiplayer mode for two players via split screen, but the real novelty of the Criterion title in this area is certainly represented by the possibility of challenging other users online. Online games can contain up to a maximum of six players for the two course sections available (Team Race and Road Fury), while the number rises to eight in the so-called Crash Party (whoever scores the most points in a scenario wins Crash). Then there is the Double Impact, however reserved exclusively for two users, in which both players must launch themselves into the same dangerous intersection in order to obtain the highest score. Even if a couple of more modes would certainly have been nice, the online feature of Burnout 3 turns out to be decidedly fun, exciting and engaging, although burdened by a series of problems caused by the -bad- management of EA servers (especially on Xbox) which they tend to bring users down with frustrating frequency. Then some inefficiencies are regrettable such as the impossibility of entering a game that has already begun or such as the sensational one that prevents players with a 60 Hz television system from playing with those at 50 and vice versa. In short, a heavy title like Burnout 3 certainly deserved a sbetter support. Clash of versions The comparison between the two Xbox and Playstation2 incarnations of the game from a technical point of view could not be missing. It must be said that the graphic differences are much less marked than in other multiplatform products: to all intents and purposes, the version for the Sony black monolith suffers only from greater aliasing, while for the rest it is similar in all respects to the Xbox counterpart. On the other hand, the gap in terms of loading times is more sensitive, obviously longer on Playstation2 also in relation to the passage from one music track to another. On the other hand, Sony users can boast of the exclusive presence of a demo of Need For Speed Underground 2: a move that is not exactly apt, given the very incomplete build of the game, which makes any kind of comparison with the Criterion title embarrassing. Audiovisual department The first two Burnouts had accustomed their fans very well from a graphic point of view, managing to combine an absolutely frightening game speed with a well-finished and spectacular cosmetics. As was to be expected, Burnout 3 continues the glorious tradition, presenting itself in a first-rate technical guise: the scenarios show greater scenographic richness, showing paths rich in detail and glimpses of great visual power. Undoubtedly superior to those of the prequel in strictly visual terms, the streets of Burnout 3 perhaps denote a slight lack of personality, resulting all in all rather conventional as regards the various landscapes, but still perform their job impeccably in the game economy . If you want to nitpick, even most of the approximately 60 cars offered under the Criterion title are not surprising for the variety and originality of the design (there are unfairly few colors available for each car), but do not raise any perplexity regarding their modeling, excellent from every point of view. Instead, it does not struggle to set a new yardstick for the graphic quality of accidents: the cars crumple, roll and lose pieces in a blaze of sparks, deforming and moving very realistically in relation to the type of impact suffered. A real feast for the eyes, accentuated by the slow-motion faculty of the impact time and which reaches its maximum apex in the Clash scenarios, authentic orgies of graphic magnificence applied to road accidents. Excellent on the graphic front, Burnout 3 is not fully convincing as regards the choice of musical tracks that form the background to the action; conforming the Criterion title to its own line of thought, EA has provided the game with a punk-rock tracklist composed of pieces by artists of dubious thickness. Not to mention that the tone of several songs is very unsuitable for the adrenaline-pumping atmosphere of the game, and that Dj Striker's interventions soon prove repetitive. But this is the only step backwards from a title that has substantially improved every aspect of its already excellent prequel, and which can therefore easily be forgiven. Comment Burnout 3: Takedown is, quite simply, the best arcade racing game ever created. Complete with an impeccable technical realization, a spectacular management of the clashes and an addictive gameplay, the Criterion title transcends the same classic definition of arcade proving to be able to last for a long time in single and above all multiplayer mode, thanks above all to the support of the online game. In short, Burnout 3 succeeds in raising the series to even higher quality levels, and consequently its purchase can only be recommended to anyone, under penalty of losing one of the brightest gems in today's videogame landscape. Pros: Excellent gameplay Great graphics Exciting single player mode Fun online multiplayer Cons: Uninspired soundtrack Some problems in network matches Crash Boom Bang As in the majority of today's racing games, before starting to devour asphalt it is necessary to go through driving school. Unlike the previous episode, in Burnout 3 the explanation of the game mechanics is entrusted to a video rather than a real training session: here the elusive Dj Striker (ubiquitous voice of the game that can be nice or hateful depending on the point of view) comments on the ~educational~ images that scroll across the screen, indoctrinating the user about the rules - old and new - that govern the world of Burnout. For the uninitiated, the Criterion title is an arcade racing game that constantly invites the player to take risks, rewarding him with a proportional filling of the barof the turbo, to then be donated copiously to get the better of your opponents: while driving it is therefore essential to perform a whole series of different dangerous actions (going against traffic, darting alongside vehicles, making jumps, drifting, hitting opponents and combinations of these), avoiding as much as possible crashing into traffic or elements of the scenery. So far, nothing new. But as the subtitle suggests, Burnout 3 definitely offers something more than the prequel; it is precisely the Takedown, or the art of making one's opponents crash. In addition to the obvious satisfaction of seeing a rival car crumple, the Takedown also has the playful benefits of slowing down the unfortunate contender and causing the player's boost gauge to stretch, with all the attendant benefits. At the same time, being the victim of a crash causes the same indicator to decrease: but thanks to an absolutely brilliant idea, even in the event of a collision, the user can try to turn the situation in his favor. In fact, here the so-called impact time enters the scene: by pressing the turbo button during the sequence of an accident, a slow-motion mode is activated which allows you to move the carcass of your vehicle in the desired direction, allowing you to carry out with this Impact takedowns on opponents and avoid turbo loss. If already the introduction of the Takedowns would have been enough to make Burnout 3 superior to the previous ones, with the real illumination of the impact time Criterion has succeeded in the feat of creating an arcade racing game whose game action knows no stops. Burnout 3 is a continuous adrenaline rush, a title that does not leave the user even a moment of breath and which forces him to reach new frontiers of eye-hand reactivity to cope with the stratospheric sensation of speed that it is able to offer. In two words: bloody fun.", "date": "2004-10-05", "grade": null}
