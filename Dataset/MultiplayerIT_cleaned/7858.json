For those who have not subscribed to the Season Pass, this DLC called ~Call to Arms Map Pack~ costs 1000 Microsoft Points, or about 12 euros. A slightly higher price than the predecessor Gears of War 3 had accustomed us to, which for 200 Microsoft Points less even offered something more. But let's see in detail the content of this DLC, the pros and cons of the new additions made. Modes and extras present The first thing that catches the eye is that after downloading and installing the DLC, a new game mode appears called Arms Master, a clear reference to any Call of Duty and its famous ~arms game~ to which it is evidently assonant. Well, just like in the Activision titles, in Gears of War: Judgment in this case it is necessary to arrive at a series of 20 kills by changing weapons each time and without ever using melee or melee attacks. In essence, it is a question of highlighting one's ability in the use of the various weapons on which the game hinges its gameplay. Ultimately, however, we would like to say that this new mode does not represent the ~true nature~ and the heart of the Gears of War gameplay, fundamentally based (perhaps even romantically, after so many years after the release of the first chapter) on the team play, covers and group strategy. In this ~all against all~ where the strategy of choosing the weapon is totally skipped, we see very confusing matches, without tactics or tactics. Perhaps some might like it, especially fans of one-on-one games, but in essence the great frenzy that ensues is less fun than the classic more reasoned matches, in which fear and the fear of being killed is a fundamental part of the game. But here the boundary between subjective tastes and the limits of the game is very blurred. The release of Judgment had in fact split the community of fans of the saga in half, who badly digested the change of direction desired by the new People Can Fly development team. While on the one hand the effort to create something new without resting on one's laurels was commendable, on the other hand the originality of Judgment was not appreciated by everyone. Where the gameplay was based on teamwork here it has been replaced by a more solitary soul, as the ~Free for All~ mode itself underlines. This first real DLC had to somehow ~recover~ that slice of enthusiasts who had gotten lost along the way and who didn't appreciate the new Gears of War line, but unfortunately the inserted mode goes totally in the opposite direction. Let me be clear, many may like it and it is not a bad job, but simply something that goes against the very nature of the series, regardless of the (valuable) technical work that results. Xbox 360 goals Also this DLC, in line with the policy of the case, offers an additional 250 points to be unlocked through 10 objectives. They are not difficult objectives, but rather it should be noted that many of them manage to ruin the very essence of the game, transforming the maps into surreal places such as for example you will see a ~Station~ full of resuscitators, or in ~Cemetery ~ Players constantly hit Boomshield. Tying particular actions to a particular place is never wise, dear developers. The new maps available In addition to the new mode, the price of the ~Call to Arms~ DLC also includes six skins to customize our characters and three unpublished maps (one is actually a remake of a famous location in the series). We obviously expected more given the price of the download, at least the unreleased playable characters and at least the five standard maps we were used to, but unfortunately none of this. The three new maps are called ~Station~, ~Cemetery~ and ~Blood Trail~. The first, slightly asymmetrical, is a set of narrow corridors all leading to a central mausoleum. From the outer parts of the maps, more raised, we find ideal places from which to use long-range weapons and to target those who are in the center or in the immediately lower part. The second is a revisitation of a famous map from Gears of War 2 called ~Bloodthirsty~ and reproposed also in the third chapter, symmetrical, it develops vertically through long stairways that lead to internal rooms with no way out, which offer shelter but also a possible trap. In this case, the structures added to the sides slightly modify the appearance of the map, and the repositionThe increase of power weapons causes a certain sense of loss to be created in the most shrewd Gears player due to the deja vu of the known map, but from the unprecedented changes. The last map proposed in this DLC, ~Station~, was designed and proposed exclusively for the game in OverRun / Survival mode and therefore offers quite open environments devoted to fortification, in a large semi-destroyed station that also offers a high distance between the various sides and therefore, from elevated positions, it also allows sniping thanks to a very wide view. The three maps are very well designed and made with the usual painstaking care that distinguishes all the locations dedicated to multiplayer in the series. On the artistic front it remains on the levels already touched upon above, above all as regards the musical accompaniment which is confirmed once again of great depth thanks to rhythmic but wide-ranging orchestrated music, always dark, bellicose, almost dark. Ultimately, summing up, we cannot be satisfied with this first paid DLC dedicated to Gears of War: Judgment. In our opinion, there were mainly two errors: the price outside the standards of the series and of these productions in general, obviously related to what the DLC itself has to offer, and lastly the fact that the developer was not listening to the ~old~ game community that was clamoring for a return to the original dynamics of the series, a rather strange factor given that Epic (in this case the publisher) is famous for having an eye towards its fans. We expect more from the next update.", "date": "2013-05-03", "grade": null}
