Thanks to the good dose of elements identical to the first iteration and a year full of the latest generational releases, Team Ninja has nevertheless launched an interesting and well-made game on the market, with all the limitations well known to the public. After several months and in the middle of a torrid summer heat, the first of three additional packages arrives on the market: the Disciple of Tengu. We already knew months before the release, thanks to an interview done in Rome with one of the members of the team, that the Nioh 2 DLC would take place chronologically earlier than the main campaign. With the review of Nioh 2: the Disciple of Tengu now time to decide whether the quality and quantity of content included are sufficient to justify the outlay, however more than content. Medieval Japan The story of Tengu's Disciple takes us all the way back to 1185, the year commonly regarded as the beginning of Japan's medieval era, just after a raging civil war. Exactly as it has always been for Nioh, the team's goal is to combine historical facts with oriental folklore to which they belong, exploiting important personalities and re-adapting everything to the surreal imagery set up by Team Ninja. our protagonist is sent back in time and catapulted into a remote and very distant region compared to the one previously experienced. In search of the truth we find ourselves in a couple of long and substantial main missions, but slightly too simple for those who are familiar with the title. During the adventure we will get to know historical figures such as Benkei, and the two main missions will culminate in an interesting and well done bossfight, even if close to others already seen during the basic campaign. Unfortunately what really left us perplexed is the speed with which the events conclude, not giving the player time to settle in and get passionate about the story, having to return very soon to the ~present~ of 1600. It is true that we have always preached the paucity of the narrative aspect of Nioh, but the fact remains that we would not have minded a further main mission and a couple of more bosses. Speaking of bosses, it is impossible not to notice an important recycling towards one of the three present during the campaign, which even takes up with both hands from a clash of the first Nioh. It is in all respects a revision that fixes some past problems, but at the same time presents new ones, such as totally busted hitboxes in relation to explosive counterattacks. New challenges The Disciple of Tengu is not only made up of the two main missions that we have already talked about. Within the new region there are also eight other secondary missions, some of which are interesting and successful, but which only replicate the formulas already known. Between one-on-one fights in small arenas and more complex assignments using the maps of the main ones with some changes in the routes, it is difficult to really find new stimuli in the structure of the quests of this DLC, which remain essentially the ones we have always known. On the other hand Nioh enthusiasts are concerned with other things and mainly with the new weapons and the addition of further NG+. From this point of view The Disciple of Tengu performs very well. The new added class, the Composite B is a well-crafted and a lot of fun to use, perhaps even more than the ones introduced by Nioh 2 in the base game. The different stances allow profoundly different approaches and even a great Kusarigama lover like yours truly enjoyed taking advantage of the new toy to tame the hordes of Yokai. What surprised us most is the customization of the weapon, among the most articulated and structured, confirming the work done by Team Ninja to increase variety. Speaking of Yokai, even from this point of view the DLC innovates little, albeit with some interesting variables. All the new types of demonic warriors are well made and one in particular varies a lot from the mobility we were used to. The new choice is small and certainly something more could have been done in this sense, especially given the lack of variety already present compared to the first chapter. Despite this, even the major Yokai added or revisited work well enough to give satisfaction, and this is certainly an important detail. To conclude, one cannot fail to mention the new ~Dream of the Demon~. Again managed as a sort of ulteriorand NG+, the new mode was eagerly awaited by all those players who were disappointed by the presence of only one additional dream in the base game. With a recommended initial level of 250 (consider that the DLC, accessible only after the end of the campaign, recommends 120 in NG), it is evident how the leap from the initial campaign pushes veterans to many more hours of farming, also considering the new sets dedicated to the profoundly different historical period. We have to say that given the strong chronological distance, we would have expected to find some stylistic choices (and perhaps gameplay) that varied the cards a bit. It is true that Japan was not exactly a harbinger of great advances in its medieval period, but a certain type of backwardness and cultural closure, even pre-Mongol, could have turned out to be a discreet and pleasant variation on the theme.", "date": "2020-08-03", "grade": "8.0"}
