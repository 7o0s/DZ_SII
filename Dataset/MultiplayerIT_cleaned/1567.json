{"name": "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic_b.html", "text": "The force is strong in this game The epic story behind KOTOR is set a couple of millennia before the events narrated in the first episodes of the Star Wars saga, in an era of great political and military tension. The forces of the Republic, seriously downsized by a series of previous conflicts, are forced to face the onslaught of the mysterious yet powerful army of the Sith, followers of the dark side of the Force led by the evil Lord Malak. These, once an honorable and valiant Jedi, disappeared on a mission a few years earlier to then return at the head of such a devastating war machine, with the precise aim of conquering the galaxy. In this scenario the adventure of the player takes place, who plays the role of a common soldier of the Republic, destined however to become a Jedi and a hero... for better or for worse. But let's go in order. Like any good self-respecting western RPG, KOTOR starts with the character creation screen, going through the selection phases of gender, facial appearance, name and one of the three available classes, i.e. Soldier (strong and skilled in fights), Scoundrel (physically weak but more gifted in the various skills) and Scout (the classic middle ground). It is then possible to leave the task of distributing the points among the various skills to the CPU and select the most suitable skills or manage the matter independently; in this case it is necessary to establish the values of strength, dexterity, constitution, wisdom, intelligence and charisma of your character, the level of the various skills (eight in total) and the initial powers (Feats). These elements, all of which can obviously be upgraded on the occasion of the various level-ups that are needed when certain peaks of experience points are reached. Once this is done, you are ready to begin the real adventure, and after just a few moments of playing KOTOR presents all the trappings of an RPG of excellent workmanship: vast environments to explore, very rich in characters to interact with, mountains of quests and different sub-quests to tackle and tons of fights to deal with, all done with the expertise you'd expect from an expert software house like Bioware. There are seven wonderful scenarios through which the KOTOR adventure unfolds, freely explorable by the player and characterized by a lack of linearity which is decidedly in favor of both the longevity of the title (already guaranteed by its considerable length) and the satisfaction of the user, who feels to all intents and purposes the master of his own choices. In fact, the decisions made during the dialogues and during the various quests not only modify the outcomes of the final rewards, but also determine a progressive passage of the character towards the positive or negative side of the Force, altering his character and physical appearance: therefore a series of noble actions will lead one's character to be respected and well-liked by the people, while a negative behavior will modify some features of the face (deep-set eyes, pallor and so on) making him feared and hated by all. Furthermore, depending on the inclinations of your character, the story of the game will take different turns, leading to two distinct endings. The gameplay is what gives the RPG the punch An RPG is also made up of fights, and KOTOR also excels in this aspect. Of the nine characters who will thicken your party during the game, only two can join the protagonist in the actual action (it is however possible to choose your companions at any time, except in the dungeons), often also taking part in the dialogues and providing advice to the player. The user can take direct control of any of the three characters on the field while the other two follow him, so as to be able to make the most of their various abilities: for example, faced with a closed door or a mine to be defused, he can prove appropriate to have the party member with the highest skills in the relevant fields act. Even during the fights, we said, the player discovers he is the absolute master of the situation, being able to easily manage each battle thanks to the excellent system (a hybrid between real time and turn-based management) by Bioware. It is possible to face the clashes with the enemies both with a more action approach in real time, letting the CPU manage the two companions, and in a more reasoned way, assigning the desired orders to each character: this thanks to the specific function of the white key of the pad, in charge of pausing the game to allow the user to choosethe attack methods you prefer. The range of selectable moves, in fact, varies according to the character's abilities, the weapon he wields and the ability or not to use the Force (which in fact makes it possible to execute various spells and magic), making the action combat always varied and extremely dynamic. As if the levels of excellence achieved by KOTOR in the two basic elements of the RPG genre, exploration and combat, weren't enough, the LucasArts product continues to amaze thanks to a boundless series of other absolutely positive aspects. First of all, the great variety of situations proposed by the game is truly remarkable, not only at the level of quests - however very differentiated and never repetitive - but also thanks to the contribution of various sub-games, including some shooter sections, speedbike board and an inevitable and highly enjoyable card game. Furthermore, enthusiasts of item collecting and various upgrades will be delighted knowing that the KOTOR universe is not only teeming with an infinite number of objects, weapons and armor to collect and equip, but that some of these can also be upgraded thanks to particular elements and crystals capable of making swords, armor, blasters and lightsabers even stronger. In any case, Bioware has been able to combine a first-rate technical realization with an absolutely impeccable game structure, making KOTOR a joy for the eyes and ears as well. Graphically, the title presents scenarios of great beauty, built in perfect Star Wars style, as well as perfectly relevant to the film series are the various races with which you will have to deal, from Humans to Wookies to Hutts, all characterized by an absolutely stellar dubbing . The polygonal models of the characters are excellent, only slightly penalized by some not exceptional animations, while textures and light effects often amaze for cleanliness and spectacularity: the only negative note are some drops in frame rate, however not heavy. The roundup ends in style with a screaming sound and musical accompaniment, which has always been a trademark of LucasArts products. Comment KOTOR manages to reach peaks of excellence in practically every aspect, making it not only one of the best RPGs ever made, but also probably the happiest and most enveloping union between the Star Wars universe and a video game. The Bioware title, in fact, merges with extraordinary naturalness a deep, complex and absolutely satisfying game structure with a uniquely suggestive setting: and it does so by making use of an excellent technical realization and, above all, of a gameplay cared for down to the smallest detail, capable to literally kidnap the user, whether or not he is a fan of the genre. It is therefore impossible, in the light of these facts, not to recommend the purchase of KOTOR to every single Xbox owner with a minimum of videogame taste: and it is not an exaggeration to say that we are faced with the only seriously capable title to compete with Halo as the best product for the Microsoft platform. Pros: Deep, varied, rewarding and engaging gameplay Excellent technical realization Fascinating setting like few others Cons: Frame rate susceptible to drops Star Wars and videogames, i.e. the strongest and most lasting marriage ever made between the film industry and that of electronic entertainment: for many years now, titles linked to the historical Lucas film saga have periodically made their appearance on the most varied systems of game, strong in the colossal franchise to which they are linked and able to draw on the various elements offered by the boundless imaginative universe of which they are part. Precisely for this reason, Star Wars video games have been able to cover a large number of different genres: FPS, shooters, strategic, action, fighting games and more, in truth with not always excellent results. Impossible not to notice how, in the vast playful production of LucasArts, a real RPG set ~a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away~ had so far been missing. Fortunately, this gap has finally been filled. Fortunately this task was accomplished by Bioware. Luckily, Knights of the Old Republic turned out to be the masterpiece everyone was hoping for.", "date": "2003-08-01", "grade": null}
