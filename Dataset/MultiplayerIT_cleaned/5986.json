In fact, when the budget is tight, you have to make choices and make the best use of your resources: exactly what was done with this game. It can therefore happen to turn up one's nose in front of the close-up shot of a low-resolution texture, just as the ~old-gen~ atmosphere that one breathes in the first stages of the campaign is undeniable, but in front of such a solid and funny it is difficult to sketch criticism. The shooter experience that is proposed to us is a swirl of emotions, even capable of triggering a bit of ~motion sickness~ in people who have never suffered from it (the writer) when the scenario moves in every part, perhaps scrolling on a track and making rotations of the view while our character turns and shoots, shoots and turns to eliminate the many robots that come out of the fucking walls... but also from the slits in the floor. Assault Android Cactus is a solid, fun, frenetic and spectacular twin stick shooter: a must buy Space policewomen The protagonist of the game is Cactus, an android policewoman who responds to the call for help of a spaceship whose robots have rebelled against the crew, fielding a veritable army of lethal machines. Penetrated in a daring way into the hull of the structure, the girl comes into contact with other cyborgs, all belonging to the fairer sex, which we will be able to unlock with each defeated boss. The action takes place across five zones, to which, however, some surprises are added at the end, and the gameplay is precisely that of a very frenetic twin stick shooter but with some interesting strategic implications. The main weapon must in fact be alternated with the secondary one, with devastating power, but which can only be used for a few moments before it overheats and requires a few seconds of cooldown. In the case of Cactus, we are talking respectively of a light machine gun and a flamethrower, the latter characterized by a limited range but capable of causing huge damage if used up close. Switching from one weapon to another allows you to quickly eliminate the toughest enemies, which are often also the ones with the greatest firepower: red mechanical ~spiders~, large bipedal robots, turrets that shoot in multiple directions, ~ghosts~ that they emit lethal lasers then disappear and then of course the bosses. The work done in differentiating the various hostile units is commendable, and it takes just a few minutes to memorize the modus operandi of the different enemies we will have to face, implementing different tactics and attacking ~from the bank~ or frontally as the case may be. The bosses themselves are endowed with peculiar abilities and a fairly original design, in all cases with various portions of vital energy to be emptied with our offensive, which open up to as many phases of the combat. The importance of power-ups In Assault Android Cactus there are no boosts for the characters, which remain in fact always the same from the beginning to the end of the campaign; however, some enemies release power-ups that allow you to increase movement and attack speed, use pods to obtain additional fire, immobilize targets for a few moments and, finally, recharge their ~batteries~. A concept, the latter, which takes on greater importance as we progress in the game: if our energy reaches zero, it is game over. Comparing concepts The Assault Android Cactus campaign can be played solo or in cooperative multiplayer for up to four players, but only locally. The lack of online access and a ~pure~ duration of no more than three hours, together with the not particularly sophisticated graphics, which leave a little indifferent especially in the first levels (although recovering great in the advanced stages) are in the end the only criticality of a product that engages very quickly and which, after the first moments of learning, turns into a swirl of emotions, an engaging experience to the point that at each game over it is impossible to resist the temptation to try the failed internship again, perhaps by changing character. And that's where the fun comes in, because the game's roster consists of a total of nine androids (all female, as mentioned), each of which possesses a unique approach to combat. You have to move with the left analog stick and aim with the right, pressing the ffire via the right trigger and switching from the main weapon to the secondary one with the left trigger, but beyond the layout what changes is the equipment, and the differences are substantial. Take for example Starch, a real android rather than a human being with cybernetic implants (so much so that the final boss tells her ~you of all people should understand what I'm doing!~), armed with a persistent laser and a very fast missile launcher to research; or Peanut, a ~hard~ looking original, as composed of pieces of luck, even equipped with two horns (one of which is broken) and without an eye, but capable of shooting molten metal and operating a disruptive drill that ~pins~ enemies by destroying them; or again Aubergine, the most peculiar character in terms of equipment, equipped with a rotating blade that must be ~piloted~ towards the targets and a cannon capable of creating a small black hole. Each android presents a different experience, and in the end it becomes a kind of obligation to complete the stages by learning to use them all. A ~sly~ that the developers didn't think about, in fact, would have been to not make the single missions open to the unlocked cyborgs, thus forcing them to replay the story from scratch and perhaps inserting some alternative section (in addition to the simple dialogues, albeit interesting) to further differentiate the campaign and increase its duration. In fact, in support of this factor we find only the high score speech, interesting but up to a certain point, and a couple of extra modes: a survival and a boss rush.", "date": "2015-10-09", "grade": "8.0"}
