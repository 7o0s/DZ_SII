From the beginning it presents itself as a mere update of the first chapter, dating back to 2011, with various improvements and an extra city. Not bad, one might say, given that it is an accurate simulation of city buses (Germany only) and that, therefore, between one chapter and the next it is not possible to revolutionize the game system, which must simply aim at as accurate reproduction as possible of the activity represented. Now, from the point of view of the simulation, there is really everything: we have vehicles reconstructed down to the smallest detail that will make fans of the genre happy and we have excellent passenger management, with validation machine and stop times to respect (yes, in the game you have to make stops, as in reality). The software itself is also open and flexible enough to allow easy installation of mods and new scenery and vehicles. In short, basically OMSI 2 keeps what it promises and offers a large amount of options. For example the weather control, which allows players to drive in different conditions and is fully customizable, or the choice of vehicle, with the possibility of using single or double-decker buses. In all honesty, having never driven a bus in our life we have some difficulty in validating the accuracy of the simulation, but in general, from the information we have managed to get on the net, the physics is well reproduced and the feedback of the vehicle is convincing. In this regard, the use of the steering wheel is not only supported, but also highly requested. Also consider that there are very few simulators of the kind and that they usually require traveling long distances, especially outside urban areas, so we are faced with an almost unique title that requires an additional effort of understanding to be understood and appreciated . A bus simulator that only needs the sweat of the passengers to be perfect. He didn't have a ticket! So let's imagine ourselves in the role of a bus simulator enthusiast and immediately see what's wrong with OMSI 2. As already mentioned, the simulation is very accurate, so what more could you want? Well, in the meantime it will seem amazing to you looking at the images, but the title of MR Software is very heavy. On the test computer, whose configuration you can find in the appropriate box, we had very frequent frame rate drops. Indeed, let's call them collapses, not declines. What is this heaviness due to, given that the graphics engine certainly doesn't do visual wonders? Sure, there's all the physics simulation that definitely needs to be managed, but it doesn't feel like anything heavier than what we've seen in other titles. But let's pass over the dancer frame rate, which we can also tolerate (as you can imagine the gameplay is not based on alertness) and we come to the second, even bigger problem of OMSI 2: it is very buggy, to the point of being really annoying. In the first thirty minutes of testing we went back to the desktop four times, for seemingly no reason. Obviously, before reporting it in the review, because there is always the risk that it depends on our computer or our copy or bad luck, we did a search on the various forums to find out that, indeed, bugs are very common and we there are quite a few complaints about the game. We also found that installing various mods or add-ons increases instability, so we carefully avoided doing so to continue testing. Among the proposed solutions, the most effective was the reduction of the audio quality, which actually made OMSI 2 more stable (reducing the graphic quality didn't help much). Unfortunately the problems are not finished. In between crashes we were able to check for another set of issues. In the first place, polygonal interpenetration is very frequent: passengers in the middle of bus doors, flying pedestrians, others passing through parts of the scenario as if they were ghosts, atmospheric effects that create terrifying graphic artifacts, walls that appear and disappear, cats and dogs Instagramming photos and other biblical plagues flash across the screen in rapid succession, to the point where we suspect they're features and not glitches. Let's top it all off with a leaky CPU-driven bus AI to close the case for good. Yet we are particularly sorry to have to mistreat OMSI 2, because behind the austere exterior and behind the atrocious realization, there are some excellent elements that it is a pity to see overshadowed. For example the buses are reconstructed very accurately, with the new MAN NG272 and the various models of MAN NL202 to makeand strong pieces. The town, Spandau, is also beautifully modeled and a pleasure to visit. Particularly interesting is the possibility of touring it in the period from 1986 to 1994, i.e. before and after the fall of the Berlin Wall, observing some key places changed by the presence and collapse of the regime. If desired, it is also possible to manage the changes gradually, in order to experience them more directly while playing. In terms of customization of game options, OMSI 2 really offers a lot. In short, the simulator enthusiast we mentioned above will certainly be attracted by such a rich and varied offer. Too bad about the build!", "date": "2014-01-15", "grade": "5.0"}
