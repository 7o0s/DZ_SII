{"name": "Wario Land: the Shake Dimension - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wario-land-the-shake-dimension-recensione.html", "text": "The market release of Wario Land: the Shake Dimension assumes particular importance for a number of factors. First of all, it is an at least medium caliber Nintendo production that makes its debut in a year, 2008, certainly less steeped in high quality titles on Wii than the splendid 2007. Secondly, it is an opportunity to meet again the irreverent anti-hero within an adventure after a long time and following the long - and very welcome - interlude based on minigames. Lastly, The Shake Dimension is what could be defined as a white fly within the modern videogame landscape, since it is an old-school two-dimensional platformer in pure Nintendo style; a genre practically almost forgotten, if it weren't for a few small games on PSN, Xbox Live or Wii Ware. And so, is Wario the man of the new-old course, able to bring platforms back to their former glory and bring hardcore gamers closer to the big N? Evil is born The plot is pretty simple; Wario's help is in fact invoked by an inhabitant of the Shake Dimension, such Merpino the Merpino, following the kidnapping of Queen Merelda and her people (the Merpini in fact) by the evil Shake King. Certainly the fat anti-hero cannot be defined as a generous soul, but as soon as the kingdom's treasury is mentioned, a bag of money that never runs out, a particular interest instantly matures in him which leads him to accept the task. Loyalty to the mechanics of the past becomes evident from the very first moments, or more precisely from when you are invited to hold the wiimote horizontally without needing to point anywhere; here a directional cross is enough to move the protagonist and the 1 and 2 keys, linked to the attack and the jump. On this rocky foundation, the programmers wanted to build something more, which at least partially exploited the capabilities of the controller and at the same time offered some peculiar and interesting implications. Obviously the solution was to integrate some actions through the motion sensor, which are distinguished according to the context in which Wario is. Giving a shake to the wiimote, for example, the ground is hit, giving life to a small earthquake, which acts on some sensitive elements present in the settings. For example, it allows you to drop crates on the balance, or raise areas of the ground, or open passages and so on. Wielding an enemy or better yet a bag of cash, repeatedly shaking the controller causes Wario to do the same thing, gaining items or cash to collect. And again, by picking up a creature after having stunned it, it can be thrown towards otherwise unreachable areas, managing the direction simply by tilting the wiimote, in a way that is somewhat reminiscent of Yoshi's Island. More or less the inclusion of the peculiar capabilities of the console is all here, with the exception of driving some vehicles, such as the unicycle and the submarine, which however is not always reactive and precise, often touching frustration. An interesting aspect of the Shake Dimension lies in the structure of the various levels; the game world is in fact divided into 5 zones, each in turn made up of 5 other stages complete with a final boss. Although the aim is to reach the imprisoned Merpino at the end of each level, achieving this goal is actually only half the battle; the other half is escaping back to the starting point within the time limit. A potentially boring and avoidable practice, but which instead was made more than pleasant both by the different path that it is often necessary to adopt, and by the presence in some levels of a kind of tube that shoots Wario out making him run at breakneck speed, a bit Sonic to understand. By managing to maintain this ~bonus~ without crashing into the walls, the mission can be completed in record time, a feat that is not particularly simple and which can stimulate even expert players. Made in Wario We have previously mentioned the economic discourse, or rather the money that Wario can get during his adventure. Far from being destined to remain in the hero's pocket, this money should instead be destined for Captain Molasses' shop, a place where it is possible to buy not only extensions to your energy bar, but above all maps which are essentially the only way to access the different areas in the game. However, this means that on more than a few occasions it may happen that you do not have enough money to proceed further, with the need therefore to repeat levels already visited exclusively to increase one's finances; if so the choice to retraceon the contrary, the internships did not seem forced thanks to the coherent integration with the mechanics, on the contrary this situation appears as a simple and often irritating filler capable only of diluting the overall longevity, which settles around 5 hours. The repetition of the levels should have been optional, being already supported and justified by the presence of a series of treasures to be carefully tracked down; the classic solution therefore that goes well with that type of player who wishes to reach 100% completion, while leaving the others free to continue without problems. A pity therefore that significantly undermines the pleasantness of the Shake Dimension. From a technical point of view however, the work done is more than appreciable, especially by those who love two-dimensional graphics; despite the ups and downs, Nintendo's artists have packaged a colorful, cartoony product that seems hand-drawn and full of personality. Above all, the animations appear very well done, both for the protagonist and for the enemies, even more so in the case of the huge and fun bosses. The choice to adopt the widescreen yes, but cut at the edges leaves a little perplexed; in practice it remains a sort of 4:3 for the actual action, with some indicators and icons in the remaining space. The sound accompaniment is also fully convincing. Comment Wario Land: the Shake Dimension in all probability will not enter the Olympus of the best platformers made by Nintendo. Some questionable game design choices, a control system with some small flaws and a good but rarely exciting level structure slightly reduce what were the very high expectations when you are faced with a title that belongs to the genre that decreed the fortunes of the Kyoto house. Nonetheless, Wario's adventure remains a high quality product, which can be played with certain pleasure and which deserves to be taken into serious consideration by every Wii owner, even more so in a period that is not particularly explosive as regards outings planned between now and next Christmas. Pro A platformer from Nintendo, need more? Technically very good Entertaining Cons A little too short The economic aspect appears forced Control of the vehicles not flawless", "date": "2008-10-03", "grade": null}
