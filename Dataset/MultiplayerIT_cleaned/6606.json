If he wants to save himself, he only has the time of six hundred and thirty beats of his heart, or ten minutes and thirty seconds, or unlimited time by deactivating the timer, to remember who he is and get up. Retention starts with a bang, of a skull, and continues in the amazement of the player, forced to discover that they have sold him, fortunately for 0.99 including VAT, an image gallery. If we have not misunderstood the intention of the developers was to create a kind of visual stream of consciousness with the memories of the protagonist, the fascinating penetration into the memories of an individual through the photographs of his life. The player must select one of the three photographs that appear in the time slots of the bar that represents the time of existence of the accident victim. No clues are given: you have little time and you have to make your selection as quickly as possible to avoid death. Retention is an image gallery disguised as a video game, nothing more, nothing less Because it does not work Translated in terms of gameplay, you instinctively click on images as if there were no tomorrow, reading texts that should give it a sense by linking it to the story or to the feelings of the dying person, but which only create further confusion. Scrolling the entire bar and selecting an image for each box that composes it, one of the four possible endings is accessed. What determines the ending? Simple to understand: each card scores points for the ending it is associated with. Once all selections are made, the endgame with the most points wins. The problem is that it is not easy to understand the associations, so, apart from going by exclusion, it is difficult to define how to arrive at one ending rather than another. But that's beside the point, as the endings are all individual photos with text tacked onto them, visible even if you haven't unlocked them. The point is... there's no point. Not that Retention doesn't make sense, since it does both philosophically and mechanically. Except that after about half an hour, i.e. the time to finish it three times, we realize not only that we are faced with a mere slideshow of images passed off as a video game, but also with something conceptually wrong, at least from our point of view. view. In fact, the player is asked to build a flow of memories of someone who is not him, a flow whose conclusion can be summarized in playful terms as ~you got it right~ or ~you didn't get it right~. You know those tests found in popular culture weekly magazines that lead to an ideal profile through a series of multiple-choice questions or statements? Here, Retention is something like this, with the aggravating circumstance of not asking questions aimed at establishing a trait of the respondent, but of accumulating on the screen photos of the life of someone we don't know, of whom we are of little or no interest, certainly not for our lack of sensitivity, but because we are not given any emotional foothold to be interested in it. In short, it is as if the title wanted to psychoanalyze us by not being interested in who we are. The deception is so blatant that it becomes immediately annoying. Imagine paying a psychologist who instead of making you lie down on the couch and start therapy, would start telling you about his problems. Someone may be wondering at this point if at least the photos are beautiful. Except that until you have selected them, you can only see a fragment of them; however we can say that some are well taken, others less so. Too bad we're going astray: it's not that to make a video game beautiful it's enough to put somewhere a beautiful work of another medium, otherwise by placing the Mona Lisa everywhere you'd all have masterpieces. Simply put, Retention is someone's attempt to get us to play with their scrapbook, without bothering to let us know why we should care to do so.", "date": "2015-01-29", "grade": "1.0"}
