Just think of the recent Injustice 2. The battle, however, up to now has only been furiously fought in two-dimensional arenas, where the three-dimensional movement-based fighting games have been left to their own devices. In these now deserted arenas only Tekken remained to reign, with his mistakes and his style falls as the only enemy to defeat. Not a good situation when trying to evolve a historical saga, as the absence of worthy challengers leads a warrior to shrink, to slowly die of starvation. Yet Harada and his people have not stood idly by: over the years they have listened to their community (although Harada's troll tweets may suggest otherwise), observed the best fighting games on the square, and learned all the necessary lessons. Tekken 7 is the child of these experiences, and we have worn our fingers in its arenas to better understand its mechanics and improvements. Here is the account of our hard battles. Serpent relatives Tekken 7 builds its narrative on a premise that should not be underestimated: it wants to be the ~epic conclusion of the Mishima family saga~, in practice the closure of the interminable blood fight between Kazuya and Heihachi. It is indeed a refreshing change of direction from the absurd turn that the story of Tekken had taken in recent years; it's a back to basics, ditching the ludicrous twists and some of the mystical/fantasy elements in favor of some furious hatred between father and son. Of course, it is not the case to expect great finesse from the events of this chapter, but at least no Egyptian pseudo-gods in this round... and it is undeniably a big step forward. In any case, it must be said that many may be disappointed by the story mode of the title, because what seemed like a spectacular and long-lasting campaign capable of clarifying many obscure points of Tekkenian mythology and competing with the spectacular stories of the NetherRealm titles, was actually detected a ~only~ good experience, not exceptional in duration. We are talking about two and a half hours of history, in practice, in which you will face battles with various modifiers in the role of various characters in the game, interspersed with the narration of an unnamed journalist who did not really feel the need (if the the intent of the developers was to add dramatic charge, they failed) and where the fun comes more from the excesses and absurdity of certain situations than from the actual interest in the events. Put simply: excellent for a Tekken, not excellent within a genre where many developers are increasingly taking single player content to heart. Even the stories dedicated to the other characters that accompany the primary plot are little more than a sop, with single battles that unlock cutscenes of little importance. The only element of the campaign that can be praised without hesitation is the use of a naughty artificial intelligence, which in certain battles with the bosses will make you seriously sweat even on low difficulties; a bold solution that many developers no longer dare to apply in favor of usability. Playstation 4 trophies Tekken 7 boasts 43 trophies, but don't be fooled by the number, it's not a particularly complicated title to platinum. The vast majority will be unlocked by playing the story mode and spending a few hours in the Treasure Battle, while the more specific ones only require you to participate in certain online modes (such as the new tournament mode) and win single battles against human opponents over the network. The only minimally complicated trophies are the secret one - which requires you to complete the difficult ~special~ chapter of the story - and the one that requires you to perform multiple 10-hit combos, not exactly automatic for those who are not practical. Lots of beatings, lots of stuff However, the last Tekken does not have only this bombastic story mode to offer: the modes in the game are wasted, and start from a classic Arcade mode (with no final cutscenes, but no internal ~bosses~) to get up to the Treasure Battle, or the challenge against the artificial intelligence typical of the series, where from battle to battle (again some battles are against bosses or with special modifiers) you get experience to rise in rank and chests of variable rarity containing items for customization. And customization is another big plus point for the game, because the number of ogcastings and costumes per character is truly mind-boggling. You can make pretty much anyone look like a real idiot with goofy hats, crazy accessories and all sorts of niceties, or fine-tune their basic clothes to bring them closer to your taste. We assure you that it will be really difficult to meet a character identical to yours online - even if it were the same fighter - and, given that we are talking about online, it is appropriate to specify that in this field there is very little to complain about. In fact, it is possible to face ranked matches with a graded system similar to that of the Battle of the Treasure or Player Matches without commitments or tension, enriched by the addition of a Tournament Mode which randomizes the challenges between the participants and manages them in a similar way to what it happens in real competitive fighting game tournaments. We then found the inclusion of a test area in which it is possible to try out the various moves while waiting for a new opponent to be quite clever (particularly useful in the review phase, when the players were still very few). Remaining on the subject, the limited number of users before the release does not allow us to give a perfect assessment of the netcode, but we were still able to face many online games during our test, and we never had half a problem with lag with opponents from from much of Europe. It's a great sign, even if there is inevitably always some latency in commands in network matches, which makes the experience less pleasant and less responsive than in clashes with friends locally. The temper of the years However, the core of a fighting game remains the gameplay, and this is where Tekken can really stand out from much of the competition. We are still talking about a product that has been present in Japanese arcades for a long time now, which has been carefully refined in this console edition and filled with new characters. It is, without a doubt, one of the most balanced fighting games we have ever seen, and for once we feel entitled to say so, since we have been watching it for some time and the new warriors contained in this version have done nothing to make us change idea. The vast majority of historical characters have been honed after years of testing, analysis and consideration, and it's really hard to find someone who doesn't have at their disposal an incredibly elaborate move set capable of responding to all kinds of threats. All of this, that wasn't enough, happened without style falls or simplifications, because each choice of the Tekken roster boasts unique characteristics that make it a real pleasure to exploit attacks and abilities (in particular new entries such as Claudio and Lucky Chloe boast very interesting special mechanics) . Even juggling, the ~rebound~-based combo system for which the series is so known (and has often been criticized) has taken a step back this time: complex combos can still disintegrate a good chunk of your score bar life, but suffering one does not mean having almost automatically lost the game as in Tag Tournament 2, and the presence of Rage Arts allows you to recover from extremely uncomfortable situations, keeping the adrenaline high. The Rage Arts, for their part, are the ~super~ of Tekken, which can only be activated when you reach the final part of your life bar, and truly devastating when you manage to place them. Many will perhaps turn up their noses at the presence of a mechanic capable of overturning matches like this, but it is also well thought out: it scales with combinations, so it is not abuseable, and it changes the pace of the match by putting players on the defensive when that can be activated, in a game where the ability to defend oneself properly and manage spaces well is essential. Style evolution It doesn't end there: when activated, Rage also gives access to Rage Drives, additional moves that consume it like Rage Arts, usually linked to particularly powerful combinations (they vary significantly from character to character). In addition there are moves called Power Crush, in practice attacks equipped with ~armor~ that cannot be interrupted with medium and high blows, particularly useful from a tactical point of view in certain situations. Add that the rebounds on the ground that lengthened certain combos have been replaced by the ~Tailspin~ mechanic, which allows you to lengthen them but only with specific hits, and you will soon realize how much Tekken 7 has changed compared to the past. And believe us, they're pretty much all changes for the better, carefully crafted into a system that's intuitive and easy to learn, but frighteningly difficult to fully master. Considerate all these aspects, only the technical sector remains to be evaluated, which, although not up to the arcade version of the game, looks good on PlayStation 4 (where we tested it). On the base console the title runs at 900p, but maintains the 60 frames per second stable without any jolts and is more than pleasant to see, also by virtue of really beautiful stages and excellent animations. A note in particular must be made towards the soundtrack, of the highest quality and capable of dramatically increasing the exaltation during certain matches. In short, it is a complete package that is difficult to criticize, so much so that even the long uploads seen in the previous test versions have been eliminated.", "date": "2017-05-31", "grade": "8.8"}
