Since the title is expressly aimed at an audience of children (like the entire NewKidCo line), the level of difficulty is clearly low, if not non-existent, and unfortunately also the length of each single level is narrow to historical lows. Therefore, (for an adult) concluding the game within five to seven minutes will not be a complex operation and fortunately not even exhausting or frustrating, given that you don't even have time to become familiar with the game and the commands that already exist we find to read the final thanks. As far as the technical realization is concerned, we can't complain much: music and effects are honest (there isn't enough time to determine if they get boring) and together with the graphic characterization adopted they manage to create a convincing cartoonish atmosphere. Although the title is a GB / GBC hybrid, the graphics are defined and the color range used can be said to be varied and spot on. The animations of the elements present in the game, including those of Elmo, are instead limited, jerky and overall not very pleasant. The controls are reduced to the d-pad to move left and right, A is used to jump (inaccurately), while B is occasionally assigned secondary functions as needed. ... let's ask papa's opinion first! The game is difficult to generalize, since it includes different types of action (or perhaps none). What you have to do is proceed from left to right of the screen, avoiding the (few) enemies and obstacles, recovering the (many) energy points and extra lives. In reality, these last two elements are not essential, given that it will be very easy to complete the game without ever losing a life (this very rare eventuality would force us to repeat the level all over again). Clearly, the matter changes if the title is used by a child, preferably between three and six years of age, whose greatest difficulty could consist in holding, supporting and mastering the Game Boy, given the immaturity of the intellectual and manual skills appropriate to the 'age. Even if it must be admitted that today's children are very smart (a rhetorical phrase that I felt compelled to quote). ... let's ask papa's opinion first! Pros: Nice cartoony environment Cons: It takes longer to buy the game than to finish it Mom, mom, will you buy it for me? This title from NewKidCo, dating back to 1999, features a character from the famous Muppets stable as the protagonist, projected into a personal and solitary adventure, taken from the animated film of the same name. We are obviously talking about Elmo (as can be seen from the title) which together with his beloved blue cover constitutes an emotional union very similar to the much more famous one already proposed by Charles Schulz, but here with much less charm and sympathy. However, this does not mean that Elmo is very fond of his blanket and when, due to a gust of wind, it slips from his hands, nothing can stop him: he will have to find it at any cost. Through the eight levels, with different settings, which make up Grouchland we will have to guide our alter ego in this discovery operation. 1", "date": "2001-08-11", "grade": null}
