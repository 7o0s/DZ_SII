Without going too far back over the years, the fighters of the games of ancient Rome have in fact found space in works such as the famous film with Russell Crowe and the television series Spartacus, but continuing at the same time to struggle in video games. Apart from the recent Spartacus Legends, taken from the aforementioned television series, being able to measure oneself with a gladius and a shield in electronic entertainment is in fact a rarity. Furthermore, on PC, the gap is even greater, given that the aforementioned game has never arrived on this platform. For a few days now, Gladiators Online: Death Before Dishonor has arrived to try to fill this void: for the occasion, the Dorado Games development team has set up a free-to-play type structure, thus allowing you to pay your blood on the dust of ancient Rome without spending a sestertius, at least in theory. After some fierce battles in the virtual arenas, let's find out together how it went. Not even the strength of a gladiator saves Gladiators Online: Death Before Dishonor from failure! Budding lanists Defining Gladiators Online as a game of only gladiators is a bit incomplete, because in reality once connected to its servers we end up playing the role of the lanista first and foremost. This figure corresponds to the owner of the gymnasium where the warriors of the arenas trained, tying their fate on the battlefield to the prestige of the respective house. Like the new Quintus Lentulo Batiato we thus find ourselves faced with the first component of Gladiators Online, the management one, within which you have to train and equip your gladiators, making them level up to acquire new skills. The entry of other characters into the ~team~ is guaranteed by the auction system, the only way to buy new talents in Gladiators Online: the free-to-play formula adopted by the game allows you to do so using only virtual currency, obtained in the usual way by completing the various proposed objectives, but for the mechanics implemented it is undeniable that by spending real money it is possible to obtain at least an initial advantage, guaranteeing the services of the most promising fighters. Generally speaking, the division of the gladiators between the famous Myrmidon, Olpomachus, Thracian and Retiarius classes is appreciable: the first equipped with a heavy defence, the second and third more or less similar in their light equipment, while the fourth has the famous net used in conjunction with a trident. In addition to the equipment, to be bought and adapted to the class of the individual gladiator, Gladiators Online also offers a growth system, within which the player can assign a series of skill points to direct the character towards his own style of battle favorite. The attributes also increase at each level, but the player cannot modify them manually: they are in fact increased randomly with a roll of the dice, which can be repeated by spending a special bonus that can be purchased with the game's currency. A way like many that Gladiators Online implements to make us get our euros out, in short, especially in cases like the specific one where we risk being faced with a useless increase in an offensive attribute for a gladiator who instead prefers a defensive strategy . We also don't hide that we turned up our noses when learning of having to wait a certain period of time between one fight and another, to ensure that the gladiators recover health, energy and morale (in case of defeat): needless to say it is It is possible to speed up the various recoveries, but we are not even going to tell you how. That of waiting is a feature clearly taken from browser and mobile games, which adapts rather poorly to the desktop experience where one would expect instead to be able to play as much and when one wants. Blood and sand While presenting some ups and downs, the gaming experience described so far would not be too bad either, to the point of making us wonder why Dorado Games hasn't developed a ~managerial~ in all respects, in which to limit oneself to the simulation of clashes in arenas. In this way, Gladiators Online could perhaps have counted on a few more options for the lanista, instead of proposing an embarrassing combat system: the movements of the gladiators are impossibly woody, while the controls are too unresponsive to make it really feel like you're in an arena where your life is at stake. Because of all this, the combatento is reduced to just pressing the space bar like madmen, to try to give as much rhythm as possible to one's attacks interspersed with the gladiator's skills used almost at random. The 3D view, introduced by the developers after the launch to support the previous 2.5D, does not help, but rather contributes to making any strategy indefinable. The biggest flaw of the shot is that it lacks the sensation of depth and distance from the opponent, thus making the use of gladiators who prefer fighting from a distance less effective: it is also for this reason that one ends up feeling a 'absence of balance between the four classes present. In this light, the myrmidon seemed to us the wrestler most likely to win. The matchmaking is not saved either: it has happened to us more than once that we have expressed the preference of facing an opponent controlled by another human, to instead find one guided by the CPU. But perhaps it was a good thing, given that we also happened to find fights dominated by high latency, to give rise to a mix that we do not wish anyone to experience with the aforementioned woodiness. From a graphic point of view, the arenas are presented quite well, while the models of the gladiators are generally appreciable, even if in some cases they seem a bit disproportionate between the various parts of the body: the possibility of further modifying the their look, beyond the usual beard and hair cut.", "date": "2015-11-24", "grade": "4.0"}
