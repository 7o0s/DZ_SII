{"name": "4x4 Evolution - Un'evoluzione a 4 ruote?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/4x4-evolution-unevoluzione-a-4-ruote.html", "text": "Hardware, graphics and sound As already highlighted in the preview, the graphics of the game are very well cared for, with backdrops ranging from ~fairly done~ to ~highly suggestive~ and between snowy areas, gran canyons, cities, forests, jungles and ruins, your eyes cannot they will have to complain about the variety and the realization of the means. In this regard, I must admit that many models, although similar to each other (in the end there will be a dozen or so really different models), are really well done: the number of polygons and textures is above average, complete with visible polygonal pilots inside the driver's compartments. To season the visual section we also mention the variable weather conditions with rain, fog, fog (yes, there are 2 distinct fog density levels!), made in a satisfactory manner and the possibility of playing in the morning (complete with len's flare), afternoon and night (obviously with a really well done ~lighthouse~ effect); to spoil this beautiful graphic picture a little, we have some slowdowns in the early stages of the race (fortunately only there), if you play with the maximum number of opponents expected, and the presence of trains and trucks made in a mediocre way, certainly very below the graphics standard of the game. The sound quality is not the best, mainly due to uninspired music and sound effects that certainly do not represent a ~cutting edge~ for the competition. To enjoy 4x4 Evolution, you will need at least a P 200, 32mb of ram and a 4mb accelerated card, even if the best results are obtained with any P3 or Athlon, 128 mb of ram and a 16mb accelerated card; excellent news also on the multiplayer side, since in my many online games (with 56k analog modem) I haven't had any particular problems; also considering that, for now, I've only played on American servers, the situation can only improve as servers appear in our peninsula as well. Playability and longevity The first 5 minutes of the game can be summed up in one word: bewilderment! Well, whatever car or joypad setting I placed under my direct command, the steering response was too slow (1000 times more than Sega's 18 Wheeler to be clear!) and I promptly couldn't pass through any checkpoint by entering the reverse with a certain frequency, while all the other opponents had already distanced me by a lot; very discouraged and very frustrated, I already had the opinion of this work by Terminal Reality in mind until it occurred to me to change the class of the vehicle, given that the various 4x4s are divided into 3 groups or categories, which can thus be reclassified: the first category is extremely unplayable, super usable the third group of vehicles, so much so that in my first online game against 3 very aggressive Dreamcast owners I missed the first position for a few seconds. Convinced more and more that in life a game is evaluated ONLY after playing it ad nauseam (with all due respect to my imminent History exam), I jumped into the road test of the various game modes and beyond the usual races fast (quick races) or timed (time attack), the 2 real sovereign modes are ~career~ and ~multiplayer~. In the first you will be able to gradually buy new cars as well as many extra parts, as well as participate in special events not included in the other game modes; in general, these are fast races on limited track areas carefully selected by the programmers, while the very intuitive multiplayer mode allows you to play online with the owners of any videogame platform. After choosing where to play and waiting for the current match to finish (it's never happened to me before the start of a L match) you can access the match field and start pushing on the gas; note that unlike the Dreamcast version, which can be used online with up to 4 users, the one for Windows platforms allows up to 8 runners to challenge each other in breathtaking races. 5If we want to find a nit in the playability we could talk about an artificial intelligence of the opponents (or bot racers) that is not exactly satisfactory, or some absurd collisions when one vehicle collides with another and magically appears on it; or when an S.U.V. he is taken over by a train: in addition to teleporting once again onto the hit vehicle (in this particular case onto the train), he will remain still and motionless throughout the passage of the carriages as if they were all joined together. On balance 4x4 Evolution comes out almost unscathed by criticism thanks to a well done and fairly fast graphics, a goodoffline mode that will keep you busy for a few days and a fun multiplayer mode, capable of guaranteeing hours and hours of exciting races, all seasoned with a track editor thanks to which, in a short time, a lot of extra tracks created by the community will be available video game that will soon be born around this excellent game, myself included. 4-wheeled giants Expected for months and months, 4x4 Evolution by Terminal Reality is finally completed. The time has come to stop continually reviewing footage after footage, reading previews and definitively uninstalling the various demo and beta versions released before this moment. The first video game in history to unite owners of personal computers, Macintosh, Dreamcast and (it is said) Playstation2 through simultaneous online use is therefore a reality and it is with a certain emotion that we are preparing to try it! As you well know (if you've read my preview on Multiplayer.it), the new creation by the authors of the macabre Nocturne and Blair Witch project: Rustin Parr is an arcade-style racing game starring the giants of 4 wheels: the 4x4, or Sports Utility Vehicles are better: one of the characteristics of the game is the presence of ~official~ cars thanks to the purchase of licenses by the software.", "date": "2001-04-23", "grade": null}
