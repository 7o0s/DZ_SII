Whether you like it or not less, therefore, even here we find ourselves commanding a team of worms in turn-based battles focused on the annihilation of the opposing team, to be carried out through the use of deliberately exaggerated or improbable weapons. To tell the truth, it is precisely in this respect, traditionally among the strengths of the series, that Verm'Odyssey In Space shows its side a bit: the roster of tools is in fact limited to 17 units between gadgets and real weapons (a big drop compared to the 50 of Worms World Party), however orphaned of historical elements such as banana bombs and bungee cords. The gameplay remains basically the same as it was in 1995 You are a worm Of course, one cannot properly speak of a shortage in this sense, but the probable intention of meeting a more casual user has certainly ended up penalizing the THQ product. Despite the years it carries on its back and the aforementioned ~mutilations~, Worms still continues to entertain, especially in a multiplayer key, even if Team 17 deserves a good few slaps on the hands for the unjustified absence of the online component: in any case , gathering four people around a console and slaughtering each other with bazookas and grenades is always an exhilarating experience. On the single player front, however, the developers have tried to provide some more stimulus to users, first of all with a story mode with slightly more elaborate contents: in this case, the mode offers a series of missions with specific objectives to be met (for example example creating a tunnel with dynamite or defeating opponents using only the elements of the scenario), the completion of which allows you to unlock some extra content. Among these, six minigames specifically designed to exploit the peculiar Wii control system stand out: however, the quotation marks are a must, as these sections really leave the time they find. In short, the intention is commendable but the execution really leaves something to be desired. Remote possibility As often happens with productions for Wii, the greatest curiosity is directed towards the control system via Remote, which however in this case seems to complicate life for the player rather than making it easier. The d-pad is used to move the worms and aim, while most of the remaining actions are managed by the movements of the controller: and if selecting weapons and firing is a bit cumbersome but all in all acceptable, it is moving of the camera that enrages, debased to a very slow process assigned to the combination of the directional cross and translation of the Remote. One could say that what we saw in Verm'Odyssey in Space makes us regret traditional control systems, and in fact it is: but even with some not insignificant difficulties, the Team 17 title still manages to be played, even if it could be do much better. The remote control system seems to complicate life for the player rather than make it easier Remote possibility And the same can be said about the technical sector of the game: the series has never been a paradigm at an audiovisual level, on the contrary, but with what a video game costs today it would be sacrosanct to expect a more decent treatment. Verm'Odissea Nello Spazio presents stylistically anachronistic 2D graphics, with small and not too neat sprites and backdrops that are as colorful as they are repetitive and uninspired, all on a console which, as we well know, is not exactly the best in terms of definition of the 'image. The sound on the background music front is bad, while the situation improves a little thanks to the voices of the worms, who always manage to elicit a smile with their shrill war cries and sentences full of bellicose emphasis. Considering the general picture, it is evident that the real problem of Verm'Odyssey In Space is its position on the market: we therefore find ourselves in the hands of a product sold at full price which does not properly exploit the characteristics of Wii, and whose gameplay it is identical (if not even qualitatively inferior) to other versions that can be obtained with a much more reasonable outlay of money. Comment Worms: Verm'Odyssey In Space is certainly not the best calling card of the series: mutilated under the front of the available weapons, incomprehensibly deprived of the online mutilpayer and forced into a control systemunsatisfactory, the Team 17 title can certainly be played and continues to be fun in a group, but the fact remains that there are cheaper and at the same time more representative versions of the franchise.
