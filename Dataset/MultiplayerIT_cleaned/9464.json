{"name": "Scontro impari", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/84965-breach-scontro-impari.html", "text": "Version tested: PCAvailable for PC and Xbox 360 (via Steam and Xbox Live Arcade respectively), Breach represents the courageous attempt by an independent developer to face openly those million-dollar productions, now strongly rooted in the video game market, which dominate the vein of first person shooters with a war background. The first trailers of the Atomic Games title emphasized the potential of the Hydrogen Engine, especially in terms of interactivity with the scenery: bombs and missile launchers gutted buildings, destroyed wooden scaffolding and blew up vehicles, in a series of sequences that aim without more to recreate the feeling of Battlefield: Bad Company 2, with its fully interactive environments thanks to the powerful Frostbite engine. Trying the game ~live~, however, immediately clarified things: buying Breach as an alternative to one of Call of Duty: Black Ops or the aforementioned Bad Company 2 could prove to be a disappointing operation to say the least. In fact, when the forces in the field are so different, there is little to discuss and the question does not concern the mere budget allocated to the project, but also and above all the talent and competence that it is possible to ~purchase~ thanks to this budget. But let's proceed step by step. At the affordable price of 14.99 euros, Atomic Games' shooter offers us four classes (Rifleman, Machine Gunner, Sniper, Support and Recon), five maps (Ascent, Passage, Silo, Peak and Night) and as many modes (Infiltration, Convoy, Survivor, Recovery and TDM - Team Death Match) with which to try your hand strictly in multiplayer, for a minimum of four and a maximum of sixteen players, activating or not the Hardcore option (which minimizes the interface and considerably increases the bullet damage). The integrated experience system allows us to earn points and level up with each kill, not only unlocking new weapons and related accessories, but at the same time enhancing our character who from the single weapon of the first games will move on to have much more equipment. complete, which includes two main weapons and various extras such as gadgets and incentives. Shadow operations Breach's matchmaking works fairly well, although it doesn't boast the features added in recent years by its most illustrious competitors. It is possible to create a new game or join one in progress, with the system allowing us to sort the search results based on various factors: number of players and free slots, mode, map and so on. Depending on the selected class, our approach to the match can change radically: the Rifleman is the most versatile category, equipped by default with an M4A1 which is effective both from short and medium distances, while the Machine Gunner seemed much less usable due to the poor accuracy that is not compensated by who knows what firepower. The Sniper goes very well with the conformation of most of the maps, given the presence of numerous shelters behind which to lurk in peace, while the Support should be chosen only and exclusively if we opt for a ~hit and run~ style tactic: the supplied shotgun does not lend itself to any other solution. The Recon class, which must be unlocked by ~completing~ the Rifleman and Sniper classes, is instead equipped by default with an AK47 and is a balanced but powerful solution. We played both using the classic combination of mouse and keyboard, and by connecting an Xbox 360 controller. Unfortunately, the second option didn't convince us even a bit: despite the presence of some sensitivity adjustments, the management of the right stick is always too slow and not accurate enough to be competitive. Aiming with the mouse, however, no problem. If you still want to use the joypad, the configuration of the controls is very similar to that of any episode of Call of Duty: the left trigger is used to aim, the right one to shoot, pressing the left stick on its axis triggers the run , the X Button reloads your weapon, the A Button is for jumping, and so on. The similarities with the Activision franchise, however, stop here: the sensation of mobility, the liveliness of the scenarios and above all the sound environment of Breach reveal themselves to be much more modest right from the start, restoring the sensation of a fundamentally ~old~ product, afflicted by a whole series of more or less annoying visual bugs. Bad companies The much-vaunted interactivity of the environments is there and it can be seen, but applied to scenarios that are all in all modest in terms of quality and design, it is not surprising that much. The five maps included in the package are in fact rather anonymous and doted of a poor level of detail, even if it must be said that they always boast generous dimensions and therefore lend themselves to different strategies. In all scenarios there is some passage that leads to the opposite end of the location, so that a lurking enemy can be surprised, and therefore at least there are no problematic situations from a gameplay point of view. As far as the modes are concerned, they are all quite classic: the Team Death Match clearly needs no introduction, Infiltration is a territorial mode based on the conquest of a certain number of locations on the map, Survivor is a battle without respawn in which one survives the most skilled, while Recovery is a variant of ~capture the flag~. Convoy, in the end, is the only original mode of the lot: in turn one of the two teams has to move some vehicles from point A to point B, while the other must do everything possible to prevent it. The technical sector, beyond the bugs mentioned above, is barely discreet and lacks personality, while unfortunately the multiplayer experience is often undermined by the presence of lag.", "date": "2011-02-17", "grade": "6.0"}
