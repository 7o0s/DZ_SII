{"name": "Laya's Horizon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/layas-horizon-recensione.html", "text": "Flying, oh, oh: an ability that appears almost trivial in video games, but which in reality few developers have been able to implement well, giving the sensation of really hovering in the air, caressing the currents, crossing the clouds and touching trees and buildings while there it projects itself at full speed along a cel-shaded valley with dreamy and fairy-tale atmospheres. These few words are enough to provide a rather precise idea of the latest experience packaged by Snowman, downloadable for free by Netflix subscribers on iOS and Android: an adventure full of inspiration and freedom, in which we will be able to discover a whole new world thanks to a cloak that functions as a prodigious wingsuit. Have we intrigued you? Then read on for our review of Laya's Horizon. Structure: between open world and missions Laya's Horizon, this is how the map looks like before jumping into the void The island that forms the backdrop to Laya's Horizon is a fascinating mix of peaks and valleys, which the inhabitants (the ~wind people~) have learned to explore wearing special cloaks that allow them to glide from one point to another on the map , taking advantage of updrafts and turbulence to possibly gain altitude and obtain an extra thrust. The protagonist of the adventure is precisely Laya, a novice girl with a wingsuit. After completing a short tutorial, we will be granted almost complete exploratory freedom, urging us to push ourselves into the areas of the setting still shrouded in mystery to unlock new landing and departure points: to do this, just fly to the places marked by a ~bubble~, after which the character will automatically land there. However, the progression of the campaign is linked to the most classic of achievement systems: gradually we will be provided with new tasks to complete (for example, flying near a certain number of houses or diving for a certain number of meters) and completing them will to level up, thus obtaining new cloaks and new objects through which to vary the mechanisms underlying the experience. The open world of Laya's Horizon appears quite large and varied, there are dozens of characters with which to interact and possibly compete, as well as places to discover: an approach that lends itself perfectly to mobile gaming, allowing us to fly for short sessions or to dedicate more time to our explorations, depending on the occasion. Gameplay: really fly Laya's Horizon, a flight sequence As mentioned at the beginning, flying is an ability that video game characters often possess, but that few developers have been able to render well on screen. Thanks to a really simple and inspired control system, the guys at Snowman have managed to achieve this goal and it takes just a few minutes to understand how to fly the cloak, although the more complex maneuvers require a little practice. It all depends on how we move the thumbs on the touch screen: once we jump from a hill, we will be able to move Laya's arms to veer slightly or tilt the whole body to make a more decisive curve, dive down or go up, accelerate using the sparks collected up to that moment ( rewards for grazing passages) or open the cloak to brake the descent and combine all these actions in various ways. Technical realization: style to spare Laya's Horizon includes many characters to interact with The technical sector contributes in an important way to making Laya's Horizon an engaging and pleasant experience. Thanks to the elegant cel shading graphics, which move very smoothly on the iPhone 14 Pro (although showing some slowdown in the more intricate sequences) and which, in general, convey the feeling of a great artistic maturity of the team. The areas of the island boast different characteristics and colors, which makes exploring the map something truly suggestive. However, it is the sound that provides that extra cue for the atmosphere, thanks to a mix of sounds, music and effects which as a whole are absolutely convincing, and which certainly deserve listening with headphones.", "date": "2023-05-19", "grade": "8.5"}
