Without a doubt, the Santa Monica team is the one that within the ~working group~ of the franchise has been able to risk the most, both in terms of narrative and in terms of content and game mechanics. On the other hand, they are the author of the Zombies mode, as well as the desire to tell wide-ranging stories, more complex and stratified than the usual too much abused plot since the days of Modern Warfare. This time Treyarch has decided to really amaze us with the special effects, creating a game overflowing with content, but which fails to match the heights of the previous Black Ops. Call of Duty: Black Ops III offers a lot of content, but not all of them are free from flaws Games room and more To conclude the list of game contents there is also a nice extra, the new version of Dead Ops Arcade 2, a dual stick shooter with a top view. It can be accessed from the Safe House computer by clicking on the icon at the top left of the desktop. In addition to having a party, before each mission, we can enhance neural, tactical and offensive skills, choose the equipment to take into battle, build new weapons and have access to virtual reality. Without forgetting the possibility of viewing various documents and collectibles. Two Campaigns, Zombies and... Since the April reveal, we know that every single component of the title is playable together with other users. This means that the campaign returns to being cooperative, which was missing from World at War, 2008. But this is not the only ~new~. That would be a big spoiler; on the contrary, it is to all intents and purposes a nice surprise: once the Campaign is over (after about six to eight hours of play depending on the difficulty level chosen) we can replay it entirely in the Nightmare version, i.e. a little longer, with a story different told by an omnipresent narrative voice, and very importantly instead of enemy soldiers there are hordes of zombies ready to eat our brains. When the developers spoke of a Zombies mode to be understood as a real Campaign, everyone thought that the usual waves had been inserted into a real narrative, perhaps taking advantage of the noir setting of what we then learned to know like Shadows of Evil. And instead Treyarch had fooled us big time. The missions are certainly the same, as are the environments, but the game dynamics change greatly. The levels are much more crowded, the sense of danger stronger, simply say that the ~range shooting~ is much less present and useful for quickly cleaning up an area. We are constantly surrounded, and above all we do not have the neural abilities of the ~standard~ Campaign available, given that the technological development in this second fiction has taken another path. We have some but it is in all respects a bonus to be collected during the game, as well as several others that we will be able to find, not dissimilar from those available in the ~classic~ Zombies. In the same way if the choice, growth and customization of equipment is one of the strong points of the Campaign, where it is structured in levels and unlocks almost in a ~role-like~ way, it is not in Nightmare where the Magic Box roulette allows us to change weapons. In short, very different dynamics, but in some ways more fun than the normal ones. There are therefore two Black Ops III campaigns, and this is already enough to make you understand how much material is on the disc. To all this we must add the Zombies, the competitive multiplayer with its Specialists and its exaggerated athleticism, the Free Run ~Mirror's Edge~ racing mode and the virtual reality training wave Combat Immersion. The brain is a weapon To fully enjoy the ~normal~ Campaign, you must necessarily play cooperatively, at least by setting the difficulty level to Veteran. This does not mean that alone it is not worth the price of the ticket but, for how it is structured, for the vastness of the environments, for the unprecedented and complex neural dynamics, being able to play with a well-knit group, almost with defined roles, means having fun much more. In fact, our alter ego has three skill branches available, called Cyber Cores, plus two real perks, all of which can be ~activated~ by spending the experience points earned mission after mission. These three branches give us access to attacks of various kinds, both against humans and against robots. Chaos is the more distinctly offensive branch: it gives us theability to stun a human until they vomit, electrify melee attack against robots, detonate explosives on human enemies, and instead destroy robots by overloading them. Even better we can launch swarms of mini drones that lock down and kill enemies. Martial, in addition to giving us ~super speed~, makes us temporarily invisible, or gives us the possibility of generating a real area shot, without forgetting a series of melee combos by moving frantically among the enemies. Control instead is directed to interact with drones and enemy robots. In fact we can enter the systems of enemy flying and terrestrial drones to ~pilot~ them ourselves. In the same way it is possible to turn an enemy robot against its companions. It is therefore understandable how Treyarch almost wants the player to ~specialize~ in a branch (then enhancing every single skill), dividing the tasks in the game with the other players. All this is also evident from the fact that only starting from the twentieth level, i.e. after having played a lot (just one playthrough is not enough) is it possible to enter battle with all three branches available. All these unprecedented tactical potentials have an important weight in combat: knowing how to use the one that blows up several robots at the same time from a distance or that stuns a large group of humans at the right time is essential. Consequently, coordinating, using the tactical view to mark enemies on the screen, and more generally playing together as a team is decisive for the fate of the game. Playstation 4 trophies Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 rewards the player with 48 trophies. We are committed to dissecting the game in all its components, Campaign, Zombies and multiplayer, with increasingly complex trophies depending on the level of difficulty or particular actions performed. Without a doubt one of the trophies that will make us sweat the most is the one obtained by completing the Campaign on the Realistic difficulty level, where you go to the ground with one shot. What's the reality? Alone all this is (partially) missing and given that in this Black Ops III epic moments of a large scale are missing, everything is resolved in long and articulated battles that almost tire ~wave after wave~. Attention we are not talking about boring missions or that don't work. We're talking about missions whose fulcrum is combat more than in the past, but which precisely because of their ~ardor~ and their ~complexity~ leave little room for the ~fracassona~ and ~caciarona~ spectacularity typical of a Call of Duty. There is no shortage of fights with real bosses (too repetitive though), aerial battles, hasty escapes and we will even have to deal with real ~horror~ and ~fantastic~ moments (we will say no more so as not to fall into easy spoilers), but more generally, everything flows away on automatic pilot without particular flashes, which are not lacking in an absolute sense but do not leave their mark as they should. But above all, what we must emphasize most in the Campaign is a narrative component that is as ambitious and fascinating on paper as it is cumbersome, smoky and all in all not very stimulating. The super futuristic setting of 2065, with the world divided into two blocks after the tragic events of Menendez in 2025, is only in the background, an ~empty~ science fiction setting where the interesting moral themes pro and against physical and neural grafts serve only as an ~engine ~ to stage events that would have deserved a much broader screenplay. The usual catastrophe, the usual secret project gone wrong by the usual CIA, the usual betrayals, double and triple crosses that we are used to are, after all, an all too ~personal~ story, which deserves credit, however, for characterizing excellent characters , where even the second-rate ones find their space and their fulfilment. The invention of neural grafts, of the possibility, in full cyberpunk style, of being all connected and of making sure that the battlefield is not only the one in front of us but also our own brain, for long periods insinuates the doubt that what we are experiencing is really reality. And this is essentially a good thing, as are some missions that are really imaginative, but sometimes so much so that they are too much self-referential fan service, which ultimately does not compensate for the lack of ~real~ epic moments. If the tutorial is perhaps the best in recent years, so well inserted within the narrative that it actually represents one of the most valid missions of the Campaign, the same cannot be said of some sections further on which, as previously written, border on a fan almost cloying and decidedly specious service.The story, with its different levels of reading, becomes so complicated in this game of ~neural~ Chinese boxes that the narration does not skimp on ~explaining~ in the numerous cutscenes to try to re-knit the threads of the discourse. From this point of view Black Ops III is one of the most talked about Call of Duty in recent years, with the consequence that the pace slows down, and what should be important twists do not hit as they should, without forgetting one of the final sections more long and drawn out of recent times. Up until the time of the final test, we thought that the Campaign might have undergone a downsizing within the balance of the game's components, given the possibility of immediately unlocking all the missions and the great focus given to the cooperative in terms of replayability. This was not the case, the Campaign is truly ambitious and ~mature~ but undoubtedly much less accomplished than in previous Black Ops. Multiplayer: wild racing The other big pillar of Call of Duty is multiplayer. The two strengths are the renewed movement system and the inclusion of Specialists. We are not talking about novelties in the absolute sense for the genre: Halo, Titanfall, Advanced Warfare and Destiny have greatly limited the weight of the force of gravity, while the peculiar weapons of the Specialists are in fact a ~revised and corrected~ version of the Destiny Super . All this translates into extremely fast, fluid and frenetic game dynamics, if possible more than in other years. Speaking of movement, the ~guns up philosophy~ preached by Treyarch has indeed been achieved. We never lower the weapon, we can always shoot. The infinite sprint, the sliding / drifting, the absence of intermediate animations when overcoming an obstacle (or entering a window), the running on the walls, the swimming, but above all the power jump, not to be understood as a ~double jump ~ at Advanced Warfare, dosing it almost as if it were a push to partialize, they expand and expand the usual game mechanics, with truly extreme results, to stage battles with an exaggerated pace, where it is really possible to die or kill in the most disparate ways, where reflexes really matter a lot. It's not trivially about jumping like crickets for the maps, it's about being good at chaining as many movements as possible, as if we had to make real combos. In this sense, we assume that from the very first days such a system will exacerbate the (usual) distance between the normal player and the true enthusiast ready to spend hours and hours on the game, capable of performing circus acts without ever stopping shooting. The maps have consequently been tailor-made for this renewed movement system, more extensive at ground level, richer in blind corners and bottlenecks, but always graced with escape routes and various defiles to get to the hot areas. In the same way, there is never a shortage of accesses to elevated points, in short, there is always a ~hot spot~ higher up where you can keep an eye on the map. Lots of variety but... We undoubtedly liked the larger maps better, such as the suspension bridges of forested Redwood, the numerous interiors and rooftop races of Breach, or Infection, with its setting from the good old days. But we cannot fail to mention the multi-played game in the beta Hunted or the memorable cliff overlooking the sea of Exodus. Having played on all the maps, however, I'm sorry to find confirmation of what we tried with the Beta: it leaves us dumbfounded by the fact that the level design is full of ~invisible walls~ and walls that are impossible to walk through. You are almost amazed to be able to jump over a waterfall and be ~bounced~ off the roof of a two-story house two meters away. We'd like to move in any direction, but instead we can only go where Treyarch has decided. Another confirmation received during the review concerns the Specialists. By setting the Custom matches, i.e. without all the limitations given by the progression, we were able to test the complete roster. For those who have only just tuned in, the Specialists represent our alter ego: there are nine of them (for now, maybe...) and each one is equipped with a special weapon and an ability. The choice of one excludes the other, so tactically it changes a lot once you enter the game. However, the way in which they can be activated does not change. The passage of time slowly fills the activation bar, but it goes without saying that killing or capturing objectives drastically cuts the cooldown wait. But who are these Specialists, or rather what distinguishes them from each other? All are equipped with more or less exotic weapons: Outrider has a bow with explosive arrows, the Reaper robot a machine gun with rotating barrels, Battery a grenade launcher, Seraph u", "date": "2015-11-06", "grade": "8.4"}
