We have rarely come across such a low quality product, so much so that we are amazed at how it has obtained authorization for publication as well as, let's face it, any type of funding. The worst thing is that in this case a sacred monster of scrolling fighting games is brought into play, a saga that made history in the cabinets of smoky arcades. This remake plays ambiguously on the fact that it can be interpreted either as a remake of the homonymous coin op Technos, or the sequel to the much more dignified Double Dragon Neon, itself a reinterpretation of the original title. Or maybe it's just another random consequence of a disastrous production that should never have been released, even in the confines of a digital release. We will hurt them so much The game begins with a functional tutorial preamble. A very short and vaguely celebratory prologue, which ends with the killing of Marian, the friend of the historic brothers Jimmy and Billy, who obviously don't take it well at all and take the field to make those responsible pay for it. That's it, since their inception, fighting games have never needed great scripts, but only faces to inflate and bones to break in profusion. Double Dragon II: Wander of the Dragons certainly does not hold back in setting up a punch festival, the problem is the ways and the presentation. The new polygonal look allows for dynamic direction and therefore the use of shots that deviate from the classic side view, so much so that the game also uses the isometric one. This feature must have pushed the programmers to the wicked idea of implementing a collision system on both axes. In a nutshell, it is possible to hit and be hit even vertically, creating unspeakable confusion and countless occasions where it is difficult to understand where the opponent's blows are coming from. The title immediately highlights the staggering dearth of combos, a feature that makes the action flat and further impoverished by inaccurate collisions. The climax is reached by colored globes scattered throughout the scenario, which must be destroyed to unleash devastating special moves. To add a little variety, unnecessarily frustrating platform sections have been inserted which only aggravate an already dramatic picture. Xbox 360 goals Double Dragon II: Wander of the Dragons features 12 objectives for a total of 400 player points. To conquer half of them, it is sufficient to complete the game, while the rest require special operations, such as reaching the end without using special moves. Good luck to those who have the courage to avenge Marian. When the dress makes the monk If you believed that the above were the worst sides of Double Dragon II: Wander of the Dragons you should change your mind, the title of the Koreans Gravity manages to give its worst in the technical realization. Aesthetically we are faced with a truly unacceptable work in 2013, with a non-existent artistic direction which leads to a rough and cheesy look. The graphics engine, despite the lack of details, runs at a frame rate of less than 30 fps, therefore resulting in little fluid and afflicted by a delay in the commands. The animations are among the worst ever seen in recent years, as are the polygonal models. The amateurish use of colors and the poor quality of the textures makes it difficult even to identify the objects to be collected on the ground, such as daggers or sticks, with the result that the action is so confusing and jerky as to discourage even the most persevering. A real disaster. The icing on the cake is the elimination of any online co-op mode, the essence of the scrolling beat 'em up, limited to local sessions. A lack truly without logic, even if in line with the low quality of this title.", "date": "2013-05-03", "grade": "3.0"}
