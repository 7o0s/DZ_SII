Instead of dedicating himself to the usual activities of his fellow men, such as raiding villages, hunting animals and terrorizing defenseless populations, he prefers to spend his days lounging around, living on the shoulders of the other members of his group. Tired of this behavior, the tribal chief therefore decides to put Oddmar at a crossroads: plunder and burn a forest, or accept exile. A big problem then, which is worth reflecting on while sleeping on it. And just during sleep a fairy offers the protagonist extraordinary powers, obtained by eating a magical mushroom: but it is not a disinterested gift... Viking heart Oddmar is a classic 2D platformer whose obvious source of inspiration is the latest episodes of Rayman, especially Legends: both in terms of the graphic style and the structure and progression of the levels, the sensations of Senri's title recall the most famous Ubisoft product. This does not mean that Oddmar is a derivative game or, even worse, a clone: on the contrary, it is one of the best exponents of the genre ever to appear on mobile platforms, and more generally one of the most brilliant publications that have reached during this quest. smartphones and tablets. The structure of the gameplay rests on elements that are introduced in a progressive manner, thus expanding the basic mechanics which, however, remain very familiar to anyone with minimal knowledge of the genre. But it is clear that the team's goal was certainly not to reinvent the wheel, but rather to create a product that pays homage to the great exponents of the subject in question, finally offering mobile users a game that is worthy of it. From this point of view, practically all the pieces of the puzzle fit together in a convincing way, starting with the splendid graphic component that places Oddmar not only at the top of the category on smartphones and tablets, but more generally makes it a product that would look good at all even on consoles. The comic style is in fact enriched by excellent animations for each element on the screen, as well as splendid backdrops and settings that enjoy a truly remarkable richness and variety. The Rayman Legends quote a few lines above finds full space also and above all by analyzing this element, because both products share a similar artistic direction, very colorful and almost baroque in its abundance. Fortunately, such beauty is supported by a quality level design, which offers a sufficient variety of situations also offering pleasant digressions from the pure platform phases. There are only 24 internships in all, a factor which slightly reduces the overall longevity given that the final credits can be reached in a handful of hours: however the completionists will be able to find some extra stimulus in the presence of collectibles to be recovered, so as to guarantee an additional challenge and increase the overall duration of the game. However, everything beautiful written so far would be nullified if the control system weren't up to par: mind you, touch controls will never guarantee a level of precision and feedback similar to a physical pad, but in any case the developers are managed to get the most out of it. The result is that Oddmar is controlled well, without flaws because the gameplay, the pace of the game and the situations proposed have been designed with the virtual keys in mind. Given what happened with Senri's previous product, or that Leo's Fortune which appeared first on mobile and then also on consoles and PCs, it is likely that Oddmar is also destined to follow a similar path. We hope so, because lovers of 2d platformers should seriously consider buying. Final note on the sales model: the game costs 5.49 and does not have any type of in-app purchase. An ~old school~ offer also from this point of view, in short.", "date": "2018-05-07", "grade": "9.0"}
