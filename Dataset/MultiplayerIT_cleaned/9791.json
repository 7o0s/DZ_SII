When he comes to confront General Abaddon, however, he realizes that the other three horsemen of the Apocalypse have not arrived with him, that the Seal that decrees their coming has not been broken and that therefore with his mere presence he has upset the natural order of events, effectively decreeing the end of the ~third kingdom~, or of the human race. Suddenly deprived of his powers, Guerra is therefore defeated by the demon Straga and subjected to the judgment of the Arso Consiglio, which condemns him to death for his faults. However, the knight asks to be sent back to Earth to find out the causes of his summoning, to therefore have a chance to redeem himself and find the culprit of what happened. The members of the Council agree to the request, but to control Guerra's actions they inextricably bind his left arm to a Sentinel, a treacherous and evil creature that can force the knight to obey him if necessary. Still far from being in full possession of his abilities, the mighty warrior therefore returns to Earth and finds it completely annihilated by events, emptied of its inhabitants and reduced to being the backdrop for the clashes between angels and demons that still rage. All that's left are pathetic monsters scurrying through the rubblebut someone's going to pay for it. Several months after the release of the console version, Darksiders finally arrives on PC with an edition that includes a short comic drawn by Madureira and the game's soundtrack (but not only: the small box on the right will explain in detail the contents of the Hellbook Edition). In this new guise, the War epic is basically unchanged, but it solves the technical problems initially detected on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 (we are referring to the showy tearing) and gives us the opportunity to admire the excellent characters and extraordinary scenarios at higher resolutions. The Hellbook Edition In Italy Darksiders PC version is distributed in stores exclusively in the special version Hellbook Edition. Inside the oversized package you will find an artbook containing numerous illustrations on the background of the project, the entire soundtrack of the game, a comic drawn by Joe Madureira starring Guerra, four artworks printed on cardboard and finally the player is given the opportunity to customize the protagonist with your team's shirt. War and peace The stereotype of the character who at the beginning of the game finds himself without powers and must recover them by passing a series of stages is hard to die, but that's because it still works damn well. In the case of War, the initial equipment is represented only by the large sword Divoracaos, by the ability to dash forward, parry blows and double jump. However, as one enters the story, the horseman of the Apocalypse comes into possession of new weapons (a scythe, a rotating throwing blade, a pistol, a glove capable of shaking the ground) and numerous new abilities (the wings to ~glide~ after a jump, the counterattack, the possibility of recalling the horse Ruin), which are added to the basic equipment, power-ups and special attacks. In Darksiders the currency of exchange is made up of the souls of the damned, to be spent every time we find a projection of the demon Vulgrim on the street: the bizarre merchant of the underworld will offer us new items from time to time, but above all we will be able to buy combos and moves that can enrich our repertoire. This is an almost obligatory operation, given that during the early stages of the game the fights are spoiled by a general lack of attack maneuvers, and you need to be right about your opponents by always performing the same combos. The upgrade system, however, appears really well balanced and gives each upgrade its own dignity. There is never the classic situation where, at some point, you are full of ~money~ and you can buy anything for the simple sake of it, as opposed to an initial phase where it is hard to get the necessary to overcome sometimes rather cunning and dangerous opponents. We therefore have a certain number of weapons and we can decide which ones to improve, but their management differs substantially from titles such as God of War: War uses the Divoracaos sword as a basic weapon, always and in any case, integrating it if necessary with one or more secondary tools. It is an interpretation forlimiting in some ways, but which has the merit of not creating annoying ~preferences~ and of keeping the action on the tracks determined by the developers of Vigil Games. Apocalypse now The gameplay of Darksiders is characterized by a large number of fights and the introduction of increasingly different and increasingly dangerous enemies: ranging from zombies that infest the streets and ruined buildings, which Guerra, if he wants, can tear apart even with a single blow, to various types of more or less large demons, capable of both attacking and defending themselves. With this in mind, an excellent job has been done in terms of variety, design quality and difficulty balancing. The entity of the threats is felt more and more, forcing us to dose the combos and to produce ourselves in evasive maneuvers in order not to succumb under the blows of the enemy; and the sum of these elements is exemplified in the boss fights, really well conceived and demanding, which on the one hand satisfy the eye with their spectacularity while on the other they refer to the most classic videogame tradition, which sees the player memorize a series of movement and attack routines by the enemy on duty with the aim of identifying the best moments to sink one's blows. In some moments then, we have to overcome particular challenges that perform an action in some ways didactic, or require us to use certain offensive maneuvers to demonstrate their effectiveness and not risk seeing them unjustly set aside. The control system integrates our needs very well, especially in the busiest situations, thanks to a completely manual management of the view via the analog stick (we played using the Xbox 360 controller, perfectly supported) and to the possibility of lock-on on a certain target. At first, the layout of some keys may seem unnatural (see the parry / sprint on the right backbone), but a little practice is enough to dispel any doubts. However, it must be admitted that the reactivity of the jump button is often not the best, and that in various situations the failure to execute the command (when, for example, you find yourself taking a leap from the edge of a platform) produces frustrating sudden deaths . The puzzle week In Darksiders there are tons of fights, as already mentioned; however, it is by no means the element of greatest weight within the Vigil Games product. From one scenario to another, the ones that we will always find waiting for us will be the puzzles: from the simple search for keys to the activation of switches characterized by increasingly complex and multifaceted systems, we will spend most of the fifteen hours necessary to complete the game the operations necessary to reach the next checkpoint. And it is precisely in such situations that the game is produced in its numerous quotations: the aforementioned God of War but also Zelda: Twilight Princess, Portal and various other old and new masterpieces. Darksiders clearly ~pays homage~ to them, but always remaining within the limits of a flawless game design, which lets us enjoy its solidity and which, above all, does not force us to do ~annoying~ backtracking: we certainly return to visit scenarios that have already been explored, but only when our character has acquired skills that allow him to access previously inaccessible areas, delimited by crystal barriers of different colors based on the skill required to break through them. Furthermore, it is very difficult to get stuck on a particular puzzle, since the elements useful for solving it are always nearby or in any case in a well-defined area. Puzzle solving often revolves around reflexes, speed and dexterity rather than mere observation skills. It is therefore a question of all-round tests, in some moments perhaps even excessive in their ~density~ but always able to return a certain satisfaction. Despite some alternative sections (see the flight phases aboard the griffin, or those in which Guerra wields a large cannon), designed precisely to lighten such a demanding gameplay, we therefore arrive at the final stages of the adventure with our legs a bit heavy, but aware of having been able to observe an extraordinarily high number of ideas, perhaps not very original if taken individually but sometimes combined in brilliant ways. Technical realization As mentioned at the beginning, the PC version of Darksiders solves from the start (thanks to the possibility of activating v-sync) the tearing problems that initially afflicted the game on PS3 and Xbox 360, and beyond this it allows us to use higher resolutions compared to the canonical 720p. Comparing thereal-size screens you don't notice particular differences: it may be that the textures on PC are always and in any case very defined, but in general it is an aspect that also on consoles had not been overlooked. The design of the characters, signed by Joe Madureira, certainly has a western flavor and closely resembles the works created by the famous cartoonist for Marvel. The bright colors recall the world of superheroes where it would have been legitimate to expect darker atmospheres, and the shades used for the scenarios support this type of choice, perhaps making a mistake but giving us an undoubtedly satisfactory final result. The ~bestiary~ is full of gruesome creatures, but there are convincing and well-recognizable characters even on War's side. Ultimately, the idea of entrusting such important aspects of the production to a comic artist like Madureira proved to be successful, despite some perplexities. The Havok performs very well and confirms itself as an efficient and relatively light engine: for technical reasons we tested the game on a notebook (find the configuration at the bottom of the review) obtaining with vsync activated, thirty frames per second rather stable at resolution of 1600x900 pixels. Excellent news also on the audio front, with high quality music and effects, which are not diminished by a generally discreet Italian dubbing but which lets itself go to some lackluster moments.", "date": "2010-09-23", "grade": "9.0"}
