{"name": "Project Zero 3: The Tormented", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/project-zero-3-the-tormented.html", "text": "Rocket launcher? Nope, camera What characterized the brand object of our review from the beginning, however, was the different and peculiar approach adopted by the Japanese designers; no guns, machine guns, rocket launchers and so on, no bloodthirsty zombies or horrible genetic mutations. Nor are fearless heroes, perhaps ex-military or otherwise trained against any threat. In fact, in Project Zero, the alter ego is always a petite and defenseless girl, armed only with a particular camera (the darkroom) with which she is able to eliminate the terrifying ghosts that haunt homes or entire villages. It is therefore a solution that shifts the center of gravity of the experience, moving away from the bloody and pulp massacre to rather adopt a constant tension, a continuous instability, an indissoluble discomfort reinforced by the (apparent) fragility of the protagonist. An apt and intriguing formula therefore, which after a promising first episode but also affected by the inexperience of the authors, met its full expression in the second chapter, still today one of the games that no lover of the genre should miss out on. Strengthened by these encouraging promises, Tecmo has therefore decided to support the creation of a third Project Zero. The protagonist this time is Rei Kurosawa, a freelance photographer destroyed by grief over the loss of her boyfriend Yuu Asou, which occurred in a fatal car accident while she herself was driving. From that day on, Rei's life followed one another in whole days closed at home, with the only exception of the outings necessary for work. Just during one of these, while she is taking photographs inside a haunted house, she is caught by a spectral vision of Yuu. From that day on, Rei's nights become dramatic, tormented by hallucinatory nightmares populated by ghosts, priestesses, terrible rituals and disturbing mysteries. The game is therefore divided into two parts: during the day, inside the protagonist's house, where it is possible to talk to the assistant and friend Miku, look for clues and evidence among the objects left by Yuu and develop photographic rolls in the appropriate room . On the contrary, during the night the action moves into Rei's nightmares, inside a large and obviously terrifying house populated by all kinds of ghosts. Worth more than a roll of 100 bullets As we have already clarified previously, the only weapon in the possession of the protagonist is a camera. Those who have had the opportunity to play the previous episodes already know very well how the mechanism works. For others, it is enough to know that the use of the darkroom allows you to transfer the view from the classic third person to a first person, just as if you were aiming a real camera. There are various rolls of film, differentiated by the exorcising potential and therefore by the damage they are able to cause to the ghosts. But this is not the only variable at play; if in fact by shooting from afar it will be possible to cause only a slight damage to the opponent, on the contrary whoever will be able to cold-bloodedly wait until the ghost is only a few centimeters away, will be rewarded with an absolutely more effective shot. There is also the possibility of enhancing one's ~weapon~ through upgrades, both thanks to objects collected around, and by purchasing them by spending the points obtained by eliminating ghosts or simply by photographing those that appear briefly in the various rooms and corridors. From a technical point of view, Project Zero 3 represents an excellent result of the matured knowledge of Sony hardware; if the second chapter was already aesthetically very valid, this third improves the whole experience by offering detailed, well-designed and disturbing settings, with an excellent use of light and above all a truly fundamental direction for the creation of suspense and anxiety. The ghosts are excellent, extremely varied and diversified in characterization and always capable of sending a shiver down the spine. The only real flaw in this sense lies in the animations of the protagonist, really woody and limited; from a game released in 2006 we really would have expected more from this point of view. The sound is completely positive, themed like few others and truly influential in the overall experience. Who's afraid of the dark? Undoubtedly the main value of Tecmo production lies in the atmosphere. Confirming the inspired creative vein of Project Zero 2, this latest episode also maintains an intriguing and compelling narrative, splendidly accompanied by the aforementioned direction capable of making even the most experienced dand survival horror fans. In this sense, the effort of Japanese programmers has the advantage of truly representing something peculiar and endowed with its own personality, capable of distinguishing it from the many clones and copies of the genre. Continuing the adventure therefore becomes almost an obligation, as pleasant as it is disturbing, with the tension always at its maximum at every corner passed. We therefore do not feel like fully appreciating the choice to break up the purely horror game phases with those inside the house; although the latter in fact turns out to be not exactly a nest without pitfalls in the continuation of the narrative, the feeling remains for most of the game that it lightens the overall tension by partially undermining the goodness of the product. Summing up so far, the picture therefore appears decidedly positive; so what is the reason behind a not particularly high rating? Quite simply, the control system. The woodiness and slowness of the interface is in fact really cloying, as well as clearly anachronistic, not differing from that of Resident Evil released 10 years ago and which was criticized up to the fourth episode for this very reason. It is a defect that holds back the ambitions of an excellent product, a real bottleneck that irritates both in the third person phases and when holding the camera. Such a pity. Comment Project Zero 3 is an excellent new entry in Tecmo's popular horror series, which confirms the great inspirational vein of the Japanese team with a view to creating a product with a tangible, intriguing and truly disturbing personality. The latter factor is anything but to be underestimated, because it underlines that despite the overexposure of the genre in the post-Resident Evil period, there are still good ideas around. Unfortunately, the overall assessment cannot fail to take into account a prehistoric control system, a legacy of a past that struggles to be accepted in the year 2006. The hope, given the potential of the series, is that for a desirable fourth episode, the programmers will put their hand to this aspect, since the results could really be surprising. Pros Creepy like few others Great graphics and sound Good longevity Cons Anachronistic control system Poor animations for the protagonist Unwelcome real world interruptions Ah the old, dear survival horror. Now that Resident Evil itself, with its splendid fourth episode, has abandoned the classic game structure that had characterized the genre since the days of Alone in the Dark, there are very few who prefer the old way. Among these, the Fatal Frame/Project Zero series by Tecmo figures by right, proudly reaching its third episode.", "date": "2006-02-23", "grade": null}
