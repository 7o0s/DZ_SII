{"name": "Moonlighter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/moonlighter-recensione.html", "text": "Perhaps reflecting the complexity of modern society, understood in Morin's vision as an indissoluble whole of different but also closely interdependent parts, RPGs have become increasingly composite, mixed with characteristics borrowed from different genres, in turn creating new hybrid canons which are then mixed again as happened to Moonlighter, subject of this review. It thus happens that the roguelike, which in turn was born from a particular meaning of the RPG, has crept into new structures, bending them according to different mechanics and giving birth to new trends such as the so-called ~rogue-lite~, which mitigates the original elements within a less rigid and often wider-ranging videogame form. Still other times the rogue-lite in turn mixes with other characteristics, bringing out a more complex mixture and consequently richer in different facets, perhaps more original. To tell the truth, at this point it is difficult to find experiences that are completely new to all intents and purposes, but you can get close, as in this case: the fact of mixing the RPG dungeon crawler with the management of a shop and, in a broader sense, a whole village is not actually an unusual thing, considering that something similar has already been experienced by Rune Factory and also by the famous Stardew Valley, but in Moonlighter the different components of the game are presented in a particular way, both in terms of 'element more properly from RPG than management and business. In fact, it seems to be faced with two distinct games held together by a splendid characterization that builds a fascinating and engaging world around the protagonist, also thanks to a graphic style which, although based on solutions that are almost conventional by now, demonstrates a truly mastery of the bitmap. notable by Digital Sun. Two jobs, one dream Will is a dreamer but he is also a boy with a responsibility on his shoulders, who finds himself torn between the desire to explore the dungeons and the need to carry on the family business, i.e. the Moonlighter shop which represents a sort of fulcrum of the Rynoka Village Activities. Near the latter there is a complex system of connected dungeons, which in the past represented the fortune of the city, attracting adventurers from everywhere but which just as quickly brought everything to ruin when excessive dangerousness forced the authorities to seal the entrance to the labyrinth. Since then only the most daring still try to explore the tunnels and among these there is the protagonist of the story. The constant voice of his conscience is the old Zenon, who tries in every way to divert Will from his dreams of glory and bring him back down to earth to work in the shop, even though he too does not disdain the adventurous side, as an old retired explorer . ~It's dangerous to go alone! Take This~, the old man says to the boy at one point, giving him a sword and shield and making it clear to everyone what the main inspiration of this game is. With due caution, there is quite a bit of Zelda in Moonlighter, in the framing, in the graphic style but in particular in the immediacy and freshness of the combat system, which requires skill in addition to the leveling up however present, this being a more canonical RPG in many respects. With a solution that makes him particularly close and realistic to us, Will finds himself working in the shop by day and fighting monsters by night in the dungeons, a sort of video game metaphor, with the need both to take care of his adventurer activity and that as a shopkeeper. The latter, in particular, is much more profound than one might expect, with the need to select the goods to be displayed in the shop and also establish the selling price, being very careful to find the right size without overloading the price tag to make the object unsellable and angry buyers, but neither to lower prices too much and lose earnings by unbalancing the market. By increasing his wealth, Will can expand and improve both the Moonlighter and the entire surrounding village. This is already a considerable commitment, but it is nothing more than a reflection of the actual game, which in fact takes place above all inside the dungeons. Merchant adventurer The RPG mechanics follow that of dungeon crawlers, but with a Zelda-style touch and room dynamics reminiscent of The Binding of Isaac. In essence, it is a matter of eliminating all the enemies present in each room in order to access the next portion of the dungeon and so on up to the boss fight, usually very challenging and from whichthe coveted key is obtained from her, as well as rather rich treasures. By putting together the four special keys it is possible to open the door to the fifth dungeon, Will's maximum objective and a rather titanic undertaking. The labyrinths are generated in a procedural way, therefore one cannot expect a very complex level design but this is not the feature Moonlighter focuses on, which as an RPG is based much more on combat than on exploration and for this reason it can count on a very pleasant battle system, with two types of attack (a fast one, which also allows you to chain combos and a more powerful and slow one) and a dodge, which are combined with five different types of weapons that create numerous possible combinations in terms of style of fighting. All this makes the action component of the game very satisfying, a positive thing since the missions in the dungeons are the backbone of the entire game system, given the need to exit and re-enter the labyrinths several times to look for materials and earn money. In Moonlighter there is no automatic progression of the protagonist's stats, but leveling up is achieved exclusively through the purchase and conquest of ever more powerful equipment. These can be purchased but often need to be modified and improved by crafting and using materials gathered in dungeons. If on the one hand it is therefore necessary to constantly replenish the shop with treasures to sell in order to earn money and develop activities and the country, on the other it is also important to weigh the most precious materials to decide whether to sell them or invest them to improve armor and weapons. This creates a rather unprecedented dynamic in RPGs, with a more direct and constant control of the finances of the protagonist and of his own evolution through the upgrade to be planned and carried out with a considerable degree of freedom. Everything is then perfectly packaged in aesthetic terms: the pixellated style is certainly not new, but seeing it applied with this taste demonstrates an artistic direction of a certain value, which is also confirmed by the excellent musical accompaniment.", "date": "2018-11-04", "grade": "8.2"}
