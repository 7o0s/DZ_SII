{"name": "Tacticool", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tacticool-recensione.html", "text": "Tacticool tries to address a very specific target, i.e. owners of iOS and Android devices looking for a solid multiplayer-based shooter with a certain depth, but stylistically distant from the cartoony atmospheres of Brawl Stars. Therefore, taking advantage of the undoubted prominence that the Supercell blockbuster is providing to this specific videogame vein in the mobile field, the guys from Panzerdog have developed an experience that in the promotional images makes fun of a bit, but which when it comes to take the field is particularly serious and capable of satisfying the high expectations of a user now accustomed to high quality products. The game tutorial briefly introduces us to the gameplay mechanics, leaving a bitter taste in the mouth compared to the lack of a single player sector that could certainly have enriched the offer. As mentioned, however, the focus of Tacticool is represented solely by competitive online, with very fast and fun deathmatches in which two teams of five members face each other in as many different scenarios. To support the system, apparently basic and banal, we find a multifaceted progression system, which thanks to the release of experience points and virtual currency allows you to earn a higher rank, as well as buy and upgrade the weapons assigned to three immediately available profiles including choose. The first profile is characterized by an equipment with a light machine gun, the second allows us to take up a shotgun, while the third uses an assault rifle, and all are supported by a pistol and a grenade. Switching from one setup to another produces substantial differences in the approach to action, since automatic weapons have a greater range but become inaccurate as soon as you move, while shotguns are lethal from short distances (using the ben tried and tested ~turn and shoot~ approach) but get in trouble when you're in an open space, with the opponent at a distance. Controls and gameplay Just like the aforementioned Brawl Stars, Tacticool looks like a twin stick shooter with automatic fire mode, which means that as soon as an enemy is within range, our character will press the trigger until the magazine is empty. Ammunition is a key factor, because running out while opponents are approaching can quickly lead to game over, at which point you will have to wait for the traditional respawn to return to the map and continue making eliminations in order to win the game. The left virtual analog stick is repositionable by default, but if desired, it can be made fixed, just as it is possible to rearrange all the buttons of an interface that seemed to us immediately very well organized. The management of the visual and aiming is in fact entrusted to the right side of the screen, with the keys for reloading, changing weapons, throwing the grenade and dodging further down, with these last two maneuvers being regulated by a cooldown that prevents you from using it too often. Collision detection is excellent, but it is above all the scenarios that make the difference, with their so interesting and varied design: there are settings with the tracks of a train in the middle which passes every certain number and can asphalt those who do not have time to avoid it, vehicles that can be used to invest enemies (or friends) and fixed turrets where to lurk to target everything that is within a certain range. Many interactive elements can be destroyed with grenades, perhaps to collect the round bonus, the bag full of money, which if kept until the end of the match allows you to multiply your earnings and speed up progression. There is a very well implemented physics system that supports shooting and allows you to experience exciting situations, such as when you throw a grenade at a moving vehicle, causing it to overturn. Thanks also to a very fast matchmaking and to an infrastructure that does not suffer from latency problems or sudden drops, the Tacticool experience remains exciting, and we find ourselves ringing several matches one after the other, without waiting times. waiting or action energy to take care of, completely free of charge. There are some references to monetization, it is clear, and it is possible that the pay to win factor could make the difference for users who decide to access superior equipment by spending real money, but during our tests it has never happened to come across clearly unbalanced situations; indeed, we have always been able to enforce theskills gained from years of twin stick shooter experience, bringing home a 100% win round so far. From a technical point of view, everything works very well: the characters have good animations and the adjustments allow us to scale the experience on less performing devices, but on the iPhone X we were able to enjoy the graphics to their fullest, detailed and fluid on every occasion .", "date": "2019-02-04", "grade": "8.0"}
