{"name": "Flash Party", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/flash-party-recensione.html", "text": "Super Smash Bros. invented a genre and its formula still works great today, mixing accessibility and depth, technique and spectacularity within a package that in its latest incarnation was characterized by an extraordinary richness in terms of content and support post-launch. Well, how to bring such an experience to iOS and Android? After some experiments and variations on the theme, XD Entertainment, a development team based in Singapore, decided to pack a real clone of the Nintendo game, trying to compensate for the inevitable similarities with a very nice artistic sector. Was the objective achieved? We tell you about it in the Flash Party review. Gameplay Flash Party, one of the first unlockable characters Let's start right from the Flash Party gameplay, which as mentioned takes up what we were able to appreciate in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, therefore the now consolidated two-dimensional based brawler formula set within scenarios more or less rich in platforms on which to jump and from which, possibly, to fall for the ring-out. The game control system, rigorously touch, has a virtual analog stick on the left side of the screen and five buttons on the right side: the bigger one, with the a sword, is used to launch the basic attack and is surrounded by keys for grip, parry, jump (naturally double) and special. The repertoire available to each of the fourteen characters that make up the Flash Party roster is made up of moves that can be performed by combining the buttons just mentioned with the directions of the stick, and which offer a wide range of possibilities: from normal to low attacks , passing through powerful uppercuts and throws. The yield of the impacts is good, and this is not an obvious aspect, on the contrary. The goal in every match is to make the opponent end up outside the ring, without him being able to recover by jumping and performing the aforementioned uppercut to gain altitude, or hit him enough to blow the gauge for the percentage of damage taken. In both cases the exchanges are immediately exciting and with continuous reversals in the face. The only flaw is a reactivity that can be improved with regard to movement. Contents Flash Party, the first unlockable character in the victory pose If the Flash Party formula (let's face it: the name is undoubtedly the least successful thing about this project) proves to be effective, solid and sufficiently varied, the contents of the package consolidate it. First of all thanks to the fourteen characters we mentioned earlier, all very well differentiated not only in appearance but also in fighting style, with a clear subdivision into classes. Of course, unlocking them all is another matter and let's enter in the age-old question of microtransactions and the free-to-play model adopted for the occasion by XD Entertainment: in the first few hours you will be able to get four characters without problems, but to have the others too you will have to work hard or put your hand in your wallet. Flash Party, the opponent is in the air: will he be able to return to the ring? In this regard, there are also possible pay-to-win implications, in the sense that by playing and collecting energy it is possible to enhance the characters and improve their performance in the arena, therefore obtaining an advantage which will then be diluted by the balance of the matchmaking. Does the system work? Difficult to say after only a few days of testing: it is something that will have to be verified in the long run. However, there are few doubts about the modes, which seem to offer the right variety and become accessible reasonably quickly: we start with the traditional one-on-one matches , to then unlock the two-on-two tag matches, the Brawl mode and the Party Record. Further news will come with the next updates, which will also bring with them new scenarios: for the moment there are only five, but the developers' goal is to give each individual hero their own setting. Graphics and sound Flash Party, the main screen Can a clone boast its own personality? Flash Party tries to answer this question with the quality of an artistic sector that promises to be really interesting right from the start, thanks to the talent of the illustrators who are part of the development team and who have given the characters a characterization that may not always be very original but certainly convincing. The style is close to that of Pixar's animated productions, the colors are splendid and give the action a great liveliness, further supported by a set of sufficiently rich and spectacular manoeuvres. Too bad for the sound, which does not go beyond some generic music and is not very present in the effects.", "date": "2022-02-22", "grade": "8.0"}
