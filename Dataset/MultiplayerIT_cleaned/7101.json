{"name": "Offroad Unchained", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/offroad-unchained-recensione-racer-arcade-targato-red-bull.html", "text": "The Unchained formula developed by the Red Bull gaming division in recent years is characterized by a great visual impact and extremely simple controls, which require the use of only one finger but which, precisely for this reason, often end up offering a experience closer to that of the classic endless runner than to real driving games. Well, in the Offroad Unchained review we explain how this approach, applied to the world of racing on four wheels, is quite limiting. In fact, we are faced with a title equipped with graphics of great impact, but which in the basic mechanics proves to be problematic and inconsistent. Gameplay and automatisms Offroad Unchained, the drifting off-road vehicle The first minutes of Offroad Unchained are dedicated to a tutorial that illustrates how the gameplay works: driving one of the many unlockable off-road vehicles, we will have to complete increasingly difficult races trying to cross the finish line first. The key to victory lies in the cleanliness of the guide, but the concept itself appears immediately rendered in a bizarre way. In fact, the game is played with the screen in portrait mode, in portrait mode and using only one thumb to steer the car, although this input is not received as expected. With the automatic accelerator and without the possibility of braking, in the end the mechanics revolve only around the slides that must be carried out to face the curves in controlled drift, the timing of the jumps and the double tap to activate the classic boost. Managing these actions in the best way, trying to avoid obstacles along the track, allows you to get the cue you need to overcome your opponents, whether it's simple events or online multiplayer. However, the free-to-play mechanics come into action with their paywalls quickly enough, and so acting on the boosts becomes practically mandatory in order to be competitive. In short, the system that emerges is that of the most classic old-fashioned freemium mobile games, with a balance of difficulty calibrated to push us towards microtransactions but at the same time an almost automated gameplay, ideal for lazy players who have little desire to commit themselves: a target that is undoubtedly broad in the mobile sector, but this is not a justification. Structure: methods and contents Offroad Unchained, the jump indicators It is a pity that Offroad Unchained proves to be inconsistent and engaging, given that the content is not lacking. From the starting screen it is in fact possible to try your hand at a quick multiplayer race, for up to four participants, or access a career mode consisting of as many as one hundred races. The traditional action energy indicator allows you to face only five challenges of followed, to then stop and wait for its (slow) recharge. As already mentioned, however, it is above all the balancing of the difficulty that creates headaches, given that the upgrades that can be purchased with virtual currency run out quite quickly and it is therefore necessary to repeat the races already completed or put your hand in your wallet in order to advance in your career. Technical construction: beautiful but heavy Offroad Unchained, a frantic head-to-head We said at the beginning of a great visual impact, but it would be better to say that in the first moments we thought we were dealing with an interlude sequence rather than in-game graphics, not so much for the quality of the assets but for the effects. The developers of Offroad Unchained have literally peppered the game with very sophisticated visual effects and seeing it in motion is truly a show, which however comes at a high price. In fact, we had never come across a title that made the iPhone 12 overheat Pro so suddenly, after just a few seconds with the settings maxed out and 60 fps. It is therefore necessary to scale the quality and the frame rate in order to play, which represents a limit of no small importance. Little to say instead about the sound, characterized by quite generic rock songs.", "date": "2022-06-25", "grade": "6.0"}
