A category that has never completely disappeared, just think of the many mobile apps that promise to make us (?) Goofy again, but which was almost extinct on consoles. The success of Ring Fit Adventure and the need to exercise, despite the ban on leaving the house, has prompted many manufacturers to try their luck again and offer games that help make physical exercises less boring and repetitive. In the Fitness Boxing 2: Rhythm & Exercise review we will find out how Imagineer tried to use boxing and a little Japanese madness to achieve the goal. Understanding how Fitness Boxing 2: Rhythm & Exercise works is quite simple: take a music game In Just Dance style, replace the dance moves with typical boxing moves and add control through the motion sensors of the Nintendo Switch. Nintendo itself is at the production, but, we tell you right away, don't wait to find the classic magic of the Japanese publisher in Fitness Boxing 2: Rhythm & Exercise. Shortcomings The reason is obvious: although well structured and full of things to do, one gets the feeling that Fitness Boxing 2: Rhythm & Exercise is a side project for the big N. On paper everything works quite well: there is a program of varied and scalable training, suitable both for those who want to get some rust out of the joints and for those looking for something more, but there are also 23 tracks to unlock, clothes to customize trainers, exercises, objectives to reach and all the rest. What is missing, however, is the cleanliness of the experience, the possibility of carrying it around with you or even simply a little care in the design of the package. We repeat, the game itself works: following the instructions of the coaches makes you sweat and also guarantees a good feeling of fatigue, but everything is left a little too much in the hands of the players. The software, in fact, accompanies and directs the training in a rather bland way. As we said Fitness Boxing 2: Rhythm & Exercise asks you to perform punches and dodges to the rhythm of the music. There is the column that says what to do with the left hand and the one dedicated to the right fist. Performing the movement with the right timing will earn more points, useful for unlocking new exercises, songs or clothes for the trainers. Too bad that often the game is not able to precisely calculate the type of shot performed. A jab is very different from an uppercut or a hook, but often the game will confuse the strikes, registering only when and if the strike is delivered. Similarly, therefore, Fitness Boxing 2: Rhythm & Exercise does not help improve posture , correct your style or track your endurance progress. There is no heart rate reading like in Ring Fit Adventure, but there is also no connection with a fitness app, so you can coordinate the movement made in Fitness Boxing 2: Rhythm & Exercise with your daily training plan or devices for heart rate or weight control. You can only import the saves from the previous Fitness Boxing, in case you have it. The lack of physical support such as the Wii Fit Balance Board, the Ring Fit Adventure ring or the EA Active elastic band, moreover, it takes away a fixed point to perform the exercise, something that will not help you maintain the initial position, with the risk of hitting objects or things around you. Furthermore, throwing punches in the air increases the risk of wrong movements and therefore injuries, given that due to enthusiasm we could throw a poorly controlled hook or punch, with consequent pain in the shoulders or back. Oriental style To these things you will have to add the fact that the character designs are quite strange. These are hyper-muscular but rather standardized avatars that we will be able to customize in some aesthetic details (such as haircut or eye color) and then dress as we like, unlocking new outfits. Each one comes with its own lines of dialogue and a rather personal style of prompting you to do the exercises. So far, so good. Too bad they all speak English and, despite the good Italian adaptation of the texts, some might not appreciate a personal trainer who doesn't speak their own language. To this we add menus that are not aesthetically appealing and not always understandable (we happened to redo a tutorial several times because we didn't understand how to start the exercise after seeing the introductory film) and incomprehensible background choices. How should I feel inspired to give more in a game offitness (which therefore could be used to limit weight problems) if in the background of my exercise there are mountains of sweets? It is true that what passes in the background is not important if one is concentrated on the exercise, but a little more care and sense from this point of view could have been put in. The composition of pieces is rather varied, always rather rhythmic, but with also quite popular arrangements of famous songs. Training Despite the little care for the package, Fitness Boxing 2: Rhythm & Exercise does everything it needs to do: it has a rather challenging progressive training program, a good selection of songs, exercises of increasing difficulty and lots of elements to unlock. learn the rudiments of the ~noble art~ in a fun way, making you sweat and getting back in shape. You will work a lot on the trunk and arms, but also the legs will work with the continuous jumps and guard changes. Hitting the air is not always the maximum satisfaction, but by combining the game with weights such as wrist or ankle cuffs, you could maximize the 'exercise. However, the impression is that Fitness Boxing 2: Rhythm & Exercise is neither the most sophisticated nor the deepest fitness software on the market and is mainly aimed at those who love to box and have the desire for someone who can suggest effective and fun combinations with which to break the monotony.", "date": "2020-12-02", "grade": "6.0"}
