In fact, the videogame role-playing game has mostly followed different paths, developing according to different mechanics and identification systems, even if the first attempts inevitably tended to be closer to the paper versions also given the technological backwardness. Reproposing similar mechanics nowadays is not easy, with structures that are now settled and canons imposed on the market, but indie productions manage in some cases to stand out and get considerably closer to those original atmospheres. Among these, some referring in particular to the mobile market are quite successful, such as the excellent Galactic Keep, or the Pen and Paper series, which emerged with Knights of Pen and Paper about five years ago. It's a nerd's game for nerds, and on that front the Paradox label is pretty much a guarantee. Even if its stirring in geek imagery is often a little too insistent and self-referential, connected as it is to a solid RPG structure it helps to set up a very pleasant experience. Galaxy of Pen and Paper expands this concept by extending it to the entire sci-fi sphere, which is also hand-in-hand with nerd and role-playing culture, thus proposing not only constant ironic references to the mechanics of role-playing games but also to science fiction in general. As in the previous chapters, everything revolves around the game master and the players, who are always present on the screen around the table on which the role-playing game takes place, but in the wider portion of the screen behind them as the adventures unfold, staged as in an enormous projection of the protagonists' fantasies. Obviously this solution lends itself to a continuous game of references, quotes and jokes that often break the fourth wall and lay bare, joking about it, the romantic illusion of the classic role-playing game. The Behold Studios team has taken over the series after developing the first Knights of Pen and Paper and leaving the second in the care of Kyy Games, and the original touch has returned to being clearly visible and appreciable in this new chapter, including the inevitable pixel aesthetic that fits perfectly into the retro spirit of the game. Roll the dice The structure is that of the classic RPG, with all interactions calculated on the basis of virtual dice rolls, which determine the amount of damage inflicted in combat, the probability of obtaining certain effects and the chances of random encounters with enemies. The combat system is obviously turn-based and based on the alternating use of the various party members, who are all in turn managed and developed by investing the various experience points accumulated. The game offers a main story, which sees us travel the galaxy on ever greater adventures, and various side quests but these are actually the weakest aspects of the package: the weakness of the story is probably a consequence of its being a sort of great parody of RPG in general, and the quests almost always result in the simple killing of a certain number of enemies, with the occasional boss to take down. However, the new setting offers much greater potential than the original one, taking us around various planets characterized by different scenarios and easily offering the opportunity for various sci-fi themed gags, as well as introducing combat between spaceships during encounters random in interplanetary travel. Everything proceeds in a rather linear way but some choice is left to the player in how to answer the questions and decide what to do, trying in this way to replicate (with due proportions) the freedom of the ~pen and paper~ role-playing game. The choice is obviously not so vast and decisive on the continuation, but the inclusion of such an element to revive a not too elaborate narrative is still appreciable. For the rest, most of the time is taken up by combat, which takes place according to the classic canons of turns with ~attack-magic-item~ options and intersects with the complex management of the characters. These are divided into rather unconventional categories, making the experimentation of teams made up of diversified elements particularly stimulating, because the exploitation of different characteristics is then decisive for success in advanced combats. The development of the fighters goes through the investment of the punti experience within various active and passive skills and special techniques: it is a deep and complex system, which however is somewhat cryptic at first due to an objective lack of explanations from the developers. The desire to build a game tailored to RPG enthusiasts is fine, but given the choice to adopt out-of-the-box categories, a minimum of tutorials or in-depth descriptions on the different types of fighters and the effects of the perks would have been appreciated.", "date": "2017-08-17", "grade": "8.4"}
