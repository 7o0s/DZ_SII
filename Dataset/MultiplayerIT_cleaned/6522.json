Many limit themselves to offering horror scenarios, without even trying to really scare, others bet everything on amateurish tricks, such as jumping on the chair or a little blood, expedients that leave the time they find, but they are liked by virtue of their social potential, still others become predictable with such speed that, when you get to the end, the horror is just a distant memory. Playing to write the review of Amnesia: The Bunker has fortunately reminded us of what true horror can be, that is the fear of taking a single step or of performing a ~wrong~ action, involving us in its impeccable grammar. Do I open or not? In Amnesia: The Bunker you spend a lot of time in the dark ~I'm breathing deeply.~ Watching us play Amnesia: The Bunker from the outside we would have found ourselves in front of a person with his eyes fixed on the screen, with slow and heavy breathing, as if he lived the fears of the character he is playing in the first person, undecided on whether to do it or not the action elaborated to overcome the obstacle of turn. It's a wooden door, we can open it by throwing a brick at it, but we know that doing so will inevitably attract the monster. So we stand there with the brick in hand thinking not so much about what to do, because we know that well, but whether the escape strategy we have developed will work, because the accursed monster will arrive. It's dark, the generator is far away and we can't go and refuel it. Then it will come. And we stand there in front of that door, aware that if we don't throw the brick it will show up anyway and we'll probably end up badly anyway. Let's mentally go over the escape plan. We have a gun, but against the creature it is of no use. We have a portable dynamo torch, but recharging it makes a bit of noise and we risk tempting fate before throwing the brick. Unfortunately, we haven't found any tricks to avoid unwanted attention or to make sure you can get away with it. No loopholes. He's smart and he's hungry. An insatiable hunger. By stopping the moment and keeping an external gaze, we understand that the flow of emotions we are feeling in front of yet another door to open has been generated and studied with a mastery that is difficult to find in other horror games. From this point of view Amnesia: The Bunker can look down on even very famous titles such as Resident Evil Village, decidedly more pop and kind towards the player in the way they handle anguish. Here the tension is palpable, built up by many small design features that you almost don't realize when you play for the first time, but which all come together in one of the most terrifying experiences of recent times, in its harshness, a kind point zero of the genre in which Frictional Games seems to have abandoned the existentialist ambitions of SOMA and Amnesia: Rebirth, to focus on the systemic essence of what defines a horror video game, carefully avoiding the shortest and most banal way, that of filling the experience of jumping from the chair, to focus on building tension, locking the player in a small and terribly claustrophobic world in which every interaction unconsciously forces us to look over our shoulder, to understand if we have just dug our grave by acting recklessly. We don't believe there is another game where even reloading a weapon becomes a distressing action. Watching from the outside as we play we wonder if we will ever throw that brick, because we know that doing so would set the hunter off, clearly revealing the location of the prey. Our posture itself is the daughter of that indecision that is tearing us apart, in a game that is literally full of similar moments. The ABC's of Amnesia: The Bunker The creature is seen very little when playing, given that in most cases in Amnesia: The Bunker you try to run away or hide Amnesia: The Bunker doesn't have a story that's too elaborate, nor does it care to have one. It is set during the First World War. In the introduction / tutorial, Henri Clment, a simple soldier, is hit by the explosion of a grenade while trying to save a fellow soldier. He wakes up in a bunker, where he immediately realizes that something terrible has happened. To reveal what happened to him is another soldier, the only other living human present, who explains to him how the officers ran away, blocking the entrance with dynamite, after an unidentified monster began to kill everyone. The soldier will immediately meet a bad end and Clment will find himself completely alone having to devise a way to open the blocked entrance, rerecovering some dynamite and the trigger. He has a gun, but as mentioned it's completely useless against the monster. He has a dynamo torch, but it lasts a few seconds and turning it on can make all the difference in the world between life and death. Be that as it may, as the introduction made us realize, it has different ways to deal with obstacles. For example, one of the first things to do is to reach the bunker warehouse, but the wooden access door is locked. In the introduction, the game explained to us that we can open it by throwing very heavy objects at it or by making it explode. The clock is used to synchronize with the generators to know when it's time to go and recharge them Looking around, however, we notice a grate and decide to open it to see where the duct leads. Will it be a login? Amnesia: The Bunker greatly rewards observation and finding alternative ways to overcome obstacles. In principle, you are free to explore and experiment, with the constraints of trying to make as little noise as possible and to be careful of the traps placed to try to stop the monster, but which apparently are only lethal to humans. At each game, the objects are redistributed randomly (the map, on the other hand, is fixed), including some access codes that are used to open some doors so, even if you can never get stuck, you have to make assessments every time on what to do. make yourself based on what you have, which greatly increases replayability. Horror lesson Amnesia: The Bunker invites a lot to experiment with the objects that are found around As mentioned, each game system is designed to create tension, even to the point of presenting itself as pleasant. Take the damage system for example. When Clment gets injured, he starts bleeding. Some image distortion effects are then activated and its movements become slower. So far we are in the standards. It is the consequences of the wounds that are in a certain sense unprecedented, because treating him quickly not only serves not to make him bleed to death and to bring him back to full shape, but also to not create trails of fresh blood which, guess what, attract the creature towards him, revealing his position. The game clarifies it immediately, so that there are no doubts about it so that, every time you suffer a wound, the tension increases exponentially without even there being an immanent danger, especially if you don't have healing items available. Another really distressing system is that of generators. The only thing the creature really fears is light, so keeping the bunker lit is essential to being able to survive longer and to explore without immediately feeling hunted. Too bad that the electrical system is connected to generators that must be manually recharged with fuel cans found around the bunker. To save you need to find lamps, which are also the only safe places in Amnesia: The Bunker So, from time to time, you have to go back to prevent them from going out. The small size of the map does not make the operation particularly onerous in terms of time, but finding yourself suddenly with the lights off, perhaps because the pocket watch that is provided to have a reference on the matter has not synchronized well , inevitably creates a state of turmoil from ~what do I do now? Do I continue the search hoping to find another generator, or do I go back to the last one visited?~ Imagine then if you ran out of fuel, knowing that the creature gets more aggressive the longer the bunker stays dark. To make it all the more terrifying, we think that the saves are not free and that dying can mean losing several minutes of the game. Sure, we have the dynamo torch (other sources of emergency lighting will also be found as the game progresses), but turning it on is like drawing a flashing target on your back, especially when the generators have been off for a while. So the game invites you not to make any noise, but at the same time does everything possible to keep us from taking a breath, because it's not possible to stop too long. We have to solve puzzles, but we also have to stock up on fuel and other tools, despite having a very limited inventory (only six slots). We confess that in certain moments they had very tense nerves and in some cases we even had to stop the game to go and drink some water, such was the tension accumulated. The answer The tension in some moments really skyrockets For those wondering, from a narrative point of view Amnesia: The Bunker si merely create a plausible scenario under the given conditions, without indulging in existential or other dilemmas. Some soldiers built a bunker in the wrong place during a bloody conflict that had already put them to the test and brought them to their limits, and what is told in the documents found around the game environments is the awareness of the men of the existence of the monster, the ways in which they tried to stop it, the desperation in the face of its apparent invincibility and, therefore, the escape. There are obviously details and considerations, there are some surprises, but that's all. We are therefore faced with a pure and simple representation of horror, which is all the more effective precisely because it does not give any definitive explanation of the nature of the hunter. After all, even the protagonist is simply a soldier abandoned by his superiors, who ran away to save themselves and the survivors. In the end there is a moment of confrontation, but without river explanations. The crux of the whole game is to survive, with the facts that are told by the documents and the construction of the bunker, full as it is of tunnels dug by the monster, whose entrances are always clearly visible (just to increase the tension quite a bit ) and corpses, some of which are fresh enough to suggest that the monster hasn't acted, but is still acting, making the experience even more terrifying. An effective answer The traps that Amnesia: The Bunker is filled with do not cause damage to the monster, but to the poor protagonist they do After several hours of play, Amnesia: The Bunker seemed to us Frictional Games' answer to those who complained about how SOMA and Rebirth have confronted the narrative with horror, i.e. how they have diluted the scariest moments into structures more relaxed, punctuated by the story they told. Here the focus is really on pure horror, from which one is almost never distracted throughout the adventure. If we want the relatively short duration (when you know what to do it takes little to complete it, also considering the small size of the map) it is also explained by not being able to maintain the tension for hours and hours for a purely practical matter. Going too far could become counterproductive and lead to abandonment, given that some may find it simply unsustainable (it's not really a health walk already ... however there is always the story mode, which allows you to devote yourself to puzzles without risking life at every step). If you're easily suggestible, leave it alone In this sense, The Bunker is a very balanced experience, which you enter with relative tranquility and which keeps you on the alert until the end, when you finally manage to release the accumulated tension death after death, open door after open door, recharge of the flashlight after charging the flashlight. Having said that, it is also fair to warn that those who expect an experience in line with that of the latest Frictional titles may be disappointed, because here we are on a very different level. Let's say that The Bunker applies every possible technique, apart from jumping on the chair (which in some ways are the shortcut for those who don't know how to design horror games) to present itself as a sort of design bible for its reference genre. This it wants to be and it manages to do it perfectly, resulting in one of the most immersive horror experiences in recent years.", "date": "2023-06-05", "grade": "9.0"}
