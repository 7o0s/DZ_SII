{"name": "Octopath Traveler", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/octopath-traveler-recensione-202306.html", "text": "A few days ago, producer Masashi Takahashi said that Octopath Traveler, in terms of gameplay, is the spiritual successor of Final Fantasy VI: a very strong comparison that only served to tenfold the enthusiasm of Switch owners. We must admit that Takahashi's words have bewitched us too but, after spending more than fifty hours in the company of the eight protagonists, we have come to the conclusion that perhaps Mr. Takahashi Final Fantasy VI does not remember it so well. It is quite clear that the producer was referring to the so-called World of Ruin, the final act of Final Fantasy VI in which the heroes are divided and it is up to the player to decide who to recruit before facing the decisive battle: Octopath Traveler, in a sense , it works the same way. However, the sixth Final Fantasy (SNES, 1994) is today considered one of the best 16-bit JRPGs - if not the best, in case you don't mind the time travels of Chrono Trigger - not only for the gameplay, but also and above all for the plot , a compelling choral story in which the colorful protagonists meet and separate over and over again, to form a common front against one of the most hateful and successful antagonists in the entire history of the videogame medium. In this respect, Octopath Traveler instead recalls - just as we predicted months ago - SaGa Frontier, another Square Enix brand much less famous than Final Fantasy. Sadly, this isn't exactly a lineage worth bragging about, and despite all the goodwill, Octopath Traveler ultimately fell short of our expectations quite a bit. The eight story problem When we wrote our latest essay last week, we had advanced the concrete hypothesis that the stories of the eight wayfarers would not have intersected, if not marginally. Today we can confirm that this is exactly the case: the eight ~campaigns~ (and stories) don't even touch each other, except through subtle references to facts and legends that characterize the world created by the developer Acquire. There are no supporting actors, allies or antagonists in common. The eight stories, each divided into four chapters, take place as parallel and have a perfectly autonomous beginning, central development and conclusion. The player could ideally go through a single campaign and fully understand the plot, since it would all evolve around the wanderer who is the protagonist. In a way, even the slogans promoted this kind of experience. Too bad it's not exactly feasible. Indeed, each chapter in the story of a single character is separated from the previous one by a gap of ten or fifteen experience levels. To be clear, the game suggests reaching at least level 27 to embark on the second chapter in Olberic's story, but if the player starts as this character and, having completed the first chapter at roughly level 5, wants to continue the story immediately, then he will have to ~grind~ a good twenty levels if he wants to have any hope of making it. Of course, you can put yourself in a corner of the map and repeat random fights for hours like Cartman with the boars in the famous South Park episode, but we find it an impractical and even less fun solution. Instead, it is better to follow the path mysteriously suggested by the game and recruit the other wayfarers, tackling the various chapters of all the stories in an ascending order of levels. The problem is that, in this way, the premise of Octopath Traveler gets fried. In this way, in short, the stories of the wayfarers are separated only on a narrative level, but not on that of progression, given that the various chapters essentially mark it. This immediately leads to a number of important problems. In the first place, the continuous passage from one storyline to another breaks the tension and the rhythm of the stories, tremendously spoiling the most compelling ones like those of Primrose or Cyrus: we are talking about no less than eight adventures, so the diary that summarizes in succinctly the latest developments, in case the player has forgotten what happened, but its existence does not improve the situation. Secondly, the non-existent interaction between the wayfarers recruited diminishes the importance of their vicissitudes and the drama of certain situations. Since there is no main storyline, the developer treats the wayfarers as mere ~tools~ of the gameplay and offers us no reason why a brave warrior like Olberic or an upright and pious clergyman like Ophilia should help a lone thief like Therion commit a robbery. The player recruits other travelers to their cities di start as if they were anonymous mercenaries: once they join the group, the characters appear only when moving or fighting, vanishing completely in the narrative interludes, without being recognized by the NPCs with whom they had interacted in their personal adventures. This solution leaves you stunned and completely nullifies the impact of some sequences, demonstrating a level of superficial refinement. The boss on duty, surrounded by his guards, mocks a traveler because he will never be able to defeat him alone. An ambush threatens the life of a traveler who is saved in extremis by an old acquaintance. Dramatic moments that leverage the protagonists' sense of loneliness and helplessness... despite the fact that there are at least three battle mates with them. It is a narrative choice that frankly astounds and breaks any illusion or pretension of tension. The travel chatter is useless, absolutely optional interludes in which the wayfarers finally interact with each other: considering that very specific criteria must be met to unlock them, these sequences at the most make the situation worse, especially if the characters comment on the very serious events that happened shortly before, while they were completely absent. The fights and the gameplay That doesn't mean that the eight adventures are bad, quite the contrary. Taken individually, the stories of the wayfarers boast a high-level writing - thanks also to the excellent Italian translation - and a series of thematic choices that elevate Octopath Traveler above the canonical JRPGs for teenagers to which Japanese developers have accustomed us in recent years. The title Acquire talks about revenge, prostitution and sacrifice: it always does so in calm tones, without pacing too much on the more thorny issues, and the result is stories that are perhaps a little predictable but nonetheless of great impact, especially that of Primrose. The more optimistic and youthful stories of Alfyn and Tressa act as a counterpart to the adventures of the adults, composing an interesting narrative mosaic, albeit without a single direction. There is no imaginary final chapter that brings together the eight wayfarers. We have not seen it even in passing therefore, if it exists, it is so well hidden in the optional contents that it can be considered irrelevant: all in all, even if it were there, it would not affect our judgment, also because in the previous fifty hours and more the eight wayfarers have never had a goal even remotely in common that could justify their existence. Unfortunately Octopath Traveler also reveals the same structural weaknesses on the gameplay front, a hodgepodge of individually convincing ideas, less overall than the experience. We've talked about the need to tackle the eight story chapters in a certain order if you want to avoid boring leveling sessions, and that means constantly moving from one city to another, often visiting the same locations over and over again to complete the chapters. or side missions. The settlements are separated by several maps to explore, where you engage in random encounters and open chests that contain items and other collectibles. There are no puzzles to solve or levers to pull either outdoors or indoors: despite the multiple detours, exploration remains linear. The game does not offer any fast movement system, for example means of locomotion, unlike what happened in the titles Acquire says it was inspired by: the player who does not want to give up experience points must therefore always retrace the same maps, often fighting enemies much lower level when returning to one of the first cities. Exploration, which soon becomes a repetitive coming and going, takes up most of the hundred hours of gameplay promised in the interviews. The structure of the game, in this sense, is repeated exactly as it is over the thirty-two chapters: the player arrives in the city, watches the interludes, talks to some NPCs, goes to the short duty dungeon, faces the boss, looks at the last interludes, the journey begins again. And this structure lends itself to a series of incomprehensible choices, such as the impossibility of replacing the first traveler with whom the game began, whose role clearly binds the rest of the formation. Thus an important gap is always created between the wayfarers that the player uses the most and those who remain on the bench more often, however forcing a grind of some level to avoid facing the most difficult enemies with a dead weight or more. It's not all bad, however. While not always perfectly balanced, the game implements a form of scaling that allows the player to get away with resorting to some good strategy. Octopath Traveler's combat system, in its simplicity, takes the lion's share: it's fun and guarantees a certain level of control thanks to the enemies' strengths and weaknesses. The clashes are never particularly fast - unless the group greatly exceeds the level of the enemies - and require a minimum of strategy. If initially it seems that everything boils down to setting aside the AP to launch destructive attacks once the defenses of the enemies have been overcome, in the following chapters you have to think more tactically, especially when facing the bosses and their peculiar mechanics. The secondary class system didn't completely convince us: each of them can be associated with only one character, and the predefined roles also leave little room for imaginative combinations. No sane player would set Ecclesiast as a secondary class for warriors like Olberic or H'aanit, unless it takes the time to learn passive skills through a cumbersome and antiquated interface. Once all secondary classes are unlocked, including the four special ones, there are still many interesting combinations to experiment with. In short, those who love to fight will find in Octopath Traveler a JRPG full of incentives, also because Acquire has filled the map with small optional dungeons full of bosses and treasures, both during the adventure and after completing each chapter. A technical picture Unfortunately, the side missions of Octopath Traveler turned out to be much less interesting, to the point that we even stopped focusing on completing them. Rewards mostly include money and consumable items, more rarely high-quality weapons or armor. On the other hand, these tasks are often cumbersome and require close attention and a good memory. Usually the NPCs will ask us to meet someone or to recover a certain object or a given piece of information, and this means employing the peculiar skills that characterize the wayfarers. The idea in and of itself is very nice, but it quickly ends up becoming redundant, forcing the player to make incredible spins just to receive some money or common consumable in return. The reputation mechanic that should make the use of these skills more exciting is equally questionable: once the attempts available have failed, the player can simply pay a certain amount in the inn to restore the possibility of interacting with NPCs without encountering any other consequences. In short, like practically every other element that makes up the Octopath Traveler mosaic, even the secondary missions give the idea of a game made in a confused and unconvinced way. On the technical sector, however, you just can't argue. It is clear that to appreciate the Acquire effort, you must like pixel art. We are talking about a style aimed at a precise sphere of enthusiasts and nostalgics, of course, but one cannot remain indifferent to the well-kept mix of sprites which, tiny and summarily animated, manage to convey unthinkable emotions. The credit goes largely to the soundtrack composed by Yasunori Nishiki, who somehow manages to promptly evoke sensations of urgency and drama thanks to evocative, engaging and always spot on tracks, both when exploring, when fighting, and when you attend some fateful meeting. The mix of old and new expressed by Octopath Traveler through the use of retro sprites and polygonal scenarios embellished with modern graphic effects, chiaroscuro and blurs is undoubtedly fascinating and establishes an interesting basis on which to build a new stylistic line. In short, it is a real pity that the Acquire game is unable to affirm an equally precise identity in terms of content.", "date": "2018-07-12", "grade": "7.0"}
