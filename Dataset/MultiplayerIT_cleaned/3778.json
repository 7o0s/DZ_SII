{"name": "Devil May Cry 5", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/devil-may-cry-5-recensione.html", "text": "The importance of Devil May Cry 5 transcends that of the nostalgia operation, and its arrival is not even entirely attributable to the need to restart a genre - that of Japanese action hack 'n' slash - for a long time poor in releases of prominent. No, Devil May Cry 5 is a symbol, a new demonstration of the power of a reborn Capcom, and a clear message to fans: ~we are great again, and we can give you your myths back as you have never experienced them before~. And with Resident Evil 2 and Monster Hunter World this message will have already passed, repositioning the Japanese team in the Olympus of the development gods, but in the case of the series created by Kamiya and then passed on to the good Hideaki Itsuno things are a little more complicated. We are still talking about a brand that has faced a reboot, an unfinished symphony closed with a fourth chapter equipped with incredible mechanics, yet disappointing in every other aspect ... In short, here it is a question of recovering the soul of a historical name , with an eye to fans and fanatics of combat systems, and at the same time with the need to make the new generations understand ~why~ the adventures of Dante and company boast such consideration. With the burning desire to find out if this herculean task had been completed or not, we therefore faced the review of the game. The response from the house was not long in coming, but be warned: it may not make everyone happy in the same way. Narrative and characters: brothers knives Devil May Cry's narrative has never been particularly memorable, beyond the charisma of the characters and the bombastic scenes that represent its lowest common denominator. Bringing it back on track in Devil May Cry 5 with a complete change of direction would have been a mistake, and in some ways a sort of betrayal of a long epic that has always made the incredible tamarraggine and spectacularity of its central moments the heart of the story. 'experience. The choice of Itsuno and his team, therefore, was to go in pure fanservice mode: to reconnect all the events of the predecessors in a cornucopia of excessive scenes and glorious returns, with only a few distant hints of the forgettable second episode. It was a good move, and the story of this chapter benefits enormously from it, even if at times it inevitably expires in the predictable. Although lacking in brilliant writing, this Devil May Cry 5 manages to stand out from the previous ones thanks to the enormous injection of charisma and personality brought by the RE Engine and the exceptional level of its animations. Add to all this a narrative formula broken up with criterion, where the continuous time jumps between one story and another outline the story in a rather crystalline way (even if a little atypical compared to the predecessors), and you will undoubtedly get the absolute chapter more refined in this aspect. You will quickly forgive the campaign's fair amount of ingenuity, carried away by the exchanges between Nero, Dante, V, and all the other colorful supporting characters. Furthermore, we appreciated Nico's rude, somewhat crazy and at times absurd characterization more than expected: on the other hand, a shoulder with the ability to reach any place on earth aboard a van is not seen every day. Curiously, then, the game also tries to expand its narrative and to give it a little more general solidity with the help of Nicoletta's notes (which describe enemies, characters and weapons found in detail), as well as a handful of letters that do not fail to reveal some interesting background. Gameplay and fighting: the art of swordsmanship, boxing and panther demonic The fact that the team has clearly taken more care of the storyline of the title is however secondary when it comes to a title of this saga: in Devil May Cry 5 the gameplay is king, queen, divinity, and there is no aspect that can equal its importance within the production. We are still talking about a video game that builds on the foundations of the fourth chapter, a title still played today by enthusiasts due to the incredible possibilities offered in terms of combinations of shots and the execution of spectacular offensive actions with each available character (especially in the Special Edition, which has a lot of usable characters). These indestructible foundations have been maintained almost in their entirety - to the point that in the role of Nero and Dante you will find maneuvers and balances already explored in the past if you have played the previous chapter, and it won't take you long to get used to the system again - only that Itsuno and the his have expanded it all with countless new moves, a whole newor system dedicated to Nero, and a new character named V, whose functioning differs from anything previously inserted in the saga. It is a monstrous amount of irons in the fire, and we assure you that for a neophyte it will not be a walk to adapt to the various warriors during the twenty missions of the campaign. Capcom, however, has if nothing else included in the game more than a ~buffer gimmick~ for those who have heard Dante mention him only because of the Divine Comedy, as well as a real training mode called The Void, where it is possible to test every move at will, with customization options that closely resemble those of fighting games. And this is, in simple terms, Devil May Cry 5 when it comes to gameplay: a game whose combat system is so complex that it is comparable to that of a three-dimensional fighting game. Nero and Dante can perform spectacular combos with ease, but at high levels they can cancel punch animations (mostly by leaping on enemies, but there are various other maneuvers useful for lengthening combinations and achieving unpredictable effects), and create extraordinary choreographies of death. As it should be, therefore, Capcom has not gone to distort so much good things, but has simply decided to offer our heroes a number of possibilities that simply did not exist in Devil May Cry 4, and new weapons equipped with fantastic surprises for the virtuosos of flying slaps. Want an example? In Devil May Cry 5, the red-clad demon hunter can surround himself with red gems, lunge at an opponent with a flying kick, jump to cancel the animation, land on his face with a sword while the gems are still hitting him, throw him into air with those same floating stones, teleport after him after switching styles, beat him with a motorcycle (yeah, one of the weapons is literally a transforming motorcycle), launch him back into the air with a missile once he switches styles again, and finish him in a number monstrous in ways. We know it seems complex but... this is basic stuff compared to what you can combine once you get all the available moves (purchasable with the red gems used in the combo described above), and the only reason why we don't go into more detail is that we don't want to spoil what is made available to the heroes once they get to the final stages. In the meantime, keep in mind that the fears related to the presence of a shop and the possible effective cost of the skills are unfounded: getting the purple currency of the game is a walk, and at the end of the first run you will have unlocked most of the moves. Two other hunters, Nero and V You may have noticed how the piece for now has focused mainly on Dante to praise the mechanics of Itsuno's work. Well, the truth is that the original protagonist, strengthened by an improvement that goes on from the origins, is once again the character with the greatest flexibility, the most exciting to use, and by far the most spectacular. Don't think for one moment that this detracts from the validity of Nero and V, however, as both are brilliant in their own way, even if the newcomer in particular is not lacking in criticism. In Devil May Cry 5 Nero, as already mentioned on various occasions, begins the private game of his demonic arm, but thanks to Nico he gains robotic prostheses called Devil Breaker, which greatly expand his move list. The Devil Breakers are a nice change of current compared to the original version of the warrior: they are all equipped with unique abilities and particularly suitable for certain types of enemies, they can be sacrificed on the fly, equipped in large numbers (the slots can always be increased with gems red) or overheated and shredded to perform devastating power-up moves that deal massive damage and massively boost a mission's Style Score. Considering that even without Devil Breaker equipped Nero is still able to use a sort of grappling hook to launch himself towards enemies or pull them towards him, and all his more complex maneuvers remain unchanged, it is really a nice evolution, whose only weaknesses there are two: the arms are not freely selectable and must be sacrificed in series, and some of them are much more flexible and fun to use than others. There is clearly talk of quite negligible defects: the first deriving from the desire to make the experience with the young man different from that with Dante - which is entirely based on the switch of weapons and styles - while the second simply linked to a question of balance general (if all arms were effective against every type of enemy, non the whole equipment system would have made sense). However, we regret that, despite being a fabulous character and perhaps even more devastating than the others if used in the right way, Nero still fails to reach the grandeur of his ~mentor~ due to these flaws. On the other hand, it is more difficult to sum up V, because the peculiar third protagonist of Devil May Cry does not fight directly, but is a summoner who controls creatures from a distance and therefore requires a considerable change of perspective on the part of the player. More precisely, V can control three different demons taken from the first Devil May Cry: Griffon, a miniature version of the electric bird of the same name; Shadow, a panther of shadow capable of changing shape, and Nightmare, a huge golem of slime capable of hurling laser beams and deliver very slow but powerful blows. All three have a precise function, with in particular Griffon which is the equivalent of a very versatile firearm (in addition to attacking from a distance, it can summon columns of lightning, place electric traps, or unleash area energy fields), and Shadow which instead it represents the summoner's primary means of ground attack. The commands given to the summons, however, exploit directional inputs very similar to those of the classic moves, but with some substantial differences: V must stay at a distance and finish off the enemies with a blow of the stick after they have taken enough hits, and it is the the only character to be able to consistently launch multiple attacks simultaneously on a monster (apart from some advanced weapon skills of Dante, and Nero's missile arm). In practice, therefore, Ours is a real bringer of chaos, which once evoked Nightmare - whose functioning is guided by artificial intelligence, provided that you don't ~ride~ it for a while - is able to unleash unrivaled devastation on his opponents for a limited time. If he is not the most unbalanced character in the game, it is only because his demonic beasts must be repositioned properly in battle with the right maneuvers, and both Nightmare and the enhanced versions of Griffon and Shadow require the activation of the Devil Trigger (an energy bar which fills with white orbs or by fighting) to work. Diamonds, with some imperfections Conceptually, the new V system is a real bomb, the problem is its application, which precisely because of the nature of the character makes it less technical than the other two choices. The primary lack of V, called down to earth, is that often superlative results are obtained with him simply by pressing keys at random, and he cannot apply the maneuvers that cancel the animations that can be used great by the other two. In Devil May Cry 5 V can still acquire moves such as jumping on enemies and the like - a feature that could indicate some advanced mechanics yet to be revealed - overall, however, the mysterious tattooed man seemed to us the least appetizing of the three for a lover of high-level action. We stress it once again: ~the least appetizing of the three~ doesn't mean that using V isn't fun, quite the contrary. We are talking about a brilliant character, with a very commendable number of maneuvers available, and capable of turning the gameplay inside out for the missions in which he is the protagonist. Overall we are after all faced with a title with an absolutely extraordinary combat system, more elaborate and technical than any other exponent of the genre, and fun as never before. The paradox lies in the fact that perhaps the only equally mechanically complex game is its direct predecessor, Devil May Cry 4, and that this contained an additional element linked to inertia, severely limited in the new episode. To explain better: in the fourth chapter the aerial movement of some moves was sensibly adjustable, and this allowed to execute complex combos with sudden and absolutely spectacular movements in the sky (but with a high execution difficulty); in Devil May Cry 5 instead this factor has been toned down, returning to a physics similar to that of Devil May Cry 3 and less customizable aerial combos. Overall, the weapons available to the game still offer absolutely insane options when it comes to offense, but truly experienced players may turn up their noses slightly at this choice. On the contrary, we fully approve the choice not to insert a key dedicated to dodging in the game (dodging exists, but requires the use of jumping in combination with targeting): the series has always linked these maneuvers to jumping, thanks to some invulnerability frames at the start of the animation.
