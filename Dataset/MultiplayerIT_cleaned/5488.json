{"name": "Rally da campioni", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/168761-rush-rally-2-rally-da-campioni.html", "text": "It is always strange to be faced with games made by a single person: on the one hand, one is pushed to appreciate the commendable effort behind their creation, but on the other, more often than not, one is forced to recognize imperfect final results, the result of handcrafted and of a general care inevitably less than when the work is managed by an entire dedicated team. Maybe an original and interesting idea stands out, in the luckiest cases. Rush Rally 2 is precisely a product belonging to this category, built piece by piece by Stephen Brown alone, an English developer with several years of experience behind him on triple A titles. It is, as you can easily guess, a fairly conventional rally game , therefore inevitably devoid of the famous ~interesting and original idea~ mentioned above. So is it a mission lost from the start or the most classic of the exceptions that confirm the rule? Rush Rally 2 is undoubtedly the best rally game available on mobile platforms Pikes Peak of my cravings Incredibly, the latter is the correct answer. Rush Rally 2 is undoubtedly the best rally game currently available on mobile platforms, as well as in general one of the most brilliant racing games available on the Apple and Google stores. This is the sequel to Rush Rally, which just over a year ago proposed an interesting approach to the automotive discipline through a top view that recalled the great 16-bit classics of the time. This second chapter changes the cards on the table by choosing a more modern solution, through 3D graphics with a camera from behind the car or from the bonnet. The approach is largely realistic, and this can be seen both from an aesthetic point of view and with regard to the driving model. Starting from the latter, the developer managed to find a perfect compromise between the desire to offer a simulation mechanic and the capabilities of the touch screens to support this ambition: although the numerous control configuration options allow you to choose the virtual keys also for steering management, the best solution is certainly the one that delegates this function to the accelerometer and therefore to the inclination of the device, while the accelerator, brake and handbrake remain with buttons on the screen. In this way you find yourself fully enjoying the accurate physics implemented, obtained by exploiting real telemetry data, which reproduces a different behavior of the car depending on the terrain, and which allows you to effectively manage counter-steering and drifting. The result is an immersive and rewarding driving experience, reminiscent of the early Colin McRae of Codemasters. Compared to the latter, Rush Rally 2 lacks any type of official license, a factor which translates into invented names of the drivers (albeit inspired by those of the most famous interpreters of the discipline, such as Colon McRay, Bichard Rurns or Sebastien Okay) and in anonymous cars and with advertising logos only similar to the real ones. There are ~only~ eight cars, divided by performance categories, while there are 72 tracks set in various parts of the world such as Finland, Sweden, Australia, Argentina, Spain and so on. Also from the point of view of the modalities, Rush Rally 2 goes on the classic offering a championship, in which you compete alone in search of the best time that makes up the classification, and Rallycross against opponents on the track, with the latter option obviously it guarantees a more arcade and immediate experience. The graphic component is instead based on a proprietary engine, the ~Rush Engine~, further confirmation of the incredible work of Stephen Brown: it is an extremely scalable engine, which offers (just like a PC title) some graphic options that can be modified for adapt to less performing devices, with the main objective of maintaining 60 frames per second. On an iPhone 6s Plus obviously we had no problem setting everything to the maximum, thus being able to appreciate an exceptional fluidity accompanied by a more than discreet polygonal complexity, which, although certainly not capable of making people cry out for a miracle, supports it in a completely honest and appreciable way the experience. The sound is less incisive, which alongside the navigator's voice is accompanied by a not entirely convincing reproduction of the roar of the engines. Even the translation into Italian has many gaps, but it is a marginal aspect after all. The selling price, set at 4.59, is undoubtedly higher than the average in a context in which ~free~ is often considered as a standard and even 99 cents is ~too much~: but the total absence of in-app purchases, advertising or freem itemsium and above all in the face of the overall quality of the product, it is a figure that Rally lovers should spend without any hesitation.", "date": "2016-05-26", "grade": "9.0"}
