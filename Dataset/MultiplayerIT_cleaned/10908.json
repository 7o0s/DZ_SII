{"name": "Zombie Infection", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/zombie-infection.html", "text": "Zombies have definitely made a comeback in recent months: protagonists of the Left 4 Dead game, they have contributed to the success of the popular Resident Evil series and have even dropped into a special mode in the latest episode of Call of Duty. The filmic origins of these creepy creatures, literally living dead with a marked propensity for cannibalism, date back to the 1930s, even if their ~boom~ occurred between the 1970s and 1980s thanks to the films of John Romero. Precisely because of their undead nature, slow in movement but always very numerous, zombies are among the most interesting subjects of horror, capable of distressing the viewer who finds himself witnessing oppressive and tense scenes. Thanks to Gameloft, with Zombie Infection the living dead also arrive on mobile phones, in an action game with a truly extraordinary top-down view in terms of quality and quantity. The protagonists of the game are the members of a team of ~televised~ vigilantes, who find themselves torn apart by an explosion just as madness rages in the streets. We will therefore have to take turns in command of the leader Anderson, the shrewd Mike and the charming Shawna to find our friends, save as many civilians from the zombie attack and understand what is behind this horror. After a short phase which acts as a tutorial, we will find ourselves immersed in the action and will be able to familiarize ourselves with the control system: the d-pad is used to move the character in eight directions, the 5 key activates the equipped primary weapon, the right function the secondary one, while the * key is used to scroll through the available weapons. Thanks to the left function key we will be able to open a menu that will show us the map, the mission objectives and the objects in our possession. Near the savepoints, we will be able to place some of these objects in a box that works in practice like the ~magic chests~ of Resident Evil, from which the various characters can retrieve previously set aside equipment, wherever they are on the map. The combat system depends on the weapon equipped: if it is a firearm, we will see a target appear on the enemy that moves more or less quickly depending on the accuracy of the weapon, giving us the possibility of placing headshots who eliminate the opponent with a single blow; if we are talking about swords or electroshock devices, on the other hand, things will work like in any scrolling fighting game, with collision detection always ~generous~ towards the player, who will therefore not have to get too close to the enemies to literally make them pieces. Furthermore, if edged weapons are used, it will be possible to carry out a running attack capable of decapitating zombies with disarming ease. Using pistols, shotguns, machine guns and rocket launchers has big differences both in terms of shooting accuracy and effectiveness: the pistol is the weapon that best lends itself to headshots, while the others are more ~melee~ solutions . The game takes place in five different locations, for a total of thirty-six missions which often involve the use and combination of objects to overcome certain obstacles, through mechanisms similar to those of classic survival horror. Beyond the sound sector, discreet but not essential, the developers have done an exceptional job for the creation of Zombie Infection. The characters are well drawn and animated, but above all the graphics engine is able to handle a really large number of sprites simultaneously on the screen without slowdowns or uncertainties. Furthermore, the various enemies are not simply eliminated, but end up in pieces (still able to attack) and finally turn into remnants that remain on the ground and do not disappear. In short, the animation front has been taken care of very much, while we note the inclusion of special effects that underline some phases, such as the ~blur~ which perfectly conveys the idea of the most powerful shocks or explosions. The use of colors is excellent, as is the general direction, and the various locations are convincing in terms of design, level of detail and interactivity. PRO Exceptional graphics in quantity and quality Thirty-six immersive and challenging missions Lots of different weapons and items AGAINST Response to commands not always punctual Sometimes frustrating", "date": "2009-01-23", "grade": "S.V."}
