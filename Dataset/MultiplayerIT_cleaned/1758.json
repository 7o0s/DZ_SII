The first minutes of Disco Elysium are a great inner monologue of a being without an identity, without a face, who tries to convince himself not to return to reality, where only disappointments await him. However, the journey of our protagonist has already been faced once and we know that it is absolutely worth it. Here's our review of the PS5 version of Disco Elysium The Final Cut. It goes back Disco Elysium: vestige of a past greatness Disco Elysium The Final Cut has recently been available in PlayStation 4, PS5 and Google Stadia versions, with Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S versions expected for summer 2021. Furthermore, the one just released is not a port direct version of the basic PC edition of the game by ZA/UM, but it is an enhanced version of it, a Final Cut that adds various extras. However, let's take a step back and try to better understand Disco Elysium, a title that is well known but which could have escaped the radar of gamers dedicated purely to the console world. We are a cop, a detective tasked with solving a murder case. Too bad we don't know this at the beginning. Our unnamed character wakes up in a hotel room, after a night spent drinking and perhaps doing worse, with the probable desire to end it once and for all. In a sense we succeeded, because when we wake up we don't have a single memory of our life and it will be up to us players to decide how to shape our new identity. We won't be alone, however, because our ~statistics~ will be by our side. Disco Elysium is an RPG, but if all you see when you hear these words is The Witcher or Dragon Age Origins, you're on the wrong track. Disco Elysium is an investigative game, a game of dialogues (whether internal or real) where violence is constant, but only as a consequence of an argument or as a failure of a dice roll (we'll get back to it shortly). What we will have to do, therefore, is to develop our statistics, or to define which mental and physical characteristics distinguish us, realizing very soon that it is not just a number in the background of a secondary menu. Let's explain: have you boosted your Logic, Empathy and your Authority? Very well, in the middle of a dialogue with a non-player character all your traits will insert themselves into the speech, they will give you suggestions, probably even conflicting ones, as if there are many people in your mind who are shouting over each other and trying to get out . Of course, the final choice is always up to you. Not everything is solely conditioned by the dialogues, in any case. Like any good role-playing game, there is a dice roll to pay the price and the chances of success depend both on the level of the associated statistic (also conditioned by the clothes you wear), and on a series of traits that you can learn during the game. adventure, which grant bonuses (and malus) for certain situations. The strength of Disco Elysium The Final Cut is obviously in the quality of the writing, which does not hold back from any topic, regardless of how awkward and complex it is to deal with. We will not only have to deal with drama and suffering, however: ZA/UM has in fact been able to mix the darker side of humanity with the more absurd and comical one, which will make you escape a few laughs. Is the second good? Disco Elysium The Final Cut As already mentioned, however, the quality of Disco Elysium is known and, if you want to delve even further into the matter, you can read our original review. Now, we're here to understand if the arrival on consoles (and more precisely on PS5) has done good or bad for Disco Elysium. First of all, you should know that The Final Cut is available as a free upgrade for all PC gamers who already own the game. No need to repurchase or even buy DLC. But what's new? Disco Elysium The Final Cut offers new characters, new missions, a new area, but also new clothes and new cutscenes. One of the most interesting novelties are the Political Vision Quests, these are four optional missions that are mutually exclusive: activating one means losing the others. They are not essential for understanding the main plot, but allow you to delve even further into the political history of the city and to meet the aforementioned new characters. The idea of the developers is to allow players to give vent to one of the political ideologies to which the character has affiliated during the adventure. We also remind you that, compared to the very first version (released at the end of 2019), The Final Cut also includes the mHardcore mode (released at the beginning of 2020) which makes the experience even more complex, increasing the bonuses but making the malus even more pressing. However, we have some bad news: the game has not been translated into Italian. If you don't have a good (or better yet very good) knowledge of English, forget it. At least the dubbing (always in English) comes in handy, which gives rhythm to the reading and makes it easier to approach the enormous amount of texts. Compared to the original version, there are many more lines of dialogue dubbed, including a narrator: however, the protagonist is still silent. The real value of dubbing, however, is its ability to characterize each character in an even more profound way. ZA/UM has played perfectly with accents, in particular, which allow you to experience the cultural and ethnic differences of the game world in a more direct way. However, we must report some bugs that, from time to time, eliminate dubbing within a dialogue: fortunately this is an occasional problem and only linked to single sentences and not entire discussions. Disco Elysium The Final Cut But let's talk about the technical side. Disco Elysium is a video game that, while almost aiming to be an interactive book, doesn't put aside the visual side: ZA/UM's work has a unique, divinely crafted graphic style; each area is always new, fresh and interesting to explore. Now, on PS5, we can do it at 4K and 60 FPS. You may have read on the net that the game has performance problems: however, we point out that the work has already been patched (version 1.1); the update has practically solved these problems. A drop in frames could still happen from time to time, but nothing that detracts from the overall experience. Now, let's talk about the elephant in the room: the control system. Before even saying a single word about it, let's stress right away that mouse and keyboard are always the best choice for these types of games and with Disco Elysium it is no different. How comfortable (or uncomfortable, if you prefer) is the interface in the console version? Not too much, in theory. The menu and non-environmental actions (such as using healing or zooming) are well assigned to the DualSense keys: Disco Elysium doesn't require too many buttons to be managed, so mapping the controls was not a daunting undertaking. The problem is the interaction with the game world. ZA/UM didn't go for the more straightforward solution of leaving the cursor in the game and assigning its movement to the right stick. This solution is after all a neutered version of the PC system and is slow and inaccurate to use. The developers have decided to allow the game, regardless of the position of the character, to switch from one element to another - among the various selectable screens (doors, NPCs, objects...) - by tilting the right stick in the right direction. Unfortunately, the system can be a bit awkward when there are many elements in a small area. Furthermore, even if the correct object is immediately identified, pressing the X key does not always start the interaction. Sometimes it is necessary to press several times before the action is registered and in some cases the character simply positions himself in the vicinity of the object (through a somewhat slow-reacting pathfinding), without however activating it. Fortunately, a patch has already been announced (1.2) which should solve all the problems indicated in this review: at the time of writing, however, it is not yet available so we cannot comment on the effectiveness of the expected fixes. The implementation of DualSense on PS5 is not a limitation but rather a lack. The controller has haptic feedback and adaptive triggers features, but they're hardly used (example, the triggers vibrate when you reach the zoom limit, but that's not a core feature in the experience). Nothing serious, but it certainly would have been interesting to see them implemented in a serious way.", "date": "2021-04-02", "grade": "9.0"}
