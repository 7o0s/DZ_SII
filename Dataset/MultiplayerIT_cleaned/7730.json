{"name": "Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/121073-leisure-suit-larry-reloaded-a-proposito-di-larry.html", "text": "Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards: Reloaded (this is the full title) was born on Kickstarter. Before deciding to launch the fundraising campaign, the good Al Lowe will probably have seen the success of Double Fine Adventure, now Broken Age, and will have convinced himself that even for the good Larry it was time to return to his glorious past after a few episodes that had wreaked havoc on the character in an apparently irreversible way. The proposal was clear: to make a remake of the first episode that resumed its visual style, while updating it, and the structure of the puzzles, albeit with a modern interface. There could be no misunderstandings on this point: Al Lowe wanted to bring Larry home at all costs, that is, to give him back his place in a comic adventure full of mind-bending puzzles and brilliant dialogues, with sex always in the background (and not only). At this point we need to ask ourselves what a lot of other people expected, given that having kept the promises made on Kickstarter seems to have been the major fault of a title that is receiving bad votes almost everywhere. Opening Metacritic we notice a strange split between the votes of the press, almost all very critical (with some exceptions) and those of gamers, some really enraptured by the work of Al Lowe. Who is right? Well, let's say that the judgment on the game largely depends on the perspective from which it is observed. It is useless to go around it: a modern gamer could find it literally horrendous. What are all those icons that make up the interface? Why does he have to select one to perform each action? Why are the puzzles so difficult and there are no such aids that will allow me to go forward without getting stuck somewhere? Can you even die in a graphic adventure? But hadn't death been abolished by law? And so on. If you are part of the ideal audience for Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded you will love the title, otherwise The white wild boar Thinking about it though, if you ask yourself all these questions while playing, it means that you are not part of the ideal audience Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded is aimed at, or people who wanted to relive an adventure that forced them to spend long minutes on a single problem , which put them in difficulty in every way and which presented an interface capable of being an enigma itself, which is what happened at the time when the first Larry appeared on the market. The new Larry is therefore the perfect game for its audience, formed by a niche we don't know how large of people, but still present, which however is forced to undergo the judgments of a press that usually addresses a very different audience; audience that moreover will ignore the game regardless (as was then expected). Those who wanted and waited for Reloaded wanted a fun and over the top screenplay, with funny descriptions of unlikely objects and situations and with dialogues full of puns and subtleties. He probably wanted a title that went beyond the boring traditional logic, certainly more accessible but in fact limiting, and that once again put creativity in front of commercial needs. They are the ones who paid to see the game made and who are now not being cut off by the canonical market precisely because the canonical market has effectively marginalized them for years. Talking bad about poor Larry would be as easy as drinking a glass of water, and he has some serious flaws when viewed from any perspective, such as the economic system based completely on chance (slot machines and other gambling games) which makes it tedious the accumulation of the sums necessary to purchase the objects we need to continue in the adventure, or the lack of some animation in points where the need would be felt. But for the rest we must not forget that we are dealing with a targeted product and that it must be judged as such. After all, it is as if we had to talk about a flight simulator or a management software: what matters is what the COD enthusiast would think while playing it, even if the masthead on which one writes may be aimed precisely at that model of public, or else one must sewing the review on fans of the genre, who in this case are also the patrons of the work? As you can see we are faced with a very complex issue starting from a product that is already well defined on its own. Who is reviewing the game was very small at the time of the release of the first original episode. He recovered it a few years later in a daring way, because Larry's fame shone at the time throughout the videogame world (made up mostly of a few magazines and a few enthusiasts). Today vi almost want to compare Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded with the prototype of the successful adventure: The Walking Dead, of which the 400 Days DLC has just been released. Here, for the time of a single video game, the good Larry made us forget that today for graphic adventure we mean a long film that allows only a few meager interactions on the part of the user, useful for slightly modifying its development, i.e. in which the role of the player, aware and accomplice, has become that of the spectator. Difficult, naive in some respects, buggy in others, but full of passion and desire to engage the adventurer in a world of non-trivial joints, Al Lowe's latest work does not allow for compromises. Don't like the action interface? Don't consider it. Don't like having to think about puzzles (puzzles aren't illogical, they're just very difficult, that's all)? Snub him. Don't you like the idea of a gameplay that takes up a past that you really don't care about? Lawful, but what are you doing here? If you were attracted by Larry's name it's because you remember the first titles in the series (the last ones are really bad) and this is a real character manual and how the adventures of the past were conceived. Honestly, it would have been too easy to crush it without trying to understand it, but once understood, it becomes impossible to consider it a failed product precisely because of the goals it set for itself.", "date": "2013-07-12", "grade": "7.5"}
