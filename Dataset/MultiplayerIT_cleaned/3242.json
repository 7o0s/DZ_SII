{"name": "Dreams", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dreams-recensione.html", "text": "After a long wait, here is the review of Dreams, the new Media Molecule project that comes out of its long beta perfected in every respect. But the new exclusive PlayStation is not the classic video game, it would be simplistic to treat it as such: Dreams is more a tool, a key, which provides us with access to a global creative laboratory that does not exist elsewhere. A courageous idea both for those who conceive and develop it, and for the fearless who have to subsidize it by believing in it to the end, just like Sony did with this original generator of dreams. Somnium After all, what are video games made of? Surely of machine language, of many ones and zeros, of human effort. Yet, despite the many elements at stake, the most important ingredient of all is the metaphysical one: as we are made mainly of water but our essence is the soul, that of the video game is, net of technicalities, the dream. Video games are made up of human dreams which, thanks to a digital cure, acquire colours, shapes and gameplay. Who do you want to be today? A spotless warrior or the most treacherous of pirates, a commander of a spaceship or a soldier at the front, a transport tycoon or a Japanese leader? Choose and you will be satisfied. Do you want to fly in the clouds like a superhero, be Spider-Man and fly around New York, visit places never seen through virtual reality? No problem my friend, there's definitely the right software for you, ready to fulfill your every wish, ready to make your every dream come true. Creative matter With Dreams, Media Molecule strips the video game of its shell to show us the dreamlike magma bubbling inside, and this is a stream made up of numerous filaments, each associated with different fields of art. Like cinema, more than cinema, the video game in fact encompasses every artistic form: the polygons are sculpted, the textures are a painting, the music is composed, the direct actors and the imagined and constructed gameplay. For this reason, while in LittleBigPlanet the video game is almost always the ultimate goal, of those who create and those who limit themselves to enjoying the creations of others, in Dreams it is only one of the possible results of the final computation. Here everyone is free to use all or part of this iridescent raw material made available, making it possible to give shape to ideas of all kinds, from the most complex video game to the most basic two-dimensional drawing, to then index each work so that interested parties can find it easily. You can pull Beethoven's head out of a polygon like a sculptor would out of marble, use a virtual canvas for an impromptu self-portrait, compose a piece of music or create a puppet of a tyrannosaurus, all through Dreams' powerful yet intuitive tools. Media Molecule has practically applied the concept of gamification to art, moreover by building an extraordinary free trade platform around it: each creation can be made available to other users so that it becomes part of the scenario of an art installation, as in the case of a particularly well done backdrop, or the protagonist of an all-round action, and the tyrannosaurus from before would be an excellent candidate. There is not even the risk of not being thanked: if a user's creation is used in someone else's work, Dreams will automatically insert his name/nick in the credits of the same. But the most interesting thing is being able to form a real development team, so that several people can work simultaneously on the same project, for example a particularly complex video game. After all, few know how to do everything, and given the potential of Dreams it is also permissible to aim high, to games with such dignity as not to disfigure for sale on the PlayStation Network (Let's not forget that To The Moon is made with RPG Maker!), but for to get this far it is necessary that there is a group with different specializations. Step by step As powerful as it is easy, this is the strong point of this latest work by Media Molecule. Dreams can't limit itself to being the classic and boring work environment, otherwise it wouldn't be different from the Unreal Engine or Unity, the classic engines used in the professional field. The strength of Dreams is having found an almost perfect point of contact between ease of use and complexity, and the credit goes to the attempt to simulate every creative impulse so that the execution is as similar as possible to the real one. The Dualshock, and more effectively the PlayStation Move, is thus transformed into a hammer and chisel, into virtual hands capable of giving shape to this sort of magical plasticine that exists only outsidebeyond the screen, but with the power of a digital environment that allows you to copy and paste mountains, rotate and resize them at will. The rest is entrusted to a myriad of menus that will manage the more advanced effects, all accompanied by a pop-up text that describes their function. Of course we won't be left entirely to ourselves: to teach us how to work with Dreams, Media Molecule has set up a series of very entertaining tutorials, perfected and enriched during the beta phase, where you learn by putting theory into practice right away, so all effects playing. However, we don't want to deceive you, finishing the tutorials is sometimes not enough: Dreams is easy, very easy, but not so much as to transform a motor hoe into Shigeru Miyamoto in just one week. Although intuitive and layered, so that their more complex functions are accessed only when necessary, the colorful menus of Dreams require some training to be exploited properly. Furthermore, some of these menus are simpler than others: transforming a parallelepiped into a skyscraper, building the classic house on the hill with the smoking chimney is surprisingly easy, but the same cannot be said of the logics that allow you to build the gameplay, functions which will require several steps on the tutorials themselves to be fully understood. Art's dream To provide us with a concrete idea of what can be done using Dreams, in this final version Media Molecule has added a small but very effective adventure lasting about three hours. The title of the work is Art's dream, a depressed musician who suddenly decides to leave the jazz band in which he has been playing for a lifetime. A perfect pretext for a surreal, existential journey between dream and reality, for an interactive experience that makes its way into many different genres: at times it will advance like a platformer, then like a point-and-click adventure that spares no time where the action is predominant. The Media Molecule touch can be seen in the graphic style, read in the entertaining lyrics, listen to the mammoth soundtrack and above all play, through dozens of inventions and reinventions. But be careful, Art's dream is absolutely not comparable to the main adventures included in the previous Media Molecule games: the Little Big Planets were in fact sold as a platformer with the editor included, at full price among other things, in this case it is Dreams itself the editor, while Art's Dream represents the classy option. Not that it lacks to play: everything that has been created by users in this first year spent in beta is still available to anyone who has a copy of Dreams. Use it however you want Currently there are hundreds of more or less complete games and of every imaginable genre, among them there are also multiplayer games, with global rankings and records to beat. Most of them are extremely simple, imperfect products, but among this inconclusive bedlam of clones and prototypes there are quite a few gems hidden, to tell the truth they are also quite numerous if we consider that Dreams has only officially come out now. Once again we must underline the fact that Dreams is not only this, and that consequently its use changes according to the moment: in this year spent in his company, we loaded Dreams as if we were opening the drawer of inks and colors, in full creative swing or to relax watching our creations come to life, but we also did it for a bit of healthy zapping which in the company of a few friends and a bottle has always proved to be extremely pleasant (jumping between an opera and other requires virtually no loading). We also gladly return to check the response to what we have published: there is nothing better than seeing a like or even a positive comment appear under one of our works. And then there are the contests organized by Media Molecule: every two weeks, users are presented with a precise theme to work on (at the moment it is ~Medieval Dream~, the previous one was ~Food~). Once a work has been entered in a contest, it can be voted on by other users until the winners are declared; note that it is possible to register any type of project, from a piece of music to an animated logo, the important thing is that it is in line with the proposed theme. Many, few, none Compared to the beta, in addition to the addition of Art's dream and other small challenges that will allow us to unlock new assets to use in our creations, the final version of Dreams brings with it softer graphics and new and more explanatory tutorials. Also added support for PlayStation Move et alDualshock without the use of motion sensors, for those who get confused in using the gyroscope inside the PlayStation pad. Of course using the Moves is totally different from using the pad, but the two different types of controllers are not mutually exclusive, so it is possible to keep them all accessible and close at hand in order to change them on the fly without having to enter a menu or pause. That's it, and it's not cheap at all. The problem, as already mentioned after our first contacts with Dreams, is that to convince users to do something truly amazing, therefore to take full advantage of what this software is capable of, it is necessary to offer them much more than a handful of likes. or a first place in a contest with no prizes. Why learn to use Dreams to get nothing concrete out of it, when with a little more effort you can learn to use an engine to put in your curriculum? Furthermore, with products like RPG Maker you can distribute your games, hoping to make money on them, while with Dreams this is not (yet) possible. Sure, no one makes it as fun to create as Dreams, but our fear is that the power of this software has exceeded and by as much as the average user is willing to do for nothing. Then it is true that a particularly brilliant work, an author who is constantly selected among the best, could still attract the attention of some software house, perhaps of Media Molecule itself as has already happened along the way during the development of Dreams itself, but it would be however one case among many, and for this same reason those many could become less and less, until they become few, very few, nobody.", "date": "2020-02-15", "grade": "8.5"}
