A further reason is actually the fact that PCM is the only presence within its market share, but that's another story. Also this year the game arrives by linking itself to the Tour de France, but above all by promising a series of updates compared to the 2009 version that justify the new expense: new modes, revised and corrected graphics and 65 official teams to guide through 500 stages, in addition to the possibility of expanding everything with the powerful editor available to create completely new teams and races, to be played single or via the Internet, where it is possible to face one's friends for up to 20 players - even via LAN. Between old and new The path of a successful series that arrives on the market from year to year is known to be full of dangers: you put too much innovation and you risk that the fans of the previous chapter don't like all the news; keep everything without revolutionizing any aspect and pass as a washing machine. Not to mention the managerial ones, whether they concern cycling, football or even curling, which are very often equipped with a large group of enthusiasts who are as active in contributing to the evolution of the game as they are merciless in crushing every possible misstep made by the developers . In a terrain that is certainly not easy to tread, Cyanide has carried out this new project with the necessary promises, identifiable above all in a new Season mode, through which to immerse yourself for an entire year at the helm of a team without however having to worry about the aspects purely managerial such as contracts, equipment and the like. It is also possible to configure the teams and races involved to your liking, proposing if you want what has been created also in multiplayer mode. Despite this addition, the main mode obviously remains the Career, in which to give free rein to all one's passion for cycling by taking care of every single aspect of one's team to lead it to victory; in this sense, the set of mechanics involved does not give great immediacy and those unfamiliar with the series, or menagerials in general, could have some difficulties, at least at the beginning. Long-time fans, on the other hand, will not find particular problems in immediately adapting to the game, which has remained practically intact in its framework as regards this mode. And here we return to what has been said above, given that in what should be the main part of Pro Cycling Manager 2010, at least as regards the single player, we are faced with the same 2009 game with a few additions. The part just described is obviously accompanied by the one dedicated to racing: the artificial intelligence of the runners has more or less remained at last year's levels, i.e. good but not excellent, just as the part reserved for one's own team appears to be improved, to which it is possible to give a whole series of commands on the strategy to be adopted, which however are not always implemented as one would expect. The interface with which to interact with your team can also be revised, not exactly user friendly as one might expect. For those wishing to launch themselves into the fantastic world of arcade racing, another special option is also available, in which to set aside the manager in us by placing ourselves directly on the saddle: nothing transcendental, given that everything only boils down to defining pedaling intensity and to carry out any overtaking, but it can still be useful to break from the most demanding career. But what a beautiful landscape! Part of the new features of Pro Cycling Manager 2010 also concerns the technical sector, thanks to a graphics engine redesigned by Cyanide to try to give more than a simple ~face-washing~ to the actual simulation part: the textures are actually cleaner than in the past, just as the contours of the roads that we find ourselves traveling are much more realistic and conditioned by the atmospheric agents, which obviously cover all the possible combinations that can be found in reality during a race. However, all of this has a downside, consisting of the fact that the graphics engine is really heavy and therefore needs to give the best of itself a decidedly powerful PC, even more than the test and recommended one, as well as decidedly more than the one reported in the minimum requirements: certainly have all those cyclists on screenit doesn't help, but the impression is that a little more could have been done on the road to optimization. There is practically nothing to say about the music, except that after a while you will prefer to listen to something else rather than the theme that is the soundtrack to the game, fortunately easily playable even in windowed mode with just a few clicks.", "date": "2010-07-07", "grade": "7.0"}
