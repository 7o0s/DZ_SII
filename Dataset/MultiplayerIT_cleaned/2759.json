Attempts so far, however, have not been exciting: King of Thieves has disappointed expectations, CATS: Crash Arena Turbo Stars also and Bullet Echo seemed to suggest a change of course for the studio with respect to the genre that had made it famous. But no: a few days ago their new original puzzle game, Evo Pop, landed on iOS and Android. Gameplay The gameplay of Evo Pop combines strategic mechanics in an interesting way in the Clash Royale style (see the energy of the action that recharges over time and allows you to make different moves, rather than creating new units) and the typical dynamics of puzzle games physics-based, assigning a fundamental role to weight, size and inertia within the games. In the game we can interact with a sort of cubic blob that can split in two, increase in size, project itself upwards and so on: actions that they perform using an energy that recharges over the seconds, each time dragging the effect from the box to the ~character~. To win, our Evos must reach 300 units, or that the opposing Evos have all been eliminated. As part of a campaign that currently has fourteen different scenarios (but more will come with the inevitable updates), we will in fact be asked to face other Evos, slowly moving within the setting as our small army increases in size. number and size, the latter being essential for an Evo to devour another once contact has been established. The most original but also the most problematic part of the new Zeptolab title lies in the fact of not being able to intervene directly to move the Evo, which often ends up slowing down the maneuvers during the action. Resorting to leaps and other moves could also give rise to reactions contrary to those we hoped for, thus lengthening the times and creating a bit of frustration. Fortunately, the experience is enlivened by a rich achievement system, which often points to the purchase of a Season Pass that would help us grow faster, and the ability to select and upgrade different Evos, each equipped with abilities peculiarities that can really revolutionize our approach to the action. The progression is not very fast and actually the microtransactions make sense, since they allow us to accelerate it and obtain the rewards necessary for the development of the roster more quickly, but playing for free is absolutely possible and there aren't even boring ads to watch, as long as you wait for the ~tokens~ that are consumed with each mission to recharge. Technical realization The Evo Pop system, fairly original despite some undoubtedly derivative elements, is accompanied by a well-made technical sector, which focuses above all on colors to characterize scenarios and characters. The graphic style is practically a low poly with some nice touches, see for example the eyes of the Evos that move from side to side in some moments. On the front of the music and effects, however, once again the opportunity to give inspiration and personality to the game, limiting this aspect of the experience to a mere accompaniment without infamy or praise, which does not disturb but does not even remain in the lead when the application is closed.", "date": "2020-12-02", "grade": "7.0"}
