And so, after the hasty Vietnam War flashback of Hours of Darkness and the absurd space travel of A Spasso su Marte, the developers deliver us a new spin-off starring, so to speak, aspiring director Guy Marvel , also among the supporting characters of the base game campaign. In reality, the package is structured as a series of self-contained episodes, in Left 4 Dead style, which complete quite quickly and each tell a different subject that the good Marvel tries to propose to the producer on duty ... almost always receiving a clear refusal . The expansion's seven mini-campaigns open with a comic-style introduction, this time more apt than previously seen, and after the words ~imagine that...~ the experience leaves room for action. Ready to face the zombies? Missions When Guy Marvel begins to tell his screenplays, we find ourselves in the shoes of different characters, who are introduced quickly and often follow intentionally stereotyped situations, which draw from the cinematic imagination of horror b-movies. In the Killer Climate campaign, for example, we play as a ranger exploring the mountainous terrain in search of survivors in the midst of a zombie invasion, battling not only the ~normal~ undead but also transformed moose, bear, wolves and wolverines. into horrifying (and pretty tough) creatures. Undying Love instead reworks the story of Romeo and Juliet, with the first being transformed into an undead and the second who, taking up arms, decides despite everything to go and save him from the members of the gang who kidnapped him, making his way between flocks of enemies. The Fast and the Fiendish mentions ~Fast and Furious~ on one side, ~Crank~ on the other: the protagonist has been bitten and must quickly run to his laboratory to create a serum that can cure him, proceeding first on foot and then on board of a vehicle, complete with a timer to mark the time it has left to live. Escape from the Rooftop instead refers to Dying Light, staging a series of fights that take place on the roofs, albeit in a somewhat too hasty way. Guy Marvel's coarse commentary represents a significant extra, although in some cases it falls excessively into the vulgar, while the gunplay is what Far Cry 5 has accustomed us to: immediate, consistent and multifaceted thanks to the wide arsenal available. Structure and gameplay Duration is certainly not the strong point of Damned Luridi Zombi, as indeed had happened with the aforementioned Hours of Darkness and, albeit to a lesser extent, A Spasso su Marte. In this case, however, the guessed ingredient of the undead (which add flavor wherever you put them, they are now a bit like parsley) and the one-shot, frantic and spectacular nature of the seven mini-campaigns helps to have fun and tackle the missions in an engaging way. We were about to write ~carefree~, but in reality the choice of permanent death adds a lot of spice to the gameplay: if you were to run into game over, you will have to start the mission over. At the intermediate level of difficulty, in truth, this post does not constitute who knows what problem, given that the challenge becomes intense only in the final parts of each episode, when the enemies become really numerous and virtually infinite, so you have to move quickly and try to destroy the devices responsible for the zombie invasion; but raising the difficulty, for example in the Score Attack mode, things can get more complicated. An excellent starting point for playing this DLC in online cooperative with a friend, moreover the only way to access multiplayer: the developers have not deemed it necessary to insert matchmaking, therefore you can only face the experience together by invitation. Playstation 4 trophies There are only seven Trophies contained in the DLC Damned Luridi Zombi: to obtain them you need to complete the seven missions of the package, eliminate some bosses and a certain number of enemies belonging to different categories. Graphics and sensations Also in the case of Damned Luridi Zombi the scenario does not belong to the Far Cry 5 campaign, on the contrary we are talking about seven different settings. Not huge, of course, but coherent in terms of design and capable of not appearing generic, although some missions are more inspired than others. The way in which the narration of Guy Marvel and of his eventual interlocutor dynamically change what we see on the screen is nice: for example in a story the two argue about whetherbe it day or night, and so as you move around the background is changed accordingly. The presence of enemies belonging to different classes also deserves a positive note: in addition to the basic ones, there are variants that launch explosive projectiles, or other armored vehicles that charge the target. Of course, there are also many missed opportunities, but in general from a technical point of view a good job has been done, zombies behave like zombies (so don't expect who knows what artificial intelligence, consistently with the wild nature of these pathetic creatures) and there are some spectacular situations, but above all we have tried to focus strongly on variety. The action is accompanied by a synthetic soundtrack that is well suited to the cinematic atmospheres of the seven campaigns, as well as by the voices of Marvel and the various producers to whom it tries to sell its scripts. Will the aspiring director be so skilled as to be able to sell even the DLC in which he is the protagonist? In our opinion yes: while not shining in terms of content, the package is fun and fairly replayable.", "date": "2018-09-05", "grade": null}
