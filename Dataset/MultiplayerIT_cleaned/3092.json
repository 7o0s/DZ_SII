{"name": "Halo 2: Anniversary", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/halo-2-anniversary-recensione.html", "text": "Writing the review of a remastered like Halo 2: Anniversary always brings a little nostalgia, because the first thing you are forced to notice is the time that has passed since the launch of the original. Halo 2 was released way back in 2004, a fateful year for the world of video games and in particular for the FPS genre, due to the releases of still highly celebrated titles such as Half-Life 2 and the first Far Cry. A few years earlier Bungie, with Halo: Combat Evolved, had finally managed to make first-person shooters on consoles playable in a dignified way and had created the most iconic franchise of the newborn Xbox, a machine that desperately needed products that would make it recognizable and provided her with an identity. Halo 2 therefore had the ambitious goal of not only consolidating the success of the first Halo, but of transforming that hugely successful experience into a real franchise. If we want, this is where the mythology of the series was born from, the one that was then expanded with the subsequent chapters and spin-offs. Halo 2 was hailed as a masterpiece by the press and the public, managing to sell nearly nine million copies (at the time a huge amount) in its entire life cycle. It was also the title that established multiplayer on consoles and allowed to overcome the distrust of many Japanese manufacturers. Even with the joypads it was possible to have a more than satisfactory online experience. Of course, the remastered version has completely lost this very strong innovative charge, almost revolutionary in its own way, but that doesn't mean Halo 2 can't represent an excellent experience even today. History Halo 2: Anniversary is the third Halo to launch in Halo: The Master Chief Collection for PC (it's been available for Xbox One for a while now). It comes after Halo: Reach and Halo: Combat Evolved because Microsoft has decided to follow the narrative chronology of the series and not the actual release chronology of the various titles. Halo 2 begins immediately after the end of the first episode, with Commander Thel' Vadamee, leader of the Particular Justice fleet, transformed into an Arbiter by the Covenant council for his failure to Combat Evolved. His destiny is to die in battle defending the cause of his people. On the other side of the fence, the Master Chief is celebrated on the Cairo station as a liberating hero. From this simple premise a story is born that leads the player to follow the deeds of both characters, in a breathtaking succession of missions, up to the grand finale... which of course we won't tell you about. The PC port Halo 2: Anniversary is not the first time Halo 2 on PC. Fortunately we are faced with a completely different product than the one launched in 2007 for Windows Vista, which was not exactly of the highest quality and had many unsolved problems. The logical choice for 343 Industries was to build on the work already done on the 2014 Xbox One version, featured in the Halo: The Master Chief Collection, offering the same graphical overhaul and the same content. In that sense Halo 2: Anniversary doesn't impress, because it is in all respects what it was expected to be: a faithful port. Being an Xbox game, the remastering work was much deeper than that done for the chapters released on Xbox 360, including completely redone textures, refined models, a hugely improved lighting system and various other changes that will make fans happy of numbers, such as support for 4K, 60fps or the ability to switch in real time from the remastered graphics to the original one with the press of a button. Gameplay Speaking of the game itself, it is clear that Halo 2: Anniversary carries some limitations due to its no longer very young age. Multiplayer, although revolutionary in 2004 as mentioned, is much less shocking today and shows some problems largely overcome by the subsequent chapters, such as hitboxes that are not very precise and a very ethical and competitive way of conceiving online that very few people are interested in by now . Having said that, the single player campaign remains more than enjoyable and, indeed, superior to a lot of modern stuff in terms of storytelling and story conduction. At the time, someone complained about its brevity and a certain confusion in the plot, but these are now limits exceeded, both for the way it is sold (it is included in a collection with dozens of other contents), and because we already know how certain situations will develop. Changing the subject, playing we could not help but notice the excellent artificial intelligence of the enemies, a positive fact, but which left us with a lot of bitterness in the mouth, because it showed us in a plastic wayico how little the world of video games has evolved in this field. Evidently there are difficulties in overcoming certain models, otherwise it is not explained. In any case, this is not the right place to think about the matter. In conclusion, Halo 2: Anniversary is an excellent title, essential for those who want to replay the entire series in the Halo: The Master Chief Collection, also because it represents a fundamental piece of the franchise's narrative universe. By purchasing it on PC you will take home the full-featured version, but don't expect it to differ too much from the Xbox One version, because that is the game.", "date": "2020-05-16", "grade": "9.0"}
