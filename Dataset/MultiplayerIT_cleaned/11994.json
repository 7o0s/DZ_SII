{"name": "The Bourne Ultimatum", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-bourne-ultimatum_a.html", "text": "~The Bourne Identity~, the first film in the trilogy based on Robert Ludlum's books, started a little quietly and did not enjoy shocking success, despite the solidity of the plot and the presence of an established performer like Matt Damon. However, the producers of the film decided to make a sequel (which received a greater response from the public, while remaining artistically a cut below the first episode) and now a third and final chapter is on its way, with the burden of closing the circle in the best way. Coinciding with the release of the film, indeed ahead of its time as far as Italy is concerned, here comes the first videogame transposition of ~The Bourne Ultimatum~, developed for mobile phones by Vivendi Games Mobile. In the game we impersonate Jason Bourne, of course, and we have the task of eliminating all the enemies that we will find in the many levels that follow one after the other, set in some major world cities (New York, London, Moscow, etc.). The mechanics behind The Bourne Ultimatum is clear from the start: it is simply a matter of proceeding through each stage, eliminating opponents as they come towards us until we reach the end. To fight we can resort to martial arts (pressing FIRE or the 5 key of the numeric pad) or using a weapon picked up along the way (which is automatically activated if the enemy is far away, like in Final Fight...), in a sequence which is slavishly repeated without any variation whatsoever. Very slight changes to the gameplay occur in the short sections on the bike, or when the stages involve opening doors to move us on the two levels of a building, but it's really too little not to silence this title of repetitiveness. At the beginning of each stage, Jason explains how his research is continuing and what is the new goal to achieve, but it is purely a ploy to make us believe that the action is not as simple and linear as it really is. On a technical level, The Bourne Ultimatum remains on a discreet level. The main sprite boasts a sufficient number of animations, and the same are on average fluid and well done. Due to the type of shot and the fundamental mechanics, it is possible to compare this title to the exceptional Cyberpunk: The Arasaka's Plot, and it is a merciless comparison from every point of view: Cyberpunk manages to reach the level of some console video games, while The Bourne Ultimatum looks like your typical mobile game, developed without much effort. The control system, in its simplicity, has the merit of responding promptly to inputs and therefore of not transforming the gaming experience, albeit repetitive and flat, into real torture. Finally, the sound sector does not shine for the quality of the music and lack of effects.
