{"name": "Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dragon-ball-z-budokai-tenkaichi.html", "text": "After a few experimental titles, Bandai has been focusing on Dragon Ball for some years now, supported by respectable sales figures. On PlayStation 2, with the Budokai series, the software division of the Japanese toy giant has succeeded in creating a good quality fighting game, which reproduces the spirit of the anime in an exceptional way. And beyond. Because, let's face it, the Dragon Ball manga, in its static nature, manages to be much more spectacular than the very slow animated series it takes, with the latter only saving itself in the last stages and in some feature films. After this necessary premise, let's see what the developers of the Spike team have done with Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi ... Revolution! Never change a winning team. Or not? Instead of making a Budokai 4, obviously putting more characters, more moves, new modes and improved gameplay, Bandai has decided to revolutionize its product. Via Dimps, who had also done a slap-up job, DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi was entrusted to the Spike team, which modified the project from the ground up. In fact, the only thing that Budokai Tenkaichi has in common with Budokai 3 is the graphics of the characters, which however have been enriched by a deterioration system that profoundly changes their appearance if they take many hits. Even the animated intro is different, abandoning the cartoons in favor of (supposedly) equally spectacular real-time graphics. The game modes are also, for the most part, new: Portal Z, Supreme Battle, World Tournament, Duel, Practice and Evolution Z. The Portal Z represents the main mode, as it allows us to ~relive the memories of the dragon Shenron~, or to participate in all (and I mean all) the battles that have seen protagonists Goku and his companions in the Z and GT series, as well as in feature films. Each saga differs from the others and can be completed in a superficial or in-depth way, engaging in fights that also concern minor characters. Everything is divided into stages, in each of which we will take control of a different character (depending on the story) and we will have to try to defeat the enemy as required by the game to access bonuses that will be usable in Evolution Z mode (completely similar to the ~shop~ in Budokai 3). It is not possible to use transformations, you have to choose the various versions of the characters. The breadth of internships creates a whole host of new possibilities... ...Like, for example, ending up under water. The minor modalities The Battle Supreme sees us choose one of the available characters and fight against the others in order of ability, starting from the bottom with Mister Satan, to place us in first place overall. And it's a question of having one hundred encounters, because Budokai Tenkaichi provides as many as one hundred characters (including the various versions of each one), each with their own peculiar moves: perhaps this is a record. Every now and then the monotony is broken by someone's interference (the first time I had to fight the killer Taobaibai, who I didn't even know was among the available characters) or by a challenge launched from higher positions, whose victory obviously worth a ~leap forward~ in the ranking. The World Tournament (which at this point could also have been called by its real name, i.e. ~Tenkaichi Tournament~) has not changed in structure compared to Budokai 3: it starts at the ~beginner~ level, i.e. with few participants, to increase from time to time the number of wrestlers involved, and consequently the difficulty. The Duel and Practice modes respectively allow us to challenge a friend or the game's AI, and to learn how the control system works. After taking blows from every possible angle without even realizing what is happening around us, we will willingly take a break in the Practice mode, even if the explanations provided by our personal trainer (Piccolo, in this case) are not always clear and they need more than a ~field~ study. Finally, the Z Evolution mode allows us to customize the characters by providing them with the bonuses earned in the other modes. If in Budokai 3 these bonuses were represented by special moves as well as power-ups, in Budokai Tenkaichi we are limited to power-ups, for an extremely simple reason: there are too few special moves for their prerogative to be optional... The quality of the graphics is undoubted, especially in some situations. The game recreates a huge amount of situations seen in DBZ, DBGT and movies. Lucifer is just one of the characters from the Dragon feature filmsBall Z Involution! As mentioned at the beginning, Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi is certainly not the son of Budokai 3. It is a completely different game, something more like a particular action game than a fighting game. Just engage in any fight to realize it starting from the view from behind the character, which is positioned sideways only when the enemy ~engages~. Otherwise, our alter ego is free to wander around the locations and destroy all the interactive elements (and there are many) present in the stages. You can move in any direction (therefore also fly freely) by combining the left analog stick with the right shoulder buttons of the Dual Shock 2, and you can fast forward with the X button. In fights this translates into a dash (further upgradable if you presses the L2 key) which can take the enemy by surprise and allow us to hit him with a combo. Speaking of combos, forget those of Budokai 3: in Budokai Tenkaichi it is no longer possible to deliver kicks and punches separately, because the attack is carried out by pressing a single key in addition to that of the spiritual attack. It is possible to parry the attacks by pressing the Circle key, and use the same key at the right time to perform a flash-dodge (erroneously called ~teleportation~), or to open a gap in our opponent's combo. There are no more than five or six special moves per character, from which however at least two must be removed for manifest uselessness (those obtainable by combining the L2 key and the Circle key). The others are obtained with the same key combination for all characters. The developers thought that this kind of approach was needed to fully capture the spirit of Dragon Ball, and as far as dogfights are concerned they were certainly right, but the end result is much less spectacular than what we saw in Budokai 3. And some problems afflict gameplay in general: the collisions are not perfect, the response to the commands either (where timeliness would be fundamental) and the management of the view is sometimes problematic to say the least. The only control we have over it is the possibility of ~centering~ it, but unfortunately it is not possible to do it while undergoing an attack (even when the attack is not even understood where it comes from, thanks to the conformation of some stages), and not even when the character is down! In short, in some cases the game becomes really frustrating and its merits are sunk by the presence of problems of no small importance in terms of concept and programming. To these problems it is perhaps not appropriate to add the lack of transformations during the game, since it is a precise choice, which fits perfectly with the spirit of the Portal Z mode. It is another spectacle that is missing, however. Unfortunately, there are few special moves and they are performed in the same way for everyone. The same goes for the combos, given the presence of only one type of physical attack. In Portal Z mode, we will relive all the battles of Goku and his companions. Makankosappoooooo! All Dragon Ball fans will be pleased to know that Budokai Tenkaichi has been translated into Italian as regards the screen texts (with some oversights from time to time, actually: the ~Taiyoken~ which becomes the ~Kaiohken~ above all) and that it is possible to select the spoken Japanese instead of the horrendous English version to which the Budokai series had so far accustomed us. Finally. Technical realization Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi boasts high quality graphics, managed by an engine that very rarely suffers from the considerable amount of polygons on the screen. The characters are practically the same as in Budokai 3 in construction, and perhaps a little less care is noticeable in the new ones. As anticipated, their appearance is modified according to the hits suffered, not in a particularly sophisticated way (you pass from one condition to another) but still appreciable. The animations are of a good standard and it could hardly have been done better in this regard, given the spirit of the game (far from realistic). The settings are numerous and boast a respectable breadth, it is no coincidence that the ~exploratory~ element (provided the opponent leaves us alone) was one of the things that Spike wanted to include in the product. There are a lot of interactive elements, which can be destroyed with the various energy waves, and the textures are of decent quality. The soundtrack of Budokai Tenkaichi has unfortunately been reworked for the PAL version, therefore the music taken from the cartoon has mysteriously disappeared in place of fairly well-made but anonymous compositions. Speech is of good quality, as is gthe sound effects. As usual, in the Tenkaichi Tournament you lose by KO or Ring-Out. Each special move is preceded by a short animation. Being thrown against a mountain and tearing it to pieces happens quite often in DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi", "date": "2005-11-10", "grade": "7.4"}
