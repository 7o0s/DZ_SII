A towering Viking or a refined samurai? A Spartan soldier or a crusader? Using a cartoonish style, World of Warriors takes all these historical figures and places them in an RPG context made up of turn-based combat, special moves and simple strategy, revisiting a formula that Pokmon fans know very well and which has guaranteed for years the extraordinary success of the Game Freak series. In fact, the point is not the action itself, but rather the search for the best possible character, a rare and powerful warrior, who can make our team take the leap in quality and guarantee victories after victories, proceeding quickly within a single player campaign made up of main stages, secondary battles but also impromptu challenges, such as those that take place in the deadly black tower or in tournaments. As often happens with freemium productions, in the early stages it is the game that holds our hand, trying to familiarize us with the interface and controls, both quite simple and intuitive, and unlocking new features very gradually. The same temple where it is possible to summon new warriors is not immediately available, and to use it it is necessary to use hard currency (guaranteeing the extraction of a rare warrior) or the ~secondary~ one, which however often translates into obtaining objects more than characters; objects that, however, we will hardly be able to use, where you have a set of basic level soldiers. World of Warriors starts from a well-tested formula, but pushes a little too much on monetization A world of mercenaries Once you select a ~mission~ on the map, World of Warriors battles take place according to a rather simple structure, in which you attack in turn but you can change your team member at any time to take advantage of specific skills, in the first place those related to the very nature of the character. There is in fact an important reference to the four elements (fire, water, earth and air), each characterized by a different color, which regulates the dynamics of combat. If a water warrior attacks a fire warrior, he will be able to inflict additional damage on him and, therefore, complete the challenge more easily. Conversely, a warrior of the air will have to be careful not to openly face a warrior of the earth, and so on. These rules add a bit of strategy to duels that would otherwise have been decided simply by the level of experience of the individual characters, although there is an action component that leverages the timing and rapid pressing of the screen to execute the basic moves and of the special ones, which can therefore inflict more or less damage depending on the quality of the execution. However, a few games are enough, however limited in playing time by the now inevitable ~action points~ (which are recharged by one unit every ten minutes), to realize how the developers have overplayed their hand a bit as regards monetization, forcing us to repeat the missions to carry out the grinding necessary to access the training and improve the characteristics of each warrior, even there provided you wait a few minutes. This approach inevitably ends up clipping the wings of an otherwise really appetizing experience, with all the numbers to do very well on the App Store, starting with the aforementioned cartoonish graphic style, not very refined but pleasant, to continue with the precision of a system intuitive and reliable touch control.", "date": "2014-11-15", "grade": "7.5"}
