{"name": "The Dark Pictures: Man of Medan", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-dark-pictures-man-of-medan-recensione.html", "text": "Man of Medan whose review you read is the new horror experience from Supermassive Games, the development studio already known for making Until Dawn. The British team has put together a new experience based on narrative crossroads, frequent jump scare and numerous epilogues in which the fate of the characters involved is revealed with variable results. The work is placed in the broader context of the Dark Pictures Anthology, of which this adventure represents the first piece. However, this should not mislead: unlike what happens in other contexts, this time we are not dealing with the first episode of a story divided into installments, but rather with a self-conclusive adventure, which will be combined with future chapters only and exclusively as regards the approach to the sources of inspiration and the interactive structure. To put together Man of Medan, the developers have in fact drawn liberally from a broad background of folk stories and urban legends, which are the basis of this and the other seven titles planned for the future. Story: a horror holiday After the short prologue, set in the late 1940s from the perspective of two young soldiers, the story of Man of Medan quickly moves to the present time, where five boys are preparing to spend an exciting holiday north of French Polynesia. An experience entirely based on boat excursions and scuba diving, in the fervent search for wrecks not yet identified by the local authorities. In the cast we find Shawn Ashmore (already known to video game enthusiasts for his role in Quantum Break) in the guise of the breezy Conrad, while Arielle Palik has been entrusted with the role of Julia. The other protagonists of the story are Alex (Kareem Tristan Alleyne) and Brad (Chris Sandiford), two diametrically different brothers both in physical prowess and in character. And then there's Fliss (played by Ayisha Issa), the skipper of the agile Duke of Milan, in charge of accompanying the wealthy group on its first outing at sea. Against the background of the events stands the figure of the Curator, played by the English actor Pip Torrens. The man essentially acts as a guide and narrator and will also reappear in all future stories belonging to the Dark Pictures Anthology. This singular character intervenes several times during the adventure, limiting himself to commenting on the progress of the game and sometimes dispensing general advice on how it would be preferable to proceed with subsequent decisions. The events narrated in the game take place mainly aboard the SS Medan, a warship dating back to the Second World War, mysteriously remained docked in the middle of the Pacific without apparently hosting any survivors on board. For the occasion, Supermassive has tried to reproduce the distinctive characteristics of the vessel down to the smallest detail, characterized by the presence of many corridors, narrow cabins and a few more extensive common areas. The intention of immersing the user in a claustrophobic context is evident, in which it is difficult to think of being able to escape the threat looming in that forgotten place. While finding the idea interesting, we find that the choice to place the player in an environment of such limited proportions has in part undermined the unpredictability of the situations that take shape during the narrative progression. The spaces of the ghost ship all end up looking alike, helping to significantly reduce the field of vision and sometimes to nullify the variety of the proposed jump scares. Playstation 4 trophies The Man of Medan Trophies are 31 overall, mostly hidden as they are linked to the development of the plot. Some objectives are related to the collection of secrets and the completion of the story also shared with other players, others plan to save or vice versa sacrifice all the protagonists of the story. Gameplay: dialogues, alternative paths, cooperative mode At the basis of the gameplay of Man of Medan there are the dialogues entertained by the characters and the different answers given by the player can lead the events towards diametrically different outcomes. Each conversation gives access to two opposing alternatives, flanked by a third option which is to remain silent. By accessing the game menu you can keep track of the relationship between the adventure companions, which will vary precisely in relation to the decisions made and the attitude maintained during conversations. To always have an overview of the most important decisions, it is also possible to access the Moral Compass, where a trace is kept of the events from which theyear tangible consequences. As you may have already guessed, in Man of Medan the interaction has been deliberately reduced to the essentials, essentially based on the observation of single objects, the opening of doors, as well as the presence of sporadic quick time events in which you have to press buttons with due timing in the most agitated phases. As with Until Dawn, neither puzzles nor puzzles have been introduced to solve to access new areas or recover fundamental objects. During the exploration, one also comes across the Premonitions, particular paintings which, once observed, give access to a rapid vision of the future, suggesting what could happen to a certain character shortly thereafter. Through these clues it is therefore possible to receive suggestions which, if interpreted in the right way, allow you to better evaluate the choices to be made. In some phases the mini game called ~Keep calm~ is activated, in which we are asked to press a button going in rhythm with the heartbeat of the character, represented on the screen in the form of an electrocardiogram. Man of Medan has a longevity in the order of about five hours of play, but regardless of the very limited duration of the story, what has not fully convinced us is above all the lack of changes of pace and sufficiently captivating situations that can stimulate the player to make a new game to discover the alternative routes. Moreover, although the variants included by the developers are very numerous, it also appears evident that some of them ultimately have limited scope and relevance in the overall economy of the story. However, the single-player experience is only one of the possible approaches to the game, because in reality Man of Medan can also be freely enjoyed in the company of other people. By selecting the Movie Night mode, you can experience the story in the company of friends and family, while remaining comfortably seated in your living room. In this case, all you have to do is enter the number of participants - from a minimum of two up to a maximum of five - and then assign one or more protagonists to each of them. At that point, the name of the player in charge of picking up the pad and making his choices will be indicated on the screen. A further alternative is given to us by the online cooperative, with which it is possible to enjoy the story together with a friend connected to the network. To access this mode it is essential to invite a user on your friends list and necessarily in possession of a copy of the game, since a tool similar to the Buddy Pass of A Way Out has not been provided. In both experiences, the situations experienced by the players they will be identical to those proposed by the single player, however by accessing the online co-op the peculiarity is given by the impossibility of concretely knowing the choices made by the other participant. On a technical level, Man of Medan was created using the Unreal Engine 4 and has predictably placed an emphasis on the expressiveness of the faces. During our game we encountered some drops in fluidity in the cutscenes and some sporadic delay in loading some textures. The quality of the dubbing in Italian is normal.", "date": "2019-08-28", "grade": "7.0"}
