The acclaimed house, mother of that jewel of the series that is Borderlands, tries to launch itself into the crowded terrain of MOBAs. He does it in his own way, with his charisma and his colorful design full of irony. It also tries to add something and even apply the concept of game progression typical of the genre to a sort of single player and co-op campaign. Let's find out together if the experiment has borne the desired results! Battleborn is an interesting experiment, not without some problems Last star to the right and straight on until morning It goes without saying that the narrative premise of the title is the least original it is possible to see in the panorama of the entire global entertainment industry. We will limit ourselves to those very few elements that form the basis of the title. Darkness has taken control of almost all of the boundless space. A single star still shines in the firmament. And that's what the so-called Battleborn fight for. A series of characters, each with their own peculiarities, who tirelessly seek to restore peace and harmony. The plot is told through a prologue and eight subsequent chapters, corresponding to as many missions. It is clear that it is obviously a beautiful and good pretext to kick off the skirmishes, but we are still talking about sequences designed and created like a real animated series. These are of fine workmanship and seasoned with the classic lines and notes of color typical of Gearbox. We are talking about a style obviously not far from what this developer has already given us but, at the same time, we note the care taken by the authors in the characterization of twenty-five characters. Both when it comes to everyone's story - unlockable upon completing a series of challenges - and for the desire and talent in always making everything, even critical situations, something absolutely hilarious. How do you re-make a MOBA Since the time of the announcement, it has been clear that Gearbox wanted to take the MOBA style and transfer it to their reference genre: the first person shooter. The difficulty of such an operation lies in the impossibility of having a view of the map from above and in having to manage firefights which, however frenetic, cannot in any way be resolved after two simple well-aimed shots. The balance of the experience, from this point of view, is both very successful and creaky. We realize the contradiction; but it is the pure reality of the facts. The game lives on two souls, the PvE one, very fun, with a degree of challenge that makes your head spin at the highest difficulty levels, but afflicted by a series of decidedly questionable design choices; and the PvP one, focused on the most unbridled competitiveness but with (only) three different modes and a series of balancing problems between the various heroes. As for the campaign, this can be tackled both in private match and in matchmaking. Everything as expected, until you realize that by starting the mission in a private game, the game forgets to balance the experience on the number of players in the lobby. Instead, no matter how many Battleborns there are, the code will spew hundreds of mobs at you for you to knock out with whatever-the-gap-it-is-you-shoot. It's great to find yourself with your friends playing on the same team and, at the same time, it's disheartening to realize that having fewer than two or three teammates will mean being forced to choose a more affordable level of difficulty, on pain of certain death. Obviously this can be remedied by starting alone, or together with some other friends, in a public game served by matchmaking. The netcode in this case works perfectly, except that, due to the impossibility of choosing from the main menu which mission you want to take part in, you end up playing the same chapter several times in a row. Or losing players even before the game begins, perhaps eager to play the last mission, but forced to take part in another instead. All this, considering the rather high average duration of the assignments, makes frustration an element always around the corner. Tasks that, apart from very rare cases, turn into a simple horde mode that requires you to kill waves and protect various elements of the map. There are no checkpoints, and seeing your objective to be defended destroyed after more than half an hour makes everything even less manageable, especially if you are not in a team made up of friends. Winning team, change mappa As for the competitive section, as mentioned we are from the parts of the classic MOBA, with the necessary attempts to differentiate ourselves. The three modes: Capture, Incursion and Fusion, are the most different one could ask for. The first, as the name implies, requires you to control a variable number from one to three zones which, upon conquest, begin to generate a series of points: the first team to reach 1000 wins. This is, strictly speaking, the least MOBA mode within the game, more like a classic shooter. You capture zones, make sure you have as many as possible to rack up more points, and battle other players to prevent them from claiming map objectives. Incursion, on the other hand, represents the one most similar to the reference genre. The two teams are in possession of two different mechs. Each must advance on the map towards the opposing zone, making sure to destroy the two objectives before the other. For those accustomed to the various League of Legends or to the more recent Heroes of the Storm, the map obviously features a series of ~minions~ (mobs of different types that advance, useful for the accumulation of experience by those who kill them for level up with your alter ego). The last mode, Fusion, represents a middle ground between the two types, also proving to be the freshest and most original. In this case the minions become the protagonists of the game and it will be important to protect those of our faction. If normally we would leave them to their bitter fate, here we will escort them to their destination. This is because they will be the ones to sacrifice themselves inside a sort of mech-eating mouth that will allow us to accumulate points and thus reach the fusion from which the mode takes its name. All the good things present, is based on the concept of leveling in the game. Every single mission or competitive match you go through will see your character starting at level one. At each advancement (ten in total) it will be possible to choose between two different upgrades. These will act on their skills in an active or passive way until the end of the game itself. These will be speed boosts, recharges, increases in the shield or in the treatments carried out and so on and so forth. Since each of the twenty-five selectable battleborn has one or two fire modes, plus two abilities that can be activated right from the start of the game, with an additional one that you will only see unlocked at level five, it is clear how the choices in terms of build also make the same character more useful in one situation or another. The certainly important thing is to always create complete teams in terms of classes. Solitary work is the least paying in Battleborn, as it is in all other team-based competitive games. The last element is the ability to create customized sets of equipment, which must be purchased in the game - each with its own specific cost in shards - to further boost certain stats. These are recovered as rewards at the end of the sessions, or in special boxes during the campaign and, in classic Gearbox style, are of different colors based on rarity and power, and consequently on cost. It's a world full of colors From a technical point of view, the game is a feast for the eyes. Not so much for the specific graphic detail, but for the incredible ability of Gearbox to carry its cartoonish and crazy style in any of its products. The game is vastly different from Borderlands in character design, but is still very diverse and each of the twenty-five battleborn oozes energy and character from every pixel. It will be impossible not to fall in love with the poses, the wonderful animations or the lines of dialogue written for each of them and more than worthily localized in the language of the Bel Paese. It must be said that the maps are all a bit too similar, especially those that make up the campaign, but it is true that we are talking about a game that focuses on the characterization of the characters and on the desire to differentiate them and make them all attractive and visually appealing. And in this, the Gearbox artists have fully hit the target.", "date": "2016-05-06", "grade": "7.8"}
