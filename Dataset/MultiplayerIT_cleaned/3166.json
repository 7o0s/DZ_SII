There's also no need to overload him with adjectives and with the emotions of your first times wearing a virtual reality viewer, it's an experience so well done that he knows how to stand very well on his solid legs. A necessary premise, before venturing into the Half-Life: Alyx review, to better understand how Valve won its bet which is not, as we hear repeated around, inventing and reinventing the wheel, but finally putting order in the confusion , this truly revolutionary one, of those who have experimented with VR during these first pioneering years. Ever since modern viewers have made their appearance in stores, developers who have been fascinated by the potential of this technology have in fact had to face various challenges: the most difficult was naturally that of having to start practically from scratch, using a new programming and game design that no one had written before then. Those who have not attended virtual reality assiduously do not know that there is an abnormal difference between games adapted to work in VR and those expressly designed for it, and that they can propose situations and solutions that on a normal screen they could not in any way work, if not taking away everything that makes them so special. Resident Evil 7 is, for example, an excellent virtual reality game, one of the best horror games ever, but the technology in question only exploits the most obvious characteristics; the case of the Boneworks experiment is totally different, or the platform Astro Bot remaining in the console environment, since they are both projects that are born and grow around virtual reality and can only work there. Each of these games, the most successful ones as well as the most problematic ones that have been no less important during this evolution, have slowly discovered and divided good and bad ideas, compiling that list that is gradually making projects for VR cleaner, more surprising and more comfortable than ever. Even Valve, without even engaging too much in the development of games, has been busy creating middleware and weaving that know-how at the basis of the birth, as well as the success, of the most modern games dedicated exclusively to virtual reality. VR, the killer app of the future Half-Life: Alyx is the final essay of the choral experimentation of these years, built around a cutting-edge graphics engine and financed by a large amount of money, which is anything but obvious when it comes to virtual reality and its software often assembled on savings. Fortunately, the mixture does not end in this cold, very cold analysis: Half-Life Alyx can also count on a considerable creative warmth, as well as the idea that the gameplay is essentially a form of perfect craftsmanship. Then there is the very important trump card: the Half-Life universe, absent from the scene for thirteen long years. Does it also seem like the perfect portrait of a killer app to you? On the other hand it really is, at least on paper, given that Half-Life: Alyx to officially become one will first have to sell all these viewers. Whether he will succeed or not is still too early to say, especially in light of a world stuck at home which has certainly not made it easier and cheaper to get a PC and a high-end viewer. To understand the effects that Half-Life: Alyx will really have on the VR market, we will have to wait quite a few months, but here are the reasons why we believe it can succeed. Meanwhile, Half-Life: Alyx works on all viewers on the market (except the PlayStation VR), and this gives anyone who has one at hand, from the cheapest to the most expensive, the opportunity to jump into the fray without major problems. The PC needed for a satisfying experience isn't off the charts either, as Valve's game proves extraordinarily adaptable, and in its own way: focusing attention on lighting and how gradually NPC polygons will be updated to depending on the distance, rather than increasing or decreasing the details of the settings which for this reason will always remain surrounded by an immaculate beauty. Thanks to Half-Life Alyx, VR can finally compete graphically with the best games out there, without however renouncing its inimitable characteristics that Valve, with this game, confirms that it knows inside out, as well as being able to bend them to its own needs like no other 'other software house out there. Half-Life Alyx is and remains a full-fledged Half-Life, there is no loss of identity caused by the virtual paradigm shift; what Alyx does is expand, apdeepen and revolutionize all those elements that have made the series the myth that we all know and love. Each area brings with it a canonical or environmental puzzle to be solved, while the firefights are based on two great axioms: the player must always be free to experiment and the AI must always be put in a position to surprise him, and precisely to push him to find non-obvious solutions. Different enemies than usual All of this worked before and works even better today, thanks to the very first person of virtual reality which places us not in front, as usually happens, but finally at the center of the action. So it can only change everything. In Alyx the headcrabs are bigger than ever, bigger than you ever imagined playing previous Half-Lifes, but with the same idiotic vehemence they jump and roll over, ungainly and unbearably hairless; it's so much fun when you're low on ammo to experiment with new ways to defend and counterattack, especially using what's around. During the game we repelled their attacks by covering our faces with chairs, buckets, trying to cage them inside, discovering that as a last resort it can also be useful to try to catch them on the fly with your free hand, and shoot them in the heart with the other kill them instantly; in an extraordinary situation, turning around we discovered a headcrab about to jump on us from beyond the newly opened door which, immediately closed, gave us an onomatopoeic ~thump~ to underline the skull of the disgusting alien. 3D, the real one, allows you to understand distances and dimensions, allowing intuitive reactions and not based on a two-dimensional estimate; the presence and interactions on a real scale instead allow us to rely on an instinct that everyone has, prompting us to behave not as gamers but as simple humans. Unlike those turkeys with tentacles called headcrabs, drones that flutter while supporting themselves on propellers and blades called manhacks are very little predictable: they often hit walls, cabinets, columns, suddenly changing direction, to speed up when our jugular is finally within reach. shot. Against them, you have to behave like Muhammed Ali, that is dancing like butterflies and stinging like bees, but even in this case cunning will often prove to be the best weapon: against a manhack, we got the greatest satisfaction by kneeling suddenly in order to dodge its charge, to discover that the idle maneuver had pushed it all the way into a locker, of which we slammed the door shut, decreeing the end of the mechanical terror. Armed and seated Although Half-Life Alyx can also be played seated, using a comfortable but limiting teleportation system to reduce any risk of motion sickness to zero, the Valve game reaches its peak when we put all of ourselves into play. To do this you will need headsets with up to tracking, such as the Index and the Vive, but the Rift S also performs surprisingly well, as well as an obstacle-free area of at least three square meters. Being able to turn around, orient yourself without having to use the rotation with the stick, is perhaps the most important aspect because it eliminates almost any form of motion sickness, but taking that extra step to bar a door, bending down to overcome the narrowest passages and physically dodging an enemy blow splashes the empathy and fun beyond all rosiest expectations. Half-Life: Alyx is a very physical game, not like Boneworks or Walking Dead but we are close to it: the substantial difference between these products is above all in melee, where Alyx's limits are not technical but serve to respect the balance of gameplay and difficulty. Although it is possible to throw objects at enemies, to slow them down or disorient them, the bipedal invader is responded to by aiming the firearm, carefully modified for more power and accuracy. It's still possible, for example, to kill a headcrab with bricks, but it takes time, it's not too worth it, and there's not even the right feedback. The paraphernalia made available by Half-Life Alyx is rather limited, in fact there are three weapons on which we will be able to get our hands: the pistol, a sort of shotgun and the repeating smg, but each can be improved for four times, provided you find the necessary objects (a sort of alien resin hidden almost everywhere but not always easy to find) and one of the terminals that make the upgrade possible. Perhaps from this point of view more could have been done, but two types of grenades must be added to the three weapons and finally the real protagonists of this game: the gravity gloves. Guanyou gravitational Gravity gloves, or gravitational gloves, are the classic idea that serves to transform a weak point into a strength. In VR games where there is a strong exploratory component, searching every corner of the map and constantly chasing every useful object can prove to be a double-edged sword, providing an interesting element of gameplay but at the same time tiring very quickly those who wear the headset. Gravity gloves have several uses but their main ability is to attract any object to itself, as long as it is not too heavy. Alyx, which in addition to being the subtitle of the game is also the name of the nineteen-year-old protagonist, will be given a couple of minutes at the start of the game. These special gloves, which can also be used simultaneously, are a technological prodigy that works with objects as if it were a sort of invisible lasso: you aim at what interests you, give a small tug towards you, and while it is in its trajectory you prepare to grab it on the fly. By doing so, it is possible to collect all the ammunition and resins without getting close to hand every time, rummage through the cartoons in search of useful objects, remedy random things by stepping back to protect yourself from ever closer enemies; over time we have also learned to use them to catch grenades on the fly, the enemy ones but also ours after an initial shot gone wrong, but be careful because during the maneuver the risk of the bomb exploding in your hand is very, very high. Heavier objects can instead be moved normally by grabbing them with two hands. After an hour or so, it will also be possible to install an essential flashlight on the gloves that will allow us to move in the darkest areas. The fact that the light is positioned on the back of Alyx's hand has rather interesting implications: in some cases, for example when reloading the weapons, we will have to give up keeping the situation under control for obvious reasons. City 17 in quarantine After almost twelve thousand characters, the time has come to combine what has been described up to now to analyze Half-Life: Alyx as a complete product. The sum of the parts creates an experience of extraordinary intensity, emotions that remain impressed for many hours after having removed the viewer, exhausted. And for the uninitiated, remembering what you did in virtual reality is totally different from remembering the passages you have just experienced in a normal on-screen video game: with the latter, the memory is almost always in the third person, it is the protagonist of the game who lives the events for us, while with VR the memory is in first person, we ourselves have killed those aliens, have explored those sewers, have had a stroke of genius worthy of a best film. Half-Life Alyx then has the good fortune to be set in the quarantine area of City 17, one of the most fascinating settings ever, a sort of Prague slowly devoured by the Combine, practically the Nazis who came from space. The fusion between Bohemian and alien architecture creates a real visual accident that displaces and fascinates; the alien structures appear as huge black metal dental implants applied to the city, impenetrable but mobile thanks to their xenosurgical steel guides. In the role of Alyx, we will walk along this constant marvel, grappling with an adventure built in perpetual crescendo: first letting us immerse ourselves peacefully in its setting, then introducing typical elements of survival horror that will give way to the more action and explosive part of which, once we reach the apex, we will be able to enjoy the dream landing. Everything is so well done, everything is so well thought out, and VR has very little to do with it: it is Valve that has this innate ability to tell and make us live textbook experiences, screen or viewer do not change things.", "date": "2020-03-27", "grade": "9.2"}
