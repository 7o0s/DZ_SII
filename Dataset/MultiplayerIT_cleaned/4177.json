However, the public and the press do not seem to agree on the value of this production and, in an attempt to clarify things, we take advantage of the arrival of the Italian localization to throw ourselves on the title and bring you our review. In a market that now seems to have forgotten real-time strategy games, turn-based strategies continue to thrive luxuriantly brought to the fore by that The Banner Saga which will soon receive its third and final chapter. And this Ash of Gods: Redemption starts precisely by relying on the production of Aurum Dust as a structure and game mechanics, also closely remembering it as regards the artistic style, distinguishing itself however with a completely different story. The atmosphere is one of the strong points Ash of Gods: Redemption offers an interesting narrative and in the first hours of the game you will get to know the three groups of heroes who will drive the story. You will control the three storylines separately, jumping from one group to another as the story flows fast and envelops you in its dense plot made of violent deaths, abuses and madness. These are not quick jumps from one side to another but real chapters to be completed before moving on to the next party, thus giving you all the time necessary to grow attached to the individual characters, to delve into their motivations and to discover all the backstory of a situation that turns out to be immediately not trivial and well written. Of course, some secondary heroes will slip away quickly without a trace, but the real protagonists will be able to conquer you, so much so as to put you in difficulty when you have to make decisive moral choices, which will positively or negatively affect the outcome of the story. Therefore, if the supporting structure is well thought out and solid, it is the construction of the dialogues with the various NPCs which appears tedious and not very fluid. You will find yourself having to chat with characters of the lowest relevance trying to find out what is going on through discussions that are unlikely to leave their mark, located in Italian but without the use of particularly sophisticated language. On the contrary, however, these get bored quickly and end up breaking the pace of the game and the evolution of the story. As you make your way through the enemies trying to discover the secrets of the harvest, between demigods and curses, you will feel the pressure of time passing, a mechanic capable of making the clashes more difficult as the hours go by and you will find it senseless to get lost in useless chatter in the villages in passing, a practice that you will be forced to do on time to recover resources and rest your party. Between ups and downs, however, Thorn's story on Terminum, as well as that of the other heroes who follow him, offers particularly interesting moments, told with excellently animated cut scenes and enriched by violence that is sometimes almost exaggerated, as well as unexpected. The aura of poetry created by the very pleasant graphic style thus collides with an era made up of brutal wars for an overall package that offers mixed emotions, a mix that is difficult to absorb but which, precisely for this reason, cannot leave one indifferent. What makes you turn up your nose instead is the gameplay which looks like a simple carbon copy of this seen in the series of The Banner Saga, but failing to even propose an appropriate balance or new ideas that could refresh the game mechanics. The gameplay doesn't offer anything particularly new Just like in The Banner Saga our heroes will have to fight on a chessboard, having to spend energy to move and attack, use special abilities and magical powers. The main curiosity is therefore to be found in a deck of cards to carry around during the campaign, particular spells that can be used by replacing them in our characters' turn and which guarantee extra healing, debuffs of various types or damage over distance. Spells often prove to be useful only in the early stages of the game but the gameplay mechanics underlying Ash of Gods: Redemption will soon make you forget this feature, obviously favoring the use of deployed heroes. In fact, the management of shifts is not linked to teams but to individual characters, which means that having a group outnumbered often brings enormous advantages since they will be able to act more times than their opponents. Basically you alternate with artificial intelligence using one character at a time but without then reaping actual benefits from encircles or shots from behind, effectively making it useless to have too manyteam members. Undoubtedly, having a large number of warriors means having more hit points available to conclude the battles in a victorious manner, but two of the three parties you are going to check have heroes so powerful that they will essentially make any action performed with the followers useless. and therefore superfluous to have more members if not for the sole purpose of using them as moving targets. However, death is not to be underestimated in Ash of Gods: Redemption since it is permanent after any character is knocked down four times in a row. To solve this problem it is possible to spend the Strix, magical amulets essential to continue in the game. The Strix are an integral part of the gameplay, mainly because they protect you from the Reaper, the curse that has hit the lands of Terminum and secondly because they are used as a bargaining chip to safeguard the lives of your companions. It will therefore be your task to manage them in the best possible way and perhaps find out how to get new ones not only by buying them from the various merchants but also by completing specific lines of dialogue and completing secondary missions. If it is therefore true that the atmosphere of Ash of Gods: Redemption is quite successful, thanks also and above all to exceptional music, the quality is diluted during the adventure due to a very limited variety of enemies which ends up making the clashes repetitive and, consequently, the whole adventure. The multiplayer is also rather useless, an extra mode that is not very well cared for and limited only to the fight between two online challengers.", "date": "2018-06-30", "grade": "6.5"}
