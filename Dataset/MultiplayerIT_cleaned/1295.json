{"name": "Magic:The Gathering Battlegrounds", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/magicthe-gathering-battlegrounds.html", "text": "Cards, wizards and enchanted forests It is undeniable that Magic: The Gathering is to card games what Dungeons and Dragons is to role-playing games. Known by all, whether one has ever attended or not. The game relies on the collecting mania inherent in each of us and in addition to offering a flood of different cards all to have absolutely, under penalty of hysterics, you spend hours and hours developing winning strategies, based on the cards you own and those of the opponent. The game is slow and full of pathos, every move is calculated and the following counter-move opens up another set of possibilities. Resetting the enemy's points is an insidious and stressful march, slow but inexorable (unless you're really good or your opponent is really dumb). Well, if you think you can find this atmosphere on your PC too, you are very wrong. Battlegrounds is fast, frantic and often confusing, forcing you to think fast, summon creatures like crazy, and defend yourself against others, all at a very high pace. But let's proceed calmly. Yes but .. the cards? They are not here. What are you going to do? You can't have everything. Anyone expecting a turn-based game, perhaps with some nice cards to throw on a virtual table will be disappointed. Battlegrounds is a cross between an action in which you run around sharing clubs or collecting magic items and a real-time strategy. The battlefield is not a table but a sort of tennis court, divided by a line. You can trespass by half of the opponent for quick raids with which to steal other people's mana crystals, essential to be able to cast spells, but if you stay there too long the punishment will be terrible (loss of energy, what did you think?). In addition to summoning creatures to throw against the enemy wizard, you can cast various spells or enhance your summons, while defending yourself from opposing creatures and collecting mana crystals, raising a magical shield or hitting creatures with a stick, all that is missing is that you start sweeping the ground while you build a sand castle with a bucket and shovel. In short, you have a lot of stuff to do. All this creates a sort of confusion (even mental) in which it is easy to lose control of one's actions, above all if one considers that the physical attack of your mage, useful for saving mana, must be given with the right timing on the unfortunate creature and same thing for the raising of the shield. This while various little monsters face each other in a duel, when one of the two yields the winner goes towards the opposing magician and if he finds no other resistance he hits him, removing the respective damage points that characterize the evocation. Blow after blow, you kill your opponent, win the challenge and move on to the next one. A bit monotonous in the long run? Singles and Multy As much as singleplayer is boring, in the long run, multiplayer turns out to be interesting and compelling. The campaign to be played alone is a long and repetitive series of clashes with various magicians, on different fields, to conquer the various types of magic: fire, water, earth, white and black magic. Each victory will ensure the use of a new spell to be used necessarily in the next scheme. All this is essential to be able to face the game on the net in a decent way, otherwise you will find yourself collecting a series of demoralizing defeats against more expert wizards than you and with spell books full of spells that you, miserable beginners who have passed two levels only, you can not imagine. Filling your beautiful book to bring into battle with the spells that are most congenial to you is therefore necessary in order to be able to hurl yourself against flesh and blood opponents, albeit through your modem. Once you become good enough to be able to sustain a battle on the last summons, you will finally find a very large group of opponents, each with its own magic. Some will specialize in attack spells, others will prefer defense or enhancement spells, depending on the type of summons they have decided to bring along. It's more like a card game now, where everyone has their favorite deck and the challenge is having the right cards (or in this case, spells) to pit against your opponent. In short, fun, varied and always different depending on who you are facing. Everything that singles lack in fact. Graphics and gameplay The graphics turn out to be decent, especially when compared to marvelsand that are seen around at the moment, the light effects that accompany the various evocations are pleasing to the eye, nothing more. A bad flaw is the fixed camera, which does not allow you to have an eye on the playing field in its entirety, but you will be so busy running from one side of your rectangle to the other that you will hardly notice it. In fact, what leaves the most to be desired is the playability. Even neglecting the fact that this is still a console conversion (and it shows, especially in the movements of your wizard) the attempt to make Magic Battlegrounds a cross between an action and a real-time strategy has partially failed. The game is confusing for being an action and unwilling to think of a real strategy to be called strategic. Already from the first more serious battles you will realize that keeping all your actions under control is no mean feat. Collect mana crystals running up and down the field, launch the summons, check which ones are launched by the opponent, decide whether or not yours need some upgrades, defend yourself from those of others, in case they have won the duel with yours and they are getting too close to your wizard, keep an eye on your energy level and that of the opponent, etc. As you can see, if nothing else, it doesn't bore us, but all at the expense of a real combat strategy which in the end is resolved in deciding which spells to bring into battle and then hopefully for the best. Also because the management of spells is limited to three per slot, to choose others you have to scroll through those in your possession all using only the keyboard, you can even throw the mouse away. Of course you can choose the order of the spells by customizing your book well, but what if you suddenly need the one you put in last place? You are screwed. Final considerations If you are a true fan of the card game well, maybe you will like being able to see the little monsters in 3D, which you have collected for years, beating each other on your monitor, but you will regret those games that lasted hours and which forced you to think incessantly in order to predict your opponent's moves and find a suitable answer. If you've never played Magic, you've got your hands on an action-strategic hybrid that will give you a few hours of fun, especially (if not almost exclusively) online. Not a bad game, it runs well without any problems, but leaves in the mouth that typical taste of ~could do more~ games. Playing around a table with pockets swollen with cards, sweaty and stinky after hours and hours of playing well that's something else. Pros: Pleasant light effects Multiplayer is varied and fun Cons: Boring and repetitive single player action or strategy? A bit of history Ten years ago a new way of conceiving card games was born. Magic: The Gathering established itself on the market, combining the passion for collecting with the pleasure of playing a complex and fun strategy game. Designed by Richard Garfield, a former mathematics professor and subsequently awarded numerous prizes thanks to his creation, the game aims to reduce the opponent's score to zero starting from twenty points using creatures, spells or various special cards contained in your deck, through various attack or defense moves. Said like this it may seem simplistic but in the last ten years there are around 6,300 different cards for an almost infinite combination of moves and countermoves. Magic is played in more than 70 countries around the world and more than 100,000 tournaments come to life every year where you can compete against real-life opponents or about 12,000 for the online version of the game. The game is distributed worldwide by Wizards of the Coast Inc. division of the better known Hasbro Inc. and has an almost infinite series of imitations, millions of players and billions of cards in circulation, making it the most popular card game in the world .The era of stickers with football players is long over, now dragons are exchanged with cyclopean ogres, this too is progress.", "date": "2004-06-03", "grade": null}
