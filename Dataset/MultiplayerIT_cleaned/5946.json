Well, we can say that Skeletomb is quite clearly inspired by the mechanics and structure of Crossy Road, however it does not try to exploit the resounding success of the Hipster Whale title in the most comfortable way; indeed, it offers an alternative interpretation to that formula. The view changes, which is not a three-quarter isometric but from above, and which becomes a ~pure~ top-down when our character passes from an open environment to a closed one, in this case small dungeons that they generally mark the middle stage of a level. And this is where the second difference comes in: Skeletomb's structure is not of the endless type, but is divided into various stages randomly generated by a procedural system. Of course, in the end it doesn't change much, being the number of missions virtually infinite and having a single energy bar, but we are certainly faced with a new rhythm, more reasoned and therefore able to deliver us a more relaxing experience, net of a challenge factor which, however, is never trivial. Skeletomb is a fun and immediate casual game, but with somewhat imprecise touch controls Touch and run The protagonist of Skeletomb is a highly customizable hero, whose colors and general appearance we can modify, who embarks on the exploration of scenarios that are increasingly complex and full of dangers, whether they are enemies (bats, mummies, skeletons) or traps (traps, ditches, spears, deep water). To strongly characterize the game is a touch control system that is also adjustable, which in the default setting works via a simple tap of the screen to jump north and with different slides to proceed in other directions instead. The attack maneuver is automatic, in the sense that it must be activated as if we simply wanted to move in the direction of the target, but we need to calculate the times well to catch the enemies off guard, perhaps while they have just invaded a new ~box~ and have not still turned to be able to hit us. A particularly effective strategy within the aforementioned dungeons, where we will also be able to collect a large amount of coins. Each tot we will also be able to watch a short advertising film and unlock a new character, with a view to a rose that in the end is quite large (there will be more than twenty) and certainly helps to mix the cards a bit on the table, while not producing real effects on the gameplay. The presence of an extended tutorial, an ~adventure~ mode (the one with separate stages) and an endless mode finally draw the picture of a product richer than the average and undoubtedly capable, thanks to the procedural system, of always offering something again. The problems come when it comes to evaluating the controls, because unfortunately several of the available options soon prove to be inaccurate and give rise to unjustified game overs. Together with the intrinsic limits of the structure, these drawbacks somewhat clip the wings of a game that also defends itself well from a technical point of view, with lively ~cubed~ graphics which, however, are accompanied by music that in our opinion is not very appropriate.", "date": "2015-10-24", "grade": "7.0"}
