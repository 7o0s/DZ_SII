All in all, it managed to stand out in the chaos of similar productions in the mobile sector and a sequel was actually predictable, if not downright desirable. Given the occasion, one would expect to find ourselves faced with another platformer with puzzle elements capable of solving the problems of the first chapter and enhancing its positive elements with this Super Phantom Cat 2, but is that really the case? What you notice at first glance is a greater care applied to the aesthetics of the game, which is still based on the particular stylization of the original but is decidedly cleaner, more coherent and elegant without abandoning the minimalism chosen by Veewo to represent the strange world of his super cat. The mechanics of the game are practically the same as the first chapter, which in turn was based on the more classic canon of the platform genre with the ability to jump on enemies' heads, collect collectibles and use the protagonist's special abilities. Precisely this last aspect, already a distinctive element of the first Super Phantom Cat, further rises to the fulcrum of the action in this new chapter, presenting a series of additional elements capable of substantially enriching an otherwise too simple gameplay. The possibility of teleporting or growing vines to reach otherwise inaccessible areas opens the door to a deeper and more reasoned approach to the structure of the levels, which can thus be explored more deeply and interpreted in different ways. The Super Cat Lab To enrich the gaming experience a little, Veewo has tried to insert a few additional variables to the original formula, putting together a hybrid that sometimes doesn't seem to make much sense, but all in all it is functional to keep the interest active . Collectibles and levels allow you to unlock new characters with different characteristics, while advancing in the game it becomes possible to build and manage a sort of base for the protagonists, linked to properly management dynamics. By spending gold coins and diamonds it is therefore possible to buy and evolve the structures for the base, capable of providing support elements such as potions, keys and so on. The addition seems rather forced and almost superfluous, however it manages to add something to the otherwise slightly puny structure of the platform, if only by insisting on exploring the levels and collecting collectibles. An element that has remained substantially unchanged from the first chapter is the interface, which unfortunately is still based on the classic virtual pad printed on the touch screen: on one side the right-left directions, on the other the jump and the action button. It is now an assimilated fact that this solution cannot fully satisfy the gamer accustomed to the feeling of the controller, but it must be said that the response to the commands is usually reactive, except for some cases. Rather, the lowered position continues to be a bit uncomfortable in case you play on a tablet. Super Phantom Cat 2 is distributed as free-to-play and has a fairly fair monetization system: there is an energy bar that is consumed as you progress through the game and involves the classic breaks that can be shortened through payment, but you can also collect coins occasionally looking at some advertising and therefore continue easily even without spending.", "date": "2017-08-27", "grade": "8.0"}
