There are numerous bloody battles that have dotted this bloody stretch of history, just as there have been many innovations made to the same technique of war within the century between the beginning and the end of hostilities, approximately between 1337 (year in which the English landed in northern France crossing the Channel and preparing for the subsequent battle of Crcy) and 1453 (in which the clashes culminated in the battle of Castillon which in fact represented the last chapter of the war). So much material from which to draw, therefore, to build a strategic with a historical background, such as this History: Great Battles Medieval. Thanks to the collaboration between the Slitherine development team and the History Channel behind the project, the game was able to enjoy a rather meticulous historical reconstruction, as well as a powerful support of audio and video documents taken directly from the documentaries of the famous specialist TV channel American, which therefore provide the correct historical background and interesting interludes between one battle and another. It is therefore a mixed-structure strategy, that is, with common elements between the real time of the RTS and the shifts of the more classic tradition. In particular, the latter appear in multiplayer matches, in which the game times are marked by a stopwatch which sets the pace between the possible actions for each player. Playing against the CPU, on the other hand, the battle takes place in real time but with the possibility of calling up the pause at any time and thus giving orders to your units. Attack my braves The game modes essentially allow you to tackle the long campaign single-handedly (on the side of the French or the British) or engage in battles individually within skirmishes, single or multiplayer. The difference between these two modes is quite substantial, since facing a human opponent we will find ourselves dealing with a timed time limit within which to develop one's turn of the game, while in single the action is more free, with the ability to call pause and organize army at any time. Within vast battlefields, the two opposing armies, the French and the English, face each other. Each army is divided into various groups which act in a compact manner as single units, obviously made up of many combatants but characterized by the homogeneity of equipment and behavior in battle. These teams obviously correspond to those that historically were part of the two sides, such as archers, heavy cavalry, infantry and artillery, for a total of about twenty different specializations plus numerous other additional customizations. Each unit, also on the basis of the equipment chosen (variable for each type of fighter) has strengths and weaknesses compared to the others, with a pattern similar to that typical of the Chinese morra (archers hit cavalry well, this last is strong against infantry, this can easily hit archers and so on). The vast battlefields allow wide and articulated maneuvers for each squadron, whose attack and defense efficiency is given both by the choice of the objective and by the conformation of the terrain on which it is located, as well as by the possibility of attacking from the flank or from behind , privileged positions to obtain devastating effects. The combination of all these variables decides the outcome of the clash between two squadrons, which, depending on the course of the battle, may see their morale increase and decrease, up to being forced into a temporary retreat which may herald a subsequent return to battle or the total defeat. With the rapid pressure of a button it is possible to choose the predisposition of the teams between defence, guard and attack, with obvious behavioral modifications in the proximity of the enemy. Peasant, officer and gentleman The customization and characterization of each team is the basis of the battle preparation phase and heavily influences the possibility of victory. The progression of the game is not given by a simple succession of forced battles, but the battles are instead decided by the player himself within a map representing the various areas where the Hundred Years War took place (France and the Netherlands , especiallyolar). Only some battles represent a real step forward from a narrative point of view within the game, while many others have the role of filler or historical digression on the events surrounding the war itself. Trying to focus only on the fundamental battles hardly leads to good results, since a certain work of leveling your army is essential for which secondary clashes play a fundamental role. The money and experience gained in battle can be readily reinvested in army management, by accessing the camp where we will find ourselves spending a good amount of time. Here, we can enlist new squads and modify the characteristics of those present in our army, changing or evolving their role and modifying their specialization. The money can be invested in new recruitments and in weapons and equipment (melee weapons, ranged weapons, artillery, shields and armor of various types, mounts) capable of modifying the structure of the team and the attack/defense stats more any bonuses against particular types of opposing units, while special experience points allow the purchase of a large number of generic, attack or defense skills capable of giving additional powers to the team and improving its performance in battle. In essence, each team can be treated as a single unit through the classic ways of managing fighters within an RPG party, with the customization and evolution of the ~characters~ becoming of fundamental importance for success in battle , given the difficulty of the clashes that make up the ~narrative~ sequence of the game. Another managerial element to keep in mind is that of the cards: these, conquered with battles on the field, represent real special powers capable of heavily influencing the outcome of the battles, each with a special power. It will therefore be necessary to choose well which ones to take with you in each battle (a maximum of two at a time can be used) and the right moment in which to activate them. Xbox 360 goals The objectives of Great Battles Medieval are arranged according to the typical logic of the genre, divided rather equally between those to be unlocked by progressing in the game and those that can be obtained by achieving particular performances in the game. A good organization for those looking for points. Wide glimpses of Normandy The graphic engine developed by Slitherine allows a large level of zoom of the shot, which passes in a short time from a bird's eye view with the possibility of seeing and managing multiple teams simultaneously to a close-up view, useful for having a better idea precise of what is happening during a direct confrontation or to enjoy the many details that make up the individual fighters on the field. If in the standard, more distant position, the graphics are not distinguished by particular technological solutions, it is with the zoom activated that we can appreciate the great work done by the developers in the characterization of the various units, although there is still something that should be fixed as regards individual animations. On the other hand, the quality of the interlude videos which act as narrative-historical curtains between one battle of greater interest and another can be improved by a good margin. Taken partly directly from the History repertoire and partly edited in-game sequences, these videos are characterized by somewhat inadequate video compression, which makes them rather less enjoyable than what they could have offered the player. The camp section is also a bit monotonous and subdued in the long run: always the same shot with minimal aesthetic variations to the surrounding scenario make the unit management experience little more than functional. The audio sector, for its part, performs its function with dignity with the usual epic orchestral music (not a great variety on this front, it must be said) and a good amount of spoken text completely translated into Italian for the videos of interlude. As for the Xbox 360 version, the controls have obviously been adapted from the interface of the PC version, applied to the console controller. The result, as is often the case for RTS on consoles, is not the happiest. Although in this case the possibility of pausing and therefore calmly studying the moves to be carried out and the relative results does not impose fast and precise movements of the cursor, it is clear that the best solution to fully enjoy History: Great Battles Medieval remains the mouse and keyboard.", "date": "2010-04-19", "grade": "7.0"}
