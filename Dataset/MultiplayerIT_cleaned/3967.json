Above all, Italy still only had three World Cups on their shelf, the Lakers weren't doing so well and in the gaming industry even the most established publishers weren't afraid to experiment and come up with extravagant products. Like We Love Katamari, second son of a saga born just a year earlier, which not only sunk its foundations on an unusual gameplay, but immersed the playful mechanics in a very bizarre and eccentric context. Those who were lucky enough to enjoy it at the time, reading these introductory lines, will sigh nostalgically not only recalling the thick hair or the toned physique of that era lost forever. He will be prey to tender reminiscences of his time spent in the company of the indefatigable Prince and the histrionic King of the Cosmos. The duo, absolute protagonists of the Bandai Namco series, after returning to the limelight in 2018 with the remastered of the first chapter, also return in We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie, a product halfway between the re-proposition in HD and the (fake) remake. Isn't this jump into the past a bit too much for newbies? Will fans of the first hour still find it fun to roll a ball up and down levels? In this review of We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie we explain why, despite everything, it is still natural to love Katamari today. Love the Cosmos, your father Between the grotesque and the demented, all the footage of We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie will leave you speechless, for one reason or another We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie, like all the other chapters of the series, is based on an extremely simple concept. By pushing a ball with supernatural sticky abilities, you will have to enlarge the sphere until it reaches a certain diameter, dragging with you anything that will appear in front of your path. It is not an operation without risks or obstacles. The Katamari, in fact, can only attract to itself what has smaller dimensions than the same portentous contraption. This means that, if initially you can overwhelm small stationery objects, crumbs and tiny animals, during the same level, and more generally in the main campaign, you will find yourself sticking cars, trees and entire buildings to the sphere. A certainly unusual idea, supported, as we said, by an equally unsettling narrative context. The King of the Cosmos, breaking through the fourth wall and launching himself into a distinctly meta-narrative externalization, surprised by the success and love shown towards his Katamari, a reference to the relative success that the progenitor of the saga met, decided to send again on Earth his firstborn. The Prince's task was to listen to the wishes of his subjects, thus creating other stars with which to constellate the firmament which, for those who don't remember, had been partially rebuilt thanks to the power of the Katamari in the prequel. In We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie we will discover something more about the childhood of the King of the Cosmos Even the graphic style is obviously curious. By deliberately choosing to save on polygons, a game world that is as grotesque in the intermission scenes as extremely colorful, lively, minimalist in the game phases emerges. Peculiar and timeless, the aesthetic sector of We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie convinces today as it did yesterday, thanks to the excellent adaptation work carried out by the developers. In high definition, the scenarios still surprise and, thanks also to an impeccable frame-rate, there are no technical problems of any kind. Years and years of indie have accustomed even the youngest audience to peculiar art designs and it will certainly not be the Bandai Namco production that will upset them. The judgment can also be extended to the soundtrack. The tracks range from off-key fanfares to orchestrated pieces and all have one thing in common: they'll stick in your head and, without even realizing it, you'll find yourself humming and whistling them at the bus stop or when you're lost in thought. Also in this area, the timelessness of the game directed by Keita Takahashi is revealed in all its shining splendor. Roll for the glory of the firmament We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie, like most games that are based on a simple concept, is addictive in an almost inexplicable way A simple and easily assimilated idea, however, doesn't always rhyme with a game that can entertain. Especially if we are talking about an experiment rIt dates back to the now-far-distant 2005. Will old-timers still find it fascinating? Will newbies appreciate the over the top formula of We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie? In short, are we talking about a game still worthy of our time? Rolling a sticky ball in scenarios full of objects obviously relies on the ancestral instincts inherent in our species, arousing as if by magic a pleasure, a satisfaction, an inexplicable amusement . The specific weight of the emotions and amazement generated by any game with this game is unshakeable, deaf as time passes. This is not a feeling universally attributable to the entire audience of gamers, because the gameplay consciously suffers from a lack of depth that will alienate the most pretentious gamers, but it is undeniable that we are faced with a production capable of arousing such a fleeting joy how dazzling. Each level of We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie is basically a race against time, trying to create a sphere that has a certain diameter Not all the credit goes to the game formula, of course. The level design plays a fundamental role from this point of view. The scenarios present a mix of large arenas and hidden areas full of objects capable of dramatically increasing the diameter of the Katamari. Finding them helps enormously in achieving scores worthy of the King of the Cosmos' compliments. However, the replay value is poor as it doesn't take long to explore each level. Yet, this will not prevent you from retrying the same mission over and over again, even if only for the pleasure of rolling the sphere around the setting. Furthermore, the original, compared to the prequel, introduced internal objectives at each level capable of making the adventure even more challenging. In fact, to fully complete each scenario, always respecting the time limit imposed, you will not only have to increase the Katamari, being very careful not to bump into too large objects, an eventuality that will cost you precious seconds. From time to time you will be asked to find particular elements, to collect only a certain type of animal and so on. The control system of We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie, through the two analogs, simulates the movement of the two hands of the Prince who push on the sphere Furthermore, We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie proposes the highly appreciated local co-op mode, an authentic source of addiction with the right companion and one inclined to this kind of experience. As if that weren't enough, which makes this revival something more than a simple remastered, a handful of unreleased levels have been added. Nothing particularly impactful on the global longevity of the adventure, which settles down to around a dozen hours, but these are pleasant additions, which testify to the adaptation developers' ability to capture the spirit, style, design of the original and to re-propose them, perfectly preserved, in these ex novo scenarios. Scenarios which, among other things, by means of specially created videos shed light on the turbulent past of the King of the Cosmos, a pleasant narrative interlude which embellishes the singular game universe.", "date": "2023-06-24", "grade": "7.5"}
