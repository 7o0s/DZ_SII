A model so simple from the point of view of the interface and the control system that it is ideal for those touch screens often accused of being too limited. Simogo, the team behind the acclaimed Bumpy Road, has therefore well thought of choosing the genre in question to give life to their new title for iOS platforms, entitled Beat Sneak Bandit. But be careful, because it's not just a rhythm game... A step at a time The Beat Sneak Bandit formula rests precisely on the foundations of game design described above, thus requiring you to touch any point on the screen of your device to the rhythm (beat) of the piece of music. However, the interesting and original evolution lies in the mix between rhythm game and puzzle, since the title of Simogo also requires a good dose of gray matter to be successfully tackled. In summary, each level is represented in a single screen, which depicts a room inside which stairs, floors, switches, lights, other elements and above all the clocks are arranged; yes, because the protagonist's goal is precisely to recover - without being discovered - all the clocks in the world, stolen by the evil Duke Clockface who therefore sent all of humanity into chaos. Closed the parenthesis on the bizarre and negligible plot, it is appropriate to focus precisely on the interesting gameplay offered by Beat Sneak Bandit; in practice, the rhythmic touch of the screen determines the movement of our anonymous hero, in the measure of one step for each successful tap. This method is the only one possible to cross the levels and therefore interact with the elements present in them; being able to reach the main clock, possibly also collecting the bonus ones, therefore becomes a work of both strategy and ear. The approach with Beat Sneak Bandit cannot therefore be superficial and inattentive; all it takes is one mistake to be discovered by a guard or a camera, making it necessary to start the level from the beginning. Similarly, a touch off the beat of the song causes the bonus clock on the same floor to disappear, making it impossible to complete the stage perfectly. It goes without saying that, as the adventure continues, things become increasingly complex and demanding, requiring even tiring planning work on occasion. However, as almost always happens with products that are so severe in their gameplay, Simogo production is also incredibly satisfying and rewarding in case of success; obtaining all the watches, in addition to the personal pleasure of conquest, also determines the unlocking of certain additional extra levels characterized by a different ~shadow~ stylistic figure. It is clear that in a product like Beat Sneak Bandit the quality of the sound accompaniment is therefore fundamental; on this front, the funky pop songs and the spot on effects are very pleasant and spot on, even if not too incisive nor particularly numerous. The graphic component also deserves a mention, which despite its absolute cartoon-like simplicity has a style that adds further personality to an already remarkable product.
