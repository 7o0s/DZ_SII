{"name": "Ancora tower defense?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/85282-legendary-wars-ancora-tower-defense.html", "text": "Although the genre has now said almost everything, the release of a new title based on tower defense should at least be taken into consideration, precisely because real unmissable gems or even customary phenomena have often been born from simple similar games ( suffice it to mention Plants vs Zombies, Popcap title present in all devices on earth with the exception of built-in appliances). However, Legendary Wars, to try to give the category new freshness and vitality, has attempted to bring together strategic and role-playing elements in a single title, all in an ever-fascinating medieval and ~metaphysical~ setting; as will be seen, the result thus obtained is certainly positive. Once upon a time there was an elf, a dwarf and a man Although the protagonists are not the most original literature has ever offered, in Legendary Wars the armies available to defend the kingdom from the onslaught of undead and various monsters are really different and well matched, as well as perfectly complementary. In fact, continuing in the game it will be possible to add wizards, mighty giant Golems and a splendid white unicorn, capable of throwing rainbows from its bony appendage, to the traditional Tolkenian triad. Although the game structure at least initially follows that of a classic tower defense, going forward in the story the strategic and RPG elements will become necessary to complete a mission: the collection of resources for example, entrusted to a skilled miner, must be constantly increased to be able to make the most of it, both by increasing the characteristics of the single miner and by recruiting others to improve the range of each descent into the mine (from which the blue gems necessary for the summoning of the troops are extracted); the same goes obviously for the protagonists in the fight against monsters, whose training at the armory will make their fiber more resistant to enemy assaults but at the same time more dangerous in the attack phase. In the long journey that the heroes face during the liberation of the kingdom, some missions differ from the others in typology and primary objectives: one can therefore have recruitment journeys, consisting in the simple crossing of a mound of land trying to avoid zombies and skeletons but passing by the free elves who are facing them, escort trips in which to keep an ally alive or even real assaults on the fortress, with the opposite purpose compared to the typical all-out defense of one's manor; in this case, however, the commanders will have to be defended, otherwise the mission will be canceled even in the presence of active troops. Once the adventure is over, the usual puzzle modes will be unlocked such as the endless hordes to defend against, side scrolling (comparable to recruitment missions) and survival mode. The enemies to face, in full respect of tradition, are divided into various categories of creatures of the night, such as zombies or skeletons, without forgetting vampires, wolves, gargoyles and dragons; at the end of each chapter then the classic boss will be faced. Despite the good premises, Legendary Wars suffers from one of the most widespread defects in these productions, namely a certain imprecision in the touch control system (not dramatic but still to be perfected), which in touching a line of defense on which to place a soldier does not always it will make the correct position correspond to the desired choice; moreover, in order to accumulate the resources necessary to upgrade the warriors, it is necessary to repeat the missions already completed several times. In fact, moving from one mission to another, where it is necessary to fight with ever stronger hordes of enemies, requires an increase in the level of one's armies; since the resources intended for upgrades come from victories, it will be necessary to repeat previous missions several times before tackling the next more demanding ones. Once the right degree of power has been reached, it is certainly easier to complete the next stage but, as imaginable, repeating the same mission 3 or 4 times in a row could establish in the player a sort of reduced ~Gran Turismo accumulation syndrome~. On the other hand, the speech on the technical front is very good: the title is in fact equipped with a nice colorful and cartoony 2D graphics, with fluid and fun animations, despite the semi-serious setting of the narrative plot; the dialogues, completely in Italian, are entrusted to the writings in the clouds, as there is no type of dubbing other than that linked to grimaces and various sounds emitted by the interlocutors; finally the music is nice, although certainly not memorable. Too bad for the lack of Game Center support and the absence of a qualunque social interaction. The tested version is 1.1 Price: 0.79 App Store links", "date": "2011-02-16", "grade": "8.4"}
