However, when the goal is achieved with brilliance and comes unexpectedly, being able to repeat yourself on the second date can prove complex. That's why the Playdead developers have taken all the time necessary for a return to the field up to the first performance. Limbo made its debut on Xbox Live Arcade and PC but the excellent feedback received made it land also on PlayStation 3, Vita and iOS, before arriving on current generation consoles in a remastered edition. The results obtained - with over 1 million copies sold in the first year of presence on the market - led Playdead to immediately start a second project, which, moreover, was not officially revealed until 2014. Inside was in fact shown for the first time during the 'E3 two years ago, when Microsoft confirmed that it had acquired the rights to publish the work exclusively. The decision to come out in the open with a long delay compared to the start of the works was intended to limit the wait, although the postponements suffered by the project during 2015 did not prevent a certain curiosity from being created among the supporters of the first hour. All the above admirers will therefore be pleased to know that Inside retraces and extends the same minimalist expressive philosophy of Limbo, based on a dark atmosphere, a totally implicit narrative and excellent puzzle-platformer mechanics. It took six years of work, but Inside finally did it Scientific experimentation Just like Limbo, Inside's adventure is experienced entirely through the eyes of a child. Having abandoned the Christian iconography that had traced the previous work, Playdead has chosen to lean on the theme of scientific experimentation, in a game universe that suggests the presence of an Orwellian regime, where the clouding of the collective conscience and the establishment of unnerving forms of control are spawning monsters. The young protagonist does not hesitate for a moment to break into what, clearly, turns out to be a research facility where experiments are carried out on other human beings. The ultimate goal of its mission remains unknown and is left to the free interpretation of the user, who must limit himself to observing what happens along the way and to formulate hypotheses. The total absence of contextualization catapults us into the heart of the interactive experience. Without any filter, one can do nothing but feel the weight of the threat which becomes more and more morbid at every turn. Yet the little boy proves to know his stuff, managing to extricate himself from a myriad of environmental obstacles that must be circumvented, defused or simply resolved to gain free access to the following areas. The monochromatism of Limbo has been set aside but the tones remain equally very dark, filtered not only by the innumerable dangers but also by a context that at first appears only aseptic and soon translates into authentic degradation. The muffled atmosphere and the long silences, broken mostly by deaf noises, are functional to increase the observer's curiosity for the unknown. If sometimes the protagonist's steps reign in the most complete silence, other moments are dominated by chases or situations in which it is necessary to hide one's presence. These moments are emotionally accentuated by the protagonist's wheezing and by the intensification of his heartbeats, to then become one with the anguish experienced by the player every time the young man is brutally strangled by a patrol or attacked by a handful of dogs enraged. The implementation of the music assumes central importance and has once again been entrusted to the care of Martin Stig Andersen, who had already taken care of the sound sector of Limbo. With Inside, a new and more accentuated synergy has been created which links interaction to sounds and enhances both the resolution of puzzles and the excited moments of escape. Insights In the world of Inside, intuition reigns supreme. Once again the control system is deliberately reduced to a minimum: with a button you can jump and cling to objects, while with a second input you can interact with some materials needed to complete the puzzles. The interaction is always limited to the bare essentials and is designed to establish those same ~trial and error~ dynamics that we had already had the opportunity to experience in Limbo. Death becomes a recurring phenomenon and represents, once again, a conspicuous choicepleasant in terms of design. The dangers that are lurking follow one another without interruption and it is necessary to constantly keep an eye out. At the same time, the many checkpoints distributed along the levels make the journey much more accessible and above all enhance the moment of deduction that occurs at every single step, when you need to understand what to move or in what order it is better to act. The amount of situations that arise, despite the journey remaining short, is quite high and embraces multiple forms of interaction. First of all, there are neural devices that are used to remotely control the individuals subjected to the experiments. These subjects now appear completely devoid of intellect, much more like zombies than living beings, although they are not aggressive at all. The protagonist is thus able to assume their role and obtain, on several occasions and in various forms, a precious support in solving the puzzles. For example, it is possible to get help to open a door or reach a higher point in the level, or even destroy parts of the setting to ensure a passage to the next area. In other moments, however, the dynamics of fluid control prevail, thanks to which it is also possible to move along levels that are almost entirely flooded. But that's not all, it will happen that you have to protect yourself from mysterious and dangerous shock waves, constantly trying to stay sheltered among the metal structures, or even to escape the assaults of some Dobermans trained to catch prey. The fluidity of the experience is guaranteed by a difficulty curve that never becomes prohibitive, although the longevity is rather limited. Once again, in fact, between four and five hours of total play will be enough to successfully complete the adventure.", "date": "2016-06-28", "grade": "8.5"}
