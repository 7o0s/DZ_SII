The linguistic diversifications were not limited only to the title, but were extended to some jokes, eliminated because they were considered unsuitable for the western public, and to the names of the protagonists, who became Kid Ying (Goemon) and Doctor Yang (Ebisumaru). Since its inception, this saga has oscillated between platform and action rpg, sometimes moving completely to one side, sometimes positioning itself in the middle of the two genres. Never having had a control system worthy of Sonic or puzzles comparable to those of Zelda, Goemon has always given his all when he managed to find the balance between these two inclinations, the only situation so far capable of letting his identity. Only Wonder Boy managed in those years to penetrate this area equally brilliantly, but if the SEGA game was probably more refined, the Konami one could boast an unmistakable trademark: the cooperative multiplayer mode, a real rarity for games of this type. Precisely this last factor, together with the characteristic graphic style, managed to bring back from the sea of mediocrity Mystical Ninja for Super Nintendo: compared to the other episodes of the series it was not very well balanced, the level design did not offer anything particularly original, the phases explorations were poorly set up. What is it today If these flaws were evident at the time they are even more so now. The sections set in the villages, or more generally all the non-platform ones, to play now are very annoying: devoid of any attention to detail, unsuitable for the action but incredibly dedicated to it, decidedly not inclined to exploration as they would be should have been. These areas occupy more than half of the game, but strangely they are only the prelude to the dungeons; the latter in Goemon are nothing more than plaftorm horizontally scrolling levels, not excellent but certainly enjoyable, especially in multiplayer. Just like in the early 90s, there are two reasons that can lead you to purchase Mystical Ninja: the first is the affection for these characters and their comedy, the second is the multiplayer mode, which is even rarer today than at the time in this genre of games. Mario, Sonic, Mega Man, Pac-Man and Goemon: if we asked any western player to find the intruder among these names, he would surely answer Goemon. However, this ninja wrote the history of Konami, for a short time he was its icon, and is still a very popular character in Japan today. Over the years he has appeared on almost every gaming platform, the titles that see him as the protagonist are about to become twenty, but he has never managed to enter the hearts of Western players: perhaps because he is too strongly linked to a certain culture, perhaps because too fluctuating in terms of quality, Goemon has slowly disappeared from the shelves of our local shops, so much so that the last three games, although the one for DS is a title of rare quality, have remained confined to their native land.", "date": "2007-05-22", "grade": null}
