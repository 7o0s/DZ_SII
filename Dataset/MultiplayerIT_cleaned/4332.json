Match", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/196847-score-match-la-recensione-di-score-match.html", "text": "Associating a football simulation with a mobile context is evidently not easy, and this is demonstrated by the fact that real football video games have not been seen in this environment in fact. Alternative solutions are therefore found, which can be better associated with a control system which for a title with fast dynamics is largely inadequate: the managerial structure, with its cadenced rhythm and recourse to menus, is probably the most appropriate in this context, but there is also a particular declination of football that has been tested and now well established by First Touch Games and which represents an excellent variation on the theme. This is the particular ~turn-based~ football of the Score series! which evolves further with this new chapter titled Score! Match. Precisely, in this new version the peculiar mechanics elaborated previously is also joined by that managerial element that is so well associated with use on mobile platforms, and the mixture that comes out is somewhat convincing, only to then get stuck on those that are a bit the chronic defects of this game system. As far as the mechanics of the gameplay itself are concerned, therefore, it does not differ much from what Score offered! Hero already three years ago, but Match takes everything to a new level not only in terms of technical advances made on the graphics sector but also on the organization of the team and the disposition of the players on the pitch, giving some additional depth to that dynamic engaging at first but very flat indeed in the long run. However, being able to challenge players from all over the world always makes some online comparisons stimulating and it is therefore easy to return to Score! Match several times, perhaps in not too long sessions. Being a free-to-play, everything is obviously filtered through a complex system of micro-transactions that can easily cage the most addicted player, but which up to a certain point do not seem to force their hand on the wallet. Football at your fingertips On the pitch, the mechanics remain those typical of the Score! series, with the action stopping at the moment of passing or shooting, requiring us to trace the trajectory of the ball, being careful not to let the ball be intercepted or to beat the goalkeeper in the event of a net finish. It is an extremely simple but also rewarding game solution and the evolutions imparted to the modeling of the characters and to the animations increase the sense of satisfaction in seeing an action unfold just the way you would like it through simple strokes on the touch screen. The main problem always remains the general randomness that distinguishes the game mechanism, in particular as regards the behavior of the goalkeepers and the way in which the players unfold on the field, given that the user's control over the action ultimately remains very limited. In the defensive phase you can simply ~call~ a slide which then arrives only when it is possible, with the tackles taking place randomly hoping for the right defensive movements by the CPU, while the imposed direction of the ~cone~ in which to make the pass o shooting does not allow you to customize the attack action much. Even the management of the team does not allow you to delve into the tactics of the game on the field, but in this area the collecting drive takes over more than anything else, and this always works quite well. Taking up the new sticker trend seen in FIFA Ultimate Team, also in Score! Match it is possible to win new players, with their different roles and characteristics, to be included in the team, as well as being able to enhance players with bonuses. The progression in the game is marked by the continuous conquest of rewards that allow you to strengthen your team and expand the player base, although everything necessarily passes through the classic expectations that characterize the free-to-play structure. For basic actions, such as participating in a game or applying power-ups, the expenditure of in-game currency is required, but the most valuable material is the gems, which can be earned by winning games or bought in packs in the game. internal store. With these we can both buy new and rich bonus boxes or eliminate the waiting times for the opening of those conquered by playing, which can represent a strong temptation for the compulsive gambler but which shouldn't bother those who engage in sessions too much of play not too prolonged and therefore do not disdain any expectations.", "date": "2018-03-24", "grade": "7.5"}
