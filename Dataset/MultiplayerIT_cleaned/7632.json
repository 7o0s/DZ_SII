After having filled the current generation of spin-offs on laptops and mobile phones, the Japanese holding could not leave Kingdom Hearts fans without a worthy chapter that greeted the current home console of Sony, a historical partner since the opening bars of PlayStation One . Economic reasons aside, an unwritten law ignited the spirits of those who, at the end of 2006, were left with a bitter taste in their mouth to discover that Kingdom Hearts II was not the end of the saga, seeing an inevitable third chapter in the mists of the generation at doors. A legacy never entrusted to PlayStation 3, with a Tetsuya Nomura unable to avert, episode after episode, the increase of rather hostile considerations from fans towards the trend of developing new titles in the franchise on other platforms. Since its first, timid steps in the market, PlayStation 3 was absorbed by popular acclaim as a worthy heir for the conclusion of the trilogy. Even if not quite in the desired form, Kingdom Hearts finally arrives in high definition, bringing back a pleasant hint of melancholy a dozen years old, and it does it, in the Nomurian tradition, with a particularly eccentric title. The Square home compilation incorporates two playable chapters, respectively the first episode in a revised version and the Chain of Memories contained in the revived edition of the second chapter, extrapolated alternately from the I and II editions of the Final Mix +. As a side dish between one session and another, Nomura has inserted the sequences of 358/2 Days, a chapter for Nintendo DS, remastered to allow a seamless vision and discover the background of Roxas and Axel. What remains of the magic of Kingdom Hearts today? Eternal Peter Pan Naturally we are not talking about the sessions in the lands of Wonderland, but rather about the current ability of Kingdom Hearts to naturally bring back those dreamy atmospheres of many years ago, when inevitably we were all more carefree and had the advantage in making our own the messages of friendship and courage so dear in Nomura. The intrinsic strength of the effort born from the merger between Disney and Squaresoft has always been and only one: knowing how to ideally balance the charisma of the Square characters with the evergreen sympathy of the Disney ones, aided by an innovative plot and the soundtrack by Yoko Shimomura. Since those less inflated days Squaresoft has had time to accept Sakaguchi's resignation, merge with Enix, change president again and change its strategies in the gaming field, but respect and gratitude towards one of its main sagas remain strong. Thanks to the loss of the original assets, the Nomura team recreated the polygonal models, textures, environments and shades of the Kingdom Hearts: Final Mix + edition from the bases, thus allowing the title to present itself in dazzling form to the new generations of candidates passionate. Compared to its ancestor, this high-definition version carries a much brighter, cleaner overall picture, with full colors and textures that soften a now dated polygonal mass, to be added to the possibility of skipping cutscenes. In terms of content, Square resumes what was added at the time with the Final Mix + version: dynamic camera entrusted to the right stick, ~quick time events~, secret bosses, difficulty levels and additional cutscenes. The technical update was undoubtedly the main objective of the team: we would have appreciated better management of Sora's jump and collision points, as well as greater fluidity in accelerations and movements; Nomura evidently preferred not to distort the dry gameplay typical of the first Kingdom Hearts. Strengthened by its playful offer and unique atmosphere, what is proposed manages to satisfy historical fans, eager to get back to the worlds they have come to love, but not only them: Square Enix has managed in an excellent way to modernize the graphics, now ready to attract new fans, with a gameplay compromise that, even at the end of 2013, appears easily digestible thanks to the improvements made in the first Final Mix+. The sweetness of the first Kingdom Hearts remains unchanged, and equally charming, even after years. Kingdom Hearts 1.5 HD Remix brings the saga back to PlayStation 3: lots of content for old and new fans Hearts or spades? The Chain of Memories for Game Boy Advance was certainly an atypical chapter, but nevertheless it was not difficult for him to reach the million copies sold in North America alone. In 2004 the popularity of the brand was very strong and Square Enix chose to implement a car-based combat systemte, curious but at the same time suitable for the required portability specifications; taking up the settings of the first episode from scratch, the pocket chapter proposed somewhat difficult mechanics to manage but undoubtedly amusing. It is no coincidence that in 2007 the publisher included it in the second Final Mix+ collection, in a new three-dimensional guise in which to manage the decks more comfortably and with a less cryptic and more explanatory narrative direction. The second playable title included in this 1.5 HD Remix is exactly the high definition transposition of Re: Chain of Memories. Thanks to a certainly younger chronological age, the conversion work is visibly less ambitious as the visual distance that separates the 2007 remake from the first episode of 2002 is also lower. Here too there is a good effort to update the resolution and cleaning, but the work behind it is certainly less evident. Excluding the addition of QTEs and the dynamic camera, there are no playful differences compared to what was already seen in 2007: the introduction of keystrokes at events tightens boss fights to well-defined patterns, making the experience attractive even to those fans who had left the Game Boy Advance episode aside due to the obvious difficulty. Certainly the compartmentalized structure of the rooms and a progress system anchored to old dictates makes the game less universal for newcomers, helping to relegate it to its gameplay niche. The combat model can give great satisfaction, objectively more strategic than the first chapter, and as such requires much more time to be mastered and exploited in its entirety. It should be underlined how Square Enix has chosen not to redo the cutscenes by adding the lip sync, present in Kingdom Hearts II instead. Playstation 3 trophies Wide characterization for the 110 trophies offered, divided into 56 for the Final Mix, 48 for the Re: Chain of Memories and 6 for the 358/2 Days. To the progress in the adventure of Sora and Riku (only in Re: Chain of Memories) and the completion of the various difficulty levels are added the collectibles, the achievement of certain levels, the defeat of the secret bosses and the success of particular conditions in the fights. Salty ice creams The HD Remix package is completed by the remastering of the interlude scenes of Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, collected here, inserted in succession and alternated with the dialogues of the episode on DS. More than three hours of footage put the story of Roxas and Axel in the spotlight, guaranteeing an omniscient eye on those facts that by force of exclusivity were intended only for owners of the Nintendo laptop. In this case, the major work concerns the increase in resolution of the polygonal models compared to the Nintendo DS, much more evident in the sequences built with the game engine than those in computer graphics. Definitely the least profound part as it is not interactive, the high definition version of 358/2 Days offers a plot based on supporting actors brought into vogue mainly in the second episode, not present here: proposing scenes of these characters in this first collection remains a choice certainly singular. There is no doubt that Square Enix wanted to offer a first tranche of the Kingdom Hearts saga, a sort of taster for an inevitable second collection that leads to the third episode; however singular the chosen solution is wise and complete for the two playable episodes, a little less for the exclusively cinematographic part. The universe developed over the course of the episodes has led many fans to not be able to experience each single production, especially the titles for laptops, and the proposed collection contains what is needed to introduce the setting and the complex web of relationships and events created by Nomura.", "date": "2013-09-10", "grade": "8.8"}
