Here is our review of Pronty: Fishy Adventure, a simple but fun game. At the bottom of the sea A marine area of Pronty: Fishy Adventure Pronty: Fishy Adventure is what it sounds like: a sea-themed adventure, taking us into the future of humanity. People live in underwater cities (somewhat reminiscent of Bioshock's Rapture, we admit), threatened by half-animal, half-mechanical creatures. To defend the weakest, however, there are the guardians, man-fish hybrids who are able to act both in water and on land. We are one of them, a Pronty, on our first day of training. Next to us is a Bronty, a mechanical swordfish who is our friend but also our battle partner. In fact, Bronty also plays the role of a weapon. However, our adventure begins when a gigantic sea monster destroys our base and heads towards Royla, the main city of humans. Even without training, we have to answer Royla's call for help and go where we've never been. The journey that follows is simple on a narrative level. More than a plot (still present, but deliberately limited to a few events), the developers have sprinkled the game world with multiple collectibles that tell the context underlying the adventure and the story of individual people of Royla and what happened to him . The city, when we reach it, is in fact deserted and apart from a couple of characters who will be the guide, it will be a lonely journey between Pronty and Bronty. However, do not think that the presentation is careless, because the main plot events will be narrated through beautiful graphic novel-style animated sequences. One of the brightest areas of Pronty Fishy Adventure One of Pronty Fishy Adventure's main strengths, after all, is the graphics. The environments are always beautiful, with many details, multiple levels of depth, with animated elements and always different styles. From the darkest depths to the brightest skyscraper peaks, the adventure from 18Light Game Ltd. and FunZone Games is always a feast for the eyes. Even the enemies are very intriguing, a mix of marine animals and mechanical objects, characterized among other things to perfection thanks to the sound design, which makes them even more real and believable. The bossfights are also visually intriguing, always different. En garde! A group of enemies attack Pronty and Bronty Going beyond plot and visual presentation, Pronty Fishy Adventure offers some interesting ideas also on a playful level. The combat system, in fact, is equally divided between our two characters. As mentioned, Bronty is the duo's offensive weapon, while Pronty mostly has to avoid taking damage. However, this is only in the very early stages. In fact, our hybrid can take advantage of the dodge on an offensive level: passing through the enemies you mark them and, if hit by Bronty, they thus suffer much more damage. The goal of Pronty Fishy Adventure is to make us use both characters at the same time, in a sort of water ballet where the moves of the two go hand in hand. Sure, it's often enough to repeatedly hit the attack button or take advantage of Bronty's exorbitantly charged charge, but overall it works, especially thanks to the fact that both creatures have their own stamina bar to keep in check. Even more important are the Chips, equipment that will remind - for example - the amulets of Hollow Knight. We have a limited number of slots (which increase by finding specific objects) and we can equip one or more Chips that offer various upgrades, such as an increase in damage as Bronty's stamina decreases, longer shots, shots loaded with additional effects, but also resistances of various types. There are many upgrades and everyone will find their favorite combination also on the basis of the fighting style that will be more congenial to them. The Chips of Pronty Fishy Adventure allow you to seriously upgrade your characters Bosses have unique patterns and even common enemies often have to be approached differently, paying attention to their uniqueness. The clashes always work, even if - with the only exclusive of some optional bosses at the end of the game - the difficulty level of Pronty Fishy Adventure is more or less calibrated downwards. Exploration We will arrive in the most diverse places in Pronty Fishy Adventure The entire adventure has been designed to be simple, even at an exploratory level. The game map is diviknows in various areas that, in the final stages once you get all the powers, they tie back into each other in a nice way, but for the most part the exploration is fairly linear and the short cuts are a bonus. While proposing a bit of backtracking, therefore, Pronty Fishy Adventure is not a particularly structured metroidvania in terms of level design: it is always clear where to go, the map is not huge and there is not much freedom of approach. However, the game makes up for it with many small gimmicks. Since we can move in 360, the game doesn't offer platform sequences like a classic metroidvania, but includes small puzzle or speed challenges, taking advantage of the various special dodges that Pronty will learn. For example, we can become small to pass narrow spaces or exchange places with Bronty so as to arrive in places closed to us but accessible to mechanical fish, paying attention to traps, aquatic currents and various devices to be used to deactivate bulkheads and other elements that block the passage. The whole adventure is a mix of fighting, exploration and collecting upgrades for our characters, with some secrets scattered here and there. There are two completely optional endings and sections with additional bosses. In total, you can expect a good ten hours of gameplay for 100%. It's not an incredible duration compared to other titles, but the length is adequate for the type of work, the ideas and the amount of play. If there had been more content, however, we would not have complained and perhaps this is one of the best qualities of a game.", "date": "2021-11-27", "grade": "7.9"}
