{"name": "The Ramp", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-ramp-recensione.html", "text": "Having a purpose, a goal to pursue, is a characteristic that has always accompanied human nature. We are constantly looking for something, big or small. However, sometimes it's good to disconnect from everything and everyone so you can have some time for yourself. It often happens that you find yourself in front of a game and approach it with little interest, almost listlessly, just for the pleasure of doing nothing in particular. The Ramp was conceived precisely for those moments in which you want to switch off and do something completely useless, which gives no reward, other than the pleasure of an experience that flows unchallenged over our daily worries. Let's see, therefore, how this small title manages (or fails, depending on your point of view) to do all this in this review of The Ramp. A contained gameplay The Ramp: The object of the game is to have no goals The main goal of The Ramp is to have no goals. The player is prompted to choose one of the four available maps and start doing tricks in the way he prefers, without time limits or particular scores. During the very short initial tutorial, the very traditional movement system is illustrated: with the left stick you move, while with the right you perform tricks in mid-air; with the triggers you cling to the board; grinds are performed with the right lat; finally, with A or X (depending on the chosen pad) you go down, in order to take the boost before a jump, but also to better manage the landing and gain speed. The latter is a sort of ~ritual~, to be repeated every time you approach a ramp (press the button, release as soon as you take off, press the button again upon landing and release just before reaching the end of the ramp). descent). A recurring use that certainly activates that meditative and hypnotic part that the title wants to return, but which also allows you to add that extra pinch of challenge if you want to play in a more active way. For those who want to put themselves to the test, it is possible activate the Hardcore mode, much less permissive with the player, who requires an additional level of attention, since it is much easier to fall, especially after particularly risky evolutions. Minimal soul The Ramp: the visual sector devoted to the doctrine of the minimal From an audiovisual point of view, The Ramp is extremely simple, which is by no means a defect, rather a strength. The only information that appears on the screen are those indicating the stunts performed. For the rest, the philosophy pursued is that of the minimal, with a few well-calibrated colors and a toy aesthetic (after all, it is the developer himself who identifies the title in a ~digital toy~). thickness to the environment we find excellent management of lighting and textures. The characters, on the other hand, are a little less attractive and often clash with the game microworld. You can choose from four models, which differ in gender and skin color, but their workmanship isn't too convincing. It must be said, however, that during the game it is an element that is very little noticeable. What is sometimes a bit counterproductive and annoying is the game room, isometric and immobile. If it is functional in most of the moments of the game (it goes particularly well with the map of the giant ramp), it often does not allow a clear reading of the scene, especially of the depth, which almost always leads to calculation errors and related disastrous falls. Probably the choice, in this case, fell more on aesthetic rather than practical research.", "date": "2021-08-06", "grade": "8.8"}
