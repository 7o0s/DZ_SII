The credit goes largely to an independent market that has been able to exploit the new development and distribution tools to give new life to a genre that still has a lot to say. It matters little that the big studios are not interested in what has been a cornerstone of videogame entertainment for years. Indeed, today new ideas more often belong to those teams that are not crushed by the weight of the administrative machinery and can express themselves freely. Moon Studios fully falls into this category, thanks to a collective structure whose developers collaborate remotely, scattered in the four corners of the globe. The second fruit of this collaboration is Ori and the Blind Forest, a platform developed with Unity which over the past year has made itself known for its style and its emotional charge. And it is the latter that welcomes us first and with power in what we could define as a flagship indie from the library of a Microsoft that this time did not miss a great opportunity. It all starts with the classic feather carried by the wind but this time it is not a placid breeze that moves the most romantic of metaphors about destiny. What envelops the great oak is a terrible storm, and that feather is an unfortunate creature that has been swept away from home. Luck wants its light to attract the attention of Naru, a placid giant with rounded shapes who, when he approaches the feather, sees it transform into Ori, starting a friendship desired by destiny. An intense friendship, immersed in a nature that is generous with those who respect it and that envelops the two creatures, giving them moments to remember forever. But here comes the nefarious fate to disturb the peace again. The forest burns, the food is gone, the elements themselves are corrupted and nature is on the verge of catastrophe. The brave and strong Naru brings the last fruit to Ori and then surrenders. A reinvigorated Ori searches for food but it seems to be too late. And it is here that a ~metroidvania~-style platformer begins which already from the prologue, all played, shows an amazing attention to detail. The polygons aren't many but that doesn't matter. The whole forest moves, the detailed backgrounds flow smoothly while in the foreground shadows of strange creatures give further depth to the scene. Water is a little masterpiece with real-time reflections, believable waves and delicious physics. The atmospheric lighting stands out in contrast to a dismal and torn world. The character design is reminiscent of Japanese animation but declined in its modern, westernized hybrid, evident in the Disney-style animations of an Ori a little Stitch and a Naru who seems to blend Miyazaki's magical creatures with the Baloo of animation more exquisitely Yankee. The whole thing is then embellished with an almost cinematic cut, although linked to the side shot, which gives us well-kept animations and breathtaking visuals. The result is a title of few words but capable of conveying a wide range of emotions. The prologue, almost like a graphic adventure, is poignant and Ori and the Blind Forest masterfully exploits it as a springboard for an all-action gameplay. Ori and the Blind Forest is a title that aims high, jump after jump Constant evolution Despite the initial emotional load, Moon Studios' platformer is not one of those titles all poetry and little substance. After the prologue we take control of a very agile Ori who, in order to save his forest, must acquire and skillfully exploit a large number of powers and upgrades. The former are hidden in the maze of a world full of ravines, contraptions to activate and secrets as per the tradition of the genre. A key element of the experience, therefore, is the exploration of the map which is only one and gradually expands with new areas that can be reached at any time. But this is only possible if you have the right skill since several areas are initially inaccessible when our hero can just scamper and make a few shy leaps. Then, suddenly, a sanctuary begins the evolution of Ori's movement which is constantly enriched throughout the adventure, also allowing us to appreciate how the same section can be played in two completely different ways once a new special ability has been acquired. But mobility isn't the only thing growing as new areas unfold before us. To begin with, in the darkest ravines are scattered blue and green globes which respectively increase the approxfull of life and energy. The function of the lifeblood is the rather obvious one to make us more resistant while the increase in power affects different aspects of the gameplay. First of all, this energy allows you to open special doors that open to new areas but also allows, in combination with a rather generous timer, to save the game in any position on the map. Furthermore, what we could define as an essential resource to say the least allows you to load the basic attack to unleash a decidedly powerful explosion. This aspect is also one of the most controversial of the title, given that you have to remember to save continuously because the game does it automatically in very rare cases and, whoever does not remember, will find themselves having to re-face even very long sections of the game. This solution is really tricky and a little incomprehensible even from the point of view of a deliberately difficult game that finds further possibilities for evolution in combat. In fact, killing monsters is the most common way of obtaining experience points which guarantee points to be spent in three distinct skill trees. Some of the obtainable skills guarantee only passive advantages but constancy allows access to remarkable enhancements such as triple shot, reduction of damage suffered and even triple jump. Meanwhile, the gameplay is progressively enriched with new movement skills such as diving, parachuting, climbing and an ingenious ability that allows Ori to take a targeted leap in mid-air near energy sources, projectiles or enemies. It goes without saying that towards the end of the adventure there are many skills to take into account but this has not caused us any particular problems. The key mapping is spot on, the Xbox One joypad responds just fine to inputs and different abilities work intuitively depending on the situation. Xbox One goals Unlocking Ori and the Blind Forest achievements is almost exclusively a matter of patience. Completing the game guarantees over 500 points to which are added all the elementary objectives such as using a skill point, discovering a secret and so on. Then there are the classic progressive objectives which could require a second playthrough and a couple of objectives all focused on the skill which could instead require countless attempts. To unlock them it is in fact necessary to complete the game in less than three hours and complete it, even without time limits, without dying a single time. An acceptable compromise The gameplay is carefully studied and this emerges from the first moments. The basic attack plays an important role but does not require aim or particular skill. The shot, in fact, is automatically successful when the closest enemy is at a useful distance. And it's good that it is so given the high difficulty of some sessions that ask us to make countless leaps, avoid lasers and defeat different creatures without ever touching the ground. In short, movement always remains central and it is essential never to forget this in a title that confronts us with enemies designed to test our agility and which continually surprises us by adding ever new elements to the scenario. In Ori and the Blind Forest we have to face floods, gravitational reversals, special rocks that allow us to redirect the blows of enemies, magic mushrooms that react to our movement and, even more fearsome, physics. In the title Moon Studios this simple word translates into volleys of projectiles that make ever-changing parables, a character who slides on the edge of the platforms, monsters that slide on extremely detailed terrain, roll madly and make ever-changing movements. In Ori and the Blind Forest, reading the action is by no means simple and sometimes it is bordering on impossible. Proceeding with caution can help but things get decidedly tough when the dangers ahead are capable of disintegrating us with a single blow. A pinch of inertial thrust too much and you die. A jump where the terrain is rough and you die. An imperceptible inclination in the double jump and goodbye to existence and here in the most difficult sections, when for one reason or another it is necessary to perform dozens of consecutive movements, trial and error takes over and the demon of frustration shows his pleased grin. But it would be a shame to give up physics that gives us a slightly more lively and believable character, spectacular water to dive into and the thrill of surprise we haven't been used to for a long time. In essence, we can accept the compromise in a varied and rich title that offers us at least eight hoursof suggestive settings, always different challenges, excellent ideas and an almost perfect evolution of the gameplay. The curiosity to get to the bottom, in essence, remains solid despite the fact that sometimes you feel like pulling the pad against the screen. But it is said that it is not necessarily a defect especially for those who love a tough challenge that still does not prevent you from finishing the game. On the other hand, it is more difficult to defend the need, not very rare, of having to cross various areas that have just been explored to reach a new area. It should be the search for secrets that leads the player to retrace their steps and not redundant level design. Yet even in this solution we find the good since it forces us to notice the skill with which some challenges have been designed which are completely different if faced by following the road in reverse. Also Ori and the Blind Forest constantly pleases the eye with its pristine 1080p at 60 frames per second, globes of light, particles, fluttering leaves, blue sparks, burning logs and countless other details including delightful sound effects and a soundtrack perhaps not very original but exciting and definitely spot on. Sometimes there is a brief hiccup in the frame rate and the border elements placed in the foreground obscure the action resulting annoying. But both occurrences are quite rare and do not affect an experience that ends up straight in the Olympus of platformers and stands out both on Xbox one and on PC in terms of the relationship between quality and price.", "date": "2015-03-11", "grade": "9.0"}
