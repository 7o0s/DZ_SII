{"name": "Enter the Matrix", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/enter-the-matrix_b.html", "text": "Bullet time Enter the Matrix is, and could not be anything else, an action game: in the vast majority of levels created by the US team, the player must in fact take on the role of the protagonists Ghost or Niobe, exploring fairly large settings and obviously full of enemies to face. Already these few lines allow us to introduce the first defect of Enter the Matrix, or the lack of attractiveness of the two characters available; the decision by Shiny and the Wachowski brothers, who closely supervised the making of the game, not to put Neo, Trinity or Morpheus in the foreground undoubtedly allowed us to embrace a plot parallel to that of the film, but equally certainly it took something away from the desirability of the product. Nonetheless, the characterization of Ghost and Niobe is decidedly superficial, thus making it difficult for the player to identify with them. Having closed this discussion, the mechanics studied by David Perry's team must therefore be described: in a nutshell, very specific objectives are provided at the beginning of each level, which often and willingly turn out to be modified or expanded in the middle of the action. Clearly, great emphasis has been given to the combat phases, which have made the Matrix film saga so famous; for this reason, the player has 3 attack buttons available, respectively delegated to kicks, punches and holds of various types. The combination of these keys gives rise to spectacular hand-to-hand fight sequences, for large stretches truly faithful to those admired on the big screen; the obvious inclusion of the focus key, i.e. the ~bullet time~ that made Max Payne famous, does nothing but give the latter a further relevance to the film, as well as obviously allowing the protagonist to more easily get the better of the opponents. As if that weren't enough, the use of focus also allows the execution of otherwise impossible maneuvers, such as walking along walls, dodging bullets or making very long jumps. Unfortunately, once the enthusiasm for the aforementioned spectacularity of the fights has been overcome, the limits of a system too oriented towards button mashing emerge, without the choice of techniques to be adopted having a real need beyond the purely aesthetic one. In addition to unarmed combat, there is obviously the ability to use a vast arsenal of weapons of various types, from pistols to sniper rifles; however, the enemies are equally armed, often making the loss of energy something absolutely inevitable. At this point, here is yet another oddity adopted by Shiny: similarly to the focus bar, the energy bar also recharges automatically, among other things quite quickly. This questionable choice makes the fights often solvable in a simple head-on attack, only to then hide for a few moments away from dangers in the event that energy starts to run low; all this benefited from the limited artificial intelligence programmed by David Perry's boys, with opponents unable to go and track down the protagonist perhaps hidden behind a column five meters away. The level design, too linear and monotonous, can also be criticized: without a doubt, the primary intention of the Wachowskis was to create a video game accessible to anyone, but this cannot justify the flatness that surrounds some settings. Matrix for everyone To make the most of one of the most important and profitable licenses ever, Atari has decided to convert Enter The Matrix for practically every existing platform: the three next gen consoles and the PC. The differences between the various versions from a purely playful point of view are minimal: the console versions are better, but only slightly, thanks to a control system, the pad, more suited to the type of game. The technical differences are more marked. Surprisingly, the best graphically most satisfying version is the GameCube, closely followed by Xbox. Bringing up the rear PlayStation 2: the engine has clearly not been optimized properly to take advantage of EE and GS, and it shows. I am the chosen one Although the third-person action levels make up the bulk of Enter the Matrix's offering, Shiny wanted to break up the monotony by inserting sections of driving behind the wheel of a car or aboard Niobe's shuttle; in both cases, if the player has chosen the female protagonist then he will actually have to lead the vehicle, choosing Ghost instead he will be called to fire at anyone who tries to get in the way and slow down the race. Although the idea may appear on paper at least appreciable, in reality the sections dthe drives are nothing short of terrible, especially if you have to drive the car on duty: the physics of the vehicles is ridiculous, and the bumps are managed in a way that makes your skin crawl. From a graphic point of view, Enter the Matrix hardly reaches the sufficiency: the polygonal models of the characters appear all in all valid, but the settings are on the contrary bare, architecturally hyper-simplistic and covered with textures of variable quality. The animations deserve a separate discussion: although those relating to the fights are appreciable and quite varied, on the other hand, however, those relating to running or climbing stairs are bordering on the grotesque. On balance then, what is saved from Enter the Matrix? Undoubtedly the screenplay, capable of expanding the events narrated in the film to the delight of all fans of the saga: what happens in the video game intersects perfectly with the facts narrated in the film through sequences both in FMV and with the graphics engine, and from this point of view the hand of the Wachowskis can be seen completely. The plot of the Shiny title is able to clarify and expand numerous aspects of the Matrix Reloaded, thus completely redefining the concept of tie-in. This aspect somehow also affects the sphere of gameplay: the desire to expand knowledge of the world of the Matrix could, for fans of the saga, undoubtedly be stronger than the structural defects of the Atari production. On the other hand, the sound is on decidedly high levels, to be promoted both as regards the songs and the dubbing; a few steps below the effects, which deserved more attention. Comment Reading the text of our review, one could hardly justify the numerical vote that we instead assign to Enter the Matrix; the defects listed are in fact quite heavy and affect practically every aspect of Shiny's effort which, probably due to the timing to be respected at all costs, appears on balance really incomplete and devoid of the finishing touches that would have been appropriate to carry out. Nonetheless, Enter the Matrix was designed for fans of the series, and was intended as a piece of the script that those who adored the Wachowski brothers' creature will hardly be able to deprive themselves of. This target audience, we are sure, will be able to overlook most of the problems present in Atari production, while appreciating all the more or less obvious references to the events narrated in the films. For this reason, those who feel that they do not have enough interest in the world of the Matrix to be able to turn a blind eye to all the defects described in the text will probably do better to lower our global by one point and meditate more than once on a possible purchase. Pros: Perfectly pigeonholed into the Matrix world Excellent original script Good soundtrack Fun, at least during the first few levels Cons: Barely adequate graphics with some bad animations Big AI bugs and questionable gameplay choices Absolutely terrible driving sections The life of the tie-in programmer lasts: creativity is forcibly limited by the relevance to a concept to be reproduced as faithfully as possible, and to make matters worse the percentages of success -critical, certainly not commercial- are nothing short of minimal. However, this semi-apocalyptic premise does not seem to have intimidated Shiny, David Perry's softco, which on the contrary has willingly accepted to take care of the videogame transposition of the second chapter of the film saga created by the Wachowski brothers.", "date": "2003-05-31", "grade": null}
