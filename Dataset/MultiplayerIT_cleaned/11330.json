{"name": "Buzz!: Quiz TV - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/buzz-quiz-tv-recensione.html", "text": "More of everything In the extra-luxury package of the Sony title there are four controllers: ergonomic, colorful, but above all wireless, which therefore avoid a chaotic intertwining of wires in games with multiple players. The first novelty of the quiz is that, compared to previous incarnations, the questions touch on all topics. For the first time the formula of themed episodes gives way to a cauldron of questions on sport, cinema, music, culture and customs. Each of these subjects is then divided into sub-topics: in music, for example, we find modern music, 80s music and dated music. The questions are usually simply written on the screen but it is also possible to come across clips from films, songs or music videos. In short, something for all tastes, consequently the quiz invites all age groups to play, children, parents and grandparents included. From a purely content point of view, the new episode on the Sony flagship boasts some new games and a decidedly vast and well-implemented online component. After choosing our alter egos from a series of very funny characters such as the Elvis clone, the nerd, the mime, the 80s girl or the Japanese robot, we have to give them a sound from the many available. So here we find ourselves in front of alarms, bells, burps (?!), Mexican trumpets, crying babies and many others. The combinations are very hilarious, also thanks to the ironic and parodic characterizations of the participants, who often and willingly manage to elicit a few laughs. Having grabbed the buzzer, you enter the arena by engaging in a series of rather varied and never too repetitive games: in addition to the classic ~fastest finger~ we find the ~pass the bomb~, steal points and throwing the cake. Finally, the final game sees the contestants sit on a sort of raised ramp that visually represents the score. Whoever makes a mistake falls lower and lower, thanks to this system an advantage of many points does not guarantee a certain victory, thus giving a lot of pathos and tension to the last round. Another gem is that during a game, at the change of round whoever has the lowest score will choose the next topic, which adds an extra pinch of salt to the already tasty Sony dish. 8 perfect number Sony's game lives entirely on the multiplayer/co-op factor. Abusing terminologies so dear to Anglo-Saxon colleagues, we could define Buzz!: Quiz TV the triumph of casual gaming, something that goes far beyond the simple game of harp for everyone. The test carried out in the editorial office was exemplary in immediately clarifying the double soul of the title. Playing one only scratches the tip of the iceberg of an extremely rich and fun gameplay. The fun is not lacking, but there is a lack of several players close on the same sofa who hide their thumb on the buzzer so as not to benefit the nearby competitor. Four local players is the perfect number, eight is close to the sublime, thirty-two online (in teams) Buzz reaches peaks of fun that few ~easy~ titles can reach. The questions, many, an official figure speaks of more than five thousand questions, have the advantage of never repeating themselves, consequently, even after many games, it is very difficult to come across quizzes that have already been seen. Anyone who feared the repetition of a criticality that had afflicted previous incarnations can sleep peacefully. It is also possible to write your own questions, on one or more topics and then make them available through an ad hoc website, to the entire community of Buzz users or just to your friends, effectively increasing longevity thanks to the users themselves of the title. Additionally, additional questions can be downloaded directly from PlayStation Store. A title therefore virtually infinite, provided of course that you are strongly interested in a type of game of this genre. The strong online component therefore seems to be the access key for the birth of a strong and fierce community, where it is possible to imagine, in view of Home, the definitive union between casual gaming and social gaming. The strong online component therefore seems to be the access key for the birth of a strong and fierce community, where it is possible to imagine, in view of Home, the definitive union between casual gaming and social gaming 8 perfect number Sony has done a good job from a technical point of view, and given the reference target, not exactly hardcore gamers attentive to single pixels and single jaggies, has managed to pack a title that is very nice to look at, in its extreme, but very effective simplicity. Buzz!: Quiz TV simply updates what was seen in previous incarnations, eif it's not the special effects that amaze us, it's the presenter and the competitors themselves that are the flagships of the work done by the developers. The first, with very short legs and a hypertrophic big head, won't hesitate to make fun of the weakest competitors with vitriolic comments. The dialogues are decidedly well written, funny, ironic and caustic, absolutely on par with those that will be possible to hear between real competitors in crowded multiplayer games. The avatars to choose from, as already written previously, in addition to being well characterized, are equipped with a set of very full-bodied peculiar animations which, even if in the long run they can become quite repetitive, are definitely funny, in keeping with the general register of the game. Comment Buzz!: Quiz TV represents the pinnacle of the casual genre at Sony. Like and more than a title like Singstar, the game represents a perfect product capable of enthralling everyone, a transversal production that succeeds in bringing together very disparate categories of players on the same sofa, from hardcore gamers to visiting grandfathers. Extremely varied, well thought out, with an excellent online component and never repetitive, and also embellished by a respectable technical, audio and video part, thanks to the excellent characterization of the competitors and the presenter. It has only one flaw, in fact playing alone the games quickly become rather boring despite the infinite amount of questions available. However, a discounted price to pay given that the game is completely devoted to use by more players. A little jewel, worthy heir to the great successes appreciated on PlayStation 2. Pros Many questions Various and never repetitive games Excellent online component Cons Voted almost exclusively for use by more players", "date": "2008-06-27", "grade": null}
