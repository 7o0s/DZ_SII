In fact, the new control system manages to give a title like Super Laser a new appeal, almost making us forget that many ~mature~ users of today already played something similar 20 years ago... On the contrary, for new gamers, accustomed to to avalanches of FPS on PC and Console or hackneyed puzzle games on the iPhone, the return to doing damage in space could definitely be a welcome change. Powder fire Super Laser is therefore a classic vertical scrolling shooter with a space setting. At the controls of a ship and armed to the teeth, the sole (and predictable) purpose of the game will be to shoot anything that moves, whether they are enemy aircraft, horrendous creatures or dangerous meteorites. Unlike the first and unforgettable exponents of the genre, such as Space Invaders and later Galaga, the spaceship is not bound to remain at the bottom of the screen moving only horizontally, but will be able to roam throughout the game area, like another historical cornerstone such as Xevious, also available in the Xbox Live Live Arcade. A lot of action therefore, without forgetting however a minimum of tactics, necessary to bring down certain categories of main enemies; for some of these in fact it will be necessary to find from time to time the weak point on which to concentrate the attacks, on pain of wasting ammunition (in any case infinite), time and lives (which instead are only 3). In order for a title like this to be successful on a particular platform like the iPhone, however, as mentioned in the introduction, a more than balanced implementation of the commands is required; from this point of view Super Laser does not disappoint, leaving the user the choice between three different control methods. In fact, we will be able to select the simple touchscreen, that is, dragging the ship along the entire screen by placing the finger immediately behind it and moving it in real time; the virtual analog stick located at the bottom left, on the model of the movement controls of football games for example, or via the iPhone's accelerometer, thus physically shaking the phone to move the aircraft. On balance, however, the most comfortable option remains the first, precisely because of the greater sensation of precision that one gets by controlling the ship's movements directly with the finger, but of course it is possible to calibrate and adjust the sensitivity for all three types of input. In order to make the gameplay easier and relieve the player of a concern, the virtual key dedicated to fire has been removed, to be touched until you drop: the ship itself will shoot on its own to the bitter end, obviously remaining our task to aim for the right objectives. Speaking of weapons, which are obviously one of the key elements of any self-respecting shooter, even in Super Laser there is certainly no lack of variety: you will have double, triple or rapid burst cannons, directional projectiles (which fire in 3 or in 5 directions simultaneously) and the laser; to this basic arsenal, which can be upgraded thanks to the bonuses released by killing a particular type of enemy ship, are added the very useful Orbiters, sort of active shields that will be positioned once acquired at the 4 corners of the ship. Characteristic of these powerful weapons is to absorb enemy blows but above all to unleash, through a viewfinder placed in front of the aircraft, a storm of crossed lasers towards any reported adversary; in the presence of all 4 Orbiters and in case of quadruple aiming at the same enemy, the resulting lasers will merge into a single very powerful super beam that will cause huge damage. Finally, the series of bonuses are completed by the multipliers for points and the classic upgrades for health and additional life. However, where the difference between this title and its illustrious historical ancestors becomes more marked, it is certainly under the technical aspect: the graphics are in fact very accurate, with detailed environments, various and defined weapons and vehicles and sometimes truly impressive enemies, often inspired by creepy insects. A particular mention goes to the effects of the explosions, reproduced so well as to create showy drops in framerate on the iPhone 3G, especially towards the last levels; however, the problem is very limited by launching the game after restarting the terminal, while no problem occurs on the more performing 3GS. Longevity is also goodnerale, thanks to the 6 rather diversified game worlds and with inspired settings, all to be completed with challenging boss battles. The seventh stage, dedicated entirely to the fight with the last super creature, is not a real level but will be particularly difficult to overcome already on normal difficulty. The sound does its duty very well, thanks to sparkling accompanying music and the excellent effects of the explosions and the cries of the enemies. Finally, there is no shortage of the increasingly popular Plus+ achievements, which while waiting for the promised Apple Game Center, give the target hunters great satisfaction.
