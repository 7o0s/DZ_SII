{"name": "Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/age-of-wonders-shadow-magic.html", "text": "The Age of Expansions Just as 2002 can easily be considered a golden year for RPG lovers, with the release of big titles and unexpected gems, 2003 can be considered the year of expansions. Frozen Throne, Bloodmoon, Shadows of Undrentide, the two expansions of Disciples 2 and of course Shadow Magic, the anomalous new chapter in the exciting Age of Wonders saga. I speak of anomaly because Shadow Magic is not exactly an expansion, presenting itself as a game in its own right, nor can it be considered as the third chapter of the series being a revised and corrected reissue of the original Wizard's Throne. In practice, with Shadow Magic we find ourselves with a kind of version 2.5 of Age of Wonders 2, same graphics engine, same game engine, same interface, same gameplay: for this reason, if you want to learn more about the basic structure of AOW2, I refer you to our review by Wizard's Throne. But don't be misled! Nonetheless, the differences are many and even if they do not change the intimate nature of AOW2, they contribute to making Shadow Magic the most complete and satisfying chapter of the series. The news The novelties that most catch the eye are the new game campaign, the new races, the new buildings and the special units unique to each race. The new game campaign puts us in the role of several heroes in a crescendo of pathos and difficulties against an alien and cruel enemy who tries to take over the land of our heroes while this is weak due to the conflict for the hegemony of the wizards that has just ended . The campaign therefore presents one of the three new races as an enemy and the others as allies, in detail these are: Shadow Demons An army of hideous creatures descended upon the continent after Merlin's ascension to the wizarding throne, our sworn enemies in the game's campaign. Syron Ancient enemies of the Shadow Demons: they fought against them for a long time and unfortunately they lost, becoming a people of slaves, horribly subjected to the will of the Shadow Demons. Nomads A people of wanderers after the abandonment of their God Yaka: they live in the desert expanses dreaming of the rebirth of their domain. In addition to the addition of these new races Shadow magic presents a complete restyling of the existing races to make the necessary corrections in the balance of the units and to add a building and a unique fighting unit per race. This rebalancing operation is to be considered extremely important since it substantially modifies the style of play from Wizard's Throne with a view to reasoned renewal: units that were previously considered weak are now much more useful, units that were previously considered indispensable are now little useful without proper support, and so on. The news The tactical phase of combat has also been restructured with the introduction of a faster siege mechanism and the addition of surrender in the combat options. The game campaign is very stimulating due to the continuous dialogue between the units that inform the player of the steps to take as he proceeds in the scenario or of the peculiarities of the area he is visiting. This creates a great sense of involvement even if it involves a very high level of scripting of events in the game campaign. It often happens that if you don't do exactly as planned, you invariably lose the campaign scenario: this could make those who are accustomed to achieving the objectives turn up their noses, but through their own paths, not through the paths chosen by the programmers. The needle of the balance Aside from the immediately visible novelties, one addition that may not immediately strike the eye makes Shadow Magic a far better product than Wizard's Throne: the random scenario generator. Strategy games are divided into two broad categories: those with a turn-based structure and those in real time; in turn they can enjoy the presence of a random generator of scenarios or not. Among the games without a random generator of scenarios we can remember Warcraft III or Disciples 2: they do not aim at a highly refined artificial intelligence since the balancing of the game campaign is not provided by complex and articulated AI algorithms, but by heavy scripting, that is, almost everything in these games is thought out and implemented in advance by the programmer, while the player can only follow the pre-established path. This does not mean that the player's freedom of action is limited, but it does mean that the movements of enemy troops are pre-regulated and not processed in real time. Obviously this is not entirely true, it remains to the intelligwithout artificial the production and movement of the troops created in run-time, but if you see well the management of the latter is not as optimal as the management of the pre-existing troops in the game map. The needle of the balance On the other hand, in games such as Rise of Nations, Age of Empires, Civilization III, Warlords and now Shadow Magic, the presence of a random generator of scenarios involves the elaboration of a refined artificial intelligence, which must be adaptable to any eventuality and to any event. The random scenario is unknown to both the computer and the player: the computer has to work out a wide-ranging strategy having no pre-calculated scripting base, nor any pre-constructed event to lean on. This is why the artificial intelligence of games like Warlords or Civilization III is so important and so much has been spent to make it ~almost human~, the AI in these games becomes the pivot on which the actual enjoyment of the player is based. To give an example, in games without a random scenario generator we could only play the campaign: in the scenarios of this campaign the programmers will have already set the resources, the enemies who occupy the key points of the map, the number of cities and will have already set their future production. When the player moves through these scenarios, pre-calculated events will be triggered as he passes, telling the computer exactly what to do and how to do it. In a random scenario, however, the resources, cities, routes and so on are created randomly and the AI will have to be so complex as to know how to move, which priorities to give, which resources to aim for until the elaboration of an authentic wide-ranging strategy that also takes into account the player's movements. The needle of the balance The artificial intelligence in Shadow Magic is much improved compared to the original title thanks to the introduction of the random generator of scenarios: this proves to be extremely rich both in wizards for the quick creation of the preferred scenario (conquest, management, etc...) and in advanced options for setting every minimum detail. The random scenario generator makes Shadow Magic a truly complete strategy game with almost infinite longevity In conclusion Do Shadow Magic's features justify the price of a new game, or can you settle for Wizard's Throne? This is ultimately the question we all have to ask ourselves. Surely in terms of changes to a first quick examination the answer would be no: same gameplay, same graphics, same game rules engine, same music (apart from the addition of a few new pieces). Three new races would not be enough to change the judgment if Shadow Magic lacked the random scenario generator. The addition of this feature has led to the rebalancing of all races, the remaking of artificial intelligence to give us a game tool that makes the title long-lived and complete as never before. In conclusion Of course there is regret for the lack of the original Wizard's Throne campaign which was certainly more than valid, but in view of the new AI it probably would have been too complex to restructure all the scripting of the game campaign. Not bad, the new Shadow Magic campaign will not make us regret Merlin's wanderings around the Continent. Certainly the new AI has led to a disproportionate increase in the processing of opponents' turns: for example in the third scenario of the elves, when playing against 7 opponents, you literally have time to finish a cigarette while waiting for all opponents to finish their turn ! It's a little better when playing in continuous shift mode, here you only have time to smoke half of it. In conclusion These are all flaws that do not ruin an overall good game, sold at a very attractive price, in line with Cidiverte's commendable pricing policy, accompanied by a rich and huge 192-page fully localized printed manual. However, the game is not localized and this is a real shame, especially considering that Wizard's Throne was impeccably translated into our Italian language. Thanks to Silvia ~Morgana~ who helped me write this article. Pros: Advantageous selling price. Printed manual of 192 pages in Italian. Random scenario generator. Cons: Game in English. The original campaign of AOW2: Wizard's Throne is missing. Infuriating turn wait times for many opponents. The long war for control of the Throne of Wizards had just ended and a new deadly danger immediately presented itself in the magical lands of the age of wonders. Adark, arcane and alien danger that would have bent and corrupted everything in its path if a handful of brave heroes, of different races, in different places had not unsheathed their weapons to counter it. So welcome to the fertile and enchanted forests of the Elves, in the arid expanses of fiery sand, in the steep peaks of deep valleys to wage a war of survival in an era that is slowly beginning to revive after the cataclysm of the last conflict. Welcome to the age of wonders!", "date": "2003-08-20", "grade": null}
