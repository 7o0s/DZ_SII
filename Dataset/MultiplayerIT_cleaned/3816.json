{"name": "Apex Legends", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/apex-legends-recensione.html", "text": "Apex Legends is a title you'll be hearing a lot about in the months to come, there's no doubt about that. The surprise launch of the game on PC, PS4 and Xbox One represents something quite unprecedented in the current gaming landscape, where inevitably the productions must be announced some time in advance in order to create a certain expectation on the part of the users. Aware that the discussion would have easily focused on the presence of prize funds and microtransactions, Electronic Arts has therefore thought of a sudden debut with Respawn Entertainment, letting the game speak for itself and not the inevitable controversies on the free-to-play model adopted for the occasion. The choice turned out to be spot on, to say the least, if we consider that in the first seven days the title totaled 25 million players, filling up with broadcasts on Twitch and going to undermine the well-established dominance of Fortnite, whose authors tried to limit the damage by investing more in marketing. As the wise men say, however, the water cannot be stopped with your hands and it is now clear how Apex Legends has become the progenitor of a new generation of battle royale. Characters and microtransactions Apex Legends is set in the same universe as Titanfall and therefore shares its futuristic setting, even if the events represented take place after the end of the Frontier war, within the insidious Foreign Lands: abandoned, looted regions, in which life it's cheap and the survivors, fighters and criminals compete in the Apex Games for glory, money and maybe a way to leave. There are eight characters that the title makes available right away, two of which can only be unlocked through the disbursement of 12,000 legend tokens or 750 Apex coins: the former represent virtual currency, obtainable more or less quickly depending on one's performance in -game, while the latter can only be purchased from the point of view of the traditional paid packages, with a basic exchange rate of approximately 1 euro for 100 coins. All the rest are aesthetic customizations, obtainable from game to game or by spending real money, in a very similar way to the aforementioned Fortnite: there are no objects capable of providing an advantage during the clashes, therefore the experience is fortunately far from a pay to win style approach. The cast of Legends appears guessed and well characterized, with each character being made unique by a different set of skills. Gibraltar, the fearsome armored Samoan, automatically activates energy shields when using the iron sight, can generate a dome barrier to protect a small area and rain down fire on opponents with his special. Lifeline is instead the traditional support unit, a fast and elusive fighter, who can operate a life-restoring drone and call from above the dispatch of a module full of rare resources. Bangalore is a skilled and precise mercenary, well balanced, capable of throwing smoke bombs to generate chaos during a firefight, while Bloodhound is a mysterious and deadly warrior, equipped with devices that track the position of enemies. The Pathfinder android is the only character equipped with a grappling hook as a rechargeable ability, whereas Wraith is a sort of ninja, capable of transforming into a shadow to escape any sorties, hide and return fire. The two unlockable characters are instead Caustic and Mirage: the first is apparently slow and heavy, but can use poisonous bombs that also allow him to barricade himself in a structure by playing while waiting, while the second can create very useful bait-holograms to outshine your opponents. Gameplay and structure The rules of Apex Legends are those that battle royale fans know well, but with some interesting variations. At present the matches are open to a maximum of sixty participants, organized solely with a view to teams of three components, even if the solo and duo modes could find a place in the next updates. At the start of the match, the order of selection of the character among the three companions is drawn, then in the same way one of the players is invested with the title of ~jumpmaster~ and decides both when to jump from the transport ship and where to land, even if the position can be sold and companions can eventually decide to ~disengage~ to head to a different part of the map. Once on the ground, quickly explore your surroundings for weapons, ammo, armor, medkits, and energy shield batteries, trying to build your own setup during the game through the discovery of increasingly performing objects, higher grade armor, accessories that improve the stability and accuracy of the rifles, as well as backpacks that allow you to increase the capacity of an inventory that is necessarily very limited . Then we move on to action, with the narrowing of the scenario which is punctuated by rounds with gradually shorter duration, in order to make the situation explosive very quickly and avoid dead moments during the game. The gunplay is the same as Titanfall, solid and consistent, with a rather varied selection of tools that allows you to choose (with a little luck, of course) the approach we think is best. Light machine guns or a nice shotgun? A sniper rifle for long shots or a nimble, lightweight pistol to target running opponents? Or a well-equipped assault rifle that can prove effective in mid-range engagements? The goodness of the arsenal is mixed with the passive and active skills of the characters to create a mix of thickness, which exploited to the fullest can make the difference on the battlefield. However, the team remains a fundamental factor: if you happen to be in a team in which each component goes about its own business, disinterested in the others, it will be difficult for you to reach the final stages of the match. Otherwise, organizing with friends and also looking at balance when selecting characters can produce important results. Not necessarily with an open microphone: an intelligent tag system assigned to the back keys allows you to quickly report the presence of enemies in the area, indicate a point to move to or the availability of objects and weapons for your companions. Although Apex Legends' time-to-kill is relatively long, even more so when using advanced armor, finding yourself alone facing two or three opponents represents an almost certain game over. Here, however, another novelty of the game comes into play: staying down does not necessarily mean the end of the game, because a partner can help us get back on our feet or, if the elimination has been completed by the enemy, collect ours ~ nameplate~ within a certain time limit and bring it to a respawn point for us to return to the battlefield. Speaking of killings, as in Titanfall, the finishers are also present here, which can give points and satisfaction to those who perform them, but also dangerously expose them to enemy fire in the middle of the animation. On the other hand, as repeatedly underlined, the acrobatic mechanics of the Pilots (wallrun and double jumps) are missing, which added an unprecedented dynamism to the gameplay; just as there are no mechs, capable of changing the cards on the table by adding further tactical depth to the action. Will we ever see them in Apex Legends? The map In the test of Apex Legends published immediately after the launch of the game we had expressed some doubts about the design of the Canyon of the Kings map, necessarily derivative of the assets seen in the two chapters of Titanfall. Well, there is no doubt that the authors had to make such a choice, on the one hand for a question of narrative coherence (the game is still set in the same universe), on the other for obvious budget requirements (the creation of the scenarios has a considerable impact on development costs), and the result is that of a setting built using an editor, devoid of a precise personality. Beyond the purely aesthetic issues, however, over the hours we have found the solutions adopted by Respawn Entertainment to be guessed and consistent with regard to the subdivision of the areas, the open territories that separate one district from another, the conception of containers as a source prime of equipment but their disposition dangerously exposed. There is a good balance between closed and open places, and although the latter are inevitably predominant, there is no shortage of rocks or barriers to take shelter behind in case you are targeted by an enemy team, even from a long distance. The presence of ziplines allows you to quickly cover some sections, both uphill and downhill, and the very ability of the characters to slide where possible proves to be really useful to avoid spending too much time at the mercy of potential snipers. The shrinkage of the map, which as mentioned occurs at increasingly shorter intervals during the game, sees the advance of an energy barrier that consumes vital energy if you end up over the border at the wrong time, but fortunately at a moderate speed: running at full speed towards the center of the scenario, after having laid down their weapons to be faster, you can still get away with it. Playstation 4 trophies Apex Legends currently includes only twelve Trophies, which of course are unlocked by completing certain in-game actions for the first time (healing a companion, finding the complete equipment of a weapon, winning a game with the various characters). There are obviously some ~numeric~ achievements, such as the one that rewards 5000 damage points, five times as a Jumpmaster and reaching level 50. Graphics and sound Apex Legends uses the same graphics engine as Titanfall 2, in this case a modified version of the Source Engine: it is an obvious choice in view of the discussion we have already made regarding asset management, but which once again proves to be spot on , effective and functional with respect to gameplay needs. The map on which you fight is huge and loads in a matter of seconds, which undoubtedly represents an excellent result in terms of the immediacy of the experience: long loads are the last thing you would expect from a good battle royale , and from this point of view the guys from Respawn Entertainment have done nothing wrong. It is also interesting to note how the authors have been able to characterize the scenario well, trying to enhance everything with high quality shadows, ambient occlusion and an excellent drawing distance, and avoiding repetitive landscapes or overly generic solutions. In this regard, the cast of characters designed for Apex Legends seemed to us to be very valid, with several interesting ideas, an excellent visual variety (which is also reflected in practice, which is fundamental) and a rather accurate set of animations, which manage to bring together the need to convincingly represent motion and do so within a netcode that almost always appears very robust, with very few concessions to latency. The PlayStation 4 Pro version of the game, object of our tests, uses a dynamic resolution that often passes from 1080p to 1440p, although in some cases it can go down further: the priority is clearly the frame rate, and on this front the performances are confirmed solid, with a stable 60 frames in the vast majority of cases.", "date": "2019-02-12", "grade": "8.5"}
