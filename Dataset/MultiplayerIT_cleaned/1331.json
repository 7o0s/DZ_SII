{"name": "This is Football 2004", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/this-is-football-2007.html", "text": "Road to Euro 2004 The game modes present in TIF 2004 are really many and offer the gamer a wide choice of competitions to participate in, and consequently an excellent longevity. 900 teams including national teams, clubs, invented teams and Old Classics (from the record-breaking Real Madrid to Platini's legendary Juventus), and 18,000 players with their real names, will compete for the many trophies available at TIF 2004. As usual necessary for every self-respecting football game there are the canonical Friendly, the national championships (there are even the Arab and Japanese football tournaments) and internationals, customized and non-custom cups, to access which you will have to get a good placement in the ~ Season~, and a very interesting Career mode that will put you in the shoes of a coach who, starting from the school teams of the high schools, tries to climb up to Serie A on the bench. In this regard, it is fun to play driving perhaps, say, the Liceo Dante Alighieri on the fields behind the schools or near the gyms, whose squad is made up of young people with absolutely familiar names, such as F. Maldini and L. Scarpi, midfielder and striker respectively. There is also this R. Guariniello Has a namesake or the famous Piedmontese magistrate also infiltrated video games to discover the doping phenomenon? We will never know This is football? Nothing to complain, therefore, about the many methods offered by the SCEE title and the completeness of the various menus (read: ~navigability~ and immediacy). If anything, the problem arises later, when we are preparing to take the field... Once the formations have been set and we have witnessed the now usual entrance on the pitch of the two teams, the disputes begin. And here falls the donkey, as some would say. While on the one hand one cannot fail to notice the attention paid by the graphics in the construction of the stadiums and the public, the latter not ~spread~ on the stands but entirely in 3D and a certain attention to detail surrounding the football event itself (the brand new celebrations that include close-ups of a group of fans or benches while rejoicing for a marking are splendid in this sense), on the other hand, one cannot defer the other, unfortunately negative, videogame aspects. A video game is obviously not just aesthetics. It is, above all, playability, fun. Well, from this point of view TIF 2004 shows several shortcomings. The London Studio programmers who created the game on behalf of SCEE, had hinted right from its presentation to the press that they would try to fill the biggest gaps in the saga, which has always been the Achilles' heel of production: the AI of football players and ball physics, in a word, the basis of the gameplay of any sports simulation. Unfortunately, however, this was not the case in reality. The playability of This is Football 2004 is clearly arcade, it has nothing to do with a real simulation, and therefore it is very reminiscent of the first episode of the series on Psx, in any case not skimping on gaps even in the arcade part. Online Game One of the positive aspects of This is Football 2004 consists in its mode reserved for online play: it is in fact the first football title for consoles that can be played by 8 players at the same time on the internet. Just connect the Ps2 to the network with the appropriate gadget and find other friends connected to the server and the game is done. In fact, TIF allows users to split into two groups of 4 players per team and to give life to authentic virtual challenges. From this point of view, the new SCEE product offers an online gaming experience clearly superior to that of FIFA 2004. If it is true that the EA title was the first to cross the boundaries of the online soccer game, it is also true that it has only done in a mode that includes one-on-one challenges. So at least here TIF manages to emerge from the competition. A further interesting aspect of the online mode of TIF is undoubtedly made up of a particular points management system which gives each player a certain ~sports~ score. How does it work? Do you know what happens on some auction sites? Well, in them each seller has his own feedback determined by the votes attributed by other users with whom he has successfully concluded a deal by respecting certain rules such as mutual respect and the correctness of the offer. In This is Football it goes something like this. If during a game the usual sly guy on duty decides, because he is losing 4-0 or he is bored, to disconnect in the middle of a match, or he doesn't respect the opponent perhaps playing hard just for the sake of hitting, then will receive negative points and his ~karma~, let's call it that, will go down. Thus, when someone connects to the server he will do everything to ignore those with low feedback, as they are considered unreliable. In short, whoever behaves like a child will no longer find anyone willing to play with him. Gameplay mon amour The AI of the players controlled by the CPU is not the best, and the new additions to the control system are of little use, such as the introduction of arrows that appear along the edges of the TV to indicate the position of the players not visible on the screen when you are in possession of the ball, to facilitate the passage or the setting of the game, when then the latter are sleeping and almost never go towards the ball. And when they do, due to a non-excellent physical impact management system, they tend to ignore the ball or lose it immediately. From this point of view, not even the animations help. Despite the slight increase in the frames and the presence of new movements, certainly with a good visual impact, they remain at a medium-low level, especially as regards the representation of volleys and running, where that annoying feeling remains of ~skating~ on grass of our heroes in long johns. It is useless to add that in these conditions, setting up a decent, realistic action is practically impossible. Even in the most difficult mode, team play is often a utopian hope, and it is very difficult to reflect on what to do. Often, therefore, it is reduced to personal action and shooting from outside the area towards the goal (as in principle it will be the CPU to control its trajectory) where usually instead of a goalkeeper there is a dumb asleep, weak in low shots ... Luckily, at least the graphics are at positive levels. The faces of some players are practically identical to their real counterparts, many, such as Caf or Gattuso, have been digitized live with the now traditional face scanning technique, while DB errors can be solved thanks to the special Editor, one of the best and most complete ever seen in a football video game, where you can edit everything from the coach to the single collar of a shirt. Even the commentary, this year entrusted to the national Brunone, Pizzul, turns out to be below expectations, resulting soporific, without rhythm, and with such a low tonality as to force the gamer to lower the bar of the stadium's sound effects almost halfway to be able to hear it properly. [***data incomplete: game card or image number missing***] Comment It was supposed to be the football simulator par excellence, an exciting cross between the aesthetic structure of Fifa and the playability and realism of Pes 3, but this TIF 2004 has only proved to be an unsuccessful attempt to imitate the most illustrious competitors. Not that it's bad, mind you, but for those who seek spectacularity or realism in a football title, rather than immediacy, they would perhaps do better to turn their attention elsewhere. Even the arcade component unfortunately does not reach the sufficiency, and the only things that are saved are the online mode and the technical aspect, but unfortunately the substance is conspicuously missing. From what world is the world, videogame speaking, we mean, when a football fan is asked by a friend what is the best football game for consoles, he replies without thinking twice about ~WE / Pes~, almost in the grip of a subliminal command stronger than one's will. It goes without saying how this deeply annoys those who, read competing software houses, do everything to get at least a little closer to the Konami masterpiece only to then discover, immediately after the release of their product on the market, that they have been outclassed again by the softco of Tokyo, which seems to have another step with respect to the competition which leads it to be always ahead of the others in the evolution of its titles. Although Sony has tied part of its fortunes in the commercial sphere to the Winning Eleven series, the Japanese multinational decided for some time to try to create a worthy rival of the King, launching the series known as This is Football in recent years . Also this year, in the inevitable invasion of football titles in the vicinity of the European football championships which, as you know, will be held in June in Portugal, the new chapter of one of the most controversial products ever in the field of simulations could not be missing football. Presented a few months ago to the press as an ambitious cross between the realism of Pes and the spectacularity of Fifa, the latest addition to Sony is ready to launch its challenge to the most illustrious rivals.
