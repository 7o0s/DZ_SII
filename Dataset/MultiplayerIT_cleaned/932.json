{"name": "Forza Motorsport Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/forza-motorsport-recensione.html", "text": "Career The Career Mode is the heart of the entire game: first of all you have to create a driver, choose the region of belonging between Europe, America and Asia, and with the basic credits, buy a vehicle. From now on we can access the various championships and events available, everything is synchronized from one's level, i.e. from how many points/credits have accumulated during the competitions, the starting level is level 0 and the climb begins until you reach beyond fiftieth (and rest assured that it will be quite complicated to get there). Every single race in the career mode places limitations on the vehicles that can be used, either by class, by year or region of production, by weight, horsepower and other variables. Among the various satellite races available in the different modes, you will find both ~uphill~ and ~downhill~ races from a mountain, endurance races in which we will have to manage the pit stops for refueling and tire changes and even speed competitions on the quarter mile. Among the various satellite races available in the different modes, you will find both ~uphill~ and ~downhill~ races from a mountain, endurance races in which we will have to manage the pit stops for refueling and tire changes and even speed competitions on the quarter mile. Career The other sections of the career mode include the garage, where we can view the cars we own and possibly change the configurations and setup, the car customization department, where we can buy the various after-market spare parts and components, all strictly under official license, or where you can make changes to the aesthetic appearance by applying decals, stickers, layers of paint or symbols (up to 12 layers) in every part of the car. The last section available, in addition to the private track to test the car, is the shop, here you can spend the hard-earned credits earned and here the region chosen for your driver and the performance in the races also comes into play. Depending on the region, it will be possible to have more models available for the area to which they belong and also have more advantageous prices. For example, by selecting Europe, you will have available all the cars produced by Ferrari with more advantageous prices than a driver of American nationality, on the other hand not all Japanese models will be available for import. And this is exactly where performance in competitions and online matches come into play. If via Live it will be possible to access lobbies for the exchange or sale of the various models available in the game, even by winning certain championships, relations with foreign countries and manufacturers in other regions will become stronger, and consequently it will be possible access their entire price list. A note of merit goes to the possibility of directly accessing the garage, provided you have a suitable car, when selecting an event that imposes category limits or the like, without having to go through other menus. Another pleasant feature concerns the positioning on the starting grid, not always last, not always first, but rather based on the performance of our car on paper. The CPU will carry out a sort of virtual qualifying and, if we find ourselves with a superior car to the rivals, we will obtain the first row, with less performing cars, however, we will obtain further back positions. The cars available are divided into various classes, from ~D~ where we will find the cheapest and least performing (as they come from the shops), up to ~A~ where you can buy cars like the Enzo Ferrari. The last two classes, the ~S~ and the ~R~, are dedicated to limited edition, racing vehicles with top-level performance, many of which cannot be bought but must be won. The hud in Forza is extremely intuitive, classic in the reproduction of details on speed, gears, engine revs, position on the map, and by pressing a button on the pad, it will be possible to bring up a diagram of our car, which will indicate the damaged parts, the temperature of the engine and that of the tyres. Small gem in this regard: at the start of the race with cold tires and a full petrol tank (yes, that too is consumed), the first corners must be approached with extreme attention, given that the grip of the tires will not yet be optimal (green colour) . The tracks available are a mix between real circuits, perfectly reproduced in every part, such as Laguna Seca or the Nurburgring itself, or fictitious circuits recreated on the basis of realistic settings. Among the best settings in terms of graphics, there are undoubtedly the two city tracks in New York and Tokyo, which will force us, for aOnce upon a time, racing on narrow roads with an impressive series of switchbacks and hairpin bends, and very few escape routes. Help me help you The series of driving aids is full of modifiable options: you can act on the AI level in the game, choosing between normal and difficult, you can change the damage level in three values, ranging from off, to moderate and complete, and based on this choice there will be more or less impact on vehicle performance after damage. With regard to damages, it must however be specified that the agreements with the car manufacturers do not provide for the complete destruction of the vehicle, or the possibility of overturning. These constraints do not depend on limits in the implementation of damages, but on contractual agreements, since most of the cars available in Forza are perfectly on sale to the public. These constraints do not depend on limits in the implementation of damages, but on contractual agreements, since most of the cars available in Forza are perfectly on sale to the public. Help me help you Among the aids there are also the three classic electronic devices for traction control, cornering stability and assisted braking. Last but not least the ~ideal line~, one of the most useful features at the beginning of the game. This line is substantially dynamic and as well as indicating the ideal trajectory for setting the bends, it changes color based on the speed of the car, instant by instant. The green line equals ideal speed, yellow indicates that it will be possible to skid and you are at the limit of grip, red when you need to brake in order to stay on the track. The game feeling in a simulation racing game is undoubtedly the most important aspect to analyze, Forza MotorSport gives its best in combination with disabling the available driving aids, and possibly the use of a steering wheel. Forget the drifts and the race for the Kudos in Project Gotham Racing, in this new title made in Microsoft, the tolerated maneuvers will be very few, we will have to carefully dose the brake and accelerator to avoid turning around when exiting certain curves, we will have to maintain almost ideal trajectories , to lose as few tenths as possible and optimize the speed out of the corners, take care of our vehicle, avoiding as much as possible to put the wheels off the asphalt, contact with other cars, and off the track on the sand, perhaps trying to cut some hairpin bends, which penalize our ride, much more than one might imagine. Tuning what a Passion One of the most successful aspects of Forza is managing the tuning and customization of a vehicle. Not only will it be possible to increase the value in credits of the same, but from the point of view of competitions against the cpu and in online matches, a well-tuned and well-modified machine will be essential in order to be able to excel. The modifications in the area dedicated to tuning and settings are numerous, divided into various subclasses and areas of competence. As for the after market components to add to the car, we have three categories, divided into engine, external modifications, internal modifications. Some of these heavily affect the class of the vehicle and we will have to be careful not to exceed the limits imposed by the categories in competitions. For example, it is possible to take a TT from class D to class A, thus precluding competitions in the lower category, unless some modifications previously made are eliminated, such as weight reduction, the use of professional tyres, or modifications direct to the engine. The modifications in the area dedicated to tuning and settings are numerous, divided into various subclasses and areas of competence. Tuning what a Passion Even the settings to the various components of the car are linked to the enhancements that have been implemented, in fact only through ~professional~ parts will it be possible to access the more particular modifications: with the standard transmission the car's ratios will be those set by the parent company, with the racing one (as well as being more efficient), you can modify a generic ratio to increase the maximum speed or acceleration, while with the professional one, we will have access to the settings of the individual gears. A.I Speaking of the Artificial Intelligence of the opponents, one can only praise the work done by the internal teams of Microsoft. The reactions and behavior of the opposing cars vary according to particular situations. First of all, the competitiveness of the CPU increases as you unlock championships and move up in category, the aggressiveness and speed of the cars controlled by the CPU also change during the race itself. In a circuit that includes several laps, the opponents mthey will improve their times as the kilometers go by, the same thing if the time difference of our first pursuer starts to decrease, perhaps due to an off-piste, and we find him in the slipstream, it will be more difficult to be able to distance him again. There will be contacts and possible counters or rear-end collisions to try to pass even where the spaces are closed, if at first glance it may seem unsportsmanlike behavior, in reality it is only preparatory for online competitions, where other users are unlikely to let themselves be overtaken without resisting . The behavior of the vehicles controlled by the cpu is variable, and we will not always see our opponents following the ideal trajectory, all lined up. Challenges of various kinds will also arise between them, contacts, overtaking in braking and even mistakes and going off the track. The behavior of the vehicles controlled by the cpu is variable, and we will not always see our opponents following the ideal trajectory, all lined up. A.I The only real comment to make to the development team, that of making the CPU uncompetitive, when we manage to modify our vehicle to the maximum. In some races the difference in performance between our car and the standard ones chosen for the event will be truly abysmal, and the CPU will not be able to create problems during the race. Audio and Video One of the hottest points in the Forza Motorsport analysis concerns the graphics engine. Tracks are rendered with a high, perhaps even exaggerated, amount of trackside and background detail. The lighting effects are well done and also the textures, obviously with the inevitable active bump mapping, are of a very high level. A few small notes to the reflections on the bodies, which do not travel at the same frame rate as the game, a defect that does not do justice to this type of feature at all. The real limit of the engine is represented precisely by the frame rate. The sense of speed, if you use the internal camera is more than valid, when you switch to the highest view, although it is almost a crime to play a driving simulator with this camera, the sense of speed is affected enough, unless do not race on city tracks or with fairly powerful cars. There are no problems in graphic cleaning, the programmers have implemented a good FSAA algorithm, and in addition also widescreen and 480p support (resolution usable only through American consoles). Too bad for the 2D audience on the side of the track, which clashes a bit with the rest of the creation, but during the races it will be difficult to notice the spectators, rather than concentrate on driving. The realization of the sound department is substantially similar: the in-game effects are well done, the roar of the engines is realistic and varies according to some modifications to the car, and depending on the camera used. The only reproach to make, perhaps concerns the ~volume~, too low even on Dolby Digital 5.1 systems. The soundtrack instead is quite anonymous, apart from the main theme, the other tracks available are not very engaging, this is not so much a problem, because Forza Motorsport provides full support for our soundtracks saved on hd, both in the menus and in the game. Multiplayer and Live Forza Motorsport is certainly one of the racing games with the best Xbox Live support. The most welcome feature is the ability to play career mode races, not with CPU-managed opponents, but with ~real~ users via connection to Microsoft's online service. All this greatly increases the longevity of this mode in Forza, prompting the player to reselect some events where perhaps he feels particularly at ease. Multiplayer play also includes support for up to two players in splitscreen, or 7 opponents in other competitions. In addition to the previously mentioned lobbies dedicated to the sale and exchange of cars, the online game also includes quick competitions in which you join the fray only by choosing the car and the track, and the possibility of creating competition by selecting the aids and the game conditions we prefer. It will be possible to download ghosts and access the local or world scoreboards, with the records on the various tracks, and it will also be possible to found your own personal ~clubs~, clearly comparable to the classic ~clans~ in Halo2. Drivatar The Drivatar mode is one of the most atypical features seen in racing games: in this section of the game it will be possible, through special training sessions, to instruct a driver managed by the CPU's AI itself. In particular, you can literally teach your driving style to the AI of our Drivatar, and then use it in the various competitions, in our place, with the only limitation of a", "date": "2005-05-12", "grade": null}
