{"name": "Fracture - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fracture-recensione.html", "text": "Earthquake! Although international critics have wasted comparisons with Gears of War and Halo, in reality Fracture is more reminiscent of titles such as Mass Effect, at least as regards the feeling during the firefights. The setting is typical of a third-person action game, so we will always have a good view of our Jet Brody and his fantastic armor, while the locations develop in every direction without favoring exploration: a visual indicator will show us our goal from time to time, after which everything will depend on how we will act to achieve it. And it is here that the new LucasArts production differs from the crowd: the ability to raise and lower the ground certainly has its value during the clashes, but above all it serves to make us reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Sometimes we will find passages blocked by rocks, therefore we will be able to lower the ground under them to open a passage; or we will have to create boosters to jump onto platforms that are very high up. It is interesting to note that some weapons also participate in this sort of particular creative process: one of the grenades, for example, gives birth to huge columns of rock which can then be ~disassembled~ by shooting at them. It will be important to understand that we can deposit such a grenade at our feet and then enjoy an ~instantaneous lift~, useful when having to overcome rather high obstacles since the ground cannot be inflated infinitely. As far as military applications are concerned, the ability to control the earth makes it possible to hurl opponents into the air or, more frequently, create useful barriers between us and enemy fire. Our armor has an energy shield that needs a few moments to recharge, similar to what happens in Halo: if we suffer attacks while we are defenseless, game over will come inexorably and we will have to start over from the last checkpoint. Combat system: doom and gloom As mentioned above, in Fracture we will be able to enjoy control over the ground but also a large arsenal of more or less conventional weapons. The standard machine gun stands as an always reliable tool, even if it loses accuracy from a distance (the burst makes the impact zone less and less defined) and doesn't boast who knows what firepower. However, we will have two ~slots~ available, and there will be no shortage of alternatives: we will be able to use energy rifles (rather effective, but only up close), powerful rocket launchers and even precision weapons for ranged shots. We'll also find unusual and original solutions, such as the grenade launcher that fires projectiles underground and then detonates them on command when they're in the vicinity of enemies. Inside the stages we will often see metal crates, useful for sheltering us (they deform and jump off, but at least they don't break) and containers with explosive spheres very similar to those seen in Resistance, but with decidedly more devastating and spectacular: with their weight they can crush those who fall under them, and then explode making the earth tremble. In this sense, the developers have done an excellent job: the explosions violently shake the view and create great confusion, as it should be in such situations. Unfortunately the same sense of ~impact~ is not returned by conventional weapons, and this negatively affects playability: it is not clear when the shots hit or miss, the enemies practically remain still under our gusts and this does not produce that sense of ~satisfaction~ that such products should instead ensure. Fracture is very challenging, but sadly not for the right reasons. Combat system: doom and gloom There are also two other problems. The first, less serious but annoying, is represented by the impossibility of changing the position of the viewfinder from right to left, as happened in Uncharted: we will very often find ourselves having to face enemies who are on our left, perhaps behind a wall, and the default setting will make it impossible for us to hit them first. The second problem, unfortunately unforgivable, is the lack of a ~sneak~ mode: you can duck behind an obstacle to take cover, but you remain ~unhooked~ from it, without the aiming system adjusting accordingly and allowing us to look out briefly to score a few shots. If we add to this a general shrewdness of the enemies, who perhaps hide and move to avoid exposing themselves easily to our attacks, we will have a complete picture of the situation: Fracture is very demanding, but unfortunately not for the right reasons. Realizationtechnical action Technically, the game has its ups and downs. The drawing style of the characters is not as exaggerated as that of Gears of War, and this unfortunately certainly makes it more anonymous, even if some visual solutions (the holographic interface of the armor, for example) prove to be quite effective. The protagonist is well done, with an armor that is not too original in shape but convincing overall. Unfortunately, the design of allies and enemies often seems obvious and not very inspired, while the animations are generally good. The management of weapons is rather confusing: you need a lot of practice before distinguishing them well, although in the end they are not very numerous. Their effect on enemies has already been discussed: unfortunately the sense of impact is minimal, with all the consequences of the case. The ability to inflate and deflate the ground, on the other hand, is excellently rendered, as are the explosions, which are truly spectacular and pyrotechnic. The locations do not appear very original in appearance, and are organized ~in blocks~, i.e. you have to proceed section by section without paying too much attention to the outlines. There are no pop-ups or clipping issues, but unfortunately drops in frame rate are frequent. As for the sound, we have average music and effects: they are not crazy, but they do their job honestly. Good dubbing in Italian. The game has online multiplayer for up to eight players, who can compete in different modes without too many particular problems related to lag and with the possibility of experiencing the interesting control over the ground in a more intimate and strategic context. Comment It's not easy to grapple with the third-person action game genre, especially when the competition is so fierce. Fracture therefore tries to build its appeal on the introduction of innovative elements, and in this sense the possibility of controlling the terrain certainly hits the target, thanks to the various facets it implies: useful during battles, of course, but also fundamental to get ahead in the internships. In short, we need to understand what to do and how to do it, even if the game always tells us what our new goal is, making our lives easier. Technically the game is very well done, sinning only for the originality of the design and the stability of the frame rate, but its problems are quite different and unfortunately concern the combat system: the approach to the clashes is too simplistic, too spartan and often confusing. It is not possible to take cover to shoot (as happens in practically all modern action games) and the sensation of impact from the weapons is minimal, deeply affecting the overall involvement and fun. Ultimately, a half-successful experiment: the original ideas that the developers have introduced should be recovered for a possible next production, but paying much more attention to the elements that cannot be taken so lightly in such a title. Pros Some really innovative elements A good number of stages and weapons Technically well done... Cons ...shame about the frequent drops in frame rate Combat system to be revised Quite difficult, sometimes frustrating", "date": "2008-10-23", "grade": null}
