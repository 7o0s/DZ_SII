{"name": "Cy Girls", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cy-girls.html", "text": "] Two games is better than one Cy Girls undoubtedly belongs to that category of adventure games with a marked propensity for fighting rather than for solving puzzles or planning actions to be performed. Through a series of missions, ranging from hacking into computer systems in search of secret information to eliminating a particular enemy, you'll have to fight your way through a series of levels packed with opponents, beating and shooting at everything that moves on the screen. And here is perhaps the most obvious limitation of Cy Girls. This being a sort of continuous shooter-fighting game, where there is no room for other videogame elements capable of varying its playability. No strategic elements, no variations on the ~kill your opponents-go on~ scheme. The puzzles, few, are limited to the usual ~find the key-open the door~, and the game mechanic itself, beyond some nice additions, such as pseudo-stealth sections (especially with the ninja Aska), lets slide the gameplay in a certain monotony, in the usual tinkering routine that often distinguishes these products. Not to mention that in fact the longevity of such products is lacking in the long term, unless you add new unlockable features to make everything replayable. In this sense, Konami's idea of developing the adventure on two DVDs seems wise (the package, in fact, contains two digital supports, one for each character, called ~Ice Disc~ and ~Aska Disc~) to increase its longevity through the length of the missions rather than sophisticated but perhaps more fulfilling gameplay. The choice of character, in fact, will not only influence the style of play (in the sense of using different weapons and fighting techniques, as regardless of the character chosen, the control system of the PCs and their moves tends to be the same for both ), but will allow the gamer to practically experience another story, as the two girls follow different plots and missions, even if parallel and linked by a logical thread. The CG graphics are not crying out for a miracle, on the contrary, they could have been done much better, as well as the dubbing and the music not up to par with other Konami products. ] Conclusions Cy Girls can certainly be categorized in that category of titles whose sole purpose is to offer the gamer a few hours of entertainment without worrying too much about overexerting their brains. If you like those games where you just have to fight to get to the end of each mission, this is the title for you. In the long run, in fact, the Konami title turns out to be a no-frills action game / shooter, all in all quite fun for those who, as mentioned, are not looking for something demanding but only for a nice and immediate diversion from other titles of the genre from more sophisticated approach. Others would be better off turning their attention elsewhere. Creating, designing a video game starting from some models may seem like a somewhat bizarre idea. If you usually tend to carry out these operations in reverse, i.e. from a video game success you draw inspiration to create a line of themed commercial products, including resin or plastic models depicting the effigies of digital characters, in this case you have decided to carry out a reverse path, that is, starting from the action figures we have come to create a video game (even if CG is not the first case in this regard, just think of Action Man). Basically, this way of working has never proved to be very successful for the software houses that were the first to try their hand at similar projects. But evidently Konami thinks differently given that the Cy Girls, produced by Takara, have decided to focus on a line of very famous Action Figures in Japan, to create their new action title. The game is set in a future fantasy-political universe, where following a blackout that occurred in 2058 which caused the economic and political collapse of all the superpowers, with a consequent long period of international crisis, the fate of the planet unscrupulous rich megacorporations have arrived. In this context, the protagonists of our video game move, Ice and Aska, respectively an expert spy of computer systems who works on her own, at least at the beginning, and a ninja, a member of an association called Cardinal & Garrison made up exclusively of young and comely maidens. Both girls are Cy Girls, i.e. ~explorers~ of the Cyberworld, a sort of virtual parallel universe managed by highly advanced software inable to broadly trace the real world and which is accessed through the neural connection of one's psyche with a computer.", "date": "2004-05-27", "grade": null}
