Multiple choices lead us to relive the same experience several times and to grasp all the possible nuances, but what if you could change every choice already made during the same game? The guys at Spearhead Games have tried to go down this road with Stories: The Path of Destinies, an interesting action RPG with an isometric view that brings together an immediate combat system and a progression of characters and equipment, and places them within a jagged plot narrative. The Canadian studio - founded by some former members of Ubisoft and Visceral Games - therefore offers us a non-linear adventure, supported by a very colorful graphic sector and a subtle charge of humor, also thanks to the presence of anthropomorphic characters with animal features. Stories: The Path of Destinies is a game that does not disdain a good dose of irony Cunning as a fox. Almost. Reynardo is a former pirate, returned to the right path after years of plundering sailing ships and lording it over with his mastery of combat. The fact that he feels as smart as a fox is not just a way of saying: the protagonist's appearance is reminiscent of Fox McCloud, but where the Nintendo icon gives his best aboard his combat ship, the good Reynardo remains fond of the blade of the sword and the fights to the death. In the manner of a consummate Han Solo our champion becomes entangled in the conflict that rages between the rebel faction and an oppressive frog emperor. Immediately a difficult choice is presented to him: to save his old friend Lapino from the clutches of the imperial crows or to go without hesitation in search of the dreaded Sky-Ripper weapon? In reality, the undertaking will prove to be much less simple than it might seem, since the decisions taken in the first part of the adventure will have dire consequences, to say the least. However, fate has other projects in store, and that is why the player is given the opportunity to make choices, understand the outcome and return to the starting point to change the course of history. In essence, the adventure will have to be restarted from the beginning several times, taking advantage of the new opportunities available, with the aim of reaching a happy ending. The presence of four different paths of destiny leads to the unlocking of 24 truths, divided into four categories which refer to the relationship with Lapino, the love for the emperor's daughter Zenobia, the recovery mission of the Sky Slayer and finally the identification of the dangerous Iblis Stone, another crucial tool in the fight towards imperial domination. After an initial phase that may seem a little lacking in bite, the incentive to continue only grows after entering the gear created by Spearhead Games at full speed. The need to give coherence to an articulated plot, without making it too bizarre, convinced the developers to rely only on three characters, around whom the whole story revolves. The empire is only a pretext, while the representations of good and evil are placed at crossroads and are expressed through the weaknesses of the subjects involved. The inevitable presence of backtracking has been balanced by some precise design choices: in fact, there are numerous alternative paths, which can only be activated after having upgraded your equipment. Thanks to this trick, it is possible to travel along roads that are inaccessible in the previous stages of exploration. Being a story told in the manner of a fairy tale, The Path of Destinies is also constantly supported by an omniscient external narrator, intent on describing in the third person not only the events, but also the dialogues and moods experienced by the characters, through a style that highlights a clear ironic imprint. Playstation 4 trophies The Trophies of Stories: Path of Destinies are 38 in total, with only four gold objectives and 13 silver ones. Much of the content can be unlocked without too many problems after completing the first path of choices. Trying and trying again From a playful point of view Stories: The Path of Destinies offers a combat system focused on the use of four types of sword, unlockable by collecting resources from chests. While being fun and immediate to enjoy, the gameplay pays for the absence of combos. Sword attacks can be carried out with the press of a single button and are alternated by a grip with which you can throw the nekittens already from the cliffs. On the other hand, a real parade of enemy offensives is not available, being instead essential to move the analog stick in the right direction to be able to counterattack effectively. Alternatively, the grappling hook must be used to snatch the shield from armored opponents, while the presence of rapid movement allows you to move for short distances without being identified and is useful for reorganizing your attack tactics. Overall, the interaction proved to be fast and fun, especially after having engaged the first power-ups and having come into contact with slightly more aggressive enemies, nevertheless something more could have been done in terms of variety, given that the techniques of attack are few and always identical. A partial variant is offered by the magical power inherent in each of the four swords, with which it is possible to inflict elemental damage or to restore part of one's health points through the consumption of energy points. Being an action packed with RPG elements, the weapon improvement mechanics have been accompanied by an extensive skill tree, through which experience points can be activated and Reynardo's abilities can be increased, while the gem slots offer further increases in defensive and offensive skills. The increase in the level and variety of enemies obviously also affects the segments already covered previously and offers a balanced challenge rate, although the game remains accessible to a fairly large audience. The developers said they had taken inspiration from some characteristic elements of the ~metroidvania~, including the possibility of unlocking new areas and discovering secrets, but in reality the story seemed usable without too many problems even by the most casual players. We close with some painful notes concerning the technical sector. During our test - which took place on the PlayStation 4 version - we encountered frequent slowdowns and a clear difficulty in maintaining a stable 30 frames per second. At the same time there were some annoying bugs that affected some mobile platforms, interpenetration with the surrounding environment and sporadic anomalous behavior of enemies. We hope that a next patch will be able to solve this type of problem.", "date": "2016-04-20", "grade": "7.8"}
