A sort of Epic Citadel with an Italian flavour, inspired by Assisi and Renaissance art. Starting from this base, the developers have decided to take back the settings and atmospheres and evolve the entire project, bringing it to become a real video game. These are the premises of Return to Castlerama, which in a certain sense outline quite precisely the boundaries of a game that is not easy to identify, between the strengths and weaknesses of a courageous, albeit imperfect, design: great atmosphere and excellent graphics on the one hand, but various structural deficiencies in terms of gameplay on the other. The game offers a rather original interpretation of the classic fantasy canvas: a simple shop boy, David da Volpedo, suddenly discovers that he represents the only bulwark in defense of the city of Castlerama and of the entire Gorendal valley against the inexorable advance of the forces of evil, embodied by demons, undead and various other creatures assisted by some evil deus ex machina, all set within intrigues and struggles between political factions that seem to derive directly from the Italian medieval and Renaissance era. An original and well-crafted mix of classic Tolkienian fantasy, legends, Italian historical events and a lot of esotericism that makes up a very thick narrative substrate, even if poorly amalgamated with the game itself. The collection of pages of a long manuscript, located across the various game settings, allows you to get to know the background of the events and the characters behind the story in depth. This is an ~ancient~ but rather simplistic expedient as it unties the narrative from the gameplay, allowing the construction of a narrative sector which, although solid and interesting, appears somewhat detached from the events that take place on the screen during the game. So much so that the manuscript can easily be set aside and taken up again later, as a parallel reading that is very interesting and complex but also symptomatic of the discrepancy between narration and gameplay. Myst in Assisi The structure is, in principle, that of a graphic adventure with a first person view, but the game does not disdain digressions in the action field, in some sections. In most cases we find ourselves having to solve puzzles that recall those of classics of the Myst-style genre, but in some others we also find ourselves faced with phases that require speed and precision of movements, situations that also tend to collide with a system not exactly perfect control. The movement is entrusted to the two classic ~virtual sticks~ with some additional keys (running, jumping and magic), a solution that is not very nice in itself but unfortunately inherent in the narrowness of the touch screen. The movement speed is rather low and the uncertainty of the response to the commands makes the more active sections, especially those with ~platform~ elements, decidedly frustrating. The decision to provide an amalgam of classically adventure sections with other more action-packed ones certainly contributes to avoiding tension drops and increasing the pace of the game, inserting an element of danger and forcing to act in a timely manner, but the general setting and the system of control point to an initial design more suited to decidedly more staid rhythms. Exploration, on the other hand, represents the key element of the entire Return to Castlerama experience, to underline the contemplative origins of the project, which started from the aforementioned technical demo. From this point of view, the game is able to provide splendid glimpses that demonstrate an excellent mastery of the Unreal Engine in the iOS environment, especially as regards the modeling of the scenarios and the management of the light within the different geographical areas of Gorendal that we find ourselves going through, although a certain feeling of artificiality persists, linked above all to the poor integration between puzzles and settings and to decidedly rare interactions with NPCs, which still makes the border between video game and exploratory tech demo uncertain. Most of the time we find ourselves exploring the 8 game areas, which are also characterized by a good scenographic variety, looking for the fragments of the manuscript and the Dagmar tarot cards which, in the typical widespread esotericism of the game, are elements that prove to be of fundamental importance for thefinal solution. The puzzles probably represent the most satisfying moments from the point of view of a real videogame experience, but their presence is perhaps even too diluted within the long wandering between the locations of Gorendal. Between mysteries and Renaissance architecture R2C is a beautiful journey, with some problems of a playful nature", "date": "2013-07-03", "grade": "6.7"}
