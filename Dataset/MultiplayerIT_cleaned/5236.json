{"name": "Rez Infinite", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/175166-rez-infinite-trance-vr.html", "text": "Playing Rez today, in 2016, brings to mind the never-too-loved Dreamcast, SEGA's latest console which, despite its short life, enjoyed memorable titles and successful experiments, which paved the way for years to come. Just like the game created by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, the same as Space Channel V and Lumines, a real mental trip able to perfectly blend graphics, gameplay and soundtrack to give an unforgettable experience, to be taken in doses commensurate with own aptitude with musical titles. And as usual, unfortunately we add, it has positioned itself within a niche audience, following those dynamics that see productions of this kind hardly able to establish themselves among the great masses. Over the years, however, there have been numerous transpositions of Rez, until today with an unchanged offer as regards the main adventure but only with some additions in terms of modes... until today, because Rez Infinite arrives at the launch of PlayStation VR with a level created for the occasion and represents one of the most valid experiences for spending time in company with the virtual reality viewer produced by Sony. The review of Rez Infinite on PS4 and PlayStation VR, among the best experiences for virtual reality VR generation The basic mechanics of Rez are extremely simple: the player impersonates an avatar that represents hacking within an advanced computer system, with the aim of destroying viruses, overcoming firewalls and crossing layers of security to awaken Eden, artificial intelligence who deactivated after discovering the complexity and freedom of human nature. Everything is reproduced with a graphic style reminiscent of the wireframe, dominated by lines that intersect each other and gradually increase in complexity in their shapes. Your avatar moves on rails, the left analog controls a viewfinder which, in conjunction with pressing the X key, allows you to hook up to eight opponents at the same time, who are hit when the key is released. The gameplay, as the norm in quality titles, is easy to master but reveals a certain depth during multiple enemies at the same time, bosses and when you want to get a high score; your character, following the elimination of a complete group, can obtain objects that allow him to ~evolve~ from an aesthetic and functional point of view, or reach overdrive and attack automatically for a few seconds. The sublimation comes from the perfect mix with the graphic and sound sectors, which are enriched according to their performance and ~pulse~ in synchrony with the eliminations, to create an increasingly complex and engaging scenario, to be enjoyed absolutely with headphones or an excellent music system. Each level for a total of five, called an area, has ten layers to go through until the boss is reached, lasts between 10 and 15 minutes and increases in complexity in the advanced stages, which also explode visually and musically. Once the areas have been completed or played for at least an hour, it is possible to access the scoring modes, the one with only the bosses and an extra level, in such a way as to extend an overall low longevity in purely numerical terms. No fear for newbies: there is also a travel option if you want to enjoy the adventure without risking dying. On PlayStation 4 it is possible to play Rez Infinite both in 2D mode and with PlayStation VR; thanks to a technical sector that is based above all on the artistic one, the title runs quietly at 1080p and 60 frames per second, which become the native 90 Hz brought to 120 within the virtual reality viewer produced by Sony. In the company of the latter, the game acquires a new dimension of involvement: through the movement of the head it is possible to look around, accompany the viewfinder and be even more overwhelmed by the mixture of all the components that we have repeatedly listed in our article. The grid effect is practically absent, the game runs fast and quite defined, we have not warned of any nausea effect thanks to the aforementioned fluidity, obviously net of some pauses due to the fact that we are talking about a title with a high and psychedelic rhythm. But there's more, Rez Infinite offers in addition to the classic levels the so-called Area X, which abandons the shooter on the tracks to give full control to the player, who can move by accelerating or going back with the right backbones and choose the direction towards which to go, always going through the various layers before the final boss, also presenthe in an alternative version. Created using Unreal Engine 4, Area X is an explosion of colors and particle effects, a real feast for the eyes, ears and mind, a breath of fresh air for the historical players of the title. In VR mode, to use an edible term, it is his death: the completion of Mizuguchi's vision (actually no, the trance vibrator and the suit shown during the PlayStation Experience are also needed!) and an experience capable of giving maximum involvement : the movement of the head is connected not only to the viewfinder, but also to the vision and direction of one's avatar, to follow the movements of the opponents and attack them in a more natural way than the version with just the pad. Too bad for the overall duration of only 15 minutes: given the quality of the experience, the music graphics sector and the involvement, it would have been fantastic to have more areas created with the new engine and the unpublished gameplay components.
