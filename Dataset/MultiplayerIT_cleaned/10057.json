And somehow he succeeds, offering us a time management title, this G.Blacksmith, which essentially sees us committed to satisfying as quickly as possible the requests of goblins who need weapons and armor to be able to enjoy their adventures on earth ~ upstairs~, managing resources and blacksmiths, thieves and sausages to cook. Elevator sickness G.Blacksmith could be defined as a ~classic~ time management title, where the aim of the game is basically to accumulate and process resources to be delivered to our client, in order to be able to achieve the objective indicated at the end of each scheme within the time limit . However, its substantial difference compared to the average of titles of its kind is that it is not possible to put a series of actions in the queue, but each action must be carried out individually, one tap at a time. This might seem frustrating for some, but in reality the game is so well balanced as to allow fluidity in the choice of actions to be performed while maintaining a high level of commitment and challenge without however becoming so difficult as to leave disappointed. The learning curve of the game is also extremely well structured: it starts with a simple exercise of carrying the orders of the surface goblins who will require raw materials. The protagonist will use an elevator to reach the drilling level and de-mine the desired element which will then be returned by going up with the same elevator. However, as the game goes on, new elements will be added, the main one of which is certainly the blacksmith who will transform the raw elements into weapons and armor to satisfy customer requests. At this point things will begin to become increasingly difficult and frenetic, because the main character to be commanded has the right to carry only two elements at a time, while the blacksmith can only work one and the customers are often at least four who are waiting impatiently. They can be calmed down by giving them roast legs which, however, in turn require free hands and a minimum of time to cook them. It therefore appears clear that it will be necessary to be able, very soon, to manage different elements in a rational way and that a mistake can cost the loss of the level. The game unfolds through its schemes with a very particular cartoonish style, all in sepia tones (or rather a greenish tone that is slightly reminiscent of brass oxide) very pleasing to the eye and vaguely reminiscent of the screens of the old GameBoy . The sound sector is equally pleasant and there is also the presence of a series of mini-games which, however simple they are and simply involve the use of a couple of buttons to be tapped, break the game in any case and somehow act as ~boss ~, marking the progress that is being made within the path of the schemes themselves. The standard mode already manages to be long enough on its own, but is enriched by a series of achievements to be obtained and an ~endless~ mode. The only thing that is missing is some online mode, but it really remains a desire to nitpick a title that does its duty very well: it is fun.
