Now that the title has also landed on the main mobile sales channels, let's see if it can also confirm itself in this sector. Even with some limitations, The Bug Butcher also proves its value in the mobile version They bounce off the fucking walls! Small review of history for all those to whom the name of Pang means nothing: it is an arcade released at the beginning of the 90s which saw the player engaged in hitting balloons which doubled in two specimens of larger dimensions at each impact. reduced, with the aim of continuing the process until the screen is completely cleared. The Bug Butcher adopts this identical structure, but inserting it in a completely different context: the protagonist is Harry, a professional exterminator called to clean up a scientific space station from a serious problem of insectoid aliens with the bad habit of bouncing off the walls. All this translates into an action game with simple but decidedly winning mechanics, which require the user to move Harry left and right and fire upwards in order to hit the creatures that progressively invade the display: just like balloons of Pang, these split into smaller parts after taking damage, and you must therefore continue to shoot at them until their complete disappearance. There are many variants that support an already very exciting gameplay: there are different types of enemies with specific characteristics, stages equipped with dynamic obstacles, a wide range of bonuses that briefly increase Harry's offensive capabilities, a points multiplier which advances until you are hit and coins to collect to increase the score and power up the protagonist. In fact, a special screen allows you to spend the accumulated money to improve Harry's equipment and skills, an aspect which together with others helps to infuse a splash of strategy to the product. Shooting at random is not enough, and especially in the more advanced levels you have to make the most of all the moves at your disposal (including a short dash that Harry can perform and a power-up that becomes available after accumulating kills that makes him temporarily invincible) in order to exterminate the aliens within the allotted time limit. The Bug Butcher knows how to be very demanding, especially towards those aiming for maximum scores: it is necessary to be as fast, methodical and precise as possible in one's disinfestation work, with the support of a control system that is reactive enough but which inevitably it is lower than the equivalent via joypad. It is not the only area in which the title of Awfully Nice Studios gives the impression of losing something on its way from the original for PC to this mobile version: beyond the clean cut of the local multiplayer mode, it is evident how the menus have been adapted in a rather lazy way, resulting in buttons, writing and indicators that are far too minute for the standards of portable devices. However, these are venial sins, amply compensated by a very attractive price especially in relation to the absolute goodness of The Bug Butcher's contents: in addition to the quality of the gameplay we talked about a little above, the more than valid longevity is also worthy of note of the main campaign, which is accompanied by a survival mode capable of constituting a good challenge. Final mention for the delightful audiovisual component of the product, which has remained unchanged from the original and further enhanced by the definition of the high-profile smartphone and tablet screens: a cartoon-like graphic characterized by excellent animations is therefore accompanied by a sophisticated sound both in the both in the background music.", "date": "2016-11-04", "grade": "8.5"}
