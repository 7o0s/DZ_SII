And so here is an independent team in its second experience, Drinkbox Studios, pulls the proverbial rabbit out of the hat with Guacamelee!, a ~metroidvania~-style action platformer that draws heavily on Mexican folklore (without avoiding stereotypes, of course) and, specifically, from the world of luchadors, masked wrestlers. The plot of the game sees the perfidious Calaca appearing on the world of the living with a specific purpose, that is to kidnap the President's daughter and offer her as a sacrifice so that he can reign over the entire universe. The only person who can oppose Calaca and his fearsome henchmen is Juan: apparently a simpleton but with an unshakeable determination, the boy comes into possession of a magical luchador mask which gives him a series of special abilities, among including that of surviving the transition from one dimension to another. Assisted in cooperative mode by a mysterious wrestler named Tostada, also masked, Juan will have to face increasingly complex levels, with secrets and alternative paths that will unfold along the way and will only be accessible once a particular ability has been acquired. Who are you? I'm Nachooooooooo! What is most amazing about Guacamelee! - which arrives on PC in the Gold Edition, with some extra content which we will discuss shortly - is undoubtedly the competence demonstrated by the developers with regard to the artistic direction, level design and combat system. After a brief introductory phase in favor of the plot, in fact, the protagonist puts on the luchador mask and begins to experience the passage between the dimension of the living and that of the dead, a change that influences the scenario in various ways and highlights the many quotes that the guys from Drinkbox Studios wanted to disseminate on the streets of Santa Luchita, as well as within the stages that surround the village and which must be reached in the traditional way or taking advantage of sentient rocks that act as a convenient teleportation, even more so when there is a bit of backtracking to be done. At this point the aforementioned level design enters the scene, which, as in the best videogame productions, offers us many side quests and shows us passages blocked by rocks of various colors, each corresponding to an attack that Juan will learn during the adventure. So if we come across a wall that seems impossible to break down, we can certainly go back to it later and destroy it. A similar argument should be made for the combat system, which combines the traditional combos of punches and kicks with a series of special attacks, some unlockable and others purchasable in the shop that acts as a checkpoint, to be carried out also and above all when the opponent on duty is equipped with a protective barrier. Between powerful uppercuts and dives, deadly headbutts and running punches, our character will be able to get rid of any enemy and maybe even have fun performing suplexes, piledrivers and throws typical of wrestling. Guacamelee! it was a fantastic action platformer on PlayStation 3 and even more so on PC A golden game As mentioned earlier, Guacamelee! arrives on Steam with a Gold Edition that includes some interesting bonuses compared to the PSN version released a few months ago. In the first place, the costumes, which must be unlocked and are not limited to modifying Juan's appearance, but include modifiers that can also substantially change our approach to the game. Soon it will even be possible to trade them via the Steam Workshop. Secondly, the presence of the El Infierno expansion, which adds a compilation of rather demanding challenges to the original structure, increasing the overall longevity of the product. Speaking of longevity, the adventure has very complicated stages towards the end, but nevertheless it takes about five hours to complete. The point, however, is that you have to face the campaign again at a higher degree of difficulty to access the true ending, and we can assure you that you will enthusiastically lend yourself to this second commitment. As far as the technical aspect is concerned, what we are dealing with is a practically perfect conversion of the game available on PlayStation 3, which due to its particular nature is not open to possible improvements on the Windows platform other than a mere modification of the resolution and the activation of the vertical synchrony to avoid tearing phenomena (we have not noticed any, for the record). The Xbox 360 controller is not only perfectly supported but also highly recommended, because in some moments you will actually get your fingers intertwined.", "date": "2013-08-20", "grade": "9.0"}
