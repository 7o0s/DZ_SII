That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's something to keep in mind if you embark on this venture. The game coming out on Nintendo Switch is an HD-2D remake of the Japanese RPG of the same name that Square Enix released in 1994 for the SNES: you should know this if you have followed the development, or even just read our previous tried Live A Live, in which we have gutted a few chapters of the game. Alternatively, the Nintendo eShop also offers a demo that could help you understand if this strange JRPG is right for you, or if you should focus on something more classic. In case you decide to give Takashi Tokita's game a chance, the director of much more famous titles such as Chrono Trigger or Parasite Eve, our Live A Live review will explain why it is a truly unique, albeit imperfect, gem . Many stories for many protagonists Live A Live, the story selection screen The seven initial chapters of Live A Live follow the misadventures of as many protagonists, but exactly as happened in the original '94 version, after completing their stories the game continues and, with its multiple endings, guarantees a more complete experience . In these terms, Live A Live might seem like a rather long RPG, but it's not quite like that: it can be completed in about twenty hours, something more if you want to unravel all its secrets. Tokita's title belongs to an era in which Japanese RPGs didn't last too many hours and this makes it particularly suitable for those looking for a contained JRPG, but with a great variety of characters, situations and gameplay. Despite this, we have to admit that Live A Live feels the weight of its years, especially on the narrative front. As we anticipated in our test, not all the stories that make up this mosaic are really valid. The worst of all is undoubtedly Oggi, a boss rush with a completely anonymous protagonist that is completed in a scant hour and does not represent the ambitions of the game in the slightest. The others, on the other hand, are already more interesting: usually, the writing, the themes and the soundtrack compensate for the deficiencies in terms of characterization and in-depth analysis of contexts and characters, and this is why the best stories are actually the longer ones, if only because the protagonists manage to breathe a little more. However, they are quite obvious plots, characterized by an invisible thread - which is more of a generic theme - which connects them in the final chapter. However, it is a ~reunion~ more in terms of gameplay than narrative. These dynamics could remind Octopath Traveler - it is no coincidence that Tokita also worked on that - but in reality there are some important differences between the two games. Live A Live, Today Chapter is a turn-based fighting game In Octopath Traveler the characters existed and met in the same world and in the same era, but the optionality of recruitment entailed a narrative estrangement for which all party members disappeared in key moments of the story, with the exception of the protagonist on duty. This in Live A Live doesn't happen simply because the characters live in completely different eras and each story is totally autonomous, if we exclude the aforementioned recurring theme which then triggers the final bars of the game. In this sense, the narrative of the individual chapters of Live A Live is more compact and coherent, but also essential, and this aspect could appeal to those looking for a light and straight RPG also from the point of view of history. In short, everything depends on the meaning you give to gender. If you think that RPGs are above all engaging stories, which justify the gameplay and not vice versa, then Live A Live is not the title for you: Square Enix's remake is in fact a kind of collection, a compilation of micro role-playing games to nibble on, and in this sense it represents an excellent entry point for those approaching Japanese role-playing games for the first time and do not want to get caught up in too long adventures. Live A Live, the chapter The Far Future is science fiction As we have said, some stories are significantly more engaging than others, especially the Near Future or the Wild West. The Italian localization ventures a colorful register and returns flowing dialogues that give greater personality even to the protagonists who are apworth sketchy. Overall, Live A Live is an extremely suggestive game also for the solution of setting each chapter in a different era, thus using different designs for the sprites and scenarios. The HD-2D graphics prove once again to be the best choice in order not to strip games like this of their vintage aura, which exist in a real limbo halfway between nostalgia and modernization, but at times you notice a certain poverty in the animations or in the effects that do not help the general picture, although this is characterized by an important level of detail. Among other things, we appreciated the decision to rearrange all the music by the always extraordinary Yoko Shimomura, which gives the scenarios a more engaging flavor, despite the limitations of the narrative: the composer employs a multitude of tools to adapt to the era in which the story on duty takes place, even churning out a very funny anime theme song in the chapter of the Near Future. RPG compilations Live A Live, in Imperial China you will have to train a disciple As we have said, Live A Live is not a real JRPG, but more of a compilation that not only offers different stories, but also various gameplay solutions. Again, not all chapters convinced us in the same way. Absurdly, it is the worst story, Oggi, that makes the best use of the combat system, which is inspired by Final Fantasy's Active Time Battle: the characters can only act when the appropriate indicator is recharged and at that point they can move on the field of battle, use consumables and attack with any special techniques. It is interesting that the latter are practically all area-based and force the player to study the positioning of his characters and the enemies deployed with a minimum of attention. Live A Live isn't a particularly difficult game, and Square Enix has made some significant changes to smooth out the rough edges of thirty-year-old gameplay - introducing a minimap when needed, for example, or the ability to change chapters without having to start them over - but it can become challenging and the difficulty curve is not exactly balanced, even if it depends on how certain chapters are played. Live A Live, in Edo Japan you will become a shinobi on a mission In the Edo Period, for example, choosing whether to sneak up or attack each enemy makes a difference in terms of difficulty, not only because the protagonist does not earn the same experience points. But Today is a boss rush and the Edo Period is a sort of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice ante litteram, while other chapters, such as the Far Future or Imperial China are a hair more strategic or role-playing and force a more traditional approach both in exploration, both in micromanagement of characters and inventory. In any case, Live A Live guarantees a very remarkable variety of situations, which fully justifies the different durations of the individual chapters. Square Enix's game is balanced in this sense and even when it is rooted in the RPG tradition, it does so with relative caution, without flooding the player with information, statistics or parameters to consider. For this reason, Live A Live may not appeal to those looking for a more homogeneous or specialized title, so to speak, but it must also be contextualized to understand the goodness of its peculiar characteristics. Live A Live, Prehistory is a hilarious chapter Today the idea behind Live A Live - a multiplicity of stories converging in the same direction - might even seem trivial to us, because many other games have proposed a structure of this type, just think of the aforementioned Octopath Traveler or, if we want to dig deeper thoroughly, to titles such as SaGa Frontier, moreover recently remastered also for Nintendo Switch. In '94, however, the JRPG landscape was dominated above all by Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, and Live A Live represented experimentation, a breath of fresh air that was practically unprecedented. In this sense, the re-proposed Square Enix in HD-2D is a piece of videogame history, a small cult, but it is difficult to imagine that the average gamer of 2022 can overlook its anachronistic naiveties. After playing it and appreciating the modernization work, we can only ask ourselves: why didn't a masterpiece like Chrono Trigger take precedence?", "date": "2022-07-21", "grade": "7.5"}
