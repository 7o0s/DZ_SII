{"name": "A Fold Apart", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/a-fold-apart-recensione.html", "text": "In trying our hand at the review of A Fold Apart we found ourselves faced with a different story than usual, quite concrete and plausible: that of a couple who must separate because one of them finds the job of his dreams in a distant city, but the 'other wishes to stay because in turn he is carrying out the activity he has always wanted to do. A situation that can often occur in real life, and which the authors of the game have tried to address through a series of exchanges that are used to justify narratively the progression between the levels, able to propose very original puzzle mechanics. The Lightning Rod Games title is available on PC, Nintendo Switch and Apple Arcade, but touch terminals are undoubtedly its ideal location. bend at the edges and turn so that the platforms connect and the character we control can reach the star that marks the conclusion of the puzzle. A somewhat complicated concept to describe, but which in practice proves to be quite intuitive and accompanies us in the scarce three hours necessary to complete the game. Gameplay As mentioned, A Fold Apart was probably developed with touch devices in mind, especially tablets, given the type of gameplay that characterizes the experience. By touching the screen it is in fact possible to determine the movement of the character, indirectly, while by dragging the edges of the ~sheets~ we will be able to create the folds that are needed for a certain portion of the image to adapt to the other, creating a passable passage. The puzzles that the game offers gradually become more complex, as is normal: in the early stages the challenge revolves above all around objects to avoid, which block our movement but which we can make disappear by hiding them in the folds of the paper; provided, however, that the measures in the end are the right ones and the road takes us where it has to lead us, that is, to collect the star necessary to complete the internship. Proceeding in the campaign, some variations on the theme are introduced, with the sheets that can also be folded vertically and diagonally, which produces truly tantalizing situations to solve. The problem is that everything takes place at a very slow pace, probably in order to allow certain words to settle for the necessary time, and especially at the beginning of the adventure this can be a major obstacle to continuing. Furthermore, the way in which the narrative themes are addressed seemed a bit obvious and banal to us. In the graphic style and artistic direction of A Fold Apart we can see the influences of animated films such as Up, but beyond the character design, indeed very successful and peculiar, the game gets lost a bit by proposing often dull scenarios, with some acute but also many simplistic and generic solutions. The soundtrack can count on a good main theme, but then it too loses its thread and inspiration, becoming repetitive.", "date": "2020-05-01", "grade": "7.0"}
