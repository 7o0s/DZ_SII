If we want the same goes for many series that exceed number two (Valve knows it well), although in most other cases there are at least the ugly aliens / the pew pew toy soldiers / the burping barbarians / or whatever you want to be killed to gratify our dreams of power and mask the mourning of creativity, while here embarrassment plays in the open. What are we talking about? But about Super Seducer 3: The Final Seduction and the effort made to write the review, given that more than an interactive towing manual it looks like a system to take two of spades in bursts. Seduction Super Seducer 3: The Final Seduction, a hot scene Super Seducer 3: The Final Seduction is substantially identical to the previous episodes, only more refined and with a few more functions. Richard La Ruina returns to the chair for the third time ready to give us advice on how to pick up and convince the partner on duty to have sex, between situations told in the first person and others in which he simply acts as a shoulder. All this translates into a dating simulator divided into ten disconnected episodes in which the player has only to choose the answers to give to keep the stories going, trying to get the maximum score of each chapter to unlock the best endings, the ones that they usually involve sex. As in the two previous Super Seducers, La Ruina will comment on our choices making us understand if we made a mistake or if we reasoned like super seducers, doing what he would have done. Once the ten chapters have been completed, there is little else to do: you can play again to unlock 100% of the answers, even the most absurd ones, perhaps using the summary diagrams to understand where you went wrong, or you can customize the stories, for example by removing the red answers (the completely wrong ones), cutting La Ruina's advice or eliminating the mini-games. The latter are two: quick time events in which you have to press the keys shown on the screen at the right time and a kind of skill game with the telephone. Both are more annoyances than sensible additions to gameplay and honestly, as soon as the option became available, we scrapped them without major drama. Too bad I can't do it right now. Contents Super Seducer 3: The Final Seduction seems more like another source of masturbation than a way to learn to hook up. Speaking of the situations told in the game, there is actually little to say, since they are very similar to those of the previous Super Seducers, between approaches to the supermarket, the gym or inside the classic trendy clubs. La Ruina performs poorly as always, but the other actors and actresses are no less. In general, the winning answers are the least interesting ones, while the ones that give the funniest results are usually wrong. Of course, by now the narrative formula centered on beautiful sexy girls to take to bed, seasoned by the nonsense of La Ruina, often completely out of context, works very little, unless one really believes that his advice has some educational value for the own love life. La Ruina also picks up at the supermarket From a thematic point of view, the problem of Super Seducer 3: The Final Seduction is not even the sexism that oozes from every pore, given that the author has never hidden the nature of what he aims to do, but just boredom inherent in seeing someone explain to you why asking a girl's phone number too directly is wrong, while he's inside a kind of harem where his words soundtrack the images of half-naked women engaged in rubbing each other or to show us the buttocks (at the beginning not too much, since there is a strong censorship of the spicy details, which must be eliminated by playing). All right, maybe it will affect some 14-year-olds, but it won't affect everyone else. Let's also add the often very badly written and very improbable dialogues (which are skipped without too many regrets) and you will realize for yourself why Super Seducer 3: The Final Seduction has not seduced us even a little.", "date": "2021-02-15", "grade": "4.0"}
