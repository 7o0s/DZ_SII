The action of this game is so dense, modular and articulated that at times it seems to have an action in your hands because it is rare that, even in the enemy's turns, you find yourself sitting on your hands. Developed by HoYoVerse, Honkai Star Rail is closely related to Genshin Impact in visual style, writing and monetization, but differs in two key factors: the sci-fi setting and the open linear structure of its levels that abandon the open world of the older brother. Players take on the role of a character with no memory at the center of an interplanetary conspiracy that pits humanity against ancestral deities, all while traveling on an interstellar train. In this review of Honkai: Star Rail we will tell you about all the fun that awaits you in the anime-inspired fights of this game and the dangers that lurk behind its monetization model. Like Genshin Impact, in fact, the game is free-to-play but to unlock most of the available characters (the heart and soul of Honkai Star Rail) you will have to face a gatcha system, i.e. prize boxes with very low odds to get what you want, which then pushes you to spend money to get what you want. Not a simple story The three main characters in Honkai: Star Rail are the Trailblazer, who represents the player, March 7th, a girl with ice powers, and Dan Heng, a follower of the hunter's way When Genshin Impact was released, many complained about too many dialogues dedicated to building the narrative universe and the tsunami of information difficult to process that reached players in the first hours of the game. Honkai: Star Rail does better, but not too much. Especially in the first three hours of the game, a flood of terms are introduced that explain the technologies and deities of this universe, but they are confusing and frustrating because they seem completely disconnected from what is happening. Indeed, after a very brief introductory phase, the Trailblazer (the character that represents the player as the Traveler of Genshin) awakens in a space station under attack. Monsters reminiscent of Evangelion's Evas want to kill us, but the cast of characters who will then accompany us in future adventures is there to help us. If we had to summarize the story of Honkai: Star Rail so far we could do it like this: the ancestral deities of this universe created the Stellarons, seeds of prosperity and growth which then corrupt and destroy the planets that accepted them. The Trailblazer has one implanted within him and for this reason he decides to join the crew of the Astral Express (the space train) to help them in their expeditions which, often, have to do with these destructive divine gifts. After saving the space station from the invasion, in fact, you will leave for Jarilo IV, one of the two planets available for launch, which is facing a dangerous crisis dictated by the negative effects of its Stellaron. The planet is slowly freezing and the last bastion of humanity remains standing only thanks to the servile work of those who, in the basement, keep the heating active and the lights on. We don't get to the levels of Final Fantasy 7 as regards the class struggle, but we are close to it. The narrative arc on this frozen planet is emblematic of the entire Star Rail experience: don't expect omnipotent heroes to come and solve problems, the stories of this universe are matters of compromise, somewhere between maintaining the status quo and preventing of a planetary catastrophe. We don't anticipate anything about the second planet that you will be able to visit because it is without a doubt the best setting of the game so far and, like Genshin, we already know that new destinations for the Astral Express are in development. Star combat The turn-based combat of Honkai: Star Rail is among the most refined and frenetic in recent years Where Honkai: Star Rail manages to stand out and outdo not only Genshin Impact, but most big-budget video games as well, is in its battle system. The anime style of the graphics, the exaggerated costumes of the protagonists and the playful and dramatic atmosphere of the story mix perfectly when it comes to defeating enemies. Visually, the best part is the animated intros of the strongest skills, the ultimates, and here you really see everything. From a possessed death scythe to a giant hen passing through a dreamlike dream dimensionand an orbital beam that crashes into enemies. In addition to this special ability that charges over time, each hero has a basic attack, a powerful attack (which consumes one action point), and a passive ability. By making a successful basic attack it is possible to earn an action point and all the characters (friends and enemies) move in a pre-established order. Ultimates, however, can be activated at any time, interrupting the flow of turns, to catch opponents by surprise. Each opponent in Honkai: Star Rail has two bars on their head: a red one indicating their health points and a white one relating to their stamina. When the latter is consumed the enemy goes into a stunned state, his actions are delayed and he takes more damage when attacked. There are seven elements in this game, each corresponding to a color, and each character is master of one of them. Furthermore, each enemy has highlighted above its health bar which elements it is vulnerable to, so having a balanced team is essential. There are offensive characters and support specialists who protect their teammates. Ideally you will only use one, maximum two basic attacks per turn, using special moves and ultimates the rest of the time. There are characters that can get extra turns under certain conditions and others that add auto-attacks when particular combinations of damage are dealt. The animated intros of Honkai Star Rail's ultimates are never boring and are the best part of the game In many of the battles encountered by exploring the linear levels it is possible to ignore the rock-paper-scissors mechanics required by elemental attacks, but in boss fights it is essential to have a specialized team, capable of quickly eroding the resistance bar of the enemy by attacking his weaknesses. There's the auto-battle function for minor encounters and an intricate system of items like Cones of Light, Relics and Traces to level up each character. These resources can only be collected up to a certain point, with the game blocking progression on multiple occasions forcing us to level up before we can face a boss. However, Star Rail's combat is so satisfying that it's almost never boring to go back to facing the same group of enemies to acquire the resources necessary to level up. A problematic monetization Hitting the matcha monetization wall when a title is done this well always leaves a bad taste in the mouth Lately more and more studies and regulations believe that prize funds are a danger to the mental health of those who play. The risk of giving birth to an addiction is real and should never be underestimated. In Honkai: Star Rail it is possible to get a few tokens to try your luck simply by playing, but the blocks on progression imposed by the game design and the very low chances of obtaining a new character will lead fans to spend real money. During our 20 hours together with Star Rail we got rewards for playing about 60 prize box tickets. After spending all of them we only got one new character, and not even of maximum rarity (five stars). To further annoy is the unnecessarily complicated currency system (there are more than seven) and daily repeatability limits of the activities that give more game coins and resources to enhance your character. However, when you decide to invest real money, everything becomes simpler and more direct and waiting periods are removed. The set of free characters that you get for playing are fun, relatively strong, varied and will guarantee you some really fun anime magic-infused fights. The title, however, wants you to interact with the shop so it will give you a test for some battles of the characters obtainable only in the prize boxes and it is clear that some are decidedly stronger than others. The ~problem~, if we can call it that, is that each of the characters in Honkai: Star Rail is really well done. Its moveset is unique, as are the aesthetics and balancing each other's strengths and weaknesses in the most difficult fights is a fun challenge that never tires. If this game were a full-price product where characters unlock over time or by completing challenges or side quests, it would be an excellent, long-lived title and one of the best and most creative RPGs of recent years.", "date": "2023-05-12", "grade": "7.0"}
