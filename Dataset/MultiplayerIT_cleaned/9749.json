It all starts with The Passing, full-bodied DLC for Left 4 Dead 2 in which the protagonists met their counterparts from the first episode. The peculiarity of that expansion, the one that interests us when talking about Left 4 Dead: The Sacrifice, was Bill's corpse clearly visible in the last map. How was it there? The Passage, the second free expansion, in this case applicable to both episodes, answers precisely this question. That is, it stages the umpteenth fight of the Survivors against the infected, with the final sacrifice of one of the protagonists, which will be decided on the spot by a brave man. For those unfamiliar with the game, let's summarize briefly: it is a cooperative shooter in which a group of four humans must survive zombies to save their skin. Apart from what has already been said, The Sacrifice has nothing original compared to what has been seen in recent years and, in this case, there is not even something to complain about. Valve probably intends such operations as a way to monetize by selling other copies of the game. In an era in which expansions have become DLC and often make amateur works regret, even if they cost money, receiving a nice gift is always a pleasure. A gift horse... The new campaign consists of three maps, of which the first two are original, while the third is recycled from The Passing. The Survivors will have to cross a port area to get to raise a bridge and escape. As usual, outdoor areas will alternate with indoor areas, moments to be overcome by running and others in which you will have to resist the attack of the hordes and the omnipresent Tanks. In general, these are well-studied and built levels, but which do not offer striking moments. Some passages are more beautiful than others, such as the suspended walkway that connects to the ship or the pond with attached car wrecks, but it's hard to be amazed. We've been playing Left 4 Dead for two years now and we know what to expect. However, expect about forty minutes of excellent gameplay in the company of the old characters and, if you only have Left 4 Dead 2, you will also receive the nice surprise of seeing the No Mercy campaign from the first episode installed. Also, if you also purchase Team Fortress 2 (or if you already have it), you will receive two free items.", "date": "2010-10-08", "grade": "8.0"}
