Yes, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the best episode of the series, and it is due to a large number of favorable circumstances. The original chapter, released three years ago on Wii U, which we have widely praised, was already an excellent starting point; two equally valid updates (1 and 2) were then added to that base. Of course, by putting everything together in a small cartridge, the final result could only be of absolute value. We are not here to belittle this which, on balance, is a truth that is difficult to contest; what we want to underline however, slightly lowering the final evaluation compared to the Wii U edition, is how much the impact can count with such a production. Mario Kart 8 was the first chapter of the saga to have funding and first-class treatment, after having spent years behind both the usual Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda, and Super Smash Bros. His arrival was disruptive: it was the only title to avoid the total commercial failure of Wii U (more than three out of five users bought it), and it marked a clear departure from its recent predecessors in terms of quality. Furthermore, the ~problem~ we raised at the end of that review has not been overcome at all, but only postponed: Mario Kart 8 was - and is - so beautiful as to put a big question mark on the future of the series. It is a harmonious amalgam of everything that has come before, and is so rich that it cannot ~add~ yet more elements. Or rather, maybe some new tracks will arrive on Switch in the future, but let's always stay there: Mario Kart 9 will have to deal with this obstacle, or actually become a simple episodic update as is the case for certain sports titles. As proof of what we have said, we point out that, following the canonical timing of the series, the new chapter should have come out this year, not a ~simple~ re-edition: Mario Kart DS was published in 2005, Mario Kart Wii in 2008, Mario Kart 7 in 2011, Mario Kart 8 in 2014. Mario Kart 8 arrives on Switch in the Deluxe edition, rich in content and beautiful as never before Race Although the battle mode, which we will discuss shortly, is loved by many players, there is no doubt that Mario Kart's DNA is best expressed in traditional racing. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe in this is similar to its predecessor: very modular and easily controllable drifts, pre-skidding hop always with R, glider and propeller for - respectively - aerial and aquatic sections. Obviously there is also anti-gravity, which allows you to run in morphologically overturned portions of land, or more simply on vertical walls; although it may seem excessively complicated, anyone who has already played Mario Kart 8 knows very well how much the feeling of running is never altered by these variables. In the game you think about arriving before the others, without stopping if you are upside down: the only ingredient that really changes in this context is the possibility of colliding with the other pilots and, being in anti-gravity, obtaining an acceleration rather than a deceleration . Here, a novelty that will be of interest to a few fans, but which is very welcome, is the assisted driving: Nintendo has focused a lot on this feature, so much so that at the start of the game, and only in certain modes, it must be deactivated because it is the standard. What exactly does it do? Well, it prevents you from going off track. The character cannot go beyond the limits of the circuit, therefore he does not fall or suffer particularly serious shocks from the barriers. Naturally such a setting does not allow you to pass close to some obstacles, as well as to take certain shortcuts, but this driving mode, limited to beginners, really succeeds in its intent: in this way an inexperienced rider has much more fun (and there there is no doubt that, although Mario Kart can be tackled ~seriously~, it is also, if not above all, a game for beginners). For the reasons previously mentioned we also assure you that no ~pro~ player will ever get better results using this help, and in time trials it is not even accessible. Regarding driving, the second big novelty of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the weakening of fire hopping, a technique used to prolong post-slipping acceleration through a series of small jumps to the right and left: it was not easy to use, and required a long time to be mastered, but evidently it had not been foreseen by Nintendo, who preferred to remove it. At the moment no t has emerged~advanced~ replacement technique for this, but it is still too early to rule out the possibility of its discovery. Certainly this choice brings motorcycles back into play, whose advantages and disadvantages compared to karts now depend only on the morphology of the track. The third noteworthy addition concerns the introduction of further acceleration out of the curve: keeping the drift loaded, after a few seconds you get the first mini-turbo, followed by the super mini-turbo, and now, allowing more time to pass, the 'ultra mini turbo. It's a useful maneuver but it will make a difference more in time trials than in races: based on the game statistics we can tell you that we got the ultra mini-turbo 300 times out of about 5000 drifts, as opposed to the first and second one which released 2500 and 1200 times. As far as the quality of the tracks is concerned, if you want a detailed analysis, read the previous reviews of Mario Kart 8 and related DLCs: here we limit ourselves to reiterating how they are - by detachment - the most beautiful and numerous tracks in the series (as many as 48). Same reasoning for the karts, the characters (some exclusive to this edition, such as King Boo and the Inklings from Splatoon) and the accessories: until proven otherwise, in this game there is no ~elected~ combination to go faster everywhere, element which can make you smile but which had partially ruined almost all previous Mario Karts. Items and battles We begin the paragraph by dealing with the subject that combines racing and battles, and which is inalienable from the spirit of the series: weapons. Mario Kart 8 in this area was not as perfect as the Nintendo 64 episode, but it was still fairly balanced, far from the exaggerations seen in the past (in particular in the GameCube chapter and in the Wii chapter). Precisely for this reason the return of the ghost (who steals other people's weapons) surprised, and not a little, but the heavy addition of the double object: now the pilots can carry not only one weapon, but two. Nintendo took a risk, Mario Kart 8 as mentioned did not represent excellence in this area, but it was still valid: such a move risks affecting the entire balance of the game. Everything will have to be evaluated over the weeks and by driving online with riders of equal value, at the moment what we can give you are nothing more than impressions and forecasts. First of all, the ~simplest~ way to aim for victory, i.e. starting fast and staying in the lead for the entire race, comes out strengthened by this choice: now there are two weapons with which to protect yourself (must be used in order of collection) , and it's not stupid to open box after box in search of the horn that destroys the blue shells (the ones that hit the runner in the head when used). Speaking of the latter, always remembering that we will only have the counter-proof by playing online for a long time, it seemed to us that they have not doubled: it is probable that Nintendo has only slightly altered their presence. In a single game (leading) we cashed three times, sometimes none, rarely two, in most cases we received a tortoise per game. Our feeling is that the double object will not help the pilots at the back, used to using the weapon obtained almost immediately, but it is likely that it could significantly alter the hot zone of the race, that is, the one between the pilots in the lead and those in the queue. The risk that these phases become more chaotic is real, but we will really only notice it online, a method that we have only been able to test with a few riders. As for the battles, present only officially on the Wii U, they can be experienced here in eight tracks and five modes. In addition to Boo, the leaf has also been added (which allows you to jump over the other runners, and to steal their loot). We tell you right away: this mode is not tactical and reasoned like in Mario Kart 64. There are many drivers (perhaps too many), and the action is rather anarchic, but still fun if faced with the right spirit (ie without excessive competition). The five modes can almost all be played both individually and in teams, and the most famous remains the one in which you have to destroy the balloons - hanging from the karts - of the other racers. However, ~cops and robbers~ (in which two teams alternately cover the different roles) and ~steal the guardian sun~, in which a single pilot must capture this object and, possibly, keep it away from his opponents until when time runs out. ~Carpet Bob-omb~ is a more chaotic and pyrotechnic version of the classic balloon battle, while ~Coin Catcher~ is probably the part that requires the most reasoning, with aThe game strategy is always uncertain between collecting as much money as possible or avoiding the fight to keep your own. To close, we point out that during the battles it is possible to make a 180-degree inversion, useful and modular, absent in the races. Switches! While awaiting the improvements to the service that will be made in a few months, the Switch online is comparable to that of Wii U. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has the same setting as the original chapter, but with some differences: now it is possible to play online for each mode of battle, but specific research is not allowed in non-tournament races. In a nutshell, you can't look for users in ~world~ and ~regional~ who want to run at 200cc or without weapons: all these options have been relegated to tournaments. An understandable choice, because previously the ramifications were too many and hindered the tracking of opponents, but that Nintendo could have managed differently (for example, as in time trials, using a simple button to switch between 150cc and 200cc). With regard to the fastest engine capacity, we confirm our previous judgment: it has been excessively criticized by most enthusiasts. It's true, some circuits evidently don't adapt well to this speed, and it's equally clear that the need to press the brake radically alters the classic approach to Mario Kart: however, this engine capacity gives good sensations, offers the most adrenaline-pumping driving and the fastest racing fast, and especially in the time trials it will find its fans. In addition to these slight differences inherent in the network, Switch presents a Mario Kart 8 not at all scratched by time, still very pleasant to look at, arrogantly kitsch and sugary, with still commendable animations. This work, like the previous one, travels at 60 frames per second (unless there are three or four users in split screen, in which case it drops to 30 frames), but this time, at least with the console inserted in the dock, the resolution goes up at 1080p: the image is therefore cleaner and sharper than before. But the real added value that Nintendo Switch gives to the saga is precisely its versatility: online and local multiplayer, portable or tabletop, on the TV or between multiple consoles, between multiple consoles with various users each. The possibilities are really many (but for each Switch you need a copy of Mario Kart, know that) and this can only benefit the nature of the game, which was born for multiplayer and sublimated by it. In this sense, the quality of the controls with a single Joy-Con struck us: a solution that is very far from being optimal, but still effective and not very limiting. As for the motion controls, if you want to tackle the title this way, the only acceptable variant is to connect the Joy-Con to their plastic support: a good compromise, but still far from the quality of the Mario Kart Wii steering wheel. Unfortunately we have not been able to test the work with the steering minutes to be applied to the Joy-Con, which will probably represent a mandatory purchase for lovers of motion control.", "date": "2017-04-24", "grade": "9.3"}
