Faced with different plots, the structure of these stories was always very similar: a western (super) man met savages and somehow civilized them. Some let themselves be subjected without resistance, while others, the bad ones, opposed the conqueror. The former were usually connoted with submissive and virtuous characters, while the latter were prone to commit any kind of wickedness: from human sacrifices to cannibalism, passing through rapes, black magic and so on. Of course, it was rare for such stories to arise from direct experience. In most cases the writers started from travel reports, mixing them with clichs and legends, to get to writing stories that exactly met the expectations of the public. These two girls will be watching us throughout the game Stay! Democratic People's Republic of Korea! does something similar: trying to tell life in North Korea, he puts us in the shoes of an American tourist who goes to visit two of his pen pals. Arrived on the spot after various vicissitudes, he discovers that in reality they are two girls, moreover enlisted in the army, who take him to a barracks outside the Korean capital Pyongyang. The two have the task of controlling him and making him visit the nation, leading him to see some of its most characteristic places. Unfortunately, from the very beginning it is clear where the developer wants to go with this, given that the protagonist approaches every situation with an unpleasant sense of superiority. Hiking Stay! Stay! Democratic People's Republic of Korea! is a classic visual novel, with dating simulator overtones. So you read a lot of text and, from time to time, make choices. The not too veiled goal is to have a relationship with one of the two girls, making them fall in love. The only variant with respect to the standard formula of the genre is the presence of a map that allows us to choose which tourist attractions to visit in the company of one of the two (never together). In total there are six places that can be reached (seven if we consider the final location), but only three can be selected during a game. Between one excursion and another there are also sequences that take place in the barracks and which usually involve all the characters. At the interface level, the DEVGRU-P title presents the classic text box in the lower part of the screen, with the options available during reading on the sides (saving, fast forwarding of the text, skip key and so on). The backdrops are the most interesting part of the game From this point of view Stay! Stay! Democratic People's Republic of Korea! it does not behave differently from that of most visual novels, even if, frankly, the interface is not very pleasant and we would have preferred it to be less visible during the reading phases. Fortunately it is possible to hide it when needed, so you can admire the beautiful drawings of the characters, with the girls taking on different poses to underline their moods, and the backdrops. The latter are the most interesting element of the game, at least on a cultural level, since they are iconic images of North Korea. Of course, they are similar to postcards, but they give strong support to the atmosphere and help frame the story better. Bad, bad, bad music, really ugly and not very suitable for the story being told. The world of visual novels has accustomed us to very different soundtracks. That of Stay! Stay! Democratic People's Republic of Korea! seems to be composed of stock songs that never follow the tone of the story and often clash with it. It's probably the worst side of the whole production. The point of view But let's get back to the narrative. The typical dialogue of Stay! Stay! Democratic People's Republic of Korea! is composed according to a pattern that is repeated throughout the story: the girls exalt some aspect of North Korea, or make enthusiastic references to the glorious leader, i.e. the caricature Kim Jong-un, without particularly striking the protagonist, who underlines how in reality what they say is wrong and that the alternative they hate so much, capitalism, is actually better (we have full supermarkets, always available electricity, freedom of speech and so on). Now, we are not interested in making political judgments on the North Korean situation, because we realize that, from the outside, we know very little about that nation (like many others, for that matter). Of course we have our own point of view, but we don't consider it particularly interesting or approffounded. Of course, we know that on the internet it is not customary to refrain from talking about what one does not know (one also becomes a webstar in this way), but we will not be the ones to fuel collective barbarism by trying to reduce a complex and dramatic situation, experienced by millions of people, a few words from sports bars. Obviously there are winking scenes Perhaps it is for this very reason that the tones of Stay! Stay! Democratic People's Republic of Korea! they seemed so unpleasant to us: because they arise from a series of clichs passed off as absolute truths, which bring the two worlds into contact starting from a sense of superiority that is expressed in the most violent and obvious world possible, culminating in the act of cultural submission definitive, symbolized by mating / insemination. It is not for nothing that failing to seduce the girls leads to the worst ending, which effectively condemns all the characters, including the civilizer. This is not to say that North Korea shouldn't be satirized, even if it's actually done by us and is more of an act of propaganda than a way to spread awareness and attack power (the only true object of good satire). , but only that the satire of Stay! Stay! Democratic People's Republic of Korea! it's bad and doesn't move the already well-established convictions of its audience by a millimetre. Paradoxically, it is not even effective in the opposite direction, because it does not touch the most controversial points of the Pyongyang regime. In short, overall it is sterile and ineffective. Moreover, having understood the general scheme, the whole story becomes boring to read, to the point that with the umpteenth dialectic opposition between the West and the communist dictatorship, one feels like skipping the text... it's not a nice compliment for a game completely focused on reading.", "date": "2017-05-30", "grade": "4.0"}
