The surprising element is the control system which relies on point and click dynamics not particularly suitable for this kind of solution. Luckily for us we played the mobile version, which is more suited to this setting than the PC and PlayStation 4 versions, but we feel obliged to warn you in advance that, although the title is the same, the experience could be different depending on the platform choice. That said, we can finally deal with this particular noir set in the thirties that puts us in the shoes of Wilt, a hero of yesteryear and an enterprising spy with a deep voice and quick witticisms. Once past the introduction, which makes it clear the importance of the narrative dimension, the extremely intuitive interface and the stealth sections are the first things that catch the eye. Characters can hide in a large number of ways but cover may be inadequate depending on the context, which takes into account flashes of light and the direction of arrival of enemies. Luckily the alcoves allow us to move from one side of the hiding place to the other but, in order to properly exploit all the other shelters, it is good to plan the whole action before getting involved and this forces us to carefully study everyone's movements enemies patrolling an area. Luckily for him, Wilt also has the ability to knock out the guards even though in some situations he can't get away without the help of a specialist. During the adventure, other characters appear, the first of which is a mole who is obviously incognito and can move without arousing suspicion. By combining the skills of the two it is possible to overcome the initial mission of the game; the first of several multi-character situations that will also allow us to take advantage of Arno's mechanical skills and those of the fascinating Siska as a burglar. In this case the mole is in charge of exploring and, once he has accessed an area, observing the movements of any guards who control it. In this way the second character, specifically the protagonist, can attempt a sortie being able to calculate the movements of the enemies without risking suddenly being faced with a nightstick when a door is opened. The Calvino Noir concept comes from a highly risky design choice The advantages of two and a half sizes Calvino Noir has all the air of being a well-finished title, unfortunately the nasty surprise comes immediately and it is a rather important problem. The point-and-click dynamic weighs down the already slow and sometimes cumbersome movements of the characters, who often find themselves having to cross long empty areas while we play the role of bored spectators. On touch devices things are more streamlined than on the PC, where the control system passes through the mouse pointer, but the combination of the dynamics of movement of the characters, the slowness of the guards, the strict trial and error structure and the checkpoints are not always hit the spot, it can often be frustrating and represents a big problem for the usability of the title. Luckily we can move the characters at the same time and select racing mode to cut the time. Option which, however, is almost impossible to exploit in stealth actions, given that the noise due to the increase in speed allows the guards to identify us. In any case, the tools to proceed are there, including the usual exclamation point icon that appears on the head of a guard when the alert indicator reaches its maximum. When this unfortunate situation occurs, it is necessary, as in the most classic of stealth games, to flee and wait for everything to return to normal; in Calvino Noir the question, thanks to the controls that are not exactly spot on, can be heavy. And it is perhaps because of the awareness of this limit that the developers have decided to leave us a small margin which in many situations can prove to be saving in no uncertain terms. In fact, Wilt enjoys a short amount of time to attack an enemy even when he has been discovered by the latter, a trick which in any case does not solve a setting that is problematic from the root. No problem, however, from an artistic point of view. The shot is lateral but the engine is three-dimensional and this gives the rooms a decidedly pleasant depth. Furthermore, the use of a 3D engine brings dynamic lights that create valuable effects thanks towith chiaroscuro and shadows that grow bigger as they escape the torches held by the guards. The detail of the band playing against the backdrop of the first level private is nothing short of delightful; just one of the many touches of class that surprise us during an adventure that takes us through the suggestive architecture of old Europe and seven chapters set in as many maps. Each of these is quite large but what is striking is the architectural variety: the shot flows showing us sewers, towers and streets constantly wet with rain, giving us the sensation of crossing a city, despite the lateral shot inevitably limiting the horizon. Almost magical, in short, even if some anonymous assets and the lack of detail, often evident in the case of the models, do not allow the image to have that overall coherence which would have guaranteed Calvino Noir excellence, if only from the point of view from a stylistic point of view. In any case, the overall performance is nothing short of excellent and is embellished with spot-on portraits that accompany the dialogues and, more importantly, by an excellent sound sector. Paying attention to the ears the first thing that stands out is the soundtrack which contributes an important way to the atmosphere. But we must also mention the dubbing, suggestive and seasoned with subtitles translated into good Italian that complete a decidedly positive picture in which Calvino Noir's excellent narrative dimension fits perfectly. The tone of the voice actors is often caricatured but the small excesses are a classic of the thirties spy film imagery and don't cause any discomfort. Some jokes, to tell the truth, reveal some unmistakable traces of amateur dubbing but, in most cases, the dialogues are more than valid and, thanks to the possibility of choosing some of the answers, they are an integral part of the experience. The iOS version As for the iOS version, which has already received a patch intended to improve the behavior of the guards, the difference to underline, beyond the controls, is that the overall price of the experience amounts to around 11 euros. The initial cost of 3.99 euros in fact guarantees only the first act while the other two, which can be purchased in a single package, cost an additional 6.99 euros.", "date": "2015-09-04", "grade": "5.5"}
