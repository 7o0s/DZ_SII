The series born from the pencil of Akira Toriyama, then transformed into an animated series and a worldwide phenomenon, has risen to the stage of video games countless times and it has become difficult to offer something other than the dozens of fighting games that Bandai, in the last twenty years, has produced for practically every platform, starting timidly with two-dimensional sprites to arrive at the 3D cel-shaded graphics of the latest iterations. Battle of Z had tried to change the cards on the table in its own way, getting closer than any other game to the real feeling of pyrotechnic cartoon battles, but it had failed on several fronts and so Bandai Namco, having sensed the potential of that formula, has resorted to a decidedly more prestigious developer than Artdink for the debut of Dragon Ball on the new generation consoles: in fact, he has entrusted the development of this Xenoverse to Dimps, the software house that signed some of the most popular tie-ins of Dragon Ball for the last two generations of consoles. The result is a decisive step towards the future, but there is still a long way to go. Dragon Ball: Xenoverse is a very interesting experiment that lays excellent foundations for the future The fate of the multiverse The approach of Dragon Ball: Xenoverse towards the famous Goku saga is really intelligent and is probably the strong point of the new Bandai Namco production. Even the stones know the story of the Saiyan transplanted to Earth by now, so instead of telling it all over again for the trillionth time, Dimps decided to play on the concept of ~what if~. What if... Raditz ducked out of the way at the last moment and Piccolo's Makankosappo only killed Goku? What would have happened if... Frieza had immediately transformed into his perfect form, leaving no way out for Krillin, Gohan and Vegeta? The Dragon Ball: Xenoverse ~campaign~ answers these questions by putting us in the shoes of a character of our own that we will create when we start the first game. We will be able to choose his race among five that differ slightly in terms of powers and statistics: the earthlings, the Saiyans, the Nameccans, the aliens of the Freeza lineage and the gummy Majins. The creation screen is rich enough in options, and allows you to build our ideal Z Warrior by choosing, for example, the hairstyle, skin color and other details. Once the operation is concluded, we will be immediately welcomed by Trunks in the city of Tokitoki. The son of Bulma and Vegeta, in fact, leads the time patrols that monitor the course of history, and has discovered that something is interfering with some of the most crucial events that occurred in the past. It is a good opportunity to relive the most important moments of Dragon Ball Z, from the arrival of Vegeta on Earth to the clash with Freeza and then with Cell, for example, and there is also space for the facts of the last cartoon film animated, The Battle of the Gods. Unfortunately, however, some chapters that are perhaps less decisive but equally memorable in the long Dragon Ball saga are missing, and Dimps has skipped some battles even, making a selection that we are sure he will not be able to please everyone. However, we must admit that the idea is really intriguing, and allows you to relive the adventures we know by heart from a completely different perspective: our alter-ego, in fact, will have to travel through time and intervene to ensure that history follows its course . His actions, on the other hand, will generate an infinity of parallel universes in which events have taken place in a completely different way and which will form the gist of our secondary activities. In case it wasn't clear, in short, in Dragon Ball: Xenoverse we fight, and even a lot, indeed a lot. Schrdinger's cat Calling Dragon Ball: Xenoverse a fighting game is, in our opinion, quite misleading. It's true, you have to beat up enemy after enemy for hours and hours, but the structure of the game, the control system, the context and the framework are totally different from those of the ~usual~ fighting games. Xenoverse is, more than anything else, a long adventure divided into missions: there are those entrusted to us by Trunks and the Kaiohshin of Time, which follow the main storyline, and then there are the secondary ones - the so-called parallel missions - that we can face in any moment. By completing missions, whether you win or lose, you earn experience points and level up, also receiving points to spend to improve your character's main stats, such asin an RPG. Role-playing contaminations, then, don't stop there. Our character's movelist is initially determined by the chosen race, but it can soon be expanded by equipping the many special moves that are unlocked by completing missions, almost as if they were weapons. At some point we will also be able to learn the special techniques of the most famous characters, choosing them as mentors and completing specific missions on their behalf. The pool of skills is immense, even if many are similar both in appearance and in effectiveness; some are exactly identical, indeed, and only change the color of the energy emission of the moment or of the animation that produces it. Do you want to create an earthling who shoots energy waves from his mouth and knows the Ginyu squad's special techniques? Please make yourselves comfortable. The only obstacle, in fact, is luck. While it is true that some skills can simply be purchased, others will have to be unlocked by completing the missions that guard them, but everything is left to chance and that Kaiohken that you would love to learn could only come out after repeating the same mission fifteen times. The same goes for the costumes with which it is possible to customize our hero, improving or worsening his statistics, and for the characters that are not unlocked by simply completing the story missions: we will be able to play as Goku and friends only in competitive mode or in parallel missions, and also as regards the roster there would be something to say. Despite the staggering number of fighters, Dragon Ball fans are sure to lament the omission of major characters and transformations. Both Android 16 and Doctor Gero, for example, are missing, yet Dimps wasted their space to dedicate it to some anonymous Freeza minions. A decidedly strange and controversial choice, which left a bitter taste in our mouths also because Dragon Ball: Xenoverse is technically delicious: while not reaching the threshold of 60 frames per second, the PlayStation 4 version we tested runs smoothly and without slowdowns or uncertainties, proposing a clean and accurate polygonal modeling and really perfectly animated characters. Too bad, however, for the scenarios, poor in detail and only marginally destructible: waves of energy that should have opened gashes in the mountains merely leave a temporary mark or mow down some trees, considerably limiting the catastrophic spectacularity that has always characterized the clashes of the series. An uncharted territory Despite the goodness of the idea, in fact, Dragon Ball: Xenoverse is a title that deserves to be refined and improved in many respects. Beyond the case that dominates the unlocking of skills, costumes and fighters, the new Dimps game doesn't quite understand what it wants to be. It's an action game, of course, and we could almost call it a fighting game if its structure didn't give more incentive to cooperation than to competitiveness, also by virtue of a not exactly well-tested control system. Xenoverse battles take place on three axes, often pitting teams of two or more characters each. The controller's face buttons are associated with two types of melee attacks with which to form combos, the usual energy strike and an evasive maneuver. By holding down the backbones, however, you access a menu for the basic special moves and one for the more powerful ones, which completely consume the Ki indicator. The latter represent just one of the many mechanics that Dimps should review: expressed through very short dynamic shots, they would like to replace the long and spectacular attack sequences of the past to make the fights more fluid, but they only end up disorienting the player who throws them and unbalance the outcome of the clash, considering the power of some of them. Each fight, therefore, is a succession of combos, teleports and high-speed flights interspersed with occasional energy waves and atomic explosions; spectacular to look at, and also fairly entertaining during the first hours of the game, the clashes become heavier and more repetitive when one realizes that having delegated the special moves to simple shortcuts has killed every technicality, and that engaging in aerial maneuvers more complex is very difficult due to the bad collision system and a camera that, caught in the frenzy of the action, never knows what to frame even when it locks onto a specific target. We expected worse given the difficulty of reproducing Dragon Ball's eclectic fights, but Xenoverse also suffers from the same problem as Battle of Z, and that is an unbalanced difficulty curvewhich often forces players to level up by repeating the parallel missions to overcome that of the new opponent, rather than deepening their knowledge of a character or game techniques which, to be honest, practically don't exist, so much so that there is not even a training mode. Even the artificial intelligence of our supporting characters leaves a lot to be desired, making some escort missions terribly frustrating, especially due to the systematic absence of checkpoints during the chapters divided into phases. That's why we strongly recommend that you grind missions together. Tokitoki City basically exists for this. Playstation 4 trophies With 36 bronze, 11 silver, 2 gold and platinum trophies to crown the collection, Dragon Ball: Xenoverse keeps you busy. It's not even difficult to scrape them together, above all you need consistency given that, for example, you will have to complete each mission and unlock all the characters, costumes and skills. What's my DESTINY, Dragon Ball Surprise, surprise. Dragon Ball: Xenoverse is a fighting game, it's an action game, it's an RPG and it's also an MMO: a Massive Multiplayer Online game in which our alter ego, created ad hoc, can meet those of the other players in the city of the Kaiohshin of Time . We tell you right away that the idea is very nice, but also that the execution leaks from all sides. And the fact that Tokitoki City is populated by dozens and dozens of Saiyans named after the characters of Naruto and One Piece is only a small part of the problem. Dimps overemphasized the wrong feature, making the Tokitoki City hub a crucial element of the entire experience. We can freely explore the city of time patrols, divided into three areas full of shops and NPCs to interact with: we will be able to go to the capsule seller to buy some healing consumables that will come in handy in difficult times or buy new skills or costumes from the appropriate kiosks. for example, and when we play online the city will be populated by other players' avatars. Offline, on the other hand, its inhabitants will be randomly generated NPCs to give us the idea that it is equally inhabited, but the problem is that Dimps has decided to separate the two hubs despite both being connected to the Internet, and this means that it is not uncommon to be ~disconnected~ from Tokitoki City even when we are playing on our own. Just reconnect to resume the game, mind you, but it is a senseless procedure, just as it makes no sense that to look for a competitive or cooperative game you have to go and physically interact with a certain NPC. Ironically, after each game we will find ourselves at the entrance to the city, and to play another one we will have to return to the NPC in question every goddamn time. Also due to its repetitive and annoying music, Tokitoki City soon becomes the symbol of everything that is wrong in Dragon Ball: Xenoverse, a useless and summarily implemented tinsel. It would have been better if it had been possible to press a simple button to call up the list of cooperative and competitive missions available, also because if Dimps wanted to focus on the social aspect, he would have had to introduce a way to interact with other players that was more complete and immediate than some preset phrase and a large list of animations. So, however, Tokitoki City looks like the Tower of Destiny, but much less practical and decidedly more dispersive.", "date": "2015-02-27", "grade": "7.8"}
