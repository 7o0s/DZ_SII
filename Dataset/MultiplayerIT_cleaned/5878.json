The complete series consists of six English-language episodes. The following text contains very violent spoilers. The first season of Game of Thrones is Telltale's best show since The Walking Dead. There are two reasons: the quality of the writing and the weight of what is at stake. Every confrontation is fraught with consequences, and this is as true for story crossroads as it is for combat. Therefore, even if the mechanics are the usual ones that have been grinding our souls for years, the tension for the outcome of the clashes pushes us to press the keys on command with excitement and fear. On the other hand, Games of Thrones is a powerful drama, full of visceral conflicts, like the novels from which it takes its name. Also thanks to Ty Corey Franck, the personal assistant of George R. R. Martin, who collaborated with Telltale as a narrative consultant. In short, Game of Thrones strikes the right chord at the right time, and it does so through the events of a noble northern family, the Forresters. Similar to what happened to the Starks, the Forresters are divided, persecuted and humiliated. Their fortunes are on the wane, their military strength reduced to the bone, and morale worn down by the setbacks that have befallen family members. But they haven't broken yet. As Rodrik, Mira, Gared and Asher, your job is to fight to avenge the Forrester house name and save it from complete destruction. A story of redemption and war, that of Game of Thrones, which leaves behind a long trail of corpses and heartbroken souls. Adding to the interest for the player is the fact that the story of the game is told in the present of the novel. That means we meet well-loved characters like Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister and Daenerys Targaryen, and infamous ones like Cersei Lannister and Ramsay Bolton. These characters have familiar faces from the television series and are voiced by the same actors who play them. Equally good are the voice actors who lend their voices to the many characters invented by Telltale. Added to this are the brilliant lines of dialogue, always fitting for the character who speaks them. You will therefore understand that it is easy to get carried away in the story told by Telltale and marry the cause of the Forresters. Even more so if we have to make all the most difficult decisions for them. And we can guarantee you that in this season finale you will have to make choices that will haunt you for a long time. A visceral season finale! Game of Thrones: The Ice Dragon will inspire you to play it all over again It's not over yet As the first season of Game of Thrones ends, a sequel is not only possible, but necessary. In fact, the history of the Forrester house does not end here, as we will see shortly. And speaking of what's left over, the final summary is noteworthy. Against the backdrop of hand-drawn screens, we hear the voices of those who witnessed the lives of the characters we played throughout this first season. Comments and reflections on their deeds are a way to make us rethink the meaning of our choices and the consequences they have had. A very clever way to intertwine the decisions we've made with the larger story, making us feel like we're part of a world that lives and adapts to what we do, rather than little cars racing on a track veering left or right in front of various crossroads. And speaking of crossroads and choices, the last episode confronts us with dilemmas with an irreversible outcome. Let's take Mira, for example. Her story ends in a cell in King's Landing, waiting to be executed. We can decide to save our lives by agreeing to a repulsive offer of marriage, or we can stand tall in the face of the executioner, during a powerful scene that brings out the integrity of the girl in the midst of the squalor that surrounds her. So let's talk about life or death, black or white. A choice that would make you want to play all over again to try a different outcome. And the same goes for Gared who, faced with the secret of the North Grove, must decide whether to use it to run to the aid of the Forrester castle or to fight the threat of the undead. These choices, in addition to being difficult, have outcomes that drastically affect what happens next season. The save of this first series of Game of Thrones is therefore one that you will want to keep on your hard drive to load it when the sequel begins. Considering the emotional impact of the story, we could have given Game of Thrones a higher rating, but several aspects weigh on the overall rating. The primo is the backwardness of the graphics engine. On a smartphone or tablet it will still look decent, but seeing animations like this on a PC or modern console is painful. Likewise, the game system needs to be overhauled, and let's not talk about its essence. Timed events are fine when the stakes are high, but there are endless ways to implement them. The one created by Telltale is too affected by the weight of the years and the numerous reiterations. Finally, let's go back to what was mentioned at the beginning of the paragraph about the closure of the story. This episode does not completely resolve the story of the Forrester house. Many narrative threads remain suspended to be resumed in the following season. While this allows the story to take up all the space it needs, it's also true that the player deserves not to be forced to buy a sequel. On this Telltale has sinned in style, neglecting the potential of a license which, at least as far as the story is concerned, is much more attractive than other recent productions from the same studio.", "date": "2015-11-20", "grade": "7.4"}
