{"name": "Madden NFL 2005: Recensione PS2 Xbox GC", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/madden-nfl-2005-recensione-ps2-xbox-gc.html", "text": "Innovation! Electronic Arts sports titles have always been characterized by everything that appears to be the ~outline~ of the various sports disciplines: licenses, updated roosters, original sponsors and anything else that frames the rich sports of today . Obviously Madden NFL 2005 could not miss all this and, in fact, we will find all the updated licenses and thousands of official statistics on our champions. But we already knew this before putting the game on the console. The big news brought by this 2005 version of the Madden series is the cure for the defensive phase of the game, a real ~blow~ to the gameplay capable of profoundly modifying what has been seen up to now. Not that the part referring to the offensive phase of the game has been neglected, but the innovations introduced to the defense are certainly the most relevant and the juiciest. First of all, the new Hit Stick control system which will allow us, with the simple touch of the right analog stick and with the right timing, to intervene harshly and effectively on the opponent's ball carrier. Attention, everything is not as obvious as it seems from the description we have just made, with the right timing, in fact, the effects of our move change profoundly and, from heroes of the tackle we could pass into laughing stock of the game, letting the opposing player run for several yards before be able to catch him. So we will have to be very careful in the development of the opponent's action and try to almost guess the moment in which to use the right stick, to avoid creating deep holes in the defense of our team in the event of a failure of our action. This new system is certainly the most striking and influential novelty on the gameplay and the beauty is that everything is not left to chance but, in addition to the right timing we will also have to choose the right defender with which to carry out the action, otherwise we will risk seeing the our defender literally bouncing off the more corpulent opponent.. the cure for the defensive phase of the game is a real ~blow~ to the gameplay, capable of profoundly modifying what has been seen up to now Innovation! In addition to the new Hit Stick system, there is the possibility of using the defensive playmaker function by indicating, easily and effectively with the simple pressure of the right analog stick after selecting the chosen player, the direction in which you want to make our partner move . This, it goes without saying, allows us to create new defensive tactics at any time and effectively anticipate the opponent's choices. To complete this beautiful innovative picture there is an A.I. defensive which has been increased drastically compared to the old versions of the EA title. A few games will be enough to realize how true this statement of ours is. In fact, the opposing team moves in an absolutely realistic way in defense, without hesitation or downtime and not only the interceptions but also the marking doubles or the blitzes on our quarterback are much more frequent. The matches are therefore absolutely fought and quite spectacular. The heart of the game The fulcrum of Madden NFL 2005 is certainly the Franchise Mode through which we will come into contact with one of the historic NFL franchises and we will manage it completely trying to bring it to the conquest of the coveted Super Bowl. Within this mode we will control all the important aspects of a football club: training and technical situations like real coaches, relations with the press in Storyline Central up to player relations and the discussion of contracts. All information will be managed through a comfortable PDA, in which we will receive emails from the athletes and all the news useful to us for the management of the club. We will also be able to read national newspapers such as USA Today and even local ones, to touch what the media and people think about our work, but above all to read the real outbursts of our players. We will be the tip of the balance in all the delicate situations that can affect the team's performance. If we sell the team's ace, the whole group will suffer psychologically, if we don't let an important player play, the same will happen as well as a fallout on the form of the player himself. We will have to be cautious and make our choices carefully in order to make it to the Super Bowl. From a strictly technical point of view, we will be able to create our own schemes and fully customize our team in terms of image with new uniforms and new club colors. Obviously at the beginning of the sports year we will be able to play friendly matches and thus prepare for the season, while once theuse the same season we will throw ourselves on the market and on the Draft. So you understand how deep this mode is and how many hours of fun it can give to the American football fan, of course, on the contrary, it can be difficult and distracting for the less experienced user. In addition to the reconfirmed player creation mode, the possibility of creating our team's fans and really customizing them in the most ridiculous ways has been introduced, a nice addition that creates a little goliardic that never hurts. The classic game options have been confirmed, such as the possibility of playing, in addition to the Franchise Mode, other tournaments and practice competitions, and in addition some very nice minigames have been introduced, useful for perfecting our style of play. Online or not? Technically the game looks almost the same on the three consoles, the versions for the Microsoft console and for the Gamecube are slightly higher in terms of texture and image sharpness. The game boasts very defined polygonal models, even the protective shoulder covers, for the first time in a game, are made separately from the athlete's model and therefore you will see them move independently of the body. The animations are very fluid and stand out above all, for their beauty, those relating to the defensive moves made with the Hit Stick. In this latest version of the EA title, variable atmospheric and light conditions have also been introduced during the game, to make the sensations of an NFL evening even more realistic. Another touch of class is given by the introduction of some skits celebrating the touchdown that are ~exclusive~ to that single athlete: real stars and stripes football takes to the track on our videogame screens. The sound is particularly accurate and Madden's commentary is as always exceptional even if exclusively in English, like the rest of the game. on our videogame screens, real stars and stripes football takes to the track Online or not? The biggest flaw we found playing Madden NFL 2005 thoroughly is the lack of an online mode for both PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The choice made by Electronic Arts to limit this possibility only to American players is quite incomprehensible. You got it right, in the U.S.A. version of the game, in fact, this mode is present and excellently implemented, so as to obviously guarantee incredible longevity, the updating of the squads and even limiting the presence of any cheaters to the maximum with a special recognition system. Certainly in Europe we don't practice football much, but there are thousands of enthusiasts and every year this number is destined to rise in the presence of events such as the Super Bowl, for this very reason the choice of programmers is even more incomprehensible to us. Comment Madden NFL 2005 is the best you could want from an American football game, very fun to play, at the same time simple and profound in terms of playability and destined to set school thanks to the new features introduced, first of all the Hit Stick system . Certainly the lack of online mode makes the product a bit limited, especially in the long run, since it lacks an excellent tool to increase its longevity and since finding opponents on the net would have been easier than looking for them in the circle of one's friends. Technically the three versions of the game are almost identical and therefore the choice is up to you: if you are a football fan, you shouldn't miss this new chapter in the EA saga. Pros Deep and complete Playability at very high levels Technically well done Cons Lack of online mode Sometimes difficult if you are not an expert in football All exclusively in English Every year the challenge between American football games is increasingly fierce, on the one hand we have the Sega ESPN series and on the other the giant Electronic Arts with its Madden. Not always both titles arrive on European soil and, waiting to know if ESPN 2k5 will arrive, we offer you the review of the Pal version, available for all three next generation consoles, of the Ea title, which certainly digs a deep groove as proposed up to now by the titles dedicated to football.", "date": "2004-11-04", "grade": null}
