{"name": "Company of Heroes 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/company-of-heroes-3-recensione.html", "text": "Relic Entertainment was founded in 1997, two years later it revolutionized the real-time strategy market with the unrivaled Homeworld. This is just the beginning: thanks to the quality and inventiveness of its games, the Canadian software house dominated the genre throughout the 2000s. In addition to Homeworld and net of two modest flops, Relic reinvents the strategic two more times: with Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War and Company of Heroes. And it is precisely to the latter, absent from the scenes since 2013, that we warmly welcome back with our review of Company of Heroes 3. A handful of heroes Company of Heroes: You can expand your base, but that's not the most important aspect of this game The peculiarity of the series, which we also find in this third chapter, is the scale of its battles. Company of Heroes emphasizes what we can define as a handful of heroes, a platoon, rather than an endless army, and by approaching the camera almost touching the roofs of the buildings the battle becomes very personal, it sucks you in. It is not enough, and often not allowed, to build a large number of units and have them converge on a hot spot on the map; in the Relic game it is necessary to follow the progress of the individual teams with a different shrewdness, cover after cover. With a little effort you will see your soldiers fight and move on the field in an extraordinary and realistic harmony. It is at this point that the game, through every aspect, including the gameplay, manages to express an almost cinematic beauty: the crackling of the machine guns, the grazing flights of the planes that scatter flakes of white phosphorus on the opposing soldiers. And then our units so small but so detailed that they raise their rifles along the fords, they cower in fear under the barrage, they group along the low walls for epic targeted executions, they take turns at the windows of a building. Not to mention, and this is the big news, the system that regulates the destruction of buildings and elements of the scenario introduced by Company of Heroes 3, capable of credibly crumbling any structure under the blows of the conflict, and allowing the mechanized divisions to show all their brazen power trampling the walls with their tracks. Beautiful and reliable Company of Heroes 3: the destruction of the battlefield is progressive and convincing, a little less when a building where your troops are hiding will collapse The same show that Company of Heroes fans have always been used to, in this case almost literally since at first glance there really aren't any big differences between Company of Heroes 2 and 3. Company of Heroes 3 is clearly built around a more modern, powerful and versatile engine: you can see it in the best amount of general detail, in the more elaborate effects, in the aforementioned new destruction system, in the three-dimensionality of the maps. But the team responsible for Company of Heroes 2 was so good at hiding the technical limitations of the time, that the distances seem small today. But let's be clear: it's Company of Heroes 2 that looks like a game from the future, not Company of Heroes 3 that looks like a game from the past. Would we have preferred better graphics or a wider gap? Without a doubt, who wouldn't deny it, however we are satisfied with a game that is still very nice to look at and which has not made any kind of whim to run between maximum detail and maximum resolution. Brave infantry Company of Heroes: North African campaign features unique troops and desert environment A video game is above all gameplay, let alone a real-time strategy game like this which also has its say from a more competitive point of view. Even here, however, you will not find any upheaval of the well-tried formula: Mechanically Company of Heroes 3 is practically identical to the second game of the series, even if in certain dynamics it is more reminiscent of the 2006 progenitor. The point of contact is found in the greater emphasis placed on infantry, now much more resistant than it was in the past, especially under the blows of a vehicle. This allows you to get away with many of those fateful circumstances in Company of Heroes 2, restoring that lost balance that fans have been arguing about for years. Shall we bet that the opposite problem will now be discussed? The balance of war Company of Heroes 3: this is the tactical map where you can check the progress of the liberation of Italy, move the troops and decide where to act In this case it's a simple matter of taste, neither of the two choices seems to unbalance or even damage the balance of the series. They are different approaches for different palates, the one adopted by CCompany of Heroes 3 is probably the choice that keeps you more time with your eyes on the action, trying to keep soldiers alive, instead of in the menu below restoring lost units. Concentrate on the goal, which in Company of Heroes 3 is essentially the same among a dozen variations: conquer and defend the checkpoints required by the mission. Each checkpoint obtained provides the player with a cyclic reserve of one of the four available resources, necessary to create new soldiers, assemble new vehicles, launch special attacks or build new structures. On some maps there are also control points that can be transformed into field hospitals, to avoid sending injured teams back to the initial positional. In Company of Heroes 3 a tactical pause has also been inserted which allows you to suspend the action and, in complete calm, plan what each unit will have to do. The tactical pause doesn't spoil anything from the original gameplay, but it allows you to go through the game with less pressure, which is not bad given how intense the battles can get. Naturally, the tactical pause is not present in multiplayer, where the Relic series maintains its real-time strategy heart unchanged. The trump card Company of Heroes 3: This third game will be the first to arrive on consoles as well Squads of soldiers, just like armored vehicles, with experience unlock new skills, while by paying with the resources collected it is also possible to improve or specialize their equipment. The vehicles can be upgraded with a new arsenal or completely reconverted: a troop transport truck can evolve into a sort of ambulance to treat soldiers even during action, while a tank will be able to mount an anti-aircraft system or double its machine guns to make it more lethal against infantry. Choices that will also have to be made according to the resources and strategies of whoever you have in front of you. Not all opponents will have a dangerous aviation, as you will not always have all the special attacks in the game available. Their presence will also depend on the mode chosen... The resistance Company of Heroes: The Game will also offer new paid content, such as different troop skins. Mods are also supported Company of Heroes 3 has its inevitable multiplayer component (but ranked matches will be added after the initial adjustment phase), offers fun coop battles where it is possible to face the AI up to four players simultaneously and in its single player modes it offers both a choice classic, the fun linear campaign set in North Africa made up of eight maps, and a small revolution, or rather the captivating Italian campaign where the goal will be to leave Salerno to free Rome. This new mode closely resembles what Total War usually offers, or rather a strategic part that supports the tactical system: what you will have in battles is what you will have managed to organize on the tactical map. To call in air support during a mission, you'll need to have an airfield or aircraft carrier nearby, as well as the right aircraft and the right resources - on the tactical map these are obtained by capturing cities, rather than checkpoints. It is also possible to form alliances with local partisans, to help them in their insurrections, in order to use their sabotage work where we deem it appropriate. When two armies collide on the tactical map, exactly as happens in Total War, the game will return to being the classic Company of Heroes 3. The number of maps also cannot sustain this dilated structure for a long time, leaving room for bored repetitiveness. To reconquer Italy Company of Heroes: Some maps are very, very beautiful to look at as well as to play As in the African campaign, where each mission is meticulously built for maximum involvement, even in the Italian one there will be unique missions with a more choreographed and adventurous construction, let's also say narrative. In short, these are not anonymous missions that replicate a battle in PVP, this happens in the secondary battles that can also be resolved automatically, but experiences built for the occasion by the developers in order to be unique, and so that the landing in Salerno is totally different from the taking of Foggia, both in setting and dramatic crescendo. On the one hand, this makes the Italian campaign more characterized in its main points, fun and exciting until the end, but at the same time it greatly affects replayability once you have managed to complete it. Not a huge problem cconsidering that the two campaigns, with their two different settings, troops and game mechanics, will keep you busy for quite a few hours. Considering the multiplayer, the coop and the four different formations (Us Forces, Wehrmacht, Afrikakorps and British army) instead of the usual two, in Company of Heroes you will certainly not lack for content. The rough diamond Company of Heroes: Bombers and paratroopers leap to the aid of their comrades in peril However, you will lack a certain type of finishing: the menus are unacceptable, the graphics lack that extra sprint even in saturation, the multiplayer is currently reduced to the bone with only two modes because the construction site is still open and for this reason there are also some ranked matches. The Italian campaign is a good news, full of subsystems to pay attention to and it is undoubtedly an idea on which the series can build its future; however, it can be seen that it could offer much more, that the project is a 1.0 which above all lacks more dynamism. The fortune of Company of Heroes 3 is that it is phenomenal to play as always, the artificial intelligence behaves very well and forces you to keep your attention high even on the back lines, the maps of the two campaigns are all very interesting and diversified, with more differences in level compared to those of past games. The fourteen maps available in multiplayer are not bad either, but it will take some time to understand if they will really be up to the tightest competitive matches.", "date": "2023-02-20", "grade": "7.5"}
