The search for truth then does the rest: once you have identified yourself with the protagonist, you will hardly leave the adventure before discovering the many mysteries in which you will be directly involved. Between technology and social control, between repression and the digital world, the surprising ending but already seen at the cinema in a feature film (which I won't reveal otherwise the surprise effect will get fried...) will finally reveal the very particular situations that you will experience during the adventure. First and Second Half The judgment on the interactive aspect is more controversial given that the adventure is decidedly different in its two halves. In the first, very logical and easy-to-solve puzzles unfortunately have to be associated with an absolutely asphyxiating backtracking of the few locations that we will visit with various procedures (getting into the car, returning to one's own neighborhood, returning to our apartment, etc.) to be repeated in too many occasions and which will make the index of fun and playful tension tend to historic lows. The first and second half of the game have rhythm, variety of locations and level of suspense absolutely opposite Reverse speech for the second part: even if the puzzles begin to become decidedly more difficult and sometimes the light of reason alone is not enough to solve them, the backtracking problems fortunately dissolve, many locations around the world are unlocked (and not I'm just... I won't tell you anything else so as not to spoil the surprise), the intertwining of the plot becomes electrifying and the whole pace of the game rises exponentially. We are definitely surprised by these two very different faces of The Moment of Silence and even more strange is the fact that ~the good wine~ is tasted in the second part of the adventure. Usually the exact opposite always happens but maybe the House of Tales Entertainment (specialized in the adventure field with the past productions of Mystery of Druids and various adventures for mobile phones including one dedicated to the X-Files show) had the clear intent to amaze. However, the important thing is that the digital adventurer has enough patience to overcome the first phase, decidedly insufficient, to then appreciate the ~second half~ of The Moment of Silence. So, dear readers, persist, endure and grit your teeth initially: I assure you that you will not regret it! So let's move on to the technical aspect: we are facing a production made discreetly from a graphic point of view. I'm not sure the point and click adventures having to put the latest generation video cards to the test but MoS remains on a decent level thanks to a good realization of the settings, the movies (as I had already written previously) and the animations enough for the characters. Perhaps the latter could have been made with a higher number of polygons and more detailed textures but in any case it cannot be said that the quality is insufficient also thanks to the possibilities given by antialiasing. Music Maestro! As far as the sound sector is concerned, however, we cannot give a definitive judgment at this moment. Let me explain: the accompanying music was excellently made, always punctual with respect to what is happening on the screen. The localization in Italian has yet to be defined since we have heard some ~work in progress~ dialogues. We have been able to ascertain that there is a truly impressive amount of sentences to dub but we still hope that the interpretations are up to par starting with the main protagonist. It would be a shame not to continue the golden age of localizations in the field of graphic adventures, and which has recently seen excellent work for titles such as the two Syberias, Black Mirror and Martin Mystere himself. Comment A good graphic adventure that could have been a masterpiece. This is in brief summary, the judgment on The Moment of Silence, representative of the point and click genre, made by the Germans of House of Tales and which can boast of an excellent plot and an absolutely first-rate narration. A hi-tech thriller set in the near future that you'll want to hear aboutfinish at all costs since curiosity will rise during the adventure. A pity therefore that in this idyllic picture we must also point out a not insignificant flaw which concerns the first part of the game where we will be asphyxiated by excessive backtracking in the few available locations and which could risk making you lose the ~second half~ of the game. which instead acquires many peculiar settings, an incessant rhythm and with the plot of the plot that becomes electrifying. On the other hand, the judgment on the localization has yet to be defined since we tried a ~Work in Progress~ version regarding the dialogues in Italian. We have been able to see that there is a truly impressive amount of sentences to dub but we still hope that the interpretations are up to par starting with the main protagonist. It would be a shame not to continue the golden age of localizations in the field of graphic adventures, and which has recently seen excellent work for titles such as the two Syberias, Black Mirror and Martin Mystere himself. In conclusion, I can tell you that the Moment of Silence experience was decidedly pleasant and positive. Only that slightly bitter aftertaste remains for the feeling of almost a missed masterpiece ... Pros: From the incipit onwards, the plot will keep you glued in front of the monitor Spectacular and excellent quality cut scenes Second part of the game with an incessant rhythm Cons: The first part is a bit soporific Only for point and click lovers The solution of the game At this link you will find the entire solution of the game. Imagine the scene: you are sitting comfortably in front of your PC monitor when you hear disturbing noises from the landing. Between the indifference of a quiet life and curiosity, the latter prevails and so from the wink of the door you see a team of highly armed SWATs badly picking up your neighbor (of whom you know very little because you moved very recently in the new residence). From now on your life takes a decidedly unexpected turn: the search for the truth about that person's arrest and the knowledge of his wife and child will seriously jeopardize your physical safety, your job and the very certainties that you had on the pre-established order. But you will discover that you will not only investigate the arrest of a man: there is much more than boiling in the pot...", "date": "2005-02-22", "grade": null}
