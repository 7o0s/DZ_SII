Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Over the last few years we have seen a proliferation of strategically based casual games on the App Store and Google Play, more or less valid evolutions of the various Farmville which added to the management phase that extra gear represented precisely by the RTS-style sections. The most successful exponent within this subgenre is certainly Clash of Clans, which has become so popular that it guarantees daily revenues of $500,000 to its authors. After a year, probably driven by the need to refresh their offer, the developers of Supercell therefore strike again with an evolution of that experience, changing the context and passing from the sorties of the warrior clans to the more traditional armies, engaged in a mission to liberate the islands of a huge archipelago, whose inhabitants have been imprisoned by evil invaders. At first the differences between Boom Beach and the aforementioned Clash of Clans seem few, but a few minutes are enough for the greater tactical depth and some precise choices that regulate the crafting phase to be evident. To entice users to make use of the precious currency, the emeralds, it was in fact decided to reduce the workforce to a single team, which forces them to wait a little more time for the construction of buildings, defense positions and attack vehicles; unless, of course, you choose to use some emeralds to complete the operations immediately. No man is an island As mentioned above, the substantial innovations introduced in Boom Beach reside above all in the strategic phase. Our base is located exactly in the center of a huge territory to be explored, paying a few gold coins (the virtual currency, released with discreet generosity) to highlight the individual islands that can therefore be attacked and freed from the presence of the invading army. Or those that belong to other users, which we can plunder when they are offline (or at least try), a treatment which, however, can also be reserved for our front (hence the need to strengthen its defences). Once the objective has been decided, one starts with the available ships and troops, unlockable based on the level of experience, after which one can choose how to approach the beach to be conquered: it is possible to disembark and let our soldiers automatically head towards targets within shooting range, destroying them one by one to earn bonuses, or use these bonuses to weaken enemy defenses using the ship's cannon. Compared to the mechanics of Clash of Clans, the possibility of indicating a specific point to be attacked thanks to the signal flares, also on consumption, has also been included: in the famous Supercell title it was necessary to rely completely on the artificial intelligence of the warriors, which led our troops often suffered enormous damage because they were busy breaking down a wall rather than immediately thinking about the nearby mortar which continued to target them, whereas now we can precisely decide what to do and how to do it, at least briefly. This fact revolutionizes the experience, because it is no longer only the numbers of troops used that count but also the way in which the attack is carried out and, therefore, the skill of the player. Of course, we are still far from the quality of a real-time strategy proper, but the steps forward made by Boom Beach in the field of casual games are undoubted. Also from a technical point of view, thanks to graphics that seem to have been made with watercolors, really very pretty and well colored, full of touches of quality class (see the movements of the water and the explosions). Boom Beach offers a casual but much deeper experience than that of Clash of Clans", "date": "2014-04-05", "grade": "7.5"}
