{"name": "L.A. Rush - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/la-rush-recensione.html", "text": "The GTA Effect has struck again. THERE. Rush, as Midway's latest effort is called, follows two main trends to attract the player. One is the famous ~GTA style~, the other is HipHop music evoked by the African-American protagonist, which is the leitmotif throughout the game. L.A.Rush is a literally gigantic game. Midway surpassed Activision and its True Crime in meticulousness in rebuilding Los Angeles. The map is even bigger and more extensive, and includes an area that ranges from Venice Beach and Santa Monica, passing through Downtown and its skyscrapers, ending up on the Hollywood hills. The protagonist of the events narrated is Trikz, and he did it really big this time. He pitted against a local Boss, infuriating him. The latter, of ruthless power, has stolen our car collection, and not only this one. Our mission in L.A.Rush will be to run illegal races organized by Mr. Lidel, in a desperate attempt to repossess our properties. Midway surpassed Activision and its True Crime in meticulousness in rebuilding Los Angeles Side Story: Win over his girlfriend Lana. And all this with the power of the engines and the skill in dangerous driving, through competitions of all kinds, earning money to pump up the car and in general making everyone understand who is the best on the scorching Californian asphalt. There are so many competitions. They range from the Street Races, the Acquire Races (where, having located your car, you will have to take it from point A to point B without it being destroyed by Mr. Lidel's gang), the Retribution Races, the Stunt Races with incredible accidents , the Endurance Races which last like a LeMans, Cross-town Races, and finally the Bonus Races which are special races designed especially for modified cars. There really seems to be something for all tastes and palates, in L.A.Rush, and the potential to be ~The~ hit of this year's winter would be all there, except that... A mix never tested We are faced with a large patch work without a soul. A mix of genres and games never experienced before, which actually adds little to what has been said so far from the automotive genre. Difficult to innovate, of course, but is creating a game from scratch basing its foundations on competition really necessary? The inspirers of L.A.Rush aren't that hard to find. The developers have kept an eye on different monitors. First of all, the one sent by GTA, from which it takes the freedom of movement and the breadth of the map. Second, that Burnout that ~inspired~ spectacular crashes. Next we see Midnight Club, from which the structure of checkpoints and competitions has been ripped. Finally from Driver takes the ~missions~ behind the wheel. Compared to the arcade games of the Rush series, the vehicles of L.A. they are very ~light~. Those accustomed to the ~tanks~ of any Rush will be blown away. Passenger cars have been made lighter for two reasons: to create a greater sensation of speed and to make accidents easier. But if you can pretend for a moment that this isn't a ~Rush~ game, everything could fall back into place, and it's not hard to do since L.A. it could be called anything else: the parental link with the series no longer exists. THERE. it could be called anything else: the parental link with the series no longer exists A mix never tested The feeling with the machines has increased, the speed too, helped by excellent shots, four in total. The handling is great, and as you unlock new cars like the Lotus or Saleen S7 it will get progressively better. There is another though, sadly. Road playability is undermined by excessive traffic. Too many, too many cars and trucks in the middle of the road. Even after hours and hours of practice, traffic will undermine your driving skills. Perhaps to make the accidents more spectacular, Midway left out the most important part: the race. In L.A.Rush you run with the brakes on for fear of crashing all the time. In a game like Burnout3 it was different. The risk was the main component and needed to get boost. In Revenge we can get rid of traffic however we want. But in L.A.Rush we can only disintegrate against each other at full speed. A mix of frustrations. In these cases, an irrepressible desire for Next-Gen arises spontaneously. L.A.Rush is big and fat, but poorly crafted. The PlayStation2 version is the festival of bad clipping, which I had almost forgotten on the threshold of 2006. Even the Cut Scenes snap. The amount of polygons is mediocre, and given the latest PS2 releases it was reasonable to expect more. Too bad, because it would not have been bad to see a LosAngeles a little more refined. The Xbox version eliminates the clipping and washed out texture issues, but doesn't add much. No extra polygons and some added light and refraction effects. The frustration, as well as graphics, is also given by the countless ~Loading~ that appear on the screen, which do not rhyme with ~frantic racing~. It feels like we've gone back a generation, maybe two. More frustrations to come? Yes, from artificial intelligence. As in a modern A Clockwork Orange, you will be forced to put up with every blessed crash. Which looks just fake, fake. The cars always perform the same movements, the same trajectories. In the end, the tactic used to win in L.A.Rush will always be the same: study the opponent's trajectory, accumulate Nitro and shoot them all at the bottom: a placement in the top three is guaranteed, progress too. Very unattractive and exciting. Midnight Club, for example, had introduced a ~random~ artificial intelligence engine, which made it virtually impossible to predict what the opponent could do. All here, the frustrations? Not a chance. As mentioned above, the crashes and barrels will be many, too many. Beautiful, spectacular, but they break the rhythm terribly because L.A.Rush is not a game of accidents. Alright, can we skip them and keep racing? Not a chance. You'll have to watch every holy accident from start to finish. As in a modern A Clockwork Orange, you will be forced to put up with every blessed crash. Comment L.A.Rush fails his missions. It's not a fun game. Indeed, the first few minutes are fun and as the hours go by it becomes literally frustrating. It's not an innovative game, because it doesn't add anything to the genre and it doesn't have its own identity, copying ideas here and there from the most famous franchises. But forgetting that it is a racing game, having too many crashes (not skippable) and an enemy artificial intelligence that is too low and stupid. The realization is mediocre: some good ideas, such as the cars and their reflections, but surrounded by few polygons, bad clipping on PlayStation2 and little general solidity. An apparently captivating title, with its modern HipHop style and the freedom of movement of a GTA, which however loses all its charm after a few minutes played. Pros: Huge map and variety of locations Numerous race modes Great sense of speed Cons: Technically mediocre Artificial intelligence too low Too many crashes, moreover not skippable Cross-platform LA Rush was released on PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Starting from the first and arriving at the Microsoft console version, image resolution and texture quality increase. The problem remains the quality of the title itself, which does not improve. The arduous undertaking of Midway. The undertaking appears titanic. Churning out an illegal racing title that can simultaneously rival the sacred monsters ~Need For Speed~, ~Burnout~ and ~Midnight Club~, and also carve out a worthy exhibition space among the store shelves, nowadays so crowded with everyone's racing games tastes. Midway, recently regenerated and in an innovative vein, squeezes its brains and tries to create a title that differs from the crowd, which attracts and which is ~cool~ as the latest generation of games has imposed to be to please the ~GTA generation ~. Many burdens for Midway, perhaps too many. Let's see how he fared with his new game in the Rush series: Los Angeles Rush!", "date": "2005-10-28", "grade": null}
