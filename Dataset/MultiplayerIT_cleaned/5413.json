{"name": "Hawken", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/171116-hawken-fenice-dacciaio.html", "text": "There are not many titles with a particular story like that of Hawken, a free to play mech-based shooter announced in 2011, which passed through an open beta phase in 2012 - the year it should have been released - and ended up on Steam in Early Access only in 2014, when one step away from the publication of the final build he was involved in the earthquake that hit the publisher Meteor Entertainment, forced to close due to debts. After another year spent in a sort of limbo, with the product practically ready but abandoned to itself by the developers of Adhesive Games, the news of the transition to Reloaded Games arrived, the same ones who saved APB: All Point Bulletin transforming it into APB: Reloaded. Despite the new team assisted by the support of the publisher 505 Games, since then the title on PC has basically only received ~under track~ updates and fixes, mainly dedicated to servers, network problems and the database. Indeed, the main goal behind the rescue mission was the (re)launch of Hawken on Xbox One and PlayStation 4, the announcement of which came on June 26 this year. Although the news has aroused disappointment in the old players, the Reloaded Games community manager underlined that only thanks to the console versions will it be possible to keep the PC version alive, whose updates should be developed in parallel after an initial period of adjustment on the new platforms . Waiting to find out the results of this evolution, we have whipped up the definitive version for the Microsoft flagship. The Hawken mech-based free to play resurrects on consoles after years of troubled development Free and honest Once the approximately five GB of the package was downloaded and the game started, we discovered the first, interesting difference with the PC iteration; beyond the variation in the logos of the companies involved, the new trailer with actors in the flesh and CG is striking, which replaces the old footage well known to Steam players. Nothing particularly exceptional, even in the light of some technical defects, however it is a work that underlines the productive efforts made by the new team to restore prestige to a (promising) brand that has fallen into disgrace. Unfortunately, the initial enthusiasm is followed by a certain amount of disappointment due to the graphical interface, probably one of the worst seen in this and in the last generation. Not only is there a confusing distribution of voices and poor quality rendering of the menu, but there are also some unwanted ~tweaks~. Just think of the mech selection screen, where there is a chaotic and not very usable grid. Fortunately, it is possible to replace it with a menu similar to the PC one, although some differences remain, such as a less intuitive organization of the mechs into weight classes (light, medium and heavy). If on the one hand you feel a little bewildered, on the other you can only appreciate the practically doubled number of vehicles, with as many as thirty-six mechs from which to draw, many of which belong to the so-called Generation 2 (G2) just mentioned on PC . There is also no shortage of interesting new features, such as the fast Charger equipped with extremely powerful Mini Flak Cannons. Speaking of weapons, curiously, on Xbox One they are not interchangeable but fixed, as well as some upgrades called Items and Internals, which range from shields to special weapons such as mines and rockets. However, the latter can be enhanced by spending both the in-game currency, the so-called HC in blue, and with real money, converted into MC (red) credits that can be purchased from the Microsoft store at prices that are not exactly very popular. All the mechs and upgrades can be purchased with credits earned in the game, while the aesthetic and cosmetic elements, such as the legs, cockpit and arms of the mechs, through holograms, special paints and the repair probe, can only be purchased with MCs. The title is by no means a ~pay-to-win~ and is perfectly enjoyable even without spending money, although especially at the beginning it is not uncommon to deal with better equipped players because they pay. In Hawken, however, it is above all skill that makes the difference. Xbox One goals Hawken offers the usual 1,000 points to unlock in 12 objectives. The most valuable ones, worth 200 points each, are linked to the elimination of enemy mechs under certain conditions (100 while repairing and 10 without dying); a similar argument can also be made for the 50 and 100 point objectives, however the completion of the training, the survival with little armor and the damage inflicted on the opponents are also involved. Melting steel From the point of view of the Hawken modalities it has remained practically unchanged compared to thethe PC counterpart, although presenting a slightly different organization of the various options. Once the server region has been selected, it is possible to launch into the classic Deathmatches (all against all, in teams and co-op teams), in the Co-op destruction mode where you destroy waves of probes and AI-controlled mechs and in the original Siege and Missile Assault. Siege is a rather particular objective mode, in which in addition to defending a precious battery of AA missiles placed in the center of the map, players must collect UE energy cells (from distributors or from destroyed enemy mechs) and bring them to their base; this energy is used to power huge spaceships that cyclically attack the opposing base. It is a tactical mode in which teamwork is essential, as well as in Missile Assault, a sort of ~King of the hill~ with three objectives to defend on the map, which are also useful for hitting the enemy base. The maximum number of players is twelve and even the normal deathmatches, especially the team ones, are very fun and full of challenge. While you control mighty mechs, each with specific flight, dash, armor, and weapon overheating properties, the overall feel is more that of a regular FPS, due to the agility of the metal beasts. The commands have been translated very well on the joypad, and after a little practice it is possible to perfectly control each vehicle: with the triggers you manage the right and left weapon; RB and LB are related to jumping and sprinting respectively; B is necessary for self-repair, while the face buttons and the d-pad are dedicated to special weapons/functions and the inevitable ~social~ moves, such as bows and hologram projections. As specified, the skill matters more than the equipment, so even the basic mech CR-T Recruit can give a hard time to the best equipped giants, although for some weapons it is necessary to work on the balance. To train, it is possible to embark on VR Training and challenges against bots, and you can also freely explore the dozens of maps available, all inspired from the point of view of design and setting; they range from classic cities translated from a dystopian future (Prosk, Origin and Uptown) to installations immersed in alien nature, such as Last Eco, Bazaar and Wreckage. From a technical point of view, as could be expected, there is a significant step backwards compared to the PC version, which is also no longer very fresh. The textures, for example, are rather scarce and sometimes load late, moreover there are some drops in fluidity, magnified by the very strong tearing effect, really annoying when you turn quickly. The effects and the number of details are clearly lower than the PC counterpart, however, despite the limitations, Hawken overall is pleasant to see, always bearing in mind that we are dealing with an honest free to play, which requires only Live Gold to be played. The audio sector is good, especially for the well-sampled sound effects, while the netcode is solid and without obvious latency problems.", "date": "2016-07-13", "grade": "8.0"}
