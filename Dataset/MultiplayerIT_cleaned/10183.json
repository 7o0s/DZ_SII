In recent years, the US company has churned out a series of fantastic products suitable for all types of users, entering last year the already large group of developers involved in tower defense: Plants vs Zombies was already a small phenomenon on PC and Mac celebrated by us in another review, which now also arrives on the iPhone with a respectable conversion. Green thumb For those not aware of the title, the premise is easy to say: a common terraced house must be defended from the onslaught of fearsome zombies, planting a large quantity of different vegetables (but not only) according to the needs and managing the solar energy present as the only resource within the game. The formula is successful first of all because it is able to explain through the first levels all the notions used during the entire adventure, then rearranging them with small changes that keep the structure fresh and with some special levels that offer some variations on the theme, such as a garden version of the classic bowling alley. To play, Plants vs Zombies is as easy now as it was then, with all the action field present within a single screen and the intelligent control system in asking you to select the element to plant on the ground and then place it only when released of the finger from the screen, so as to correct any inaccuracies while running. Once the challenges and puzzles that can be unlocked by progressing in the adventure have disappeared, the only main mode remains that still manages to entertain for a long time, mixing the presence of over forty user-selectable objects and about thirty different opponents with environmental modifications which, in their madness, are always consistent with the premises. Those who have already completed the title in its previous incarnations will therefore not find anything new, even if the price of 2.39 euros and the immediate fun offered by the game mechanics make the second step anything but unpleasant. Visually, the explosion of different colors and the light-hearted style, combined with a barely hinted comedy during the short interludes between one scheme and the next, revisit the classic concept of zombies in an original way, once again hungry for the brains contained in the house but here beaten, torn to shreds and humiliated by mole-bombs, exploding cherries and carnivorous plants, so much so that they had to invent pole vaulters and imitators of Michael Jackson. It is impossible to find big defects and, apart from a good but not stratospheric sound, the writer is left with only a bitter taste, this time too, due to the absence of a multiplayer that with the bases developed by PopCap would be all other than impossible to implement.
