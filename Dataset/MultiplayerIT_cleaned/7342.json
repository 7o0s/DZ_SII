On the other hand, as has been the case for some time in the world of cinema, it is safer from a commercial point of view to aim at exploiting an already known brand, which boasts a solid user base, and to re-propose it in a version adapted to current technical standards, rather than design some new intellectual property from scratch. Even if to tell the truth such operations have not always brought positive results, to the cinema as in the world of videogame entertainment. One of the exceptions in this sense is the Tomb Raider signed by Crystal Dynamics, a software house that last year succeeded in the difficult task of bringing back to life a historic franchise, but now worn out by the passing of the years and by the intensive exploitation of certain mechanics and the its protagonist. Lara Croft was no longer the global phenomenon of the 90s, and the series was now too stuck in itself. Precisely for this reason, the developer has staked everything on the characterization of the new Lara, very different from the stereotypical character of the past, all breasts and spectacular jumps, making her more real. A young and inexperienced archaeologist who is shipwrecked on a mysterious and inhospitable island where she must gradually learn to survive on her own skin. A courageous but successful choice, which ended up rewarding the San Francisco Bay-based software house, allowing it to gather critical acclaim, immediately, and from the public, slowly. A title of this stature could not therefore leave the top management of the publisher, Square Enix, insensitive, who thus decided to create a revised and corrected port of the game specifically for the newborn next gen consoles. The Tomb Raider reboot returns better than ever to next gen consoles thanks to the Definitive Edition A more defined Lara The Definitive Edition of Tomb Raider does not intend to distort the playful system of the original title, as we will see later, or even to modify it significantly. If anything, try to improve it. The gamer then finds the exact same adventure of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, enriched however by a series of refinements that are not limited only to a mere change of resolution. And what has just been described is evident right from the start of the game. Once you arrive on the island you are inevitably struck by the scenery. Compared to the original edition we have greater depth in the image, especially looking at the horizon, thanks to the native resolution of 1080p which heavily affects the definition and detail, and a series of excellent particle and dynamic light effects that embellish the environments, and return a plausible world. The wind that plays a confused melody among the trees, accompanied by the screech of flocks of birds fluttering in the sky, and by the leaves that detach from the branches and flutter in the air mixing with the pollen of the flowers, drawing irregular trajectories before settling down at Lara's feet. Everything contributes to making the scenarios come alive, and is managed by the game engine with a certain fluidity, guaranteed by an almost constant 60 frames per second on PlayStation 4. ~Almost~ because every now and then, by sensation, in the more chaotic phases it seemed to us to notice a slight dip, but it's a few frames and you really have to be picky to notice them. In short, the end result of this sort of restyling is a ~cinematographic~ world that comes to life. Let me be clear, we are not dealing with something shocking or never seen before, nor therefore a product that squeezes the Sony console hardware to the max, but certainly the title does not give the feeling of playing an ~old~ product of a generation. The character of Lara Croft deserves a separate note, who is inevitably the one who has received the most attention from the graphics. If the polygonal model of the beautiful archaeologist appears even more refined and pleasant, well proportioned and embellished by the presence of effects such as perspiration on the skin, mud that sticks to her or dirty her face, as well as by the natural movement of the hair thanks to the TressFX, the speech is different for the conformation of the face. Not that this is bad, mind you. Here too the presence of a greater number of polygons, more refined textures and a higher resolution contribute to making the girl's face very realistic. It just looks different than what fans saw and liked in the original. The starting point is always that of the model Megan Farquhar, but some of the girl's features are stayou changed, and this then affected its expressiveness. For example the slightly darker eyes, their more rounded line and some other reinterpretation of the face, in fact have changed the look and in general the expression, making it sometimes a little tougher and more mature than always the version PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. And this perhaps clashes with the character of the frightened young woman who learns to survive told by the plot of this reboot of the series, and that many had come to know and love. This sort of evolution could probably be exploited for the sequel, given that there we will have a more adult Croft and tempered by the experiences lived on the island of Yamatai in the Dragon Triangle. TressFX extension TressFX is a technology developed by AMD through which it is possible to recreate a natural and convincing hair movement. A very interesting process that works by drawing and managing tens of thousands of tiny elements, complete with complex shadows and anti-aliasing, detecting their collisions so that they don't overlap or interpenetrate each other or with other elements. All by quickly making calculations that must be updated many times every second to synchronize everything with the movements of the character. The result is visually a show that in the future, with the upcoming TressFX 2.0, will also involve grass, fur and other elements of a game. Playstation 4 trophies There are 51 Trophies available in Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition: 41 bronze, 7 silver, two gold and one platinum. To get the simplest you have to perform fairly easy tasks, such as killing ten small animals and skinning them, completing a challenge or recovering at least 25% of the game's relics. While for the more difficult ones you need to modify and upgrade all weapons, win a ranked match in each multiplayer mode or complete all the optional tombs, until you get the coveted Platinum, upon completing all the other challenges. The art of survival Once the normal initial phase of amazement, generated by the new technical system of the product, has been overcome, the player begins to notice all the other innovations present in this Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition. Starting with the voice commands that can be given by activating them using the PlayStation Camera. In this way it is possible, for example, to call up the map on video to be able to consult it, or to intervene on the weapons, to check those supplied or to decide to change the one in use with one's voice. During the most spectacular sequences, such as when Croft risks falling from a hill or being dragged away by the current of a river, the motion sensors can be used to intervene on the right direction for the girl to take, and make her avoid an obstacle . Then there are some new functions related to the DualShock 4 which in some ways do not add anything relevant to the gameplay or the way to play, but they certainly contribute in a fun way to immerse the gamer in the world of adventure. For example, when Lara performs decisive actions on the screen, such as lighting a torch, starting a fire or shooting, the joypad light flickers orange-red as if to simulate flames, or flashes white with each weapon shot. Through the speaker positioned on the front of the DualShock 4 you can hear some of the ambient noise generated by exploring certain areas of the island: footsteps echoing in a cave, crawling through tall grass, the crunch of a breaking branch or of the bones of a skeleton accidentally crushed. The small controller screen can instead be used through tactile commands to look closely and rotate the recovered artifacts, or for other secondary functions, such as starting a fire. The Definitive Edition of Tomb Raider also includes all DLC released up to now for the game. However, these are mostly additional side contents: for multiplayer there are, for example, new maps or some characters to be deployed in the Solarii or Survivors factions, plus the weapons of Agent 47 from Hitman: Absolution, while for the single player mode there it's clothes, weapons and extra items for Lara, plus an unpublished secret tomb to explore. Few things. On balance, the new features and DLCs add nothing particularly striking to what was already a decidedly well-packaged product, starting with a plot that develops around the mystery of the Yamatai empire, the myth of Queen Himiko and the atmosphere mystery of the island where the events take place. While the gameplay revolves around the character of Lara, her characteraction and her transformation into a stronger woman, told in a linear but effective way, and made to experience the player firsthand. An intense, dramatic and exciting gaming experience, with a young girl hunted down, forced to suffer physical and psychological trauma, to fight for her survival and to kill. All elements that end up adding a new emotional dimension to one of the greatest heroines in the world of video games, and creating a sort of empathy with the character. The transformation of the protagonist has parallel effects on the game setting, which in fact loses much of the puzzle / exploratory component of the previous chapters, gaining it in terms of narrative structure, on the fashion launched by the Uncharted series by Naughty Dog. In this Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition, Lara Croft doesn't perform amazing acrobatic leaps, shoot like a gunslinger, or know martial arts. Simply try to stay alive, explore, hunt, gain experience to unlock new combat moves, get weapons (bow, pistol, assault rifle and shotgun) and useful items to upgrade them. Everything happens in a progressive way, alternating combat sequences, free exploration and dynamic climbing thanks to the excellent level design that effectively intersperses indoor and outdoor settings, and seems to want to lead the player by the hand so as not to let him lose even a moment of the constant flow of events, which in crescendo permeates an adventure with a cinematic air. In fact, the island is configured as a well-defined microcosm, among ship cemeteries, forests and abandoned military bases, connected to each other by connecting ~corridors~, to be crossed according to a linear progression. For the rest, the product also offers a multiplayer mode that consists of four modes, but nothing really interesting: the online experience offered by Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition can therefore be configured as a small alternative addition to the main game. Final note for the sound sector, identical to the counterpart for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The samples and background noises are beautiful, the dubbing in Italian is discreet, which loses points if compared with the original English version due to the lack of expressiveness and the little characterization of some characters.", "date": "2014-01-28", "grade": "8.8"}
