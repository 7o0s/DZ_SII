In fact, we are not talking about any title but about a production that ten years ago marked an important turning point for David Cage and his software house. Omikron: The Nomad Soul, the first title of Quantic Dream, was already permeated with cinematic contaminations but it was far from the formula of the interactive film that has characterized Cage's productions since Fahrenheit. And it's good to spend a few words on a genre that escapes the classic yardsticks. This is because in interactive films the interaction merges with a predominant narrative component that cannot afford the ingenuity typical of the average videogame. In an interactive film there is no well-defined gameplay to underpin it all. It is the narrative component that holds up the experience and this means that it must have a high quality. But that's not enough. In order to be able to speak of a video game, the story must coexist with interactive mechanics, dynamics capable of involving the player or in any case of deluding him that he has some influence on what happens. Cage's ability lies precisely in making this happen and Fahrenheit is the first clear demonstration of this. A simple but engaging interaction fits into a mature and credible narration, whose cinematic cut is striking regardless of the quality of the texts, the polygon count or the expressiveness of the models. It is the narrative cut and the possibilities of choice that give the illusion of dynamism in a title whose playful part thrives on quick time events and only apparently free choices. And here, assuming that the narrative quality is excellent, personal tastes and subjective sensitivity to the suspension of disbelief come into play. It therefore becomes difficult to actually evaluate how much what Fahrenheit tells us is worth. But we can certainly estimate the narrative component of the title starting from the atmosphere and the solidity of the narrative. The vein is typical of Cage that reaches us on our armchair starting from an apparent normality. Suddenly that normality breaks down and everything changes forever, dragging us into a whirlwind of mysteries, nightmares and delusions. Fahrenheit: Indigo Propecy returns in high definition to take us back to the origins of Quantic Dream The magic of cinema The gameplay of Fahrenheit is the simplest imaginable but in the title Quantic Dream there is no way to get bored. The secret is all in the rhythm, dictated by a cinematic cut that is used to keep tension high and enhance the illusion that the context in which the player is placed is dynamic. The departure is one of those burning with a heinous murder made even more disturbing by its supernatural nature. The assassin, in fact, is the protagonist himself who acts possessed by a mysterious cultist. Having accomplished the macabre gesture, our anti-hero suddenly regains control but finds himself confused, wounded and smeared with blood. The only sure thing is that soon someone will notice the body and the only possible choice is escape. But before leaving the tents there is the possibility of gaining a few seconds by hiding the traces of the crime and it is here that we enter the scene with actions that have a relative weight on the overall narrative, which in any case includes multiple endings, but produce visible and concrete in the short term. A mop, a bloodstain, a toilet bowl. All elements of a small puzzle that we must solve quickly. To hurry us is the cinematic cut of the title which with a double shot shows an approaching policeman. Suddenly we find ourselves having to face a short quick time event that further fuels the tension and reveals another game mechanic that gives further importance to our actions. The characters also have to deal with their own psyche which is put to the test by events, failures and wrong choices. One mistake and a handful of morale points go away. A success and here the specter of madness moves away and it is good that it is, since reaching zero means having to face a bleak Game Over. But let's go back to our crime scene and the protagonist's desperate escape. The pace is through the roof but suddenly everything changes. In the following scene the director dictates more reflective rhythms. In this case, two policemen are in the spotlight, each to be checked individually to take advantage of their skills, who investigate the case and allow us to retrace what we have experienced without haste. Another purely cinematic gimmick by uA title that uses two different rhythms to involve us, two breaths, one of which takes us into the nightmare while the other keeps us attached to reality. And the recipe works as well as other similar gimmicks that make Fahrenheit unique and anticipate mechanics proposed in Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls. The weight of the years The central part often relies on quick time events but even in this case you find originals and a cinematic cut that make the action sessions engaging and not at all frustrating. However, the narrative dimension loses a pinch of intensity compared to the incredible initial stages and culminates in an ending that many have found too far from the initial expectations and therefore disappointing. Despite this, the experience shaped by Quantic Dream almost always remains intense and enjoyable thanks to a dark and disturbing atmosphere that permeates the entire production. An element that has allowed Fahrenheit to age quite well despite some rather evident technical flaws. The biggest problem concerns the movement of the character which is dated to say the least and could displace those who are not familiar with video games from a few years ago. But fortunately for us we are not talking about an action title and this means that a problem of this kind has a relative impact on the gaming experience. Furthermore, the gesture system is still valid which, despite having been designed for the Dualshock sticks, adapts well to the mouse and in the mobile version of this reissue it adapts perfectly to touch controls. The mechanics, on the other hand, are the simplest imaginable. To perform some actions we are asked to mimic the movement which is indicated by an animated icon that appears on the screen. In some cases it is sufficient to move the mouse in the suggested direction while in others it is necessary to measure the amplitude of the movement to complete the action successfully. The difficulty, this is clear, borders on nothing but we don't even find ourselves having to simply press a button to be able to move on to the next shot. Miming the gesture involves involvement, the fast pace makes it more important than the narration and here is the magic of Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy comes to life. And when the deception threatens to reveal itself, an excited quick time event acts as a break, a moment of pure action that often accompanies or marries a pop rock bran that breaks the splendid but decidedly dark soundtrack signed by the famous Badalamenti. The change of pace, as well as the change of shots and context, is a key element of a complex narrative that gives a mature breath to the entire production. A production that makes use of a good dubbing in English, secrets in quantity and does not skimp on bloody and spicy scenes which, fortunately for us, have not undergone any censorship. The only compromises necessary to be able to enjoy Fahrenheit, in essence, are related to the lack of adaptation in Italian and the certainly not modern graphic design. On the other hand, the only novelty of this Remastered edition is the high resolution and it is legitimate to wonder if 8.99 euros are not too much for such a small job. In any case, the higher definition gives us a clean image and highlights still acceptable interiors while the cinematic cut compensates for the poverty in terms of polygons. Furthermore, the title sports a system of facial expressions that was anything but trivial for the time. But Fahrenheit is far from the realism of modern games and some panoramic shots require a large dose of imagination to be appreciated. The merits, however, are many and we can confidently state that it is still an enjoyable experience and a lesson in how well-chosen shots and a fast pace can give a completely different meaning to all in all simple dialogues and game mechanics that border on banal.", "date": "2015-02-19", "grade": "7.5"}
