Contrary to what was estimated, the new single campaign, although it remains firmly planted in the red (under) Martian soil, does not bring us back in the Kevlar shoes of the marine of the original title. Not that this is a detail of any importance beyond the initial sequence, but in any case, playing a leader who has already conquered Hell would not have been adequate. After all, we are supposed to be small soldiers terrified of the dark and the expansion starts once again from this assumption in presenting us with even more gloomy environments immersed in darkness. The prerequisite for a return to the red planet by the UAC after is the discovery of new archaeological sites of an unknown civilization. The discovery of a bizarre demonic artifact (a sort of beating petroleum-colored heart) will have two main repercussions. The first - predictable - to awaken infernal forces determined to get their hands on the arcane object, causing the natural massacre of our research expedition. The devil makes pots... The second, to equip the player with a new weapon, the artifact precisely, capable of absorbing the souls of the dead and consuming them by slowing down time for a few seconds, triggering a sort of slow-motion, extremely effective during fights . The plaster rigidity of the gameplay is manifested in these cases in an almost exemplary way: on the one hand the lackluster AI of the enemies makes them easy prey in one-on-one battles, making the use of the artifact completely superfluous in a good 80% of situations. Conversely, the remaining 20% envisages furious melees in which slowing down time becomes absolutely mandatory in order to emerge alive or at least intact, to the point that  coincidentally  you will almost always find the recharge for the artifact a few meters before the appearance of a horde of ravenous devils. The fact of having to use it practically only in the circumstances foreseen by the programmers communicates the unhappy feeling of literally hanging like puppets from the hands of the level designer, canceling the already bland illusion of freedom of action. Yes, because even with the good that can be said of the new singleplayer maps - and some are really excellent, also in the light of the general qualitative increase, which provides for greater variety, wider spaces and more external environments - every time we approach to collect cures or ammunition, the punishment factor persists, with a monster charging from a dark corner, diving invisibly from the ceiling or attacking us from behind from a point where we know there was nothing a moment ago. In addition to the artifact, our equipment has been enriched by two other elements: the welcome return of the classic double shotgun and the so-called ~constrictor~, which is none other than a - sic - gravitational pistol. If its operation is substantially similar to that seen in Half-Life 2, its use has some differences aimed at limiting its use. The devil makes pots... With the left button you attract objects and releasing it, they are thrown away. The weapon has a time limit of a few seconds after which it will no longer be able to ~hold on~, so we will not be able to circulate half a level with an explosive barrel in search of enemies to blow up. In fact, however, the slowness of reaction and the fact that three quarters of the view are obstructed by the raised object and by an invasive graphic effect of distortion, limit its use even more than the extreme lack of objects to lift and hurl, which only fall under the explosive crates and barrels categories. As a result you will once again find yourself using the constrictor in the circumstances foreseen by the game, attracting otherwise unreachable packs of ammo or catching and repelling fireballs as in the case of the first boss of the game. Speaking of enemies, excluding the new ~end-of-level monsters~, the novelties consist of a new version of the fiend, equipped with two heads and armed with plasma rays instead of fireballs, and a reissue of the flying skulls. The multiplayer section has had some substantial improvements, starting from the ~native~ support for up to 8 players without any slowdowns. The different maps turned out to be a pleasant surprise, as well as the new Capture the Flag. The balancing problem of the missile launcher remains unsolved, which tends to transform each session into a race to grab it and an inevitable carnage of the less rapid ones, but essentially the good old Doom multiplayer remains the same, keeping its frenetic spirit intact and adrenaline. And that's what fans demand from him. Comment Hard to say if Resurrectionof Evil has turned out to be an expansion oriented more towards singleplayer than multiplayer. We can at least say that of the two, the second is undoubtedly the more successful, not only for the goodness of the new maps or new weapons, but above all for the indisputable gameplay flaws that the new single-player campaign persists in perpetrating. Perhaps the least exciting thing about this expansion was probably the transition from a position semi-perched on antiquated but still legitimate playability postulates, to a lackluster attempt to follow the shooter trends of the moment (the anti-gravity gun, Slow Motion). The impression is that Id Software is increasingly abandoning its role as an innovator in the world of FPS, to become a market follower. If Doom 3 entertained you, Resurrection of Evil will continue to do so, without too many pretensions and without - despite itself - changing the cards on the table a lot. But if your first experience with the latest id shooter was enough for you, you won't find anything in Resurrection of Evil that is worth the hefty cash outlay. Pros: Single-player campaign of decent duration New maps of good quality Improved and enriched multiplayer Cons: New scarce and banal weapons Only two new monsters The artificial intelligence is the same, the game design too Evil has risen again Even before its announcement, we were as sure of an expansion for Doom 3 as we are reasonably sure that winter will be replaced by spring. These traditions die hard, especially in the case of a title that after having placed a few million copies, has no problem presenting itself with an additional expansion at practically full price. The question in these cases is ~whether the package is worth the candle~, or whether the game in question has enough to say to justify the disbursement of an amount equal to 2/3 of its cost of exit.
