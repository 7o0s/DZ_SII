{"name": "Yomawari: Lost in the Dark", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yomawari-lost-in-the-dark-recensione.html", "text": "The most disturbing and gloomy period of the year is approaching and, for the occasion, in 2022 we are also witnessing the return of a niche series, but discreetly appreciated by fans: that of Yomawari. It may also be that you have never heard of it, but a few images will be enough to remove your doubts, since the artistic direction of the product in question - developed by Nippon Ichi and published by NIS America - is truly unmistakable. Some time ago we offered you the review of Yomawari: The Long Night Collection, a package of two titles that at the time (it was 2018) finally landed on Nintendo Switch, again to ~celebrate~ Halloween. These days we have instead returned to the same narrative universe of the previous episodes, but with a new chapter unrelated to the latter, therefore perfect for old fans, but also and above all for newcomers, who will find in Yomawari: Lost in the Dark a fresh experience and also enriched by some new mechanics. What follows, then, is the review of Yomawari: Lost in the Dark. We ventured into the dark on PlayStation 5, in backwards compatibility mode as the title is available on PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch and PC via Steam. Synopsis: Who's Afraid of the Curse? Of anguish, in Yomawari: Lost in the Dark, you will experience a large amount The plot of Yomawari: Lost in the Dark is both cryptic and disturbing. An unnamed protagonist awakens in a haunted forest, where an invisible threat lurks in every corner. It is here that he meets a girl who claims to know her, but without being able to reveal more at the moment. What she is told is the following: the protagonist has been struck by a mysterious curse, and will only have until dawn to be able to break it; vice versa, it will remain trapped forever in the shadows. From this moment on, the player wakes up in an unnamed Japanese town, perfectly identical to the one present in the previous episodes of the series, and will have to figure out what to do, how to move, how to break the curse before it's too late. The first known goal is to reach your home, because you woke up in the school a few blocks away. From here on it will be necessary to go to specific macro-areas of the inhabited center, explore them from top to bottom, and recover fundamental objects for the progression in the plot. The entire adventure, in fact, consists in the recovery of key objects linked to the memories of the protagonist: the latter will trigger flashbacks, so that at a certain point the whole event will be clear in its fundamental lines. But the main value of the story of Yomawari: Lost in the Dark - and this especially for newcomers - consists precisely in its being elusive, mysterious and distressing. All in all, however, Nippon Ichi's proposal is really similar to what we have seen in the past in the other chapters of the series; indeed it seemed to us that even some areas of the town were simply ~recycled~ by Night Alone and Midnight Shadows. Veterans, therefore, will always have a sense of vague familiarity, not only with the atmospheres, but with the same places where the adventure takes place. Gameplay: move between monsters and shadows Beware of sounds and noises: in Yomawari: Lost in the Dark they indicate the presence of enemies The gameplay of Yomawari: Lost in the Dark responds perfectly to the need to render the constant anguish and sense of danger that hover over the entire world represented. In the past these mechanics, especially on Nintendo Switch, were linked to the Joy-Con vibration system: this time an attempt was made to take a step forward from the point of view of immersion; in our opinion the developers have succeeded, but without anything really sensational to report. To begin with, the new mechanics introduced in Lost in the Dark is linked to the torch: a simple pressure on the central part of the pad allows you to turn on and turn off the device. The lit torch obviously attracts the attention of very dangerous demons and monsters, which almost always lead immediately to game over; on the other hand, without the torch it is not really possible to interact with the objects of interest scattered on the ground, from the coins useful for saving progress in the sanctuaries to the key objects to continue the narrative. It is up to the player to understand when and how to activate the tool without incurring excessive risks. Very often in Yomawari: Lost in the Dark we will have to solve small environmental puzzles, but nothing really complex Much more interesting is the ~auditory feedback~ linked instead to the sound coming from the controller (uned to vibrations). It can be used in various ways: a ringing bell indicates the points of interest to reach on the screen (the closer the character is, the more intense the sound becomes); the accelerated heartbeat allows you to understand when an invisible enemy is getting too close to the protagonist, thus signaling situations of imminent danger. We appreciated the implementation of sounds coming directly from the controller, which combined with the vibration system make the experience of Yomawari: Lost in the Dark more immersive than ever. After all, it should also be noted that these are minimal innovations, compared to an evident recycling - of situations, characters, places and even monsters - of elements from all the other chapters of the Yomawari series. All right, the charm of the setting combined with an artistic direction that is still valid to all intents and purposes has remained unchanged, but sooner or later the time will come to completely change places and demons, otherwise there is a serious risk of re-producing years later always the same game with insignificant variations.", "date": "2022-10-21", "grade": "7.0"}
