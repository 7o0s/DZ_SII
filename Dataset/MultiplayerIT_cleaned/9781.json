{"name": "Impresa Eroica", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/81019-guitar-hero-warriors-of-rock-impresa-eroica.html", "text": "Version tested: Xbox 360After the years of an ascent that seemed unstoppable, the music games market found itself in a state of stalemate that few had anticipated, despite the fact that millions of people continue to have fun with guitars, microphones and drums. After the departure of Harmonix, went to the court of MTV to carry on Rock Band, and after having entrusted the development of Guitar Hero to Neversoft, the Activision project has led to a proliferation of episodes dedicated to individual bands, such as Metallica and Van Halen , and to chapters more oriented towards pop music such as Band Hero, in the run-up, a bit of everyone, to achieve the status of a real alternative to Karaoke capable of being successfully installed in any home on the planet. In this research, however, the saga had somewhat lost its identity, going to disorient those players who had approached to become the emulators of the most famous rock stars, between fiery solos and furious melodic rides. With Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, Neversoft steers towards the origins with a track list among the best in the series and some game ideas that work really well. A handful of heroes The Demigod of Rock has been defeated by the machines. The legendary guitar that was wielded without fear of defeat ended up segregated in the depths of a cave that only a few daredevil musicians will be able to find and play properly. These heroes are the characters that made the history of Guitar Hero and that, however, no one used anymore, given that almost all the players rushed into the editor to create a random avatar to impersonate, if only to unlock the relative, inevitable trophy/ objective along the lines of ~Create your own Rockstar!~. In Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, things get different and more interesting. Each chapter of the Heroic Enterprise, this is the new name of the story mode, has these characters as protagonists, each with its own musical genre of reference, which also makes sense of the heterogeneity of the repertoire, which goes from Glam Rock to Doom , passing through CrossOver and Rock 'n Roll, removing the impression, which had been had in recent years, of a series of vaguely Rock and somewhat incoherent compilations. From the legendary Lars, the Viking, up to Johnny, the punk with the green crest, each of the eight is presented with an intro that tells of the power hidden in its bowels and which can be released by overcoming the different songs at any level of difficulty in the lineup and unlocking the required number of stars. Once done, our hero transforms into a semi-divinity of rock, with a rather disturbing appearance and with enormous power, ranging from the possibility of activating shields so as not to fail the songs, up to doubling the Star Power accumulated in the related sequences. Once the Demigod of Rock is rescued and the powers of all eight musicians have been unleashed, there remains the possibility of exceeding all the songs in the story mode with maximum stars, using a band with all eight powers combined to be able to ~Dominate the Heroic Deed~ and tackle a new concert with a collection of songs from the impossible ones, from Megadeth to Dragonforce. To Dominate the Company, the number of cumulative stars rises to 40 for each player and for each song, given the flood of bonuses that add up and as the screen becomes a carnival of star power, error-free sequences and ~ You are great~. The idea works and the story mode is as fun as a few years ago, the only pity is that limit to 40 stars, since one realizes, with a little practice, that with all the powers it becomes practically impossible fail a song and that all the stars accumulate well before the end of a song in an almost inevitable way, except for the few more demanding cases in which, however, it is enough to go down in difficulty level to get out of the way without too many worries. In short, if in the old episodes a song in ~Expert~ could not be completed, here it is still possible thanks to the powers, but simply not all 40 stars are obtained, moving the problem from the non-completion to the perfection of the performance, and giving the feeling that not much has changed, apart from all that sizzle of bonuses and the great satisfaction given by one of the best track lists ever (if not the best, to be honest). All this until you sink your teeth into the new quick match. Chess game! The reached maturity of Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock can be seen precisely in the new ~quick game~, which was previously a Cinderella to allow you to play any song in the lineup, even those that once unlocked by finishing the story mode at ~Esperto~ and which were therefore precluded to most. Now, however, each player has a level, given by the amount of stars collected and which are accumulated by playing every single song even in this mode, unlocking further bonuses and gadgets to use to adorn your But there's more, as every single song in the Guitar Hero library (you can import songs from any episode with the relevant code in the different packs) has been equipped with challenges for each instrument. The challenges range from playing the vibrato with the lever for as long as possible, from making sequences of notes without errors, to playing with or without the alternating picking of certain pieces, rather than others.The Quick Game list allows you to discover all the challenges present in each song and decide which one to focus on, trying to achieve the highest goal, since each challenge has three levels of completion. This takes Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock's longevity to the stars, also because it's possible to target a friend's achievement and ~trace~ it, starting the song with an indicator that will tell us when you've managed to beat him during the game. performance of the piece, or when we have managed to beat our previous performance with the possibility of spamming the result both on Twitter and on Facebook. Here, among other things, the musicians' super powers regain that strategic potential that is lost in the campaign, given that in what are called Heroic Challenges, only two can be activated at a time, instead of having all eight of them at the same time, unleashing the need to understand which combinations of powers lead to obtaining the highest number of stars for each single piece and according to one's weaknesses. If we add to this the many online modes, the party mode, with all the songs playing in rotation, leaving the possibility to start rocking at any time and the music editor, it is clear how Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock represents the most complete chapter and one of the funniest. The substance of the game always remains the same and it is not certain that it will be able to bring back to passion those who had decided to put a stone on it, but it is impossible not to notice Neversoft's effort to restore substance and new content to the whole system. Xbox 360 goals Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock is a generous game of objectives, above all because their achievement, except for a few cases, is not linked to the level of difficulty at which you decide to play the individual songs. Having friends to form a band with and having the possibility to play online, the achievement of almost all 1000 points is almost a given, relegating everything to a mere matter of time, since only the Enterprise Domain requires between 15 and the 20 hours of play. Animatrix Another point on which a few notes can be made is the motion capture with which the virtual executions of the songs of Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock were made which, between lip synchronizations and movements studied to the millimeter, allow you to attend real virtual concerts, practically perfect. The graphics engine, among other things, no longer suffers from those sporadic slowdowns due to too many on-screen effects that even affected the gameplay and the audio quality is now perfect, but this has been for some time now. The new guitar also lends itself to very long playing sessions thanks to the excellent grip and Neversoft wanted to leave behind the misunderstanding of the touchpad which, evidently, few used to play, returning to the simplicity and precision of the first guitar models. We are only sorry that the video sensor has not been implemented which, in the main competitor, allows you to calibrate the audio and video delay due to HD screens without having to determine the lag manually.", "date": "2010-09-27", "grade": "8.7"}
