There are very few who have managed to capture the essence of the mother series, transporting it into completely new and different forms of gameplay. We still remember Pokmon Pinball with pleasure, while Pokmon Mystery Dungeon has never made us crazy, for example. In regards to Pokmon Rumble, one of the most recent spin-offs, the sentiment has never been very positive. The series, born as a game for Wii Ware, has always been a low-demand entertainment designed especially for the youngest fans of Pikachu and his companions. A pastime, however, sold at full price, which dreamed of the quality and depth of even the other spin-offs. Not much has changed with this Pokmon Rumble U, but at least Nintendo has reduced the claims of the game, offering it at a low price through the eShop. To be the first time that pokmon run on Wii U, in short, it's not exactly a triumphal entrance... Gonna kill'em all (with fire) Behind Pokmon Rumble U there is a really nice idea. These are not the usual pokmon we know, but ~gashapon~, small puppets enclosed in plastic spheres, often sold through special vending machines. In Japan they have always been very strong, and we bet you have also seen someone outside the tobacconists or supermarkets of your city. The short introductory movie of the game outlines a very simple but captivating story, which reminds us - and it should not be a coincidence - of the Disney and Pixar Toy Story series: four balls accidentally fall from a box and are dragged by a river to an unknown place . Inside them are Pikachu, Oshawott, Snivy and Tepig; the player's goal is then to bring them back to the shop, facing - uh - various stages in which dozens and dozens of other figurines... no, oh well, it's even demeaning to make sense of the plot. Pokmon Rumble U was born as a simple arcade game in which you control one pokmon at a time within a team of four, while the other three are controlled by as many friends with their controller or a flawed artificial intelligence. We start with the four little monsters mentioned above: one key has a special move attached to it, another key has a special move attached to it, that's where the enemies are. Go and hit. The basic mechanics are disarmingly simple, also because Pokmon Rumble U has been stripped of almost all the RPG-like technicalities that characterized the two predecessors, especially the Nintendo 3DS version from two years ago. There are no more maps to explore, for example, but only small colored and sufficiently diversified arenas in which to face dozens of pokmon at the same time, often led by tougher bosses and mini-bosses who perhaps have special attacks that force the player to reflect on their own movements. From a technical point of view, Pokmon Rumble U presents itself surprisingly well, considering the low budget: the angular, essential and ~toy~ style with which the pokmon were represented delighted us, and we are sure that children will find the explosions irresistible colors and special effects on the screen. However, the gameplay essentially comes down to repeatedly pressing the two attack keys, or occasionally interacting with the Gamepad, and this could even bore them. Pokmon Rumble U is too simple and repetitive, but kids will really like to collect all the monsters Hudson knows where all those monsters come from Pokmon Rumble U exploits the functionality of the Gamepad in a rather interesting way: not only is it possible to play with the controller without looking at the TV screen at all, but sometimes it is possible to interact with the game by touching the display to eliminate some obstacles or collect certain objects. It is a discreet interaction, but which makes the gameplay a little more lively and enjoyable, especially for the little ones. The other Wii U feature that Pokmon Rumble U exploits in a much more interesting way is the NFC system: in theory, it would allow you to read the ~codes~ of the figurines marketed by Nintendo together with the game. The catch, however, is that at the time we are writing this review, there are still no clear plans regarding the distribution of these graceful figurines in Italy. Don't expect mechanics even remotely similar to those of Skylanders, however: Pokmon Rumble U is perfectly and fully usable without the figurines. It is possible to collect all 649 pokmon in the game (which in essence would be all those created up to Pokmon White 2 and Black 2) with the exception of the chromatic ones, available only in the form of a figurine. Thethe problem is that only the pokmon obtained through the figurines can be modified: all the others, including the same pokmon acquired in the game, only have a couple of special moves that the player cannot modify or replace in any way. If you want a Rattata with different moves than the one you just ~caught~, the only thing to do is repeat the stage where you can acquire it and cross your fingers. After all, the new pokmon are obtained like this: totally at random. By defeating hordes of enemy pokmon, there is a chance of getting that stage's pokmon; or you can complete the various challenges related to that arena, which perhaps require you to use certain special moves or pokmon of a certain element, and unlock rare pokmon that could not be obtained in any other way. Too bad that the objectives to be completed are only reported to us at the end of the game, forcing us to memorize them before starting the level over again, and that some are quite complicated and require you to perform very precise actions that are often thwarted by the poor artificial intelligence of our companions . In short, perhaps too much patience is needed.", "date": "2013-08-16", "grade": "6.0"}
