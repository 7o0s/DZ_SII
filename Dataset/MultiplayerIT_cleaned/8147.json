It mixes suggestions and ideas that have made the last decades of its history great with mechanics that can be used alone or in company, marked by party game rhythms and tempos. And a bit like Wii Sports at the time of the launch of the previous hardware, it expresses the philosophy of the newcomer console by promoting games in company within the same living room without renouncing, now, also a social 2.0 connotation through integration with Miiverse . Compared to Wii Sports, it is unlikely to act as an equally effective bridge to ferry Wii U into the homes of the non-gamer users who made Nintendo's fortune in the past five years; on the other hand it is a much better, more refined and richer product. But this is an obvious and predictable assessment, because at the time there were only 5 disciplines with the sole task of conveying the revolution that was kept inside the Wiimote. Here instead we are faced with a vast virtual playground which in the same way is intended as an introduction to the use of the GamePad, which however turns out to be a controller that is evidently less immediate and simple to make understood. Nintendo Land is a magnet for attracting an audience looking for some quick games, with the merit of being able to not trivialize the high-sounding names that have been entrusted to it. A good title, and the opposite would be strange considering that we are talking about a first party game. A winner? Let's find out... WiiU plaza Every self-respecting amusement park is not made up only of its attractions. We need to create an environment that connects them, maintaining a carefree atmosphere and proposing some interesting side interactions. Nintendo Land performs this task wonderfully, throwing us into a small square on whose circumference the portals that drag into the individual events open, leaving the remaining space for the Miis and the growing number of small and large extras that are unlocked in time. By playing, in fact, you earn coins that can be spent within the Coin Game, a sort of hyper-minimal pachinko (and with few repeating level patterns) that rewards with purely aesthetic bonuses, new songs to add to the jukebox that collects the musical themes attractions or curiosities such as a button to press to change the time of day and therefore the light that illuminates this colorful hub. Game after game, the square thus acquires statues dedicated to more or less well-known characters from the Nintendo universe, is filled with new activities and gradually becomes more and more full of details. Many of these extras offer simple interactions that allow you to familiarize yourself with the Game Pad's touch screen, which also serves as a control as the camera follows the movements recorded by the gyroscope of the large WiiU controller. Thanks to the integration with the MiiVerse then, it doesn't take much to see your square filled with the Miis of other players, who bring with them welcome messages or drawings through which to socialize, so as to eventually add them to your friends list. What we are projected into is therefore a small but successful meta level that succeeds in the difficult task of putting aside the cold, static geometry of the classic menu without getting lost in excessive and useless accessory functions. But since aesthetics doesn't always mean practicality, Nintendo Land also allows access to the various attractions through a more banal single screen, which can be called up at any time by touching the lower right corner of the GamePad. More than likely this will soon become the most used login method; a few moments, as soon as you want, and you are in fact ready to jump into a single game or a playlist of several games. The twelve attractions Aside from the good presentation, the heart of Nintendo Land are the twelve attractions divided into six single-player, three competitive and three cooperative. The latter, which can actually also be tackled individually and up to a maximum of five people thanks to a GamePad and four Wiimotes, are The Legend of Zelda: Battle Quest, Metroid Blast and Pikmin Adventure: important names to which the most articulated, equipped with different modes each including a campaign with ambitions from a real little Story Mode. The idea is to take up a playful theme from the reference series and develop it in a more immediate key. In The Legend of Zelda: Battle Quest, each level is a track filled with enemies that can be eliminatedthem with sword blows by the four wielding the Wiimotes, while the holder of the GamePad takes out the opponents with arrows and bow in a backward position of support. Similar is what happens in the futuristic universe of Metroid Blast, where Samus' followers shoot at the ground while the lucky one equipped with a GamePad flies over their heads aboard a small spaceship, destroying waves of progressively more aggressive enemies. Finally, Pikmin Adventure sees a player take on the role of Olimar busy as always to collect and then throw the Pikmin, while the remaining users control an extra large version of the funny little creatures, capable of moving independently but also of being themselves throw at more fearsome enemies to perform devastating moves. In all three cases, these are pleasant and sufficiently robust experiences not to run out of interest after a few minutes, while maintaining the immediacy necessary for a party game. The three competitive events are instead as many variations of the same chase and escape mechanics. Luigi's Ghost Mansion takes us inside the haunted house already visited in the past - and in the future, on 3DS - with a ghost busy fleeing the torches of the four Miis who are asked to coordinate the effort to find the spirit presence without being caught surprise behind. It seems like a small thing, explained this way, but the strategies that can be implemented are different and hours can be spent perfecting both the use of the ghost and the coordination of the spirit catchers on duty. In the footsteps of Mario is a more traditional variation of hide and seek where one escapes relying on the accurate mini-map displayed by the Game Pad, and the others seek by observing the difficult third person perspective shown on the television. Finally, in Animal Crossing: Sweet Day, those who run away must collect a certain number of fruits to win the game, whoever chases uses the two analogs of the Game Pad to control as many characters in order to block them and make them drop what they have collected. In competitive attractions, the need to have as strong a group of friends as possible is felt more than in any other; in fact, despite the support of CPU-controlled bot species to take the place of human companions, it is immediately evident how these minigames really need at least 3 users to start expressing their potential, finding in the (unfortunately infrequent) groups of 4 or 5 people then their maximum expression. Finally, the six solitary attractions are generally shorter in duration but more complex than those previously described. We go from the stimulating puzzles of Donkey Kong Crash Course with its courses to be completed by precisely tilting the pad, to the weak Yoshi's Fruit Kart with levels full of obstacles to avoid by drawing the right trajectory. Up to tests of skill and reflexes such as Takamaru's Ninja Castle with its ninja stars to be thrown at enemies by swiping your fingers on the GamePad, or Captain Falcon's Twister Race where you can survive rapid races through designed tracks without sparing hairpin bends, platforms and very risky jumps , once again directing the ship thanks to the vertically held controller. Finally Baloon Trip Breeze and Octopus Dance, in addition to being the two less immediate and reserved quotations for an audience of Nintendo enthusiasts, respectively use the screen and the analogs of the Game Pad to ask us to control the gusts of wind that regulate movements subject to inertia of a poor Mii hanging from a balloon, and repeating choreographies a la ~Simon Says~ in time with the music. In player attractions, Nintendo Land is generally quite weak; the gameplay choices are either not particularly original, or not extraordinarily fun (or both), greatly reducing the appeal of already rather short experiences. When you play in company, however, things definitely improve, and the promises of asymmetrical gameplay made at the time of the announcement are kept: certainly the console and its controller still have several unexpressed possibilities, but here we begin to glimpse ideas that could come back useful and also be taken up by other developers looking for inspiration. How beautiful is the playground? As far as the technical component is concerned, Nintendo Land is a delightful game; even with a variety of graphic styles capable of distinguishing each individual attraction, the common thread never fails to guarantee the cohesion of the overall package and the validity of the work of the Japanese programmers. It goes without saying that we are certainly not dealing with a muscular product capable of squeezing the hardware,but despite this Nintendo Land is a game that is always pleasant to look at, full of personality, with a sugary taste and irresistible by large stretches. The sound accompaniment is extraordinary, especially for the songs that recall the most famous themes of the series from which the various attractions are inspired; instead we found Monita incredibly irritating, suffocating and omnipresent assistant who with a robotic voice devoid of any emotion explains rules and game methods with excessive frequency and meticulousness. That said, it is therefore necessary to justify the vote you find at the bottom of the page, and therefore the reasons why the overall value of the Nintendo title is reduced. The basic problems of Nintendo Land are actually two, and the first is purely practical: it is simply not an easy product to appreciate in its entirety, because to see its fully expressed potential you need GamePads (and here we are), four friends (no online multiplayer, order Nintendo) and above all as many Wiimotes (with relative Nunchucks for Metroid Blast, the only one that requires it). The attractions of the single player are pleasant, albeit with ups and downs it is clear, but certainly not sufficient to support Nintendo Land - which is a party game - in the long run, even considering the stimulus of the ~objectives~ system of the stamps; the juice, the heart, the substance must be sought in company, and in all situations the Nintendo production works well in proportion to the number of players involved. Alone it's a mediocre product, but even in two it doesn't improve that much, and in three you barely start to think. If you already have a house full of WiiMotes, or if your friends are Wii owners willing to bring their own remotes from home, good for you; but in most cases, Nintendo Land is a game that few will be able to exploit 100%, unless they want to spend a lot of money on it. The second problem of Nintendo's production is that it is played with pleasure, appreciating the manufacturing care and attention to detail typical of the Kyoto house, but one never gets the concrete sensation of being faced with either an unforgettable title, or at a moment of transition for the entire industry.", "date": "2012-12-01", "grade": "7.5"}
