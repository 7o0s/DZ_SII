The new Pro Cycling Manager is a product with dozens of parameters, variables and possibilities, so many that sometimes one gets the impression that this title doesn't really want to be played, but wants to be taken seriously, almost like a job.Developed by Cyanide Study and published by Nacon, Pro Cycling Manager 2023 is clearly designed for a rather small audience: fans of cycling and management video games. Anyone who does not fall into this double category could have a hard time squeezing the fun out of this somewhat complex title. Professional bike lovers will find teams, competitions, impossible climbs and sprints to the last pedal stroke while managerial fans will be able to make their way through sponsorship contracts, scouting for new cyclists, money management and research and development of talent and equipment. In this review of Pro Cycling Manager 2023 we will try to understand if, under the layers of numbers and some graphics that border on an Excel sheet, there really is that fun or involvement that a video game made for entertainment should always have. A life as a spectator In Pro Cycling Manager 2023 it is better to start from the single cyclist mode if you are not so much a fanatic of management games as you are of cycling video games If your dream is to ride a carbon fiber bicycle and try to win the yellow jersey, Cyanide and Nacon have already thought of you and developed the official video game of the Tour de France which, like any sports simulator, will put you in contention to enter the legend of the French stage race. Pro Cycling Manager 2023, on the other hand, is designed for those who find a secret pleasure in making the key decisions that lead athletes to victory behind the scenes, in short, those who love to build the foundations that hold up the cathedral rather than decorate its rose window. This does not mean, however, that you will not be able to satisfy your protagonism crazes because there is both a team mode, in which to manage an entire team, and a single rider mode in which you will have to impress the sponsors, bring home increasingly better results. and climb the ranks of the cycling world to become a team owner with a real chance of winning the world's biggest races. If you don't belong to the exact center of the Venn diagram that unites cycling and managerial fanatics, but you want to give this title a chance, we advise you to start from this mode because it is much less aggressive in terms of numbers, statistics and parameters to meet. You'll start by creating your athlete and choosing his area of expertise from someone who's a sprint expert, someone who masters the climbs, someone who's a workhorse for the whole team (a position that will consistently make you progress), and someone who gives the its best on the flat thanks to the regularity of its pedaling. Then you can choose the distribution of the 13 statistics but you will find that there are quite strict constraints (more or less 3 points out of 100 more or less for each) so as not to unbalance the game too much. Over time, victories and leveling up you can increase these numbers even if the impact of these decisions almost never results in the long term. As in the more complex mode, between one race and another the decisions taken do not have immediately visible results: Pro Cycling Manager 2023 is a title for those who know how to have confidence in their long-term strategies and have a long eye for making choices right knowing that they will pay not before two or three races. The dilemma of time Pro Cycling Manager 2023 manages to immerse you in the shoes of those responsible for managing an entire group of professional cyclists but this will take up a lot of time Like any self-respecting manager, there is an auto-completion function for the pivotal events, in this case the most important races, and therefore you can choose not to follow the race minute by minute, but go immediately to see the results. This way of progressing will earn you fewer points and less progress than the traditional way of following the milestone events moment by moment. In Pro Cycling Manager 2023 this gameplay structure is repeated with the 3D Racing feature. After choosing the cyclists to field, talking to the sponsors, managing the capital and doing some research and development it's time totake to the track and see who is the fastest, the most resistant and the most determined. You can still choose to autocomplete each race, but it's unlikely that your cyclists will bring home good results this way, because the simulation algorithm never takes risks and can't think of winning strategies during the competition. What you will have to do is watch the race by giving each of your cyclists the race directions. You will have to decide who ~shoots~ or acts as a battering ram against the wall of air to keep up with your teammates. You will have to choose when it is better to push and vice versa when it is better to recover energy for when it will be necessary to give the maximum. To do this you will have a series of pedaling modes available for each cyclist and an effort indicator divided into three colors, green (where energy is not consumed but you go slow enough), yellow (which consumes energy to keep up , but does not tire the cyclist) and red (to be used when you have to give everything and which can tire the pedaler too much). Each racer drives and overtakes automatically making the simulation limitations of this game, sadly, obvious. We didn't expect stellar graphics, but seeing the cyclists crossing each other as if they were all ghosts in the corners still makes your nose turn up a bit. The leading bikes, then, have very limited animation so they don't lean when cornering and look like little trains on rails in a model. The interactive race simulations of Pro Cycling Manager 2023 are a fundamental part of the game which, however, has some graphical issues. Graphical defects aside, the biggest obstacle we encountered and which makes the soul of this game more ambiguous is the duration of the simulated races which can reach peaks of half an hour in which you do nothing but watch your cyclist pedal and have it switch modes every five to ten minutes. The game wants you to spend time in a mode, the 3D racing, which is not very refined and with obvious technical difficulties. The depth and beauty of Pro Cycling Manager 2023 lie instead in its many parameters, in the relationships between contracts with cyclists and contracts with sponsors and in decisions related to research and development. However, that flow of thought and gameplay is interrupted by these races that are rather boring to interact with and quite ugly to watch because they are full of graphical inaccuracies. Yes, there is auto completion, but if you care about the results and objectives that the game presents you with each race, then you will have to put up with this very long process. Work or play? Pro Cycling Manager 2023 is somewhere between a very intense and immersive experience and an Excel spreadsheet to be delivered by the end of the month to keep the accounting happy Let's say you're precisely the fan Cyanide Studio wants to please: a fan of cycling and management video games. Before jumping into Pro Cycling Manager 2023 you have one last dilemma to face and that is that this game may require too much of you, both in terms of time and concentration, to give you in return an experience that, at its best, just gets by. The time to spend in the menus is not little and, despite being gratifying in its depth, it serves to prepare all one's resources for a simulative apical moment that frankly leaves you tepid. When it starts again, it somehow manages to rekindle its spark, even if it is a strange cycle that leaves a bad taste in the mouth. The heart of the problem lies in the fact that after each race, which certainly lasted too long and maybe even went badly , you are overwhelmed by an avalanche of numbers. The game effectively distributes contract expirations, scouting phases and rider and sponsor satisfaction management, but sometimes there are situations where two or three of these parameters need to be addressed between rides and here the game tends to get really too complex. There are not many automatisms that can help you and some of these moments made us completely lose the desire to play because they added layers of unnecessary complication to an experience that needed fluidity.", "date": "2023-05-28", "grade": "6.0"}
