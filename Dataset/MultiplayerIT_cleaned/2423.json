{"name": "Pinopee: Wings Of Adventure", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pinopee-wings-of-adventure.html", "text": "CONTROL (HA-TU') Let's come to the excellence of the product: the control system. For the whole game you will need only one key, the A key, while to get around the various menus the B key may also be useful. Your robotic bee can walk, crouch, push, climb, but above all fly and perform dizzying aerial accelerations. And here it is necessary to spend a few words on the gimmick (which in truth is very Sonic) that characterizes the title: the Dash!! (which in this case is not a detergent). By pressing the A key, you can perform a certain number of accelerations in each direction before retouching the ground, so you can reach prodigious heights, launch deadly attacks and daring escapes. During the adventure you will meet the cute little fairy who will magically increase your number of Dash!! so you can replay previous levels that had inaccessible points. Also while you are in flight ~targets~ will appear on both objects and enemies, this will allow you by activating the Dash!! to dash like Sonic through the level doing terrible flying combos. Unfortunately this option could have been exploited better because it seems very valid: there are rare times that you will actually be able to use this skill because the ~target~ appears at too close a distance. A further complication prevents you from exploring the game worlds with painstaking calm: Pinobee needs to recharge. Well yes, our winged cyborg has an autonomy that gradually decreases, to remedy this he must spasmodically collect flowers that regenerate him. If your autonomy reaches 0, GameOver. In addition to this, we note the canonical ~life bar~ which extinguishes as the malevolent opponents, the pools of water, or sharp spikes infer on you. The visual rendering is good, the graphics are nice with delightful accompanying elements, like any self-respecting platformer; the backdrops, however, remain a little mixed. Scrolling and animations are very fluid and characterized: there are even some Simil 3D effects that are good. The opponents, who are ultimately not too frequent, are well made, but are too anonymous. In any case, it is evident that the potential of the GameBoyAdvance is starting to be exploited by developers. The sound accompaniment is up to the game, without overdoing it. Music has never bored or annoyed me and this is usually a good sign; the effects are valid and nice. BARTERING (ONLY PLAUSIBLE AND SUSTAINABLE FORM OF ECONOMY) During your flutter you will collect a multitude of cards that will allow you to activate bonuses. There are three families of bonuses differentiated by color (pink, blue, orange). The more cards of the same color you own, the more bonuses you activate (simple). Obviously the amount of trading cards is limited, this means that you will have to decide which cards to keep (I know, I know, the choices are difficult but that's life). However, I announce that you can connect via the GBA GameLink to another GBA and Pinobee cartridge owner to exchange the cards owned by both, so as to be able to finish any collections, activate particular bonuses and so on. Among the various abilities that you can receive are those to increase the propulsion of the Dash!!, your energy level and similar. AND THE BEE MAYA GOES The game is pleasant above all thanks to the simple and effective control method, even if the feeling remains that a different design of the levels would have enhanced Pinobee's possibilities more. It must be said that in the game it is essentially necessary to jump, jump and ... jump again: since the difficulty is rather low, the predominant side is the exploratory one. The title is not a masterpiece, but if you are looking for a technically valid, satisfying product with a high replayability factor, you have found it. I am sure that, if the programmers know how to capitalize on the inaccuracies committed in this first Pinobee adventure, any sequel could become a great success. Pros Simple and fun Technically sound Highly replayable Cons Lots of potential left untapped Useful links Nintendo Gameboy Halifax Activision Artoon Hudson A STRANGE STORY We've all grown up with princesses to save, menacing aliens, planet earth on the brink of holocaust... but this time the music changes. Pinopee is a robot, built by the old bee Grandpa Bee; when the elderly scientist was completing his robotic creatura was kidnapped. At this point a fairy intervenes and addresses us saying: ~Pinopee, go and bring your creator home also because he left you incomplete: he still has to install your heart!~. So, heartless (but with the instruction manual in Italian) we set off once again to solve this adventure. Since we are without feelings, according to the actions we take during our games, we will access different endings, thus offering a vast work to all players who wish to approach Pinopee. The game is really enjoyable to play. The level of difficulty is not high and the games run smoothly, leaving us the opportunity to decide how far we want to go deeper into each level by looking for the various secrets. You have three save slots available. The organization is the classic one: there are worlds to go through each in turn divided into stages that have the same setting. Every time you complete a stage, Pinopee's diary will be updated, informing you about how you tackled that level, reporting any ~mistakes~ and keeping you updated on the evolution of the plot. Each stage can be replayed at will to dissect all the bonuses and the most hidden ravines. In some worlds the levels are very large, so as to be labyrinthine.", "date": "2001-08-09", "grade": null}
