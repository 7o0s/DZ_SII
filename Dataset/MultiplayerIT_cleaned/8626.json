Thanks to the countless reruns of every single episode, over the years the series created by Yoichi Takahashi has also become famous among the new generations but, slowly, it has begun to give way to new ideas and imitations, among which Inazuma stands out Eleven. And it's curious because Inazuma Eleven was actually born first as a video game and only later became a manga and an anime, but in Italy the cartoon arrives before the games which, however, reach the shelves only three years after the Japanese release. . what a mess! The important thing is that we can now enjoy the successful Level 5 franchise, designed above all for football lovers but not only. The school from another world For us, more than a year has passed, but for the Raimon institute football club, only a week has passed since the conclusion of the international tournament and life has resumed as before, between school lessons and daily training sessions. Everything changes drastically when the school is attacked by the extraterrestrial Alius Academy, which uses sport as a real weapon of war. It will be up to Mark Evans and associates to wander around in search of the best footballers in Japan to build a new team with which to defeat these opponents and save the world. This, in summary, is the absurd premise of Inazuma Eleven 2: Storm of Fire & Blizzard and those who have already seen the related animated series will rarely be taken by surprise by any twists and revelations. However, considering the plot a mere pretext would be really wrong, given that the Level 5s have managed to create a coherent universe and many nice and well-characterized characters. For this reason we have decided not to negatively evaluate a story which, although simple and improbable, nevertheless proves to be quite interesting and pleasant, thanks also to various well-made animated sequences, entirely dubbed into Italian. Furthermore, with this sequel a curious ~Pokmon solution~ was adopted with the release of two versions, Firestorm and Snowstorm, which differ in small details, for example the emphasis placed on some characters and the sentimental interest of the protagonist from a narrative point of view or different athletes, special techniques and opponents from a playful point of view. An option, called Contact, is therefore inevitable, which allows you to exchange exclusive players from one cartridge to another, but which unfortunately only works via local wireless; the Wi-Fi connection, on the other hand, allows you to download new characters, techniques and challenges, increasing the already satisfactory duration of the experience. The result is therefore a story with an unquestionably Japanese flavor that recalls the more traditional animated series in its structure and exposition. Ultimatum to Raimon How to combine soccer and jRPG? It is certainly not an easy operation but somehow Level 5 has succeeded, making its franchise attractive even to those who do not appreciate our national sport or do not understand much of it. For the record, this writer falls into both categories. Yet we liked Inazuma Eleven 2, perhaps precisely because in its absurd simplicity it tries to propose something new, it being understood that, in fact, the differences with the previous episode (and those to follow, to be honest) are really minimal. The game structure essentially alternates between two phases: the first consists of the canonical exploration of the environments, which impressively recalls the setting of the most recent Pokmon for Nintendo DS with two-dimensional sprites in somewhat dull but fairly detailed polygonal locations. In these moments it is possible to interact with the other characters, buy items, open chests and all the usual RPG repertoire. Sometimes we will be forced to ~fight~ with the very characters we want to recruit or with the rivals on duty and, as you can imagine, these clashes take place right on the football field: after choosing the team members and deciding their arrangement, you can start the game and control the movements of the sprite holding the ball by touching the bottom screen. The other characters will move accordingly, especially the enemies that intend to intercept you: the interaction between the player and the opponent is reproduced throughrso short cutscenes, sometimes overly spectacular, showing the polygonal models of the characters in conflict. Each athlete has a repertoire of hallucinating special moves that can even evolve: spinning fire kicks, summoning dragons and other creatures that accompany the shots, huge walls and energy hands to parry and other spectacular techniques that would make the Infernal Catapult of the twins envious Derricks. The management of skills and the outcome of the ~fights~ are based on real jRPG parameters, complete with elemental affinities, healing items, experience points and statistics that must be carefully studied to create a personalized team suitable for any type of rival . In reality, the difficulty is decidedly calibrated downwards, therefore a great preparation is not necessary to face the games, much less an in-depth knowledge of the sport ... but perhaps this is the greatest merit of Inazuma Eleven 2.", "date": "2012-04-02", "grade": "8.0"}
