In fact, we are talking about the people who created V-Rally back in 1998 and the controversial reboot of Alone in the Dark exactly ten years later, a branch of Infogrames / Atari that closed its doors in 2003 and was then reconstituted by its founding members just a few months later. The Gear.Club series has been the focus of the French studio for some years: it is a simcade racer characterized by a traditional but solid driving model, capable of offering a very pleasant experience without standing out from the crowd. inside a vein that is always rather inflated... at least until now. The premises of the new chapter, available for a few days for users subscribed to the Apple Arcade platform, are in fact very ambitious, especially on a technical level. Is the game up to it? We tell you about it in the Gear.Club Stradale review. Structure Gear.Club Stradale, the villa and the first cars purchasable in the game Let's start by saying that no, Gear.Club Stradale doesn't have an open world setting as maybe someone hoped, even more so after learning that the main setting of the game is our splendid Tuscany. It's true, the starting hub is represented by a huge villa with a large garage, where you can park the cars of the club we belong to, but the building cannot actually be explored nor can you freely roam the map in search of events to participate in as in Forza Horizon 5. Well, the limits of the game lie precisely in its structure, which never as in this case seems to have been adapted to the premium nature of the productions available on Apple Arcade, rather than designed from the beginning with the subscription platform for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV in mind. Witness a rather slow and grinding progression system, in which you have to grapple with the same events over and over again in an attempt to earn the experience necessary to level up and unlock further content. The latter are made up of new tracks (specifically unpublished portions of scenarios that we may have already seen), new aesthetic objects, new upgrades strictly linked to the rank reached and the resources obtained, and finally new cars, which can be purchased using the game's virtual currency but available at the dealerships within an annoying time limit, which should somehow mask the smallness of the fleet. The experience therefore appears all too basic in its dynamics and quite limited: you choose one of the available events in rotation, you compete with one of the cars in your garage, you eventually get money and objects and use them to get upgrades or new cars, clearly after completing a certain number of races. There is no career proper, nor are there multiplayer modes: huge shortcomings for a racer who should focus on sociality. Gameplay Gear.Club Stradale, one stage of the race On the gameplay side, Gear.Club Stradale can count on the excellent system developed by Eden Games over time, capable of offering a traditional but solid and pleasant simcade experience. This means that you have to brake before the curves and you can't throw yourself into frantic drifts like those described in the Slipstream review, but at the same time you can shoot and bounce off the walls as always happens in Gran Turismo. all of the games available on Apple Arcade, the Eden Games racer supports Bluetooth controllers and this is undoubtedly the best way to play, perhaps in front of the large screen of a recently produced iPad, which manages to push the excellent graphics of the game to its maximum potential. The best way and unfortunately also the only possible, if we consider that the touch and tilt commands suffer from various problems. Gear.Club Stradale, a race aboard the Fiat 500 Abarth The former only work with dignity on the iPhone, since to brake you have to touch the central part of the screen, which is really complicated to do on a tablet. It's better with the accelerometer, both with the brake only and with the touch version of the brake and accelerator, provided however that you adjust the inclination sensitivity very well: it often happens to perceive a clear understeer in the corners which makes the experience rather frustrating .A few words must also be said in relation to the balance of difficulty: although the different types of races are characterized by a different degree of challenge (easy, medium, difficult), it is enough to upgrade the car a minimum toso that you can always shoot your opponents. A choice, the latter, also the daughter of a setting devoted to very short challenges to adapt to the portable nature of the game. Graphics and sound Gear.Club Stradale, a race in the desert In the end, it's more the graphics and sound of Gear.Club Stradale that keep their promises. In particular the first, among the best ever seen in a mobile driving game, so much so that it is really easy to confuse this title with any medium-high-end racer for PC or console. Merit of the excellent polygonal models of the cars and the excellent lighting system, which is reflected on the categories and on the objects in the scenarios, creating shadows and changing the color tones according to the time of day in which you race. In motion, especially on a high-end device and therefore at 60 fps, the Eden Games title really makes a great impression and manages to mask the polygonal paucity of some contour assets, such as trees or vegetation, as well as the mediocre yield of smoke and some dust. Gear.Club Stradale, the section dedicated to upgrades Of course, the great structural limitations we mentioned earlier prevent the game from fully and quickly expressing its repertoire of cars and settings, given that both things are unlocked very slowly. Likewise, each setting is divided into different tracks to make up numbers, but the landscapes that you find yourself observing are fundamentally the same. The soundtrack fulfills its function well, accompanying the action on the screen in a lively way thanks to the discreet variety of songs available. The effects stand out a little less but appear functional, capable of reproducing the roar of the engines and other noises in a quite realistic way.", "date": "2022-04-16", "grade": "7.0"}
