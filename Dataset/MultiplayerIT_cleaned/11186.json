{"name": "Yakuza 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yakuza-2-recensione_a.html", "text": "A year later Kazuma Kiryu almost succeeded in starting a normal life. He is about to start a family and definitively abandon his career as a gangster, but obviously a new shadow casts over the life of this Japanese anti-hero when he becomes involved in a criminal feud that will unleash a real war between rival clans. And Kazuma will have to make his way through allies and opponents in a desperate attempt to put a stop to this madness and his life as a yakuza. Yakuza 2 is an action-game, essentially, but the plot has been treated very well, and proves to be more than an excuse for a series of fisticuffs: it's compelling, full of interesting and multifaceted characters, many of whom were already introduced in the prequel , and does not disdain unpredictable twists. The quality of the direction is very high and the spirit of an all-Japanese gangster movie is reproduced perfectly, thanks also to the realism of the setting, situations and themes covered. Furthermore, the care reserved for the reproduction of Tokyo, Osaka and its surroundings is maniacal: it is not only the setting of the main events in the game, it is not only the ring of the numerous fisticuffs in which Kazuma will be involved, it is also and above all a micro-city to ~live~ and explore, full of alternatives to simple progression in the adventure. Here comes the Shenmue mirage we have mentioned: the freedom of the player is remarkable, you can play bowling, you can attend and manage private clubs and attractive Japanese girls, or even work as a gigolo, all with the aim of scraping together ( or squander) money and experience. But the fulcrum of Yakuza 2 is naturally action and combat, and in these situations the Amusement Vision title gives its best, offering a battle-system of pure action and reaction in which the player directly controls Kazuma, performing dodges, attacks, combinations and particular decidedly choreographed special shots. The repertoire of moves available is very broad and the action component of Yakuza 2 will not fail to amuse both old fans and new players, thanks to original ideas such as the contribution of observers who will even be able to provide our alter-ego with weapons and tools to kill enemies. Once upon a time PlayStation 2 By now at the end of its life cycle, PlayStation 2 grinds its teeth as hard as it can and Sega brings into play a technically splendid product. There are flaws, such as a slightly unstable camera and an annoying pop-up of polygonal models, but in general the technical realization is of the highest level: the various characters are modeled excellently and enjoy fantastic animations, which give the best of itself during the clashes but which also show maniacal care during the non-interactive cutscenes, truly similar to a Hollywood film. The various locations are very detailed and full of little gems bordering on perfectionism, so much so that it seems difficult even to consider the game's more optional settings ~collateral~: the reconstruction of the settings is incredible and the development team led by Toshihiro Nagoshi is really managed to capture and best express the feeling of this fascinating land and culture. The excellent graphic sector is accompanied by a splendid soundtrack and a library of truly exceptional sound effects in terms of variety and quality. The atmospheres and the various interactive sequences thus enjoy enormous realism, and the musical accompaniment is always spot on and precise. Instead, once again a very particular choice as regards the dubbing, entirely in Japanese with English subtitles, a bit like in Mel Gibson's historical films. Although initially alienating, the final effect is truly superb and, ultimately, truly immersive. Yakuza 2 is available for PlayStation 2. Comment Yakuza 2 is certainly one of the best products in the PlayStation 2 toy library and it is a pity that it passes so quietly, overshadowed by the software of the new generation consoles. The playful experience is satisfying, the excellent combination established between plot and gameplay is surprising: each element does not invade the other, the balance achieved by the developers is such that even the wide freedom granted to the player becomes an integral part without accessorie is felt. Technically of excellent workmanship, despite small graphic imperfections, Yakuza 2 has the only defect of proposing a background that may not be liked by everyone. For the rest, it is simply a small masterpiece, a must in the playrooms of players who will be captivated by the charming Kazuma. Pros: Technically excellent Compelling and elaborate plot Excellent gameplay and perfect longevity Cons: Background, charactersi and atypical settings It has not been translated into Italian Random clashes that are sometimes repetitive", "date": "2008-09-19", "grade": null}
