What is considered to be one of the lowest functions of the human body, one of those not to be talked about at all during aperitifs or an elegant dinner, is actually intertwined with our culture. Let's say it's the fertilizer. Dario Fo recounted when St. Francis threw dung on the Pope and curia causing a great scandal. After all, God's jester entered the church naked well before those who do it today to get a transgressive portrait to share on social media. God himself, in Deuteronomy, worries about where to send his people to fulfill their needs: ~You will have a place outside the camp and there you will go for your needs. In your equipment you will have a peg, with which, when you squat down outside, you will dig a hole and then cover your excrement.~ Nothing strange, given that for believers it is he who created us, holes and excrement included, so it is also right that he provides us with a tutorial on all our mechanics. And if for De Andr ~Flowers are born from manure~, for Freud we all go through the so-called anal phase, between eighteen and thirty-six months (someone never gets over it), in which we become aware of our sphincters and begin to get interested and feel pleasure in pooping (if you are interested in the subject, read ~Three Essays on Sexual Theory~ and live happily). Surely coprolalia, i.e. the uncontrollable impulse to pronounce obscene words and phrases, can be considered a disease, but feces and bodily functions have always been used, from above and below, as an instrument of desecration of power. The bottom line is that constipation doesn't make even queens happy. Fart Simulator 2018 certainly does not have such a cultured background. It's probably more the work of a bored kid who wants to show off using the classic device of the loud fart in public. The one usually followed by silly chuckles. However, unlike many other similar operations, in this case the premise was at least followed by a real game, at times even well done, even with all its limitations. In truth Fart Simulator 2018 is divided into four games all with farts as a leit motif: in the first you have to fart on the customers of a shopping center, avoiding getting caught by guards and gyms and excessively inflating by spending too much time between one wind and one 'other, under penalty of explosion in a brown cloud; in the second you have to reach the space using guess what propulsive force? We don't think it's difficult to get there; the third is a mockup of the Metal Gear series, called Metal Fart Solid, in which a certain Colon 'El entrusts us through Codec with the task of thwarting the plans of the Fart-Hound terrorists who are up to who knows what in the Shadow Noses base; the fourth and last is a (very short) graphic adventure that becomes a survival action in which you are armed with a rifle that shoots farts against terrible zombies. Let's be clear: we are dealing with a poor title, with a very low price, which sells out in about an hour. Some sections, particularly the space journey section, are pathetic, to be kind, but we swear Fart Simulator 2018 manages to elicit more than a few chuckles and even has some moments that we wouldn't hesitate to call brilliant. For example, do you remember the famous fight with Psycho Mantis in Metal Gear Solid where you had to change the controller port to escape his psychic powers? In Fart Simulator 2018 you face a certain Bloody Mensis, who must be defeated by literally turning off the audio to stop his terrible song. Even the arcade phase is better than it looks, as playing you unlock different bonuses, such as a smart-fart screen cleaner or invisibility, which add an unexpected variety to the action. Of course, don't expect much more than a few apt quotes or a race for scores, because we're always talking about a title that sells for two euros. However, it is certainly much more successful than operations born from similar assumptions, such as the ~What's Under your blanket!?~, Who laughed without caring in the least about the gameplay.", "date": "2017-12-22", "grade": "6.0"}
