Productions that are almost always characterized perhaps by spartan or in any case not spectacular graphics like that of triple A mega-productions, but capable of involving the same (and sometimes even more) often due to a depth of game such as to make everything else pass in second floor. This is the case of Mount & Blade by TaleWorlds Entertainment, a title capable of conquering in a very short time an enviable group of enthusiasts, as well as a community of modders among the most active in videogame history thanks to a series of fascinating settings in the midst of which the player finds himself free to trade, loot, or seek glory by allying himself with any of the warring factions in the act of vassalage. All supported by a solid gameplay without excessive frills. Mount & Blade: Warband brings medieval warfare to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One Warbands But it is with its sequel, Mount & Blade: Warband, that the production perhaps finds its fulfilment. The game was very successful a few years ago on PC, to the point that today the development team brings it back in a revised edition for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One which we are now going to examine. The product is a standalone product that offers a sandbox medieval combat and realm-building experience, expertly blending genres such as management, RPG, strategic combat and third-person adventures. The player begins by selecting the appearance and gender of the character to play, the faction he belongs to and the skills, then enters ~the scene~ as a simple first-level ~swordsman~, with only a family banner at his disposal, if he has chosen to be descended from a fallen nobleman, a few crude weapons, a shabby armor and, if all goes well, a limping horse. In short, anything but a well-done hero. It is no coincidence that the first few bars of the game can be difficult, given that based on the equipment and parameters of the character, even a gang of five normal petty thieves can be fatal to him. But a few careful choices and the continuation of the adventure within the world of Calradia are enough, and after a while things begin to change: the user completes the first missions, expands his object pool, among other things virtually infinite , and improves the statistics of his virtual alter ego thanks to an RPG-style character growth system, and which even includes various bonuses/penalties in the use of ranged weapons (still, on horseback, in movement). Maybe he also raises a good amount of money and with that, when he arrives in a village, he enlists a handful of poor peasants willing to do anything to bring home the bread. Once properly trained and equipped, these can form a first unit of personal soldiers, with which to begin to assert themselves around. Step by step, the user is involved in a truly infinite series of activities and situations: from occupied castles to be liberated, or vice versa, to besiege to increase one's fame or for a monetary reward, to personal quarrels between lords to settle training with one or the other, up to plots to start wars, personal rivalries, exchanges of slaves and food, princesses to marry, fiefdoms to administer, revolts to appease and so on and so forth put some. On the other hand, the strength of Mount & Blade: Warband is in its incredible replayability and variety of situations, where the story is shaped by the player himself with his choices and actions. A key element of Warband are obviously the fights, characterized by a good set of commands which on paper allow a ~simple~ and immediate management of what happens on the battlefield, which is almost in antithesis with the underlying realism that permeates the clashes . In reality, and for this we have written ~on paper~, the absence of a peripheral such as the mouse is felt in this sense, which in our opinion is almost indispensable for this type of game. Playstation 4 trophies There are 57 Trophies made available by the game. These are divided into 50 Bronze, 4 Silver, 2 Gold and 1 Platinum and can be obtained by progressing through the main adventure, becoming King or Queen, killing a certain number of enemies with a specific weapon, level up in specific parameters such as leadership, and so on. Art and War Not that you can't play with the PlayStation 4 controller or there are insurmountable problems, but it is undeniable that certain orders to be given toand your troops or your character would find it easier to do, so to speak, if you could use a tool like the mouse rather than the analog sticks. In fact, the title uses a system of parries and directional attacks (movement to the right, slash from the right, up sword raised and so on), as well as an ~arc~ to determine heights, distances and methods of blow to be inflicted on the enemy, which according to we would be more comfortable to manage with the aforementioned peripheral. Just to be clearer, if the objective is to knock down a knight, then one must move the mouse upwards and at the same time give a long ~curve~ of movement to strike with a straight sword, whereas if the target is on foot, the hero's hand must drop and therefore a shorter arc of movement must be made in order not to miss the blow. However, in Mount & Blade: Warband it is possible to choose some configurations of the commands, including simplifications that guarantee, for example, parries or attacks without the need to indicate the direction, but simply by pressing a specific button. And if fighting against the CPU isn't enough for you, there's the multiplayer, which turns out to be fun and discreetly made, capable of hosting up to 32 players at the same time engaged in open field battles, conquering castles and villages, or in furious scrums all against all. To complete the picture of a production that pays little attention to frills and focuses more on realism and playability, there is a technical sector of sufficient workmanship, especially in relation to the type of video game. The graphics do not take full advantage of the power of the PlayStation 4 hardware, and seem in principle to reproduce the same as the old PC edition, albeit with some significant improvements. Upon closer inspection, the presence of slightly more defined textures, the addition of some contour details useful for reviving the scene and a slight increase in the quality of the visual effects, such as those of reflection of sunlight cannot in fact escape on armor and refraction of objects/people in bodies of water. Too bad for the polygonal modeling, which is not bad but is clearly ~old~ since structurally the various characters are the same as the original computer edition of a few years ago. Agreed that the game aims for something else, but it's also true that the developers could have tried a little harder and really improved the aesthetics of the product. In the same way, their animations are also outdated, which give them slightly wooden movements, while on the other hand the sound sector is pleasant, capable of decently restoring the typical sounds of pitched battles, past environments and so on. Finally, the English dubbing is good, the absence of Italian subtitles should be noted.", "date": "2016-09-19", "grade": "7.3"}
