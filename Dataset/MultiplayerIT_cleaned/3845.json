{"name": "Trenches - World War 1 Horror Survival Game: la recensione di un horror che non spaventa", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/trenches-recensione.html", "text": "Trenches - World War 1 Horror Survival Game really has a great premise: to shape the horrors of trench warfare in WW1 with a dreamlike adventure where something is always lurking to consume your soul. However, the game struggles to create tension and a sense of urgency in its narrative due to unclear premises and a setting that should be claustrophobic, but ends up feeling annoying due to its many technical problems. Made by Ryan Portelli, the sole developer behind Steelkrill Studio, Trenches is a psychological survival horror with gore and gore elements but which, sadly, lacks the immersiveness necessary to worry and horrify those who play. What should be apex moments in the exploration of the claustrophobic trenches rather than generating amazement and surprise take the form of a funny sequence of botched animations that look more like the result of a bomb exploding in a delicatessen rather than the blind fury of a evil entity. Trenches - World War 1 Horror Survival Game, the protagonist of this review, is a game that would have a lot of potential but, unfortunately, it is plagued by a rough grounding and many technical problems. An excellent premise WW1 trenches were a labyrinth of claustrophobic tunnels and bunkers that Trenches seeks to digitally recreate If there is a moment in history in which the human race has given its worst, it is precisely the First World War. Steelkrill Studio has decided to orient its game towards the more psychological side of the conflict, as deep scars have been inflicted not only on the bodies of hundreds of thousands of people. The disconnection from one's family, the daily contact with death and the devastation of the surrounding landscape have caused considerable trauma in those sent to the front. Trenches wants to explore just the desperate need of a soldier to escape from that labyrinth of tunnels and atrocities in order to be able to return to his loved ones. Too bad that there is a demonic creature who is absolutely determined to kill him. The story also focuses on the loss of humanity of soldiers at the front and the horrors of war. The most attentive players will soon understand that in the dreamlike and surreal world where they will find themselves, there is something wrong even when looking at the shadow that the protagonist projects on the ground: something is missing. There is no noise in the trenches The claustrophobia of the WW1 trench system is well replicated in Trenches, pity about the technical problems The trenches are the perfect place to set a psychological survival horror: tunnels, bunkers, mass graves and corpses were the order of the day in the mud of the hills on the border between France and Germany. The developer has done a good job, on a sensory level, to try to immerse the player in that very dangerous silence that veterans have said was one of the worst moments of the whole conflict, since it was the moment that preceded an assault. Even just moving creates tension and the game will often remind you how important it is not to make the slightest noise. There is a system to lean over and check what is hidden around a corner and you will have to be careful where you walk because, depending on the material of each surface, you can create more or less noise (wood, for example, makes a lot of noise) and the creature stalking you may hear your footsteps. If you choose to connect a microphone to your PC / console and enable the dedicated function in the menu, it will force you to also control the volume of your breath while playing because in this way the creature will be able to hear your noises. In particularly shocking moments (such as the discovery of a corpse or after an important point in the story), then, the protagonist will be out of breath from the shock, something that will increase the chances of alerting the monster of the trenches. Too many technical problems This pair of floating arms is just one of the glitches plaguing Trenches and breaking her veil of Maya The progression system is, on paper, well thought out. The ultimate goal is to escape the trenches, but to do so you'll first need to find nine clues, each of which triggers flashbacks about your past and what happened in the dream dimension you're in. These clues are linked to bloodied newborns who cry desperately and it is precisely their lament that guides you through the tunnels of the western front. To understand where the closest bloody newborn is, you will have a whistle that will increase the volume of its screams in order to understand in which direction it explhour. This is not an operation to be performed lightly: by doing so, the creature that stalks you will also hear you and could pinpoint your position. This all sounds very nice, but in the game, unfortunately, this mechanic has been translated in a decidedly disappointing way. The fog that the developers have filled the trenches with to create tension has a very strange interaction with the walls, causing them to appear and disappear between frames. Leaning before a corner, often, will make the camera enter the wall making you see through the walls and nullifying any fear. Furthermore, the monster that is chasing you is not exactly a strategist and the ease with which it is possible to escape from his sight makes him a decidedly little credible threat. Even some of the game mechanics work badly and risk ruining the tension: scattered around the map, for example, there are glass bottles to throw to distract the must, a pity that often the latter have broken in our hands before the I only launch because we passed too close to a wall. Thus luring the monster to the exact place where we were. Finally, while the music and sound effects manage to create some tension while walking through the trenches, when faced with a tense moment the audio sometimes comes with a slight delay which, rather than frightening, confuses and annoys. It doesn't help that the quality of the assets used is rather low and that the English texts on the screen have many syntax errors that sometimes prevent you from understanding what needs to be done. The result of all these technical problems is an inevitable detachment between the experience of the protagonist and the emotions of the player who, rather than being frightened, finds himself frustrated by the impossibility of enjoying a setting with so much potential and a story which, despite its lack of originality, manages to capture the attention.", "date": "2023-01-30", "grade": "4.0"}
