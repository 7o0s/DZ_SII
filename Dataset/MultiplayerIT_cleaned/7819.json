{"name": "Poker Night 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/118282-poker-night-2-a-carte-scoperte.html", "text": "If you are a poker regular, you will certainly know the charm of an evening spent with friends around the table, perhaps betting small amounts of money for the pure pleasure of playing but exulting like madmen in case of victory, as if we had suddenly become millionaires . Or maybe you're just one of those who go to dodgy clandestine gambling dens where you gamble and when you rejoice you really do it because you've become a millionaire. Almost. Whichever category you belong to, you certainly won't be immune to the charm of Poker Night 2, the new episode of the series created by Telltale Games and set within the comfortable walls of the Inventory, a mysterious room, probably located in a sort of space-dimensional interweaving that makes possible the interaction between characters who on paper belong to completely different worlds. Who are we talking about here? Seated at the gaming table, from left to right, we have Brock Samson, the Swedish bodyguard from the animated series ~The Venture Bros.~, unbeatable in hand-to-hand combat yet endowed with an incredibly calm and reflective nature, ergo a major very dangerous reason when angry; Claptrap, one of the androids seen in Borderlands, protagonist together with his kind of the fourth DLC of the Gearbox title, foul-mouthed and irreverent when it comes to playing cards; Ash Williams, the unforgettable survivor of the two chapters of ~The House~ and above all of ~The Army of Darkness~, a chapter that consecrated the character played by Bruce Campbell among the most famous anti-heroes of all time; Sam, the anthropomorphic dog from the ~Sam & Max~ series, accompanied once again by his little and pestiferous friend, who more often than not dispenses him some absurd suggestions. Finally, an exceptional croupier manages the games: the artificial intelligence GLaDOS, directly from the Portal series. Bluff or not? The prerogatives of Poker Night 2 are precise and aim to offer us a narrative experience of a certain type, characterized by an atypical atmosphere and irresistible dialogues, which alone are worth the ticket price (definitely popular: 4.99 euros for the Steam version). The title of Telltale Games should therefore be framed in the category of ~divertissement~, with the developers who have thus wanted to try their hand at an interesting and out of the ordinary narrative challenge because it sees completely different characters discussing and interacting with each other. Each hand corresponds to short jokes or elaborate speeches that fish in the background of each participant and which are all the tastier and more fun the more we know the story behind the various Brock, Claptrap, Ash and Sam. Added to this are also the interventions of GLaDOS, which are also very pleasant even if often and willingly uttered in order to ridicule our strategies. Poker games are therefore just a nice pretext to immerse yourself for some time in a sort of narratively unexplored terrain, a limbo in which everything seems to be possible. In any case, winning a few games produces tangible results, in this case it is possible to unlock various skins for cards, chips and the table, up to conquering extra objects to be used in Borderlands 2 and Team Fortress 2. The part played appears to have been realized competently, with a good artificial intelligence of the opponents, more than capable of launching into reckless bluffs or to discover when it is us to try our luck. The element of greatest interest lies in the fact that the developers have tried to make the characters credible with respect to their history, providing them with a set of plausible behaviors, all to the advantage of the enjoyment of the experience. The interface is clean and well organized, fully controllable via mouse. The technical sector is also very accurate, really effective both for the design of the characters, deliberately based on unique assumptions: Brock Samson and Claptrap boast polygonal models made in cel shading, even if the first has a more cartoonish appearance, while for Ash and Sam opted for a traditional style. However, the lion's share is played by the dialogues, really rich and very well acted, which form the heart of this production. But don't expect an Italian translation... Poker Night 2 is exactly the experience fans of the first episode have come to expect", "date": "2013-05-24", "grade": "7.5"}
