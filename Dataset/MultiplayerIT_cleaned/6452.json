However, Rush Rally wanted to offer a deeper and more multifaceted interpretation of this type of experience, drawing inspiration from a classic like World Rally, the arcade game produced by Atari in 1984, and giving us a structure full of unlockable cars and events. The latter are distributed within two main modalities: in the first we will have to compete following the classic rules of rally competitions (albeit with four possible variants), therefore aiming at obtaining a certain lap time; in the second we will find ourselves facing three other opponents on the track, trying to cross the finish line before them. There is no shortage of social aspects, with the connection to Facebook which will allow you to view the performance of our friends via ghost and challenge them with drifts and curve cuts. All applied to a gameplay that uses various adjustments to allow us to adapt the car on duty to our needs and the characteristics of the route, raising or lowering the suspension, changing the length of the gears, acting on the wing or on ~frivolous~ details such as the color of the paint. Surprisingly, all these aspects translate into substantially different behavior for the car, which can draw more inspiration or stretch, adapt to curves in a softer or more decisive way, and so on. A tuning that becomes necessary when we decide to abandon the tranquility of the lowest level of difficulty in favor of a more engaging and demanding challenge, which also renders the reactions of the vehicle when cornering in a more realistic way and therefore requires a greater number of corrections, as well as a minimal knowledge of the layout. Rush Rally is a solid and convincing driving game with a responsive and precise control system Yes, there is also the Lancia Delta Integrale Rush Rally is a freemium product, therefore it can be downloaded for free from the App Store and Google Play, provided you accept the presence of non-invasive advertising between one screen and another, as well as a traditional energy bar (rechargeable over time) which regulates the number of races we can carry out in a row. However, it is possible to completely reset the indicator by watching a simple trailer, or decide to invest 1.99 euros to remove any limitation altogether. That said, even with free use alone, the title developed by Brownmoster turns out to be quite generous and far from the extreme monetization attempts of some mobile games, providing us with a good number of cars and races to access without constraints, simply bringing home victories. As mentioned above, the game uses the selection of one of four difficulty levels to increase the realism of the car's reactions, and going from ~easy~ to ~normal~ already produces substantial differences, all to the advantage of longevity and replayability. The type of default shot, which refers to the aforementioned World Rally, unfortunately proves to be inconvenient in most cases, hiding any obstacles among the transparencies which, once hit, translate into time penalties. The fixed view from behind the car is much better, less original but decidedly more ~readable~, assisted by a simple and precise touch control system, with two buttons on the left (arrows to steer) and two on the right (accelerator and brake) which are really reactive and allow you to face the extra challenges present in a given event, such as the obstacles to avoid or the scaffolding to pass under. The Rush Engine made by the game developers, the same seen in other important mobile racers, boasts credible physics, a good rendering of the day/night cycle, a large number of objects on the screen and good visual effects, in this case the long trail of dust or sleet created by running on sand or snow. On the other hand, the sound is bad, due to the croaking voice of the co-pilot: is this also a tribute to vintage video games?", "date": "2015-03-28", "grade": "7.8"}
