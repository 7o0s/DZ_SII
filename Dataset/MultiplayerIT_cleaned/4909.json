The transmission derived from a television format proposed by Mickey's house around the world, called in the original language The Disney Afternoon. The enormous success also achieved in Italy among the young people of the time was naturally due to the quality of the Disney productions, led by the unforgettable adventures of Uncle Scrooge and the other ducks in DuckTales. But the cartoons broadcast over the years have been many, and from them Capcom was able to draw heavily to create some videogame transpositions for the NES, some of which were at the top of the overall production for the Nintendo console. As you may have guessed, The Disney Afternoon Collection is dedicated to the Disney Club, with which the Japanese publisher has recently brought back six games to PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, in a single block that also includes some small changes compared to to the original titles. If you were a kid in the 90s, you won't be indifferent to The Disney Afternoon Collection! DuckTales! Woo-hoo! In the quick review of the games included in The Disney Afternoon Collection we can only start from DuckTales, an adaptation made in 1990 to enter the circle of the best titles seen on the NES by right. Like five sixths of the games in the collection, it is a platformer, in which you have to go treasure hunting as the richest duck in the world equipped with a spring-loaded stick with which to jump and defeat enemies. Thanks to the excellent level design, DuckTales still manages to have its say today even beyond what the eyes of nostalgia can make it palatable, including the stunning 8-bit soundtrack. In its successor DuckTales 2, released in 1993, we find game dynamics similar to those of the first episode, with respect to which the non-linearity of the levels and exploration increase thanks to the possible alternative uses of the stick. Remaining on the ~papery~ theme, The Disney Afternoon Collection then offers us Darkwing Duck from 1992. It is still a platformer, oriented towards the action of its superheroic protagonist who can use his own Gas Gun to shoot enemies. With the cloak you can also deflect the blows of the opponents, advancing between holds and jumps which make it quite challenging overall. From ducks we move on to squirrels, with the inevitable Chip & Dale Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers from 1990. A title that is still highly enjoyable today in both single and double, thanks to the possibility of controlling both protagonists together with a friend in a single match. As in the other cases, the rest is the design quality of the levels and the game dynamics, based on the possibility of the two squirrels to throw objects around. Its sequel, 1993's Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers 2, plays rather similarly, albeit with fewer differences than between the two DuckTales. To close the list of games in The Disney Afternoon Collection we finally find TaleSpin, dedicated in 1991 to the animated series of the same name that featured some of the animals known in the old feature film dedicated to The Jungle Book. The game clearly differs from all the others in that it is a shoot 'em up, in which we find ourselves aboard Baloo the bear's plane to shoot enemies. A not exactly inspired overall design, accompanied by a somewhat wooden control system, probably makes TaleSpin the title that has aged least well among the six that are offered to us. Playstation 4 trophies The Disney Afternoon Collection features a total of twenty Trophies, all of which are Bronze in type. To obtain them, the player must complete all of the proposed adventures, also working hard to improve their times in the Time Attack and Boss Rush modes. Even those who don't make use of the greedy rewind function, completing all six games in the old style, will be rewarded. What's new? If after DuckTales: Remastered you were expecting to see the games of The Disney Afternoon Collection with refurbished graphics, we are sorry but you will be disappointed. Indeed, even DuckTales itself is proposed in the guise known in its original version for the NES, as well as all the other titles to which it is possible to apply only a couple of filters and three different screen sizes, ranging from the original one to the ~wide~ for modern monitors. However, we have chosen to stay with the dimensions of the time, since it seemed to us that the others made everything a bit too stretched. If from the point of viewtechnical we are stuck on what we saw many years ago, Capcom has included some new features in the package such as the Time Attack mode, complete with online rankings with which to compete against the best speedrunners around. For those who want to limit themselves to facing the bosses of the various titles offered, The Disney Afternoon Collection includes the Boss Rush mode, thanks to which you can skip the cutscenes to limit yourself to the final battles. To give a little relief from the anachronistic difficulty of some of the games in the collection, the Digital Eclipse team has also introduced a rewind feature, which basically allows the player to go back at any point during the game, even if which would otherwise have been game over. For lovers of curiosities, the developers have finally included a historical section, where you can get lost in the artwork, documents and various anecdotes related to the games of The Disney Afternoon Collection.", "date": "2017-04-26", "grade": "8.0"}
