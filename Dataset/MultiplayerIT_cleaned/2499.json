After personally testing the Beta version some time ago, I am now going to show you the pros and cons of the final release on the new chapter of the famous brand produced directly by Sony for Sony. After a short loading and language selection, here comes the introduction in full motion video that will introduce you to the game; a montage, well done but classic, mixed between scenes taken from the game and real renderings, with a musical remix of the good trance piece also used in the options screen. The game modes that you can choose are the QUICK RACE (i.e. immediately on the track, a more arcade-like default setting and the possibility of modifying the starting grid) the TESTS for the race strategies (they include obsessive settings on the type of tire compound angle, aileron angle, number of pit stops, etc.). Other ways to play F1 are the SINGLE RACE (my favourite), the typical GRAND PRIX (with the usual practices, qualifying etc.) the TIME CHALLENGE (where you can record your best time and submit it to the SCEE website ) and the SPECTATOR MODE, in which if you want, you can limit yourself to being the director in a race and spying from unacceptable views during the normal game (such as Replays more or less). The graphics of Studio Liverpool (those of Psygnosys) have undoubtedly done a good job .. I repeat a really sharp color choice combined with a high definition and a frame rate of sixty frames per second! I have no more words to praise the graphic beauty of the cars, the view in the cockpit or the tracks richer in heavy 3D like the one in Monaco... in short, graphically speaking a formula one like this has never been seen before on consoles . It should also be remembered that the DVD support has also been exploited to contain myriads of images that will be unlocked by winning and which you will then find in the ~Gallery~ section. Speaking of audio.. Commentary throughout history can only be seen in two extreme ways: hilarious or annoying. The audio effects do their duty but, let's face it, nothing that her little sister Psone can't do too. Absence of Dolby Surround, while for the first time after Stereo I find the wording ~Inverse Stereo~ (forgive my ignorance or any gaffe.. but I didn't quite understand what it is). After previews and interviews.. in short, how is the game??! Here you are; now that I've played it much deeper I have to admit that the artificial intelligence of the opponents didn't seem the best to me (in this we are still far from the thickness of simulation milestones on PC) but I don't want to consider it a real defect. In an attempt to be realistic, the driving model is a little mischievous, in the sense that (as I had already noticed in the demo) you skate a little too much, even with the ~dummies~ settings the game is not very permissive (ending up on the grass is equivalent to end up on the ice) in short, punctures in tyres, accidents and natural disasters are certainly spectacular characteristics.. but to play carefree I preferred to leave ~ON~ on the ABS, the computerized traction control and the curve signals (of the stickers that appear in Colin McRae style). Beautiful collision management, the pit stop section, the much-cited particle effects and real-time climate changes, which also change during the race and the appreciable split screen to challenge a friend. I got to try the game with both the steering wheel and the pad... and I must admit that I have always had a concept of my own on the subject, namely; I believe that with the home steering wheel the game is not easier, it certainly adds realism, it is cooler, but not easier (you have to get used to the steering angle ..) it seems to me that in curves it is paradoxically easier to dose small taps of dear and old joypad (which still performs well thanks to the new even more analogical technology). Where the pad has always won and overtaken the peripheral called the steering wheel, it is in the question ~gear lever~ or the possible ~pedaliera~.. simply incomparable. The definitive Formula One? Definitely not (also because the 2002 version will be released next year heh heh..) but a good product, a successful attempt to add depth to this genre on consoles and simply the best F1 game out there for Ps2. Too bad there isn't an option to link two consoles (in short, there was in the first Ridge Racer on PSX! What are the developers waiting for?) and too bad for another two, three little things (read above) from which you can still console yourself by watching the DVD video documentary inserted inper pack (a really great bonus). In short, having reached this point, one word is not enoughand two are too many; if you are a fan of this kind of racing games with laps (and laps) of the track, rather than simple check-point arcades .. the purchase deserves all the consideration of the case. The definitive Formula One? Pros: Good product High longevity Rich in extras Cons: Some unnerving flaws Preview Formula One 2001 Special Formula One: Past and Near Future Interview with Studio Liverpool Screenshots Formula One 2001Screenshots Formula One 2001 Video Formula One 2001 Tense nerves for all opponents The prancing horse most loved by Italians is also going strong this season. Michael Schumacher (for some a demi-god, for others the king of the obnoxious) has just won his fifth Monaco Grand Prix... and the Playstation 2 seems to have found a game in which racing is serious. This adrenalinic world has always fascinated you but you don't even have a driving licence? Were your favorite cartoons Ken Falco and Gattiger? No problem: Studio Liverpool took care of it.. from today you can race in the Continental Circus on board your Ps2 thanks to the DVD-rom of Formula One 2001.", "date": "2001-05-31", "grade": null}
