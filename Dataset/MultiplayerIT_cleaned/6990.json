Come to think of it, it has been since its announcement, from that ~is it an April Fool's out of season?~ during BlizzCon, by the embarrassed smiles of a development team who knew well what challenge they were facing: not only succeeding in the thankless task of effectively translating the experience of the Blizzard series on mobile, but also and above all defeating prejudices. Or at least try. Since the announcement, a lot of water has passed under the bridge, several beta phases have followed and the development has run its course with the necessary times, without treading the hand given the stakes. What happens if you entrust the creation of an action RPG to a team of experts of the genre, overflowing with talent and resources? It happens that an extraordinary action RPG comes out, the best ever seen on iOS and Android. Diablo Immortal, the Crusader class Even today, however, it is not the quality of the game, its peculiarities, the many contents and the extraordinary technical sector that are being discussed. No, we are obviously talking about microtransactions and the craziest and most extreme use that can be made of them; even where it is not binding for the experience, even where the monetization system is identical to that of hundreds and hundreds of other free-to-play games that hide the same odious risks for those who are inclined to spend without thinking too much. Make yourself comfortable , therefore, because there are many things to say and it will take a while: welcome to the Diablo Immortal review. The birth of freemium mobile games Diablo Immortal, the use of one of the special skills Anyone who knows a little about the history of the App Store knows that the strength of the Apple digital platform also and above all lay in the accessibility of its many applications, many of which were offered at a price of just 79 cents. Games, of course, also bowed to this policy, but at the time they were actually mobile games: from Angry Birds to Jetpack Joyride, from Temple Run to Candy Crush. Titles capable of grinding monstrous numbers in the face of relatively modest investments. In any case, it was soon realized that owners of thousand-euro phones had great problems spending 79 cents on an app and so the market moved to free-to-play productions, or rather on freemium: games downloadable for free but which adopted some more or less binding monetization system. In some cases the approach was that of demoware, therefore one or two complete levels with the possibility of buying the rest by paying a few euros, but in most in some cases it was better to leave the illusion of free of charge intact by resorting to traditional microtransactions, with or without the perverse mechanism of loot boxes. Our yardstick Diablo Immortal, a boss fight during the campaign The debut of freemium titles was not immediately massive and so the first free games were greeted with a mixture of amazement and wonder, sometimes regardless of their actual quality. Perhaps someone will remember our reviews under the label ~the free game of the week~, when the mobile market was not yet monopolized by the free-to-play format and it was actually possible to observe the developers experimenting with various solutions to understand how to get a some blood (money) from turnips (owners of smartphones worth a thousand euros). Over the years, the situation has clearly changed: finding premium games on the App Store and Google Play, therefore free of microtransactions and sold at a full, it has become almost impossible and at the same time monetization systems have been consolidated with in-depth studies and specialized personnel behind them. Diablo Immortal, one of the many fights in the game Obviously, this does not mean that all the development teams adopt the same approach and it is precisely for this reason that, on the other hand, on Multiplayer.it we have always used the same yardstick, also in this case linked to the reality of the reference platforms and the average quality of the games available. Incidentally, this is why the same game reviewed in the mobile version usually gets a few more votes than the PC or console version. How invasive are the free-to-play mechanisms? Is it possible to play without spending anything or is there actually an obligation? And does this obligation occur immediately or after a few hours of play? The answers to these questions influence the numerical evaluation as much as the more traditional entries. Microtransactions in Diablo Immortal Diablo Immortal, the mechanisms for recycling items In Diablo Immortal are presentthree types of currency: Gold, which is obtained by completing missions and defeating enemies; Platinum, which can be bought using Eternal Orbs or through the sale of certain items; and finally the aforementioned Globi Eterni, obtainable only through the purchase of packages from 99 cents to 99.99 euros. Two types of Battle Passes and the so-called Gift of Abundance are added to this system, all systems that multiply the rewards by accelerating the progression. The prize funds, which as you know in some countries are equivalent by law to gambling and have determined the non-distribution of Blizzard's mobile game, in reality they cannot be purchased directly, but only conquered as a prize, for example during shipments. However, the probability of finding rare and precious objects inside them can be increased by using the Emblems, the latter being purchasable and only through Eternal Globes. Diablo Immortal, a look at the in-game shop The most controversial aspect of the Diablo Immortal monetization system lies precisely in the mechanism of the chests, given that it is the only way to obtain the Legendary Gems: precious stones that, if applied to the equipment, multiply its qualities by enhancing it in a substantial and giving life to a clear pay-to-win aspect that manifests itself in particular in the final phase of the game, which includes different player versus player modes. However, let's go back to the discussion made previously on the invasiveness of free-to-play mechanisms, because from this point of view the mobile incarnation of Diablo stands as a more unique than rare case. In fact, if it is true that the game allows you to reach the aforementioned endgame phase even without spending anything, albeit net of some inevitable moments of accumulation of experience to level up, at the same time the system that we have illustrated so far puts a real and just lock on one of the elements that are traditionally part of the experience of the series: the most unbridled collection of equipment. Multiplayer mode Diablo Immortal uses an unprecedented MMO structure that includes cooperative content, accessible immediately and rather simple to manage, but also competitive modes that require a character of such a level that he can become part of Clans and Brigades. The first, Battlefield, consists of a team PvP in which two teams of eight players clash with the aim of destroying the opponents' Ancient Heart. The second, Arena Antica, is instead a battle royale with rich rewards up for grabs which, however, will only go to the winner. Once the endgame phase has been reached, we will also be able to deal with the methods present in the Cycle of Conflict, in which the factions of the Shadows and the Immortals fight for dominance. Ah, yes: how is the game? Diablo Immortal, the interface shows where to go when needed It bears repeating: Diablo Immortal is the best action RPG available on iOS and Android, there is little to discuss. It's true, there are products equipped with a more consistent combat system as regards the yield of impacts and which perhaps also bring into play sophisticated defense mechanisms in order to enhance the player's actual skills rather than weighing down any difference in level compared to their opponents, relegating evasive maneuvers to simple positioning, but overall Blizzard's production is superior to any other. As already mentioned, it was not difficult to predict such an outcome: we are talking about an experienced and very well supported development team, as well as an extremely consolidated brand in its dynamics and structure, declined in this case in the form of an MMO which however creates more opportunities than disadvantages, the latter reduced to the pure and simple staging of sequences in which we will find ourselves surrounded by other users who fight nothing, at least in our eyes, and who will sometimes end up ~dirtying~ narrative moments of a certain importance. Diablo Immortal, another spectacular clash The different classes available, each with its own abilities and peculiarities, the enormous amount of objects that can be conquered and then recycled or sold to animate the mechanisms related to the game's crafting, the long campaign with its many cooperative implications, a narrative sector entirely spoken in English which, if desired, returns some emotion, an almost perfect touch control system (but it is also possible to play with a Bluetooth controller, if desired) and an irreproachable artistic direction represent just some of the strengths of this production. up to thirty hours to complete the story of Diablo Immortal and at that point, as mentioned, several gp are unlockedpotentially exciting aspects, with many competitive facets but also a greater incidence of the pay-to-win aspects we mentioned above. There are many free-to-play mobile games that absolutely do not allow you to play for so long without spending anything indeed some already intervene in the first chapters by changing the balance of the difficulty to push to buy potions or upgrades. Blizzard has chosen a different path, but no less controversial: the important thing is to be well aware of it.", "date": "2022-07-01", "grade": "8.0"}
