{"name": "Glimmerati", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/glimmerati.html", "text": "Red carpet ready Starting from the narrative incipit just described, Glimmerati combines the action on the real track with a deliberately hyper-glossy storyline, animated by calendar characters who move between events anchored to the most classic soap opera clichs. This mechanism works very well both as a mere glue between one driving phase and another, and as a gameplay tool, offering the user the possibility to choose his own path according to the relationships he will be able to establish with the various characters. What matters most in the Bugbear title is however always represented by the actual phases on board one's racing cars, which can be unlocked as one continues in one's rise to success. There are three different types of competition among which the user can divide in Glimmerati: the first, and more banal, is made up of the various races that make up the championship, to be contested against seven cars commanded by as many VIP drivers. Being able to count on a dozen tracks set in three different cities, this is definitely the most substantial and interesting part of the game, which does its job well while denoting a generally rather low level of challenge. Another game mode consists in satisfying some requests from the other characters, which most of the time are resolved in reaching a certain point on the track within a time limit. The last type of competition concerns the single challenges against the drivers of the tournament, by winning which you can get new cars with which to fill your garage. Not to forget the inevitable Bluetooth support that allows multiplayer action for up to four players. VIPs at the wheel In addition to offering three different game sections, Glimmerati also does a good job in the more strictly course context, thanks to a precise control system of the cars that favors a tasty arcade-style gameplay. Constant foot on the accelerator and skids are therefore the order of the day, with the added possibility of exploiting a turbo charge that gradually recharges itself after use. All this is favored by the adoption of a never too praised bird's eye view, which allows optimal use of such a product on a portable console. The end result is a title that roughly recalls - from a cosmetic and playful point of view - the various exponents of the Micromachines series, although this Glimmerati adopts a decidedly more adult imprint. Speaking of the technical sector of the Bugbear production, the quality of the graphics should certainly be pointed out, which proves to be accurate and detailed: even without showing off a monstrous polygon count, Glimmerati offers to the eye scenarios characterized by a skilful use of light effects and a effective arrangement of textures with high definition, scrolling everything at an always stable frame rate. Less exciting, but still up to par, is the work done on the sound front, which consists of a pleasant musical accompaniment, effects suitable for the situation and a dubbing of the dialogues as ~fake~ as the protagonists of the story. Comment Glimmerati is a solid racing game, which takes full advantage of the potential of N-Gage not without a good dose of cunning, thanks to a truly ductile bird's eye view and perhaps too little used in the portable field. Characterized by an excellent quality technical sector and by a game system that combines the pure fun factor with a good depth, Glimmerati proves to be a more than worthy title both for quick games and for longer sessions, with the only drawback of a non-exceptional longevity and a level of difficulty tending to low. Anyway, one of the best racing games available for the Nokia console. Pros: Excellent graphics Convincing and varied gameplay Control system at the height Cons: Rather low difficulty level Not very long-lived Imagine that you are a young heir to great wealth but lack the credentials to enter true high society. Now think how you would feel if a famous businessman named Maxwell noticed your driving skills and invited you to join the exclusive Glimmerati racing club, which is an open door to a future of fame, wealth and wonderful women. Now, realize the absolute impossibility of this actually happening and console yourself with this new N-Gage racing game from Bugbear...", "date": "2005-07-21", "grade": null}
