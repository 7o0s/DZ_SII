As is known, in fact, at midnight on D-day, paratroopers of the 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions were parachuted over enemy lines in order to prevent the German counter-offensive from landing the allies on the French beaches. Due to the strong wind and other unforeseen events, however, the launches went badly and almost all the soldiers found themselves far from their objectives and often even isolated from their fellow soldiers. After a few minutes, however, we will be able to get in touch with the members of our group and thus reform the team. Not only the places that we will encounter in the course of the game up to the infamous Hill 30, but also the countries and rural scenarios have been carefully recreated by the developers based on photographs of the time. Furthermore, the whole story is based on certain military sources that tell how the events took place in those terrible days, including army movements and battle tactics. The whole story will be told and seen through the eyes of Sergeant Baker who will not only tell very interesting anecdotes about the members of the group but will also be able, thanks also to an excellent Italian dubbing, to give us goosebumps ~I don't have never asked to become foreman bringing us to the knowledge of all his fears and uncertainties, knowing that he operates with responsibility for the lives of his men. The game looks like a tactical shooter, and if you've already played Full Spectrum Warrior you already have a very clear idea of what we're talking about. We will lead two squads of soldiers, one with cover functions and the other with assault. In fact, following military techniques, in almost all firefights that we will be forced to face, we will use the technique that provides for a first engagement in which we understand where the target is located and, subsequently engaging the same under fire from the team cover, while the assault one will go around the enemy to take him from behind or on the flank. Making our comrades in arms interact is very easy: by pressing the left analog trigger, an indicator will appear that we can move back and forth, in order to precisely identify the point where to send our soldiers. The game looks like a tactical shooter, and if you have already played Full Spectrum Warrior you already have a very clear idea of what we are talking about When Storytelling is Emotion If we place this indicator on a German position then the indicator will turn into a viewfinder and in doing so we will be able to order an incessant covering fire, necessary for the outflanking maneuver described above. We will also be able to launch our comrades in a decidedly risky ~melee~ assault that can only be implemented in cases of clear numerical superiority. An innovation brought about by the Ubisoft title is the tactical view, which can be activated by pressing the back button on our joypad, which moves the camera in a bird's eye view, pausing the game and allowing us to see not only our position with respect to the objective but also that of our comrades, in order to understand the evolution of the situation on the battlefield and thus make the best decisions for the success of the mission. In addition to movement, assault and cover fire, we will not be able to issue other orders to our soldiers but we will only discover by playing that the developers' choice to limit the options has been decidedly spot on, also in order not to make troop management too cumbersome. The whole game is devoted to a decidedly marked realism: that's why the slowness of the rifles or the imprecision of the machine guns, and that's why a few shots suffered will be enough to see Sergeant Baker or his companions die. Too bad, however, that this realism has not been taken into consideration at the beginning of each new mission, in which we will find all the soldiers in perfect health, even those who had been injured or lost their lives in the previous level. A choice that goes to the detriment of realism but certainly taken in order not to raise the level of difficulty too much, which is already calibrated upwards in itself. If you are a player who gets discouraged after dying a couple of times during every single mission, perhaps Brothers in Arms is not the title for you: you die, and you die a lot! However, using the system that has often been revived since Halo, the game will automatically save when crossing checkpoints, usually 3 or 4 per oeach level faced, an excellent method for not having to start from the beginning and without wasting time on saves. When we meet the Germans, above their heads, using a full spectrum memory indicator, we will be shown the degree of ~suppression~ of our fire against the enemy. If the indicator is red, the ~Krots~ will be able to shoot at will without risking being hit, while conversely, if the indicator is gray, we will be able to move around the battlefield, running less risk as the allied cover fire is decidedly intense. In all these phases of the battle, the artificial intelligence of our soldiers as well as that of the opponents will be enhanced. It is true that we will be able to give orders but our allies will not simply execute every command, but, being trained soldiers, they will seek shelter and the best position to face the engagement. Likewise Hitler's followers will retreat and move across the battlefield, seeking the best cover and trying to outflank our array of forces. Needless to say, an excellent example of programming. Arms comrades Technically the game is done very well, even if the excessive use of blur to make a cinematic atmosphere might not be liked, and every little detail has been taken care of. As previously described, all the landscapes have been perfectly recreated, using vintage photos and location inspections in the Normandy countryside. The settings are therefore very credible and very similar to those seen in films such as Saving Private Ryan or in the TV series, produced by Spielberg and Tom Hanks, Band of Brothers (from which the game has drawn more than one inspiration). The vegetation was created in a very similar way to what was already seen in Ghost Recon 2, with the definition of the individual blades of grass. Too bad not being able to interact almost at all with the houses: when we find a closed door we will not be able to force it in any way. It must be said, however, that the small villages that you will meet in the game gave us the impression of being real, very very real: different buildings, telephone poles, pieces of cars blown up and wreckage of all kinds scattered in tour. The polygonal models of the characters are the most detailed we have ever seen before and obviously perfectly reproduce the uniforms of the time and the now sadly famous equipment of each paratrooper weighing 65 kg. The same goes for weapons and equipment featured in the game such as the M1 carbine or M1A1 machine gun. The game's view is the classic first-person view, but it is necessary to switch to the ~scope view~, by pressing the right analog stick, in case of a firefight. Of course you can also activate a kind of viewfinder in the options that makes life easier without the need to aim, however at the expense of realism. The same goes for the covering fire indicators which can be disabled as desired. There is no denying the story is the host and playing Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30 the impression of being on a battlefield is more alive than ever Arms comrades Some pearls characterize the technical realization of the Ubisoft game and one of these is certainly the one concerning the way in which the game warns us that we are too exposed to enemy fire: not only will we hear the bullets splashing on the ground or between the blades of grass, but one side of the screen will take on a soft-blurred color which will indicate the direction of the attack. Really immersive. The only flaws in the technical sector we found turn out to be some small jerks every now and then, some loading a little longer than normal and some unconvincing textures, but absolutely nothing serious. There is no denying the story is the host and playing Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30 the impression of being on a battlefield is more alive than ever, but the developers would not have succeeded in the enterprise without the use of an excellent audio sector, obviously Dolby Digital in game and with a really good Italian dubbing. But not only the voice actors did a great job but also the sound players gave their best, hearing the bombs and bullets bursting nearby will make you jump off the sofa. Ps2 Version! The Ps2 version of the Ubisoft title we tested turned out to be very similar to its Xbox counterpart. Certainly from a visual point of view the impact is perhaps less but, when compared to the vast majority of PlayStation 2 titles, Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30 turns out to be very convincing. Some textures are a bit faded and poorly defined but from the sound point of view the version that is the winner seems to be the one dedicated to the Sony console. The console joypadand Japanese by its nature is less suited to shooters and it must be said that even in this case the controls are better in the Xbox version. Other shortcomings affect our evaluation more clearly such as the lack of a clear fire indicator and the absence of some extras. The multiplayer instead is exactly the same in the two versions, unfortunately limited up to a maximum of four players. At the end of our test we can only be satisfied with a game with some small imperfections compared to the version for the Microsoft console; shortcomings that, in our opinion, cost about half a point in terms of evaluation. Multiplayer Like many other titles planned for Xbox, Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30 also provides a multiplayer mode that uses both the split screen and obviously the Microsoft online service. This mode, which can only be played by 2 to 4 players, is very simple and a little too essential; we certainly expected a little more. The online clashes will all focus on carrying out a mission, the objectives vary but the concept remains unchanged, in which one team will have to achieve an objective and the other will obviously have to prevent it. The objectives as mentioned are as varied as collecting an explosive and undermining a truck or carrying a message to a waiting vehicle. Every time during the level we will be killed instantly we will be able to take the place of one of the soldiers previously led by the AI, while when all our allies are killed then for a certain number of times we will be able to call other teams to replace them. You will therefore not find any other type of mode, there will be no deathmatch or capture the flag, only these missions as either the allies or the Germans. Comment Needless to say, we really liked Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30. From the first news coming from the last E3 we were impressed, but we certainly didn't expect such a successful game. After Full Spectrum Warrior, tactical fps lovers on consoles can only rejoice, moreover the dramatic component of the story is able to capture the attention of even non-enthusiasts. The technical sector is the icing on the cake consisting of a well-orchestrated and well-told story. Too bad you have used so little online features but the single player game is absolutely worth the purchase. Waiting for news regarding the sequel, already planned, of this excellent title, don't miss it. Pros Curated and historically recreated setting Technically cared for Oscar-winning sound and dubbing Cons Difficulty not for everyone Underused online mode Some slight technical imperfections The Second World War was the backdrop for many games, but with Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30 Ubisoft has definitely amazed us by packaging a valid, very valid product, which certainly aspires to become one of the best strategic shooters ever seen on consoles. The result is the result of careful research by the Gearbox developers who documented themselves to recreate the places of Normandy, in which the title is set, during the famous six days of June 1944 in which the fate not only of the war was decided but also even of modern history as we know it. From June 6, 1944, better known as D-day, until the afternoon of the 13th we will lead a team of soldiers, a group of friends, who moving in unison and with disruptive force gave their fundamental contribution to defeating the Germans. This is no joke and we kid you not, after you have played all 18 missions the feeling of having been there will be as strong as ever. A dramatic impact like few other games we've tried and we're sure that once you've grabbed the joypad, you can't help but agree.", "date": "2005-03-24", "grade": null}
