{"name": "The King of Route 66", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-king-of-route-67.html", "text": "Poor King! A more or less direct sequel to the fun 18 Wheeler American Pro Trucker, The King of Route 66 offers essentially the same gameplay as its predecessor, which sees the player at the controls of one of the five trucks available in a series of various modes. If the number of the latter has definitely increased compared to the prequel, the same cannot be said of the quality of the game structure, which in The King of Route 66 reaches levels of worrying lowness for a Sega product. But let's go in order. The main mode, homonymous with the title, follows the game action of the original coin-op: the user, therefore, must drive his truck through various stages with a variable task between reaching the finish line before the opposing truck or over time pre-established. All interspersed with unwatchable cut-scenes and fixed screens in which text windows unravel the useless plot of the game with excessive prolixity through dialogues between characters that cannot be more kitsch. The bad news is that a couple of internships are enough to realize how these intervals are in all respects cloying ploys to lengthen the life of a title which, without these, would last a scant ten minutes. In fact, with a shameful choice of game design, Am2 has set aside the long and suggestive paths of 18 Wheeler to replace them with a dozen sections of truly embarrassing brevity. A couple of curves and straight lines, and the game is done: completing a stage never takes more than a minute, even if you are often forced to repeat the operation several times, given the absurd balancing of the skills of the opponents. In addition to traveling constantly in a zig-zag, thus thwarting the famous and fun trail effect of the prequel, the rival trucks are endowed with an odious infallibility and a curious ~magnet~ effect on the player: regardless of the skill of the user and the number of used turbos (another -very bad- news), the opposing truck is constantly attached to the exhausts of his own articulated lorry. A really annoying aspect, which, adding to the poor management of the shocks and the fact that under the effect of the turbo the vehicle becomes practically undriveable, makes the gaming experience unsatisfactory to say the least. The road to boredom Paradoxically, the secondary game modes prove to be slightly more stimulating than the main one, without however ever being able to cross the threshold of mediocrity. In addition to a section dedicated to eight different mini-games (which as such still leave the time they find) and a poor 2-Player Mode both for the fluidity of the action and for the pure and simple fun factor, there is room for the Queen of Route modes 66 and Rival Chase. The first sees the player engaged in conquering the heart of some kind damsels through small quests related to the achievement of a specific objective before the time runs out: the rather tedious game plan is slightly revived by the possibility of buying a large number of upgrades for your own truck and a set of brand new tractors. The Rival Chase mode, on the other hand, offers a series of challenges against opposing trucks complete with an unprecedented energy bar, which must be properly emptied with clashes before the finish line. Even in this case, however, boredom is not long in coming. As if the weak game structure were not already enough to demean the Sega title, a disarming mediocrity graphic sector takes care of completing the work in the worst way. The King of Route 66 is afflicted by obvious clipping problems, presents scenarios with an absolutely low polygon count and shows off a series of textures with a rather poor definition. All seasoned with a series of very unjustifiable slowdowns and a terrible menu design. The music, at least that, is saved. Comment The King of Route 66 is a clear example of how a sequel can take all of its predecessor's best ideas and throw them out the window. In fact, the latest production of Am2 retains very few points of contact with the good 18 Wheeler American Pro Trucker. If the latter in fact knew how to distinguish itself for a good graphic design, a series of long tracks inserted in well-constructed scenarios and a solid if not very varied playability, The King of Route 66 does almost completely the opposite: so here we find ourselves with a title with dull cosmetics, characterized by a series of very short paths and with a tedious and irritating game structure at the same timei know time. A bad misstep by Sega. Pros: Apt soundtrack Presence of the 50/60 Hz selector Cons: Tedious and poorly constructed game structure Too unbalanced difficulty level Graphically not up to par After the forced abandonment of the hardware sector and the extension of the game production activity on other platforms, it was reasonable to expect from Sega a qualitative performance equal (if not greater) to the playful releases of the Dreamcast's good times. Strangely this was not the case, and the line-up of the Japanese software house was largely composed of often unconvincing porting and not always brilliant new titles. The King of Route 66, however, does not belong to either of these two categories: Am2's latest product, in fact, fits right into the wild pile of simply badly made video games.", "date": "2003-11-17", "grade": null}
