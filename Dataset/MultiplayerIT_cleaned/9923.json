The more observant will have noticed that Prince of Persia: Warrior Within had already been launched on the App Store some time ago, but realizing that they had published a version full of bugs, the developers decided to use the magical sands, take a step back and take a few more weeks to perfect the game. But now the wait is over, and one of the most superb and promising titles in Gameloft's recent line-up is finally available on Apple devices. However, the last thing the Warrior Spirit needs is a long and useless presentation: just remember that it is neither more nor less than the second chapter of the trilogy born with The Sands of Time, which appeared on PC and consoles of the past generation. Persecuted by the dark spirit Dahaka, the prince will weigh anchor in search of a solution to get rid of it, but his ship will be boarded and he will end up shipwrecked on the mysterious Isle of Time. It must be said that, although Gameloft has chosen what is considered by many to be the worst of the three episodes, the expectations of the fans were anything but low: being able to reproduce the same feeling in the controls and the same technical goodness of the original represented in fact a huge challenge for the developers, and unfortunately not all hits have been successful. Great Jupiter! The title is presented in grand style, starts in the fourth and welcomes the player with the same, excellent video in computer graphics that introduced the console version. Even at the end of the filmed sequence and in the first moments of gameplay, the game displaces with truly impressive graphics, which give their best on iPhone 3GS. The troubles, however, appear as soon as you place your thumbs on the screen of the device: Gameloft has once again used the traditional interface with the digital stick on the left and action buttons on the opposite side, but this time a big mess came out. The controls represent in fact one of the biggest weaknesses of the game, and to climb, run on walls or drop from a ledge the player will be forced to juggle an intricate pattern of keys. The presence of a complex camera system, often unstable and difficult to manage, completes the job, destroying that sense of precision and safety needed to perform the most daring acrobatics. It happens all the time to stumble into the void, fall by mistake or jump in one point instead of another, and the possibility of rewinding time proves to be more indispensable than ever. Given the premises, the fear was that the use of the Sands of Time could be equally complicated and not very intuitive, but fortunately a touch is enough to save the skin, while the high quantity of enemies from which to draw sand allows you to have a supply of very generous attempts. It must actually be said that problems of this kind are felt much less during the numerous fights: between parries, grabs and sudden attacks, each fight turns into a choreographic dance between the prince and his opponents, where it is possible to exploit the scenario to one's advantage , jumping on the walls or using columns to gain momentum. The energy lost in combat can be restored by drinking from one of the fountains scattered here and there around the island, which act as real checkpoints in which to save the game in progress. Unfortunately these points are quite rare, and the inability to interrupt at any moment does not encourage those short gaming sessions so appreciated in iPhone titles.
