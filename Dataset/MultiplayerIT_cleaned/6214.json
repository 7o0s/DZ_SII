Suddenly a prophecy shakes these warriors from their torpor and forces them to come out into the open to clash, find out which of them is destined to destroy the world and kill him before this happens. This, in brief, is the plot behind Rise of Incarnates, Bandai Namco's interesting free-to-play experiment for PC. However, the narrative elements have very little weight from the point of view of an arena action game designed for two-on-two fights which, as highlighted in the test of a few months ago (we invite you to read it for more information on the structure, controls and the basic rules), stands as an attempt to clear customs in the West a formula that has been working great in Japan for several years, also and above all in the arcade. We are talking about gameplay in the style of Dragon Ball Z: Tenkaichi Budokai, to remain among the products distributed by us too, but the greatest similarities are found with the Gundam series: Extreme VS, which puts couple fights on the table. They are therefore titles that mix fighting game and third person shooter mechanisms, and which base their charm on the balance of the characters, the timing and the tag maneuvers, some of which are indeed quite spectacular. Rise of Incarnates arrives at the appointment with the official launch in an undoubtedly more mature guise How do you change in order not to die After the long Early Access phase on Steam, which brought the Bandai Namco product to confront an attentive and rather demanding user, Rise of Incarnates was launched in the final version and became the protagonist of a welcome rethinking compared to the free-formula to-play that had characterized its debut. In addition to the already present possibility of accessing the entire roster for twenty-four hours from the first launch, in fact, and a series of achievements that allow this period to be extended up to two weeks, the monetization system has been profoundly revised and it is now possible to purchase characters also using virtual currency, albeit at increasingly higher prices and therefore according to relatively long times. However, the credits that are obtained immediately are enough, once the introductory phase is over, to unlock one of the Incarnates forever and to lay the foundations for a first specialization. In fact, the depth of the gameplay of this product does not lie in a combat system that ultimately reveals its cards after just a few minutes, often leading us to repeat the same combinations of shots with the aim of defeating the opposing team; but rather in becoming familiar with the peculiarities of each character, trying to exploit the characteristics of speed and power, the special maneuvers and even the specific weight in view of the clash to become competitive. Let's have a foursome The various months of gestation also seem to have contributed to substantially improving the online sector. If in the early days of the Early Access phase it was really difficult to find users willing to play a game, however running into problems related to latency or connection errors, during our new tests we found a surprisingly fast and efficient matchmaking, capable of organizing matches in a few seconds and therefore put ourselves in a position to immediately start collecting experience points, so as to raise the general level and that of the individual Incarnate, as well as unlock the boosters that can make our maneuvers more effective. Attention, however: from the beginning we have been able to verify how the developers have carefully avoided introducing elements (especially paid ones) that could represent a problem for game balancing, resulting in the infamous ~pay to win~. No, the improvements have a limited weight, which however decreases as experience is gained, which means that they become increasingly complex to exploit and do not create situations in which the traditional novice user is knocked out in two shots by an opponent who decided to put his hand in his wallet. The roster and the outline If the improvements of Rise of Incarnates are evident in terms of free-to-play mechanisms and matchmaking, the same unfortunately cannot be said of the contents that most catch the eye. Two scenarios have been added, bringing the total to five (New York, London, Paris, San Francisco and Washington D.C.), but the modalities have remained the same, obviously net of the consolidation of the two-cont deathmatchor-two. Of course, in these cases increasing the variety implies a fragmentation of users and it is possible that the authors are waiting to be able to count on greater numbers to introduce something in this sense, the fact is that at the moment there is not much to count on except the aforementioned roster of characters; which absolutely do not shine for design but are, as mentioned, well differentiated and must therefore be discovered and tested one by one, focusing on specialization. From a technical point of view, the production stands out clearly compared to the average free-to-play for PC, but we are still talking about modest graphics, especially as regards the settings, bare and purely functional to the action. Ultimately, the download of Rise of Incarnates is certainly recommended for those who appreciate the action VS genre and want to invest some time to discover the roster and grow at least a couple of characters, although there are many aspects of the game that still need of improvements.", "date": "2015-07-09", "grade": "7.0"}
