We know that Japanese gamers are crazy about RPGs, yet the million-seller palm belongs to a decidedly more action-oriented title, that Monster Hunter Portable 3rd (in the West it will arrive as ~Monster Hunter Freedom 3~) which since its release has sold more than four million copies, repeating the success of the previous episode. The role-playing elements in the Capcom series are not lacking, moreover, and are combined with a series of highly appealing contents. It is clear that, faced with such results, several publishers have thought of creating their own Monster Hunter: Namco Bandai has tried it with God Eater Burst, which we will see in Italy in less than a month, while Square Enix has precisely produced Lord of Arcane. The title developed by Access Games differs from the Capcom blockbuster in its medieval fantasy scenario and RPG-style fights (in the sense that they take place in a sort of abstract location, like in RPGs), but otherwise we are there. After creating our character using a simple editor, we'll face a short tutorial that will show us the exploratory phase but above all the game's combat system. At this point we will arrive in Porto Carillo, a village with lots of inhabitants, artisans and a guild where you can leave for the various quests, both alone and with three friends. The game supports cooperative multiplayer, but only locally: the only way to play online is through an Adhoc Party on PlayStation 3. Arms and baggage Equipment is one of the fundamental elements in Lord of Arcana. Our character can initially choose between five different weapons which, depending on the size, may or may not allow him to also hold a shield: the gladius, a light and fast sword, which allows us to move quickly and dodge attacks, but also to parry the blows of the enemy with the shield; the white grail, a hammer created ~in the image of the Holy Grail~, powerful and fairly balanced; the bronze sword, a weapon to be held with both hands, capable of causing enormous damage to the opponent; the bronze axe, also heavy and powerful; the aegis spear, moderately effective and has a useful long range attack. Depending on the materials collected during each quest, we will be able to ask the village artisans to upgrade these weapons as well as the rest of the objects in our possession, which will soon prove to be a very important practice for surviving against the most powerful bosses. To access the quests you must select those available within the guild, then you can leave. Some missions require you to collect certain items or eliminate certain enemies to complete, but there are also quests based solely on fighting a monster. In that case it will be best to make sure you have enough life energy and supplies, or game over will come inevitable. The missions are generally divided into two distinct phases: exploration and combat. The first takes place with reference to a map of the dungeon, which is divided into several ~rooms~ each time and which often requires the finding of keys in order to continue. Within the scenario we see the enemies move, but the fights (as mentioned at the beginning) do not take place ~live~ as in Monster Hunter, but in RPG style: you come into contact with an opponent, then you are projected into an area circular of generous dimensions, inside which we find a variable number of monsters to defeat. Based on the effectiveness of the weapon in our possession (from the village we can still switch from one type of weapon to another, to better evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each choice), the clashes can be resolved in a short time or take several minutes. When an enemy is on the verge of being overwhelmed, the view of the battle changes and we are given the opportunity to end the duel with a coup de grace. Cross and delight Unfortunately it is precisely in the fights that Lord of Arcana shows its side to a whole series of limits. In fact, during the first hours of the game, with unpowered weapons, duels take up a lot of time and soon become repetitive. The maneuvers at our disposal turn out to be ineffective, and so we always end up resorting to the same blow, the one that assures us a quicker epilogue, while any counterattacks by the opponent become an eventuality to be avoided not because of the damage we could suffer, but onlyso as not to waste further seconds in yet another dispute that is always the same. The target locking system, deputy to the left back button, limits the problems with managing the view but only up to a certain point, since very often there are more than one enemies. The presence of a bar that regulates our shots and heavy attacks acts as a limiter against an even more repetitive conduct, but alone is not enough to improve the situation, just as the spells that will enter from a certain point on are not enough become part of our repertoire. The problems become even bigger during the fight with the bosses, because you always find yourself moving to avoid their blows, and the decision to assign the adjustment of the view to the d-pad therefore proves to be completely meaningless: either you move or you looks around, unless you have two thumbs in your left hand. Using the back keys to move the view would have been a much better solution, because a control system of this type (which makes even the exploratory phase cumbersome) really ends up undermining the enjoyment of the experience. All at the expense of the large number of quests, capable of making the game last from a minimum of thirty to a maximum of even one hundred hours. As far as the technical sector is concerned, Lord of Arcana moves between ups and downs. The character we control is well done, has a decent set of animations and a good level of detail, and the enemies (albeit divided into relatively few variants) show a slightly inferior design. What is really wrong are the scenarios, because beyond a few exceptions the background is almost always repetitive, devoid of particular charm and therefore unable to entice us to explore every corner. When we face very large monsters, then, the frame rate takes the hit and also produces quite noticeable drops. Nothing to say instead for the sound: although the music is not unforgettable, they manage to accompany the action in an appropriate way, accompanied by effects of discreet workmanship.", "date": "2011-02-22", "grade": "6.0"}
