{"name": "Emoji Kart Racer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/emoji-kart-racer-recensione.html", "text": "The idea of an emoji-focused kart racing game is something we would hardly have thought of, but it's also true that this type of game seems like a standard template to be filled with anything that can come to mind, from licensed series to characters or - evidently - pictographic symbols, so we are no longer surprised by anything. However, a somewhat rambling concept would need very solid support in terms of gameplay, and this is where the game leaks from various sides, as we see in this review of Emoji Kart Racer. The fact of setting the entire identity of the game on smileys that we can't see 99% of the time, given that the shot is obviously from behind the protagonists, says a lot about the bizarreness of this project, but it's also enough indicative of its general consistency. It also comes at a time full of alternatives in this area: beyond the new Mario Kart 8 Deluxe tracks, we have seen the launch of Kartrider Drift and we are waiting for The Karters 2, so the competition is not lacks. The characteristics are typical of this sub-genre of the racing game, or rather a classic-style arcade that focuses entirely on the action, possibly multiplayer, looking very little at the realism of the guide but above all at immediate fun. There isn't even a vague narrative context, which is understandable considering that the premise of an emoji race is probably not a very high profile source of inspiration, while there is the classic progression between different championships made up of various tracks placed in sequence. Classic gameplay In Kart Racer emoji we only see smileys in replays The two essential elements in any kart racing game are also present in this one: the arcade driving model and the use of power-ups located on the tracks. The gameplay of Emoji Kart Racer falls precisely within the canon set for the genre, without trying absolutely anything new but, to tell the truth, rather removing something, given the small amount of variations present in the game and a mere adherence to the consolidated tradition also for regarding the functioning of attacks and defense system. Driving a kart is not a negative experience, resulting rather immediate: drifting is present but does not require particular counter-steering management to obtain additional accelerations, while the use of the brake is strangely harmful, since it involves an excessive penalty. The problem is rather represented by the physical management of the cars, which tend to react in a rather unpredictable way to the jumps and obstacles present on the tracks, complete with abstruse camera movements and erratic behaviours. All this tends to give little reward to the actual skill at driving, given that we often find ourselves victims of rather random accidents, due to elements of the scenario that perhaps would not even be designed to be real obstacles, but end up causing ruinous accidents. The power-ups have the classic attack systems or temporary advantages which, substantially, are equivalent to some of the historical options of Mario Kart, although the quantity in this case seems to be rather lower, with some elements that are also redundant. This lack of attention to the balance and variety of consumable items makes them accessory elements without great interest, far from the strategic characteristics they should have in a full-blown kart game, moreover without even being able to fully express themselves in a battle mode, mysteriously absent . Tracks, modes and customization Some kart racer emoji tracks are nice The moments of satisfaction that can emerge from driving in Emoji Kart Racer also depend on the design of some tracks, which are more interesting than others, but the results in this area too are fluctuating, given that many tracks appear to be little studied and decidedly anonymous. Considering that the variety of environments and situations that is vital in a game of this kind depends on these aspects, as well as normally having to provide a certain basis for more or less strategic interpretations of the race, it is easy to conclude that only a small part of the game's tracks it actually works, while the rest seems crammed in to make some volume. All this regardless of the technical realization of tracks and cars, which in principle is pleasant even if far from the maximum expressions of this genre. Another deficient feature, in an inexplicable way, is the scarcity of game modes made available : to begin with, in a game that basically bases its essence on the competitionion multiplayer, the absence of online play is atrocious. It can be overlooked that there is only the standard championship mode, which allows you to tackle the packs of tracks in sequence (4 sets of 4 tracks each, for a total of 16 tracks, it's not a bad endowment), but that it is possible to face it in online multiplayer is absurd, considering above all that artificial intelligence is incapable of offering an engaging challenge. emoji Kart Racer presents split-screen multiplayer as the only form possible Faced with this shortcoming, the lack of alternative game options such as battle in the arena or any other interpretation of the race also takes a back seat. Basically there is only one mode in the whole game. Customization should be a basic element of the gaming experience, all centered on unlocking new emojis and accessories to use as protagonists, as well as new vehicles and modifications for them. These are purely aesthetic elements that do not change the gameplay, but to tell the truth they remain rather marginal also due to the aforementioned framing issue, so it is above all the vehicles that stand out, some of them with interesting designs. Emoji Kart Racer unfortunately does not ooze charisma from all pixels, to put it mildly, so this aspect does not emerge in a particularly convincing way either.", "date": "2023-04-02", "grade": "4.5"}
