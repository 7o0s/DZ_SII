Divinity II: Ego Draconis fell precisely within this type of product, and proved to be a real surprise for RPG lovers that became more and more beautiful as the adventure progressed, or rather, in the discovery of how many goodies of all kinds the developers had included in it, not least the possibility of transforming the protagonist into a dragon, although the monster sessions were less profound than the rest of the title and oriented towards an almost arcade solution. Strengthened by the success achieved, the developers have released an expansion in record time, Divinity 2: Flames of Vengenance, and, at the same time, have seen fit to also renew the base game by proposing a single edition containing the entire saga of dragon knight: let's see how. The Infinite Threat The events of Divinity 2: Flames of Vengeance begin immediately after the end of Ego Draconis, so that, if you were to start the expansion directly, you will have access to a high-level character, which is however not recommended both in terms of plot that of gameplay, as letting yourself be thrown right away into a complex experience like the one offered without having honed your skills may not be the best of ideas. This is because the creation and above all the development of the character is one of the focal points of the entire package: although it has the soul of an action RPG, Divinity 2 is above all an extremely difficult game, in which a dispersion of points in a thousand badly developed can be the difference between a powerful hero and a hybrid that is excellent on paper but weak in practice. In fact, the idea behind the title is to propose a complete approach focused on the role-playing experience of the title, which means, for example, that the fights are not managed through combos that can be activated by certain key combinations, but through skills recallable by pressing the keys, in the style of the various Dragon Age or MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft and various emulators. Creating a character with multiple skills but all of a low level is, therefore, the worst of strategies if you want to keep a hero alive in a world populated by multiple creatures (fantasy stereotypes are captured perfectly) whose level cap is almost always superior to that of the player and often presented in mixed groups of healers, tanks and shooters able to support each other during the fight, thus forcing us to look for strategies other than direct attack or, why not, to look for diplomatic solutions, at least when possible. The fabulous world of Rivellon The setting, which has remained the same in both products, nevertheless has a lot to say about: Rivellon is a typical fantasy world, populated by monsters, ogres, humans, necromancers and obviously the inevitable undead, and in which the umpteenth eternal struggle of good against the usual demonic evil that oppresses the poor peasants. It would expire in routine and repetitiveness if the developers hadn't had the excellent idea of making Rivellon a parody of the classic fantasy, yes re-presenting the characteristic clichs of the genre, but, at the same time, ridiculing them to the max, with a result similar to the one obtained by the films of the Die Hard series in the panorama of 80s action films. The champions of good wear golden armor, in a vaguely Roman style, so tacky as to elicit more than a smile, and carry weapons so ornate and with such absurd shapes that one wonders if in reality such ridiculous and unbalanced swords could ever exist. The cities are built in a cartoony style (vaguely resembling that of World of Warcraft) and the buildings have a kitsch decor that covers different styles ranging from rococo to neoclassical in a blaze of opulence that D'Annunzio would certainly approve but which today's gamer it can only give the impression of a successful ridicule of the genre. To make things even more paradoxical there are in-game encounters and quests: among living skeletons convinced they are still alive, great wizards transformed into vegetables, wise ghosts and necrophilic wizards, fun is guaranteed, also thanks to the lines of the tthese, many, very long, almost exhausting except that over and over again during the dialogues jokes and observations worthy of the best Monkey Island escape. Among other things, the quantity and quality of the quests is truly remarkable and the objectives are the most varied and absurd: whether you have to look for earrings in a haunted theater or follow the trail of a murderer, rather than investigate a murder like the better than detectives (complete with witnesses and clues) or take a position for one side or the other during a discussion, it can hardly happen to get bored during the long dialogues or the hours sometimes necessary to complete a single quest. Wanting to find fault with this variety in fact, it can happen that sometimes you find yourself with dozens of unsolved quests to complete, ending up losing the thread of the main plot, whose developments, among other things, are sometimes lower than those of some minor quests, as if it had been inserted as a mere glue between the paradoxical and irreverent surrounding adventures. Nothing bad anyway, given that the main quest goes through steps that present opponents superior to those normally found in the area, thus forcing the player to complete all the corollary of secondary missions to increase experience and skills before the ~final~ battle . Expedient which, among other things, brings the duration of Divinity II: The Dragon Knight Saga, the entire package, between 60 and 100 hours of play based on the percentage of missions completed and the strategy of the various clashes. It's a pity that the sessions transformed into a dragon, however entertaining, are also the ones that are most detached from what was previously said, even if, needless to deny it, a squeeze of massacre in an arcade-like style, with the possibility of flying through canyons, skies and hills by burning enemies and shooting down aircraft gives a significant twist to the gameplay, varying it to the right point. Improvements for all tastes From a technical point of view, the work carried out is decidedly convincing: thanks to some criticisms leveled at Ego Draconis, the developers have well thought out to insert a discreet series of graphic improvements in Divinity 2: Flames of Vengenace, starting from more convincing animations than the characters (especially of the protagonist in the execution of the skills) up to a greater general detail of the world, both on the clothes and on the environments (open or closed) passing through a substantial increase in the special effects of spells, sources of light, flames and etc. The general result is decidedly satisfying and functional to the gameplay, which among other things, also thanks to an almost total scalability of performance, maintains full fluidity even in mid-range computers. The sound effects remain convincing and the accompanying music proves to be epic and redundant at the right point, convincingly underlining the various parodic excesses of the title. Enemy AI generally doesn't disappoint, featuring characters who do what their class should suggest, which means healers who support their fellow soldiers, necromancers who summon new foes, and marksmen who shed splash and ranged damage, too. if it often happens to see enemies who don't move when a few tens of meters from them some fellow soldiers are massacred in situations that sometimes recall an MMORPG rather than a single player game such as Divinity 2.", "date": "2010-11-17", "grade": "8.5"}
