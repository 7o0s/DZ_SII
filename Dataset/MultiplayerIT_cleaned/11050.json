{"name": "MotoGP 08 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/motogp-08-recensione.html", "text": "Those who know the genre of racing simulations, on two or four wheels, know well that these are products that aim for one thing: to offer an experience as close to reality as possible. Our car or motorbike must behave as if we were racing on a real track, taking into account tire grip, traction (especially when cornering), track conditions, set-up and the characteristics of the vehicle we drive . Modifying one of these values, even slightly, must produce a more or less marked change which must be evaluated during the test laps; and all the work done has the sole function of turning into the best possible result in the race, when we won't be alone on the track but will have to face dozens of fierce opponents. Is MotoGP 08 an absolutely realistic motorcycle simulator? No it is not. But it comes very close, and has had the merit of introducing a parameter adjustment system that allows anyone to play the game, as already seen in the 2007 edition for PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360. The ~arcade~ style is ideal for beginners and for anyone, in general, who wants to race without too many thoughts: the bike is very little affected by collisions, it holds corners even in the worst conditions and hardly escapes our control. The ~simulation~ style, on the other hand, is only recommended for experts or for those who have already become familiar with the game: the front and rear brakes are independent, collisions almost always result in falls, going too long in the corners is not forgiven and you have to be very careful to dose the acceleration. Finally, a middle ground between the two approaches is represented by the ~intermediate~ style. The presence of three distinct classes (125 cc, 250 cc and MotoGP) constitutes a further element of gameplay variation. You have to make a mess For the 2008 edition, MotoGP presents some novelties of a certain importance, which concern the game modes available. The career, in particular, has been made much more substantial and interesting, with a ~rewards~ system that unlocks new teams and new categories as races are won and championship points are collected: you must necessarily start from the 125 cc class, with the choice limited to a few teams, and climb the rankings to eventually land in 250 cc and in MotoGP. You can create your own pilot from scratch, customizing his appearance thanks to the numerous helmets available, one more beautiful than the other, and improve his speed, acceleration, etc. characteristics. spending the points earned at the end of each race. This discussion goes beyond the normal set-up adjustment, which before the various sessions allows us to modify the length of the gears, the lean speed in the corners, the stiffness of the suspensions and the rubber compound. It is clear that each of these interventions must be evaluated on the basis of the weather conditions and the characteristics of the track: if it consists mainly of curves, it is better to opt for greater acceleration and stability; if instead it has very long straights, it is the case to push on the final speed to the detriment of the rest. The presence of three distinct classes (precisely 125 cc, 250 cc and MotoGP) constitutes a further element of gameplay variation, given that the bikes have a more or less aggressive behavior depending on the engine size and therefore offer a profoundly different experience, this beyond the choice of the team (which in itself changes the cards on the table). At the beginning of the career we can select the level of difficulty and the number of laps for each circuit, choices that will accompany us for all the seasons that we will compete in the various classes. Outline mode As for the other modes, we have a series of rather classic options: the ~single race~ sees us face a fast race in which we will have to choose the driver, team, class and circuit from those available, while the ~timed race~ is the usual time attack with the presence of a possible ghost bike to beat to improve our lap time. It is obviously possible to try the ~championship~ mode and play an entire season in the engine capacity class that we prefer, going from one race to another and from one session to another just like in reality. Unlike a career, in this case we will have to choose a real rider and refer to his specific characteristics and the bike he rides. Then there are the ~challenges~: there are no less than fifty missions to be completed one after the other, with an ~unlock~ system, which increase the difficulty gradually and which are set as ~scenarios~, i.e. they resume situations that actually occuryou in the 125, 250 and MotoGP championships. We will therefore be asked to take on the role of Valentino Rossi, Daniel Pedrosa, Andrea Dovizioso and many other riders in races that perhaps have seen their exceptional comeback or that are remembered for some particular circumstance. The online multiplayer mode closes the circle, in which we will be able to challenge players from all over the world in single races: we will have the possibility of opting for a quick game, looking for one that matches our requirements (class, driving style, etc. ) or host it for us. Finding challengers isn't difficult, indeed the rooms are quite populated and competitive; however, there are some ~youthful~ problems that are difficult to overlook: there is often an annoying lag that shows us the opponents proceeding jerkily, and there is only one type of competition, without the possibility of organizing tournaments . In short, online is one of the aspects of MotoGP 08 that should be improved (a lot) in view of a possible 2009 edition. On the track! Once we have adjusted the parameters of our bike and selected the riding style, it's time to tackle the track. The free practice and qualifying sessions don't feature any substantial innovations, with classic-type action and a decidedly ~reasoned~ approach: you find yourself alone against the track, with the aim of memorizing its hairpin bends and finding the best trajectories. During these phases it is possible to make all possible experiments with the set-up, to possibly try to improve the lap time: at the ~easy~ level it is enough to maintain a clean driving to give even a few seconds to the adversaries, while at the ~normal~ or ~hard~ you have to commit much more or resign yourself to waiting for the upgrades. As for the actual race, after a rather simplistic start (traffic lights off and go, no frills) one cannot help but notice that our opponents are often very slow in going through the corners, a situation in which we can really build our advantage, while they catch us easily on the straights, where the bike (understood as a team) makes the difference. Unfortunately the level of the AI leaves something to be desired: the other pilots move following predefined patterns, without variations and, above all, without ever making mistakes. The fastest ones are basically fast due to the quality of the vehicle they drive, with few exceptions, and with the same trajectories we will be able to compete with the best only by enhancing the characteristics of the driver or by changing teams. Lastly, it is very strange that the classic ~wake effect~ in MotoGP 08 has been largely overlooked: having or not having a ~fast track~ in terms of aerodynamics, being behind another bike, does not translate into a substantial advantage. Technical realization Among the strengths of the game, we must certainly include the polygonal models of the motorcycles, which are truly extraordinary in detail and fidelity: imagining something better, from this point of view, would be difficult. We have six different views available, three in third person (from different distances) and three in first (one ~back~, one from the cockpit and the other in absolute first person), which can concretely influence the approach to racing: the former allow us to drive quietly and reasoned, with greater control; the latter are more spectacular (the view tilts together with the bike), fast and frenetic, but more difficult to manage with precision. It is possible at any time to look behind, with the pilot actually turning back to check the position of the opponents. The tracks are extremely faithful to their real counterparts, with an excellent realization of the sky (even at night, complete with a full moon and stars) and weather conditions. Moving on to the shortcomings, it must be said that there are uncertainties in the frame rate when there are many bikes on the screen at the same time, and that the various elements surrounding the track (public, pits, various vehicles, structures) are unfortunately static and lacking in particular detail . It should also be added that the crash management is far from spectacular, with the driver reacting in much the same way whether he hits a wall at 300mph or 100mph. The podium awards stages are missing altogether, moreover. The sound sector is essential, with only one ~signed~ song of the punk rock genre for the intro and far from exceptional techno music to accompany us in navigating the menus. In the race there are only effects, in this case the roar of the motorbikes. Comment MotoGP 08 is the best motorcycle racing game for PlayStation 3, although it must be admitted that this also depends on the generalshortage of such titles for the Sony console. The work done by Milestone is good as usual: the gameplay is extremely solid and with few frills, the excellent style selection system allows you to adjust the experience according to your needs and the addition of two engine capacity classes ( for a total of three different championships) only contributes further to the variety of situations. To this we must add the substantial ~challenges~ mode and the online multiplayer, which however suffers from obvious youth problems. From a technical point of view, the graphics do their job in an excellent way (the bikes are extraordinary, the tracks are faithful to the original counterparts, the weather effects work great) but they focus only on the most important things, with little attention paid to the surrounding elements which could also help to improve the visual impact in general. Motorcycle and racing enthusiasts, especially those more oriented towards simulations, will certainly find something for their teeth; with the hope that the 2009 edition can compete, even at a technical level, with the best racers around for the so-called nextgen consoles. Pros Substantial and rich modes Solid gameplay as usual Technically excellent Against AI that can be greatly improved Online multiplayer anything but fluid The side elements should be enhanced", "date": "2008-11-17", "grade": null}
