With the passage of the brand from the hands of the defunct Ascaron to those of Keen Games, some typical mechanics of the series have disappeared and the gameplay has been completely revisited. A full-bodied change was largely predictable given the certainly not striking dimensions of the new development team, but also trying to understand the elimination of the exploratory component, to say the most sensational, we are faced with some difficult to understand choices. With Sacred 3 the famous series created by Ascaron changes developer and direction The right choices? The change to the formula that displaces the most undoubtedly concerns the lack of the drop, the lifeblood of the hack & slash genre. In its place is an automatic equipment evolution system with new weapons and armor unlocking automatically as you progress through the game. To make sense of this choice, the developers have created a weapon specialization process with a series of sub-skills that can be unlocked by spending the gold obtained by playing. And the same formula is used for the skills that become increasingly effective from unlock to unlock while maintaining the original mechanics. But even if the customization of the heroes is there, thanks to a series of passive skills, some of which are obtained by advancing in the game, the lack of the drop is felt and the number of skills is small. But let's go slowly. One key activates the basic attack and the other a chargeable area attack that lowers enemies' defenses and interrupts their actions. The third command corresponds to a parry or a somersault and the last two allow you to launch as many special attacks. Among these we find some that penetrate by hitting numerous enemies in a row and there are those, such as the archer's ice bomb, which are useful for escape. Then there are bursts and powerful single shots, also capable of breaking through the defenses of armored enemies, in addition to the classic spells that produce damage over time. But in the end it is almost always a mere question of damage. The ice slows down and blocks, facilitating things in different situations, but the special abilities cost while the breakthrough is free, it hits an area and interrupts the moves of numerous enemies, becoming the heart of the gameplay for all four heroes. In essence, the evolution of the character does not significantly change the gameplay, always focused on the combination of breakthrough attack and defensive skill, and the lack of loot means that the progression ends with the achievement of the maximum level of the character. It is the situations, in essence, that represent the heart of the experience and luckily for us the levels are well differentiated aesthetically and are characterized by peculiar scenarios such as burning floors, lapilli showers and large end-of-level bosses. Finally there are the arenas, or levels to be completed by defeating a series of waves, and missions with secondary objectives such as saving innocents in danger. Adding to all this the online cooperative (drop-in drop-out) we can count on a few hours of carefree fun, at least until the gameplay begins to show its shortcomings and the enthusiasm inexorably fades away. Strengths, defects and compromises In the absence of a drop system, the only resources obtainable from monsters are gold, useful for buying potions and unlocking advancements, and two types of magic globes that allow us to recover lost vitality and the energy needed to launch special skills . This choice significantly reduces the replayability of the levels but it must be said that the areas to be faced, divided into main and secondary, are numerous as are the mechanics related to the monsters. There are enchanters with area of effect powers, champions with their own abilities, armored enemies, minions galore and bosses of various kinds, all characterized by powerful strikes and massive spells. All represented with a technical content that is certainly not striking but still capable of giving us a good visual result. The variety of textures is remarkable, the large carefully animated mechanisms stand out and there is no shortage of good quality graphic effects especially in the case of spells. On the other hand, what is missing is inspiration with anonymous characters, certainly not imaginative architectures and details of fluctuating quality. The story itself does not offer noteworthy ideas apart from the numerous dialogues with the freed spirits, often eager to show off, which represent the only sparkling element of the narrative component. We can also not survLearn about various technical issues such as dynamic lighting effects that sometimes disappear into thin air or poorly adapted mouse and keyboard controls. That Sacred 3 was made with consoles in mind is no mystery but some choices, such as the somersault that follows the direction of the cursor instead of that of the character, are incomprehensible and greatly compromise playability. Furthermore, the balance has several shortcomings, often placing us in the face of all too simple challenges and then suddenly making us mate with all the resulting frustration. To all this we must then add the lack of a map which, although not particularly useful when playing alone, given the linearity of the levels, would be essential in the cooperative mode to know where the companions are. Basically in the review phase we are forced to confirm what was said of Sacred 3 on the occasion of the test. We are not dealing with a Sacred or even with a hack & slash. We can rather speak of an action with a character evolution system that is not particularly exciting and various choices that are not very understandable. There are some positive elements that highlight the capabilities of the guys at Keen Games, but what we have in our hands is a game that has very little to say.", "date": "2014-08-05", "grade": "6.0"}
