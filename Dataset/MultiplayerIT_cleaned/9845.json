{"name": "La rana dalla bocca larga", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/79601-frogatto-la-rana-dalla-bocca-larga.html", "text": "The revival phenomenon is very widespread in the Apple gaming sector: several important software houses have in fact taken advantage of the success of the iPhone and iPod to re-propose on the AppStore versions more or less faithful to the original of 2D classics of the past, skilfully mixing the nostalgia effect with clever commercial strategies. However, there is another aspect of this phenomenon, which sees independent developers refer to the simplest play structures of the 8 and 16-bit period to launch their own new products: this is undoubtedly the case of Frogatto, the Lost Pixel title inspired by the more strictly old school platform tradition. Half frog and half cat An old-school action game cannot be defined as such if it does not demonstrate a total disinterest in the narrative sector, and Frogatto is no exception: the very slender storyline in fact sees our protagonist (a frog really devoid of great appeal) waking up one morning looking for of a job and find yourself forced to save your city from the dark intentions of the evil Milgram. As usual, this is little more than a pretext to justify the more than 30 levels - divided into four different environments - in which the user is called to jump from one platform to another, eliminate enemies and collect bonuses. The basic action would hardly need descriptions, since it is firmly directed on the classic tracks of the genre: the virtual pad that occupies the lower part of the touchscreen therefore provides a directional cross and only two keys, useful for jumping and exploiting the only weapon in Frogatto's possession, namely his tongue. Like a new Yoshi, our hero can temporarily swallow enemies and then hurl them at other opponents, eliminating two birds with one stone and getting gold coins as a reward. This currency can be spent in a special shop to improve certain characteristics of the character (such as the height of the jumps and the extension of the tongue) and obtain temporary attack bonuses, adding a pinch of RPG elements to the whole. There are also other interesting aspects to give variety and liveliness to the game world: it is therefore possible to talk to various characters and obtain small sub-missions, and there are battles with bosses at the end of the level, which often require the user a minimum of cunning to be defeated. In short, Frogatto applies what is written point by point in the manual of the perfect two-dimensional platform, perhaps not shining for originality and personality but still managing to give a pleasant and all in all rather long-lasting gameplay. The control system - really problematic in the very first release of the game but fortunately then corrected with an update - proves to be sufficiently reliable, except in the (rare) moments in which particularly precise movements are required. Generally speaking, therefore, Frogatto is a platformer decidedly pleasant and well made, also characterized by a technical realization of undoubted value: the sprites are perhaps a little too small and the design is not exactly screaming, but generally the title has a good visual impact, finding its strength in the care small details, whether these are the elements of the backdrop or the animations of the characters.
