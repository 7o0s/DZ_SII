Creative Assembly and its highly successful Total War series have been around for some time, breaking new sales records every year and having hundreds of thousands of loyal fans, but such success is not only due to the successful initial intuition. Certainly the gameplay of the series, that mix of turn-based strategy and real-time tactics that allows you to govern your empire on a political, economic and military level, has represented and still represents a formidable spring for history buffs and deep videogame experiences , but it is above all the ability to renew itself that determines the success of the London team's projects. There have been some missteps but recent developments and the support of an ever-active community have eased the friction and ensured that expectations for the newly released Total War: Rome II were skyrocketing. And on balance we can't help but be satisfied with the result: it suffers from some problems that Creative Assembly had already accustomed us to but it's the most ambitious title of the entire saga and the reasons for playing it far outweigh those for leaving it on the shelves. Not just Rome In 272 BC. Rome is preparing to conquer the boot and then to extend its dominion over the Mediterranean. In those years, however, European balances were in the balance and anyone who had observed the continental map from above would have found it difficult to predict its future: the still flourishing Hellenic world, the barbarian populations to the north and the civilizations of the African coast squeezed what would become the driving force of subsequent eras in an apparently dead-end grip. Different stories and cultures traded, fought and multiplied in a once-in-a-lifetime landscape, which Creative Assembly used to create a gigantic map made up of one hundred and seventy-three conquerable regions. Compared to Shogun II, which based much of its charm on the contained territory and on the detailed challenge, here the feeling of freedom is strong and even a little unsettling at first. Choosing one of the nine civilizations available (Romans, Egyptians, Macedonians, Carthaginians, Pontics, Suebi, Parthians, Iceni and Averni) to which three are added for those who have pre-ordered the game (Athenians, Spartans and Epiri) means not only starting from different geographical positions, but also founding the misfortunes and fortunes of one's work on different cultures. The historical characterization of the period and its protagonists has fully convinced us, thanks to a system of personalized objectives that guides, if desired, the player's actions without imposing anything. And then, above all, through the distinctions made for each civilization, for example in terms of technological trees and therefore possible technical, military and social evolutions. It can be seen that there is a lot of research work and this helps to bring out the historical dynamics of the period naturally, without limiting the player's freedom. In short, having played the good prologue in three acts, all you need to do is select your faction, the level of difficulty and leave; it will take a few turns to be completely absorbed by Total War: Rome II. Rome II takes up and expands on a historic and beloved title: it's not perfect but it convinces Size weighs Although the gaming experience is in fact divided into two, on the one hand the turn-based one focused on managing one's own domain and on the other the real-time one reserved for battles, it is useless to deny that the first is also the one that almost always has decreed the fortunes and (partial) defeats of the series. The substance compared to the previous chapters does not change but Creative Assembly intelligently understood that the dimensions of the new map required some innovations that did not make the control of one's own forces too dispersive. The regions are now grouped into provinces, which thanks to a unified panel allow you to more easily keep the basic statistics of the area under control, also making building management immediate. It's a brilliant choice supported by a great interface, which reduces the time spent navigating between screens but doesn't mortify one's tasks. On the contrary, a harmonious development of cities, thanks to the large quantity of controllable territories, is much more complex than in the past. For example, it happens to lose fundamental territories, perhaps because they are specialized in the production of resources such as food, and to find themselves in difficulty also in other boxes of the same province with the risk of seeing the level of public order drop. So to lose the substantial bonuses associated with it, up tothe outbreak of riots. The management of the armies is also less confusing, above all thanks to the option that allows you to recruit new troops on site, without these having to be set up in city centers and sent to their destination across the map. The advertised presence of military traditions, which assigns permanent statistical values to one's army unrelated to the growth of individual troops and which therefore persists even if they fall in battle, is an interesting but certainly not epochal addition. More substantial, in our view, is the possibility of assigning an ~attitude~ to each team, fortifying a position or preparing an ambush. In short, the micro-management of one's empire was sacrificed, decreasing interactions but at the same time increasing the importance of each click. A direction that manifests the greatest benefits when the territory to keep an eye on reaches a certain size. If the gaming experience on the map has convinced us, also thanks to the many additions that refine a consolidated formula and a splendid visual rendering, it is undeniable that there are at the same time some flaws that manifest themselves in this half of the offer. Internal politics, therefore the delicate balance between the most important families in the case of Rome, provides for options ranging from arranged marriages to murders passing through the attribution of positions to the top military units, but fails to emerge from the status of mere and a bit boring statistic, ending up being more of a nuisance than anything else. A negligible detail, all in all, which can be kept in the background. On the other hand, the shortcomings of artificial intelligence cannot be ignored, predictable and decomposed especially when it has to make up for the player's territorial losses suffered. At times, we get the feeling that the forces around us react to our actions rather than acting on their own, following a well-defined path. This is a problem known to fans of the series, which here compared to Shogun II, especially due to the size of the map and the amount of factions and variables, seems to be accentuated. It is not easy to decide what weight to attribute to these defects: considering the success of the project as a whole, we believe they are balanced and overcome by many points in favor, but it is undeniable that Creative Assembly will have to get to work on corrective patches. The same goes for the graphic optimization, which here rather than on the battlefields in real time seems to lose several shots both in terms of images per second and in terms of unjustified length of uploads in the face of even very advanced hardware. Land and sea Battles return to Total War: Rome II with notable additions. As always, one's forces must be positioned to then maneuver the spectacular representation of a battle with white weapons with thousands of characters on the screen and a visual rendering that here enjoys truly unparalleled textures, lighting and animations. The technological step forward, even compared to the more recent chapters of the series, is important and is further enhanced by the variety of scenarios available. There are dozens and dozens of different maps divided according to the geographical area, the population that dominates them and the type of clash, among which the five capitals Rome, Athens, Carthage, Babylon and Alexandria stand out. To these correspond as many dedicated maps and designed specifically to recreate the most spectacular and memorable sieges of the entire gaming experience. Furthermore, for the first time, land and naval battles come together: it so happens that a battle takes place both on land and by sea, allowing for example the forces that survived the waves to disembark and give a hand to their team engaged in the battle. Also in this case there are some artificial intelligence problems, especially related to boats, but they are not dramatic. We liked the better representation of the line of sight of the soldiers, a novelty that follows on a vastly larger scale what we saw in Company of Heroes 2. Now the player is forced to use the fastest troops as scouts to keep an eye on enemies, make themselves take into account the strengths of others and avoid being taken aback. The number of units designed by Creative Assembly artists, between playable and non-playable civilizations, is impressive and once again underlines the extraordinary content abundance of this chapter. Overall, the single player experience of Total War: Rome II is one to be recommended without too much hesitation. Unfortunately, the scope of the project does not seem to have allowed the best optimization of all aspects of ludici and technical, but it would be short-sighted not to take note of the preponderance of the pros over the cons. When you get tired of playing alone, multiplayer is back. Here the persistent progression of your account, one of the strong points of Shogun, is lost in favor of a much more streamlined selection of modes. In addition to the cooperative campaign and 1 against 1, Creative Assembly has included the classic challenge for up to a maximum of eight players: the overabundance of different maps and factions helps this particular juncture which also enjoys a better matchmaking system to hope to find someone in front of your level. If the Total War: Arena experiment proves to be a success, we believe that the developer's multiplayer efforts can increasingly go in that direction, so if you were looking for who knows what amount of multiplayer options, do your math well.", "date": "2013-09-04", "grade": "8.8"}
