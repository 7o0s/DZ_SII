{"name": "L'ultima speranza dell'umanit", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/134238-xenonauts-lultima-speranza-dellumanita.html", "text": "Xenonauts is set in 1979, the year in which the world is in the midst of the cold war. But suddenly men are forced to put aside all diatribes to unite against a new threat. Deep space has in fact spewed out an army of aliens determined to conquer the Earth by any means possible. The situation, needless to say, is desperate and the only ones who can save the planet are the Xenonauts, an international special corps supported by most of the countries of the world. But the support of nations goes hand in hand with trust and a series of failures could significantly reduce the funds leading to an even more dramatic situation. Before reaching these extremes, however, it is possible to optimize funds and intervention capacity to limit the damage and make enough progress to be able to launch a counterattack. From this point of view, the position of first base is fundamental, the only one that is granted to us for free. The tip of Sicily seems to allow us to cover a good portion of the land and this should allow us to intervene in numerous inhabited areas. However, they remain outside the East and West which will have to be garrisoned with further bases as soon as possible. But first there are more important things to take care of. Initially it is necessary to spend the grants to improve and equip our men in view of the first fights. Furthermore, it soon becomes necessary to equip the main base with defensive weapons, essential for preventing direct attacks, and it is equally important to upgrade the research facilities that allow us to build futuristic weapons that are far more effective than human ones. Finally, it is essential to equip and improve the aircraft that allow us to intercept UFOs, initially small and then increasingly large and powerful, and allow us to transport our troops where a flying saucer has crashed or landed or in a city invaded by a massive alien force. Xenonauts faithfully reproduces the gameplay of X-Com, one of the most loved turn-based strategy games ever A timeless classic The experience, as many will have understood, is practically identical to that of the old X-Com (in Europe UFO: Enemy Unknown) even if we find small changes aimed at making the formula more intuitive. In any case, turn-based combat is still based on the time units that determine how many and what actions each of our soldiers can perform. These include different shooting modes, the movement and use of equipment which includes first aid kits, explosives of various kinds and ever new devices, some of which, such as weapons obtained from extraterrestrial research, derive from alien technology. The gameplay, therefore, also evolves through the equipment, just like in X-Com, and the power of the new weapons does not only alter the damage inflicted on the enemy. Indeed, one of the factors inherited from UFOs is the total destructibility of the environment with each weapon possessing a specific destructive capacity. An alien rocket, for example, can raze an entire floor of a building to the ground, damaging and exposing any hidden enemies with the risk, however, of also injuring any civilian refugees in the building. The same dynamic, among other things, applies to enemies who, regardless of civilians, certainly have no qualms about destroying large portions of the map as soon as they sense the presence of a Xenonaut. It therefore becomes essential to take into account the evolution of both our equipment and that of an enemy who can eliminate an entire team in no time at all. Precisely for this Xenauats allows us to deploy a large number of units that allow us to create a real front of advance and expand the strategic complexity of the experience. Furthermore, each soldier has characteristics that make him more or less resistant both physically and mentally. In fact, it can happen that a soldier resists a wound without too many problems but at the same time gives in to panic or falls under the influence of the enemy's psionic powers. In these cases, various reactions are possible ranging from fleeing, often in the wrong direction, to panic attacks complete with random bursts that can hit our soldiers. It is therefore important to evaluate who to send forward and it is always better, when possible, to choose the best soldiers, keep them alive in order to make them grow from mission to mission, upgrade them with new laboratories and prevent them from remaining without cover. And this can often happen thanks to the artificial intelligence of the enemies which, although not particularly aggressive, a factor that could have made the first games hellish, makes every alien alethal threat. The enemies exploit the map with sadistic skill and maps at night, thanks to an extremely reduced visibility for humans, can often cause nasty surprises. But if nothing else the degree of challenge increases gradually and there are some gameplay choices that have the clear objective of preventing the experience from becoming unbearable. The most obvious of these choices concerns the police and some civilians, whose eventual departure worsens the budget of the missions, who are equipped with weapons and defend themselves by helping us not a little during the demanding city invasions. In addition, jets shot down by aliens do not have to be purchased again and are automatically returned to service after three days. But even with these facilitations it is impossible to protect the entire planet without significantly increasing one's fleet. In fact, as the days go by, the attacks are increasingly numerous and massive, so much so that it is necessary to use more aircraft and more intervention teams at the same time. Furthermore, the use of mechanical means in the field soon becomes essential, which are more resistant than soldiers and, very importantly, are expendable unlike the graduates whose increased skills are vital to counter the most powerful enemies. The student who challenges the teacher Basically, Xenonauts effectively reproposes the X-Com formula while refreshing the experience thanks to a streamlined and understandable interface which, among other things, informs us in advance of the amount of time units a soldier will have after having performed the action selected by us. This is a very important factor given that during the opponent's turn our soldiers can react when an alien enters their field of vision provided, of course, that they have kept enough action points to pull the trigger. In these situations, those who are on the defensive attack first and exploiting this mechanic can be vital enough to be often exploited by the aliens themselves. And it is precisely in these cases that exploding some walls, after directing the attention of our forces in the direction of the explosion, can prove to be fundamental in transforming an enemy ambush into a quick victory. But as we anticipated, a small victory in the field is useless without the research essential to understanding how to defeat aliens, and without the funds that depend on our ability to protect the entire planet. This is not an easy task given that the areas outside the influence of our radars and our attack aircraft are subject to ~alien~ accidents of all kinds. In this case, it is the news of sightings, downed planes and missing ships that indicate which areas are under heavy attack and even if sending an aircraft blindly is practically useless, especially for a question of fuel, the information revealed by the news can be useful clues to decide where to build the next base. Furthermore, this sort of alien news, not present in the X-Com series, gives greater depth to the experience by constantly reminding us that the entire planet is under attack. A factor, the latter, capable of increasing a tension already made palpable by a spot-on soundtrack. But the atmosphere is still quite different from that of the Microprose title. The elements that make up the graphics are more varied, the flying saucers are very well drawn and each map is characterized by peculiar elements, such as the trail left on the ground by a crashed UFO, which effectively contextualize the situation. The greater definition, on the other hand, makes the repetitiveness of the textures evident and the image is certainly more detailed but less soft and enveloping than the splendid pixel art of X-Com. The work done by the developers, however, is commendable. The editor is an invaluable addition to a strategic title with refined mechanics, the interface is excellent, the world map is beautifully done and the encyclopedia, a fundamental narrative component that expands after each discovery or research, respects the Ufopedia both from a visual and content point of view. The aliens, on the other hand, are based on a completely different design and distance themselves from the classic iconography in a similar way to what Firaxis did with the reboot of UFO: Enemy Unknown. And the same goes for weapons and devices that don't refer to period science fiction but reinterpret it in a modern key. The result is a less suggestive title than the muse to which it refers but the clear difference in the aesthetic setting is fundamental as it gives the Goldhawk Interactive title its own identity. In addition, Xenonauts' in-flight combat is decis much more successful than the one seen in X-Com. The realistic radar vision works very well and the clash can include various aircraft, enhancing the possibility of concentrating fire, dodging shots or using afterburners in order to make simultaneous attacks and therefore much more effective.", "date": "2014-07-02", "grade": "8.5"}
