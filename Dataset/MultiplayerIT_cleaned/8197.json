We are therefore a bit embarrassed in front of Pro Evolution Soccer 2013, given that for the second consecutive year we are given a title that essentially does not offer anything different from what we have already seen. The situation is not the same as in FIFA 13 (remember the controversy that arose due to the incredible similarities with FIFA 12?), in the sense that in this case at least the main screen has been changed and some small changes in terms of gameplay can be seen, but ultimately the work done borders on pure recycling and this can only leave us disappointed and embittered. But let's proceed in order. The play offer remains unchanged, so once you start the game you make some choices in terms of customization (player name, nationality, favorite team), after which you can try your hand at a quick game, with the Champions League, with the Copa Libertadores , with the ~style vs. style~ mode or with online multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. And again: you can take on the traditional Master League, compete in a cup or play an entire season, or finally dedicate yourself to the Camino dei Campioni. Never change a winning team Pro Evolution Soccer 2013 includes a tutorial for those unfamiliar with the controls, especially the Playmaker style - the great insight developers Konami had when the series debuted on Wii. This approach sees us manage the team as in a sort of real-time strategy, using the infrared pointer of the Wii-mote to dictate the movements of our teammates and draw effective deep passes while, with the Nunchuk, we manage the selected player and eventually we end up on the net. The artificial intelligence of our team and opponents adapts to the situation, in the sense that the defense shirts widen quite clearly to allow us to carry out the various maneuvers without too many problems. Then there is the Classic style, to be played with the Classic Controller (preferably Pro, given the poor quality of the ~standard~ one), which refers to the layout and feeling of the traditional PES, which for many years has dominated any competitor on PlayStation 2. In this case the backbones of the pad activate the run, the change of player and the ~tricks~, while the main buttons are assigned to the shot, the filtered pass, the cross and the normal pass. The presence of a ~fatigue~ bar realistically places a limit on the use of the sprint and pushes us to and make changes to field fresher people, a factor that has always positively characterized the Konami franchise together with the icon that describes the current athletic condition of the player. Cross and delight Precisely by using the Classic style we have noticed that certain actions are completed more easily, we score without too many problems and even on remittances our team most of the time checks on the opponents, which translates into an average lowering of the difficulty. However, there are also blunders in this edition, with teammates and opponents who sometimes find the ball a meter away but don't move to conquer it. There are also some problems with the interface, which for some situations necessarily requires the use of the Wii-mote instead of the Classic Controller, such as when making a change or having to confirm a selection. This turns out to be quite inconvenient. Among the various modes available, identical as mentioned to those of past editions, the Cammino dei Campioni undoubtedly stands out. The reason is obvious: starting from a Master League-style structure, this mode sees us select a team with a very limited squad, then play a series of competitions to get not only an upgrade of the players who have distinguished themselves most during the matches, but also new elements to add to the formation, ~drawing~ the card at the end of each session. Finally, as regards the technical sector, there is very little to say: we have not noticed any differences compared to PES 2012, so if there are any, they are really marginal elements, both in terms of graphics and sound. The polygonal models are very similar to their real counterparts and the animations are well made, but there is a certain ~aliasing~ effect and, obviously, ~aesthetic~ innovations such as the Player ID are missing.", "date": "2012-11-09", "grade": "8.9"}
