The original survival horror matrix has undergone countless mutations over the years, just like a T-Virus, acquiring an increasingly action-packed identity. However, Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City is a particular experiment, it is a spin-off, therefore an episode that differs from the rules and conventions - if they still exist - of the series, emphasizing the mechanics of teamwork. As if to reinforce the concept of a different interpretation rather than a sequel, it was decided to set everything in the famous city of the second chapter, precisely during the events following the zombie outbreak. The unexpected peculiarity is that of making the adventure live from the point of view of the Umbrella agents, engaged in the cancellation of any compromising evidence for the company. A tantalizing idea, which however has fueled some doubts about the effectiveness of being able to capture the spirit of the series, especially due to the fact that the jobs have been assigned to the Canadians Slant Six Games. Capcom as you know is currently busy on the highly anticipated sixth episode, thus limiting itself to supervising the project. Ugly dirty and bad Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City immediately breaks a not indifferent taboo of the series, that of loneliness and the condition of inferiority, since from the beginning we find ourselves with a team of four elements, the U.S.S. Squad, highly trained and heavily armed. The choice is suggested by the co-op setting to tackle the online campaign with friends, however the awareness of commanding an entire team offers a profoundly different experience from those we were used to. In addition to this we are dealing with a vaguely RPG structure, with six classes capable of acquiring and enhancing specific skills during the game thanks to the experience points accumulated. If everyone is able to use firearms and melee attacks, the demolition specialist enjoys placing lethal bombs, the infiltration specialist acquires the ability to make himself invisible or see through walls, while the most original remains the scientist who , thanks to a special gun, is able to tame enemies. Skills and classes are decided before each mission, in a special briefing screen that effectively replaces virtual shops. Here we can also decide which of the two weapons to take with us and check the points obtained by the team. One of our fears was represented by the characterization of the team, which seemed at first glance rather impersonal, but we must admit that a good job has been done: characters such as the beefy Beltway immediately won our sympathy. But the surprises don't end there. Civil war The main campaign unfolds through seven chapters that see the U.S.S. Squad cross Raccoon City to clean up the clues in the locations already seen in Residet Evil 2 and 3. These include the hospital, the church, the police station and the Umbrella laboratory, where we meet Dr. William Birkin just before turning into a terrible B.O.W., the biological weapons that we all know well. The setting is still in the third person, but the dynamics undergo a heavy turn towards the shooter, mainly due to the special forces intervened to clean up. Their presence serves as a pretext for a long series of firefights where the exploitation of the covers is necessary and this brings the title closer to the canons of the genre, needless to say sublimated by the Gears Of War saga. The developers have taken a lot from the Epic title, including the race complete with a shaky camera, on the other hand the evasive moves have been kept to a minimum. So forget about furious somersaults or circus acts, RE:ORC is still a squad shooter, even if to make the most of this feature it is better to face it in the company of friends. Anyone can enter the campaign, engaging one of the three slots available for allies, otherwise the artificial intelligence takes care of it, however with mixed results. In our sessions we almost never saw the peculiar potentials exploited for a strategic approach, excluding the most basic actions such as the use of healing sprays. The level design adapts in some way to the war context, completely eliminating the presence of complex puzzles or maps, but almost always favoring large spaces in which to move with a certain freedom. The SOCOM team tries not to get caught thereby hand and forget the weight of the brand, thanks to a series of tricks such as the relaxation phases (where you take a breather with investigations and assorted tasks), and a certain fan service, with the exploitation of locations, situations and familiar faces. In the process the survival horror effect has been completely lost, so don't expect to jump on your chair like the first, unforgettable episodes. You again In addition to the aforementioned Birkin, we find Nicholai Ginovaef, engaged on a mission with the UBCS Delta group, Ada Wong, Hunk and obviously Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield, with some unexpected background. We even have the possibility of hindering the operations of our heroes, a gimmick in the end not as effective as Capcom had subtly advertised. On the other hand, the roster of enemies revealed to be extensive, recovered from the old chapters, from the Lickers to the lethal Hunters, the schizophrenic Crimson Heads and above all the Tyrant Nemesis and Number 103. The first in particular will be the protagonist of a dedicated DLC, and it is undoubtedly amusing to work towards its activation as real villains would do, but we don't want to spoil the surprise further. Another element introduced is the possibility of getting infected: if we don't recover a special antidote within a time limit we risk joining the horde of undead, even worse attacking our own companions (who will cut us down mercilessly). For this reason, the inventory has been completely eliminated, replaced by a comfortable real-time interface, with grenades, objects and antidotes assigned to the directional keys of the pad. Unfortunately, the single campaign turns out to be rather short, with a duration of no more than six hours and a hasty and subdued closure, alone it is also too diminished by the flatness of the CPU and is unable to express its potential. Technically we are faced with an acceptable but not exceptional job, far from the results obtained by Capcom and its proprietary engines, with too many slowdowns and some video dirt. However Slant Six Games has managed to give the characters a decent polygonal load, also adding some shaders to emphasize the environments, an effect helped by the almost total darkness. The quantity of enemies on the screen is particularly commendable: between special forces, zombie assaults and groups of leaping Hunters it is often difficult even to understand where to move, and the elaborate hit box allows you to wipe out limbs and heads, with a Romerian splatter effect . Too bad that the rough artificial intelligence leads to unintentionally comical situations. The game is fully dubbed in Italian, with a good overall quality. Xbox 360 goals Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City presents the canonical 1000 player points, divided over 50 objectives. By finishing the single player campaign we managed to win only 260, a sign that to bring home the rest you will have to invest a considerable amount of time in online multiplayer. Among the most challenging we certainly have the one that requires the completion of each mission on a Veteran with an S + grade, or complete 98 Versus games. Good luck! The online mode As announced, there is a series of online multiplayer modes, all collected under the heading Versus. The first is a battle between two teams of four players on a series of maps overrun by an increasing number of monsters. The SPEC OPS Team is introduced for the occasion, a militia commissioned by the government to counter the actions of the USS. This is indeed one of the biggest surprises from Capcom, and the characterization of the characters suggests further developments which will predictably express themselves in the form of DLCs. The second mode is the Biohazard Mode, in honor of the original Japanese title of the saga, it is the typical game on the Capture the Flag model, although in this case we are talking about the recovery of special vials containing G-Virus scattered around the map, the first team that manages to recover five of them wins the game. Survivors moves the action to the Raccoon City hospital, where we have 7 minutes to reach the roof to be recovered by a helicopter. The limited seating problem means that someone will have to be stranded presumably dead. Closes one of the most heralded modes, the Heroes mode, where we find some of the key figures of the series gathered against the Umbrella agents, among the guests at the party there are obviously Jill Valentine and Carlos Oliveira. The special abilities remain unchanged, such as the pheromone lure, a blow that attracts enemies towards the victim who receives it. The most interesting aspect is the acquisition of experience points, totally shared with the campaignna single and fully interchangeable between the two modes.", "date": "2012-03-22", "grade": "7.5"}
