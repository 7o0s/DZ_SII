{"name": "Creaks", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/creaks-la-recensione.html", "text": "Creaks' review confirms at least a couple of things: on the one hand the fact that Amanita Design undoubtedly has a magical touch that makes all the projects it completes interesting, on the other the certainty that Apple Arcade is clearly back on track, bringing above the average quality level of the new introductions between Beyond a Steel Sky and this new title. Creaks takes up the drawn graphic style, typical of the team's productions, however moving it towards stranger and darker atmospheres. It arises from the sense of disquiet that sometimes emerges from apparently more peaceful and everyday situations: those strange images that form in the semi-darkness, just out of the field of vision, like optical illusions that disappear when a more careful vision puts everything back in the right perspective. There is a name that identifies this phenomenon: ~pareidolia~, it indicates the tendency of the human brain to see images or reconstruct figures based on more or less unconscious patterns, giving a different and specific characterization to objects or simple random lines. In Creaks these optical illusions find their way to break into the reality of the poor protagonist of the story, becoming obsessive and threatening presences from which to escape. It all stems from an apparently banal situation, which in a few seconds transcends into the strangest and most disturbing surreal: a light bulb that breaks, insistent noises and a tear in the wallpaper of a normal room open the door to an absurd world, where distorted become true under the cover of darkness. The premise takes us back to twilight atmospheres that we have seen in fantastic stories, between Gaiman and Hoffmann, embellished with a handcrafted but extremely detailed graphic trait, which gives a very strong identity to the whole gaming experience. We are in a territory that is close to, but substantially different from, compared to the other graphic adventures by Amanita Design, which in this case abandons the hunt for pixels and the interaction between characters and objects to introduce more properly puzzle game mechanisms, with the need to maintain remarkable timing and precision to survive, because it is also the first game of the etiquette in question to propose a sense of constant threat that can lead to repeated virtual deaths. The world inside the wall Creaks closely resembles the gameplay and tension typical of Playdead games such as Limbo and Inside, constantly proposing puzzles to be tackled in order to advance in the strange world that the protagonist discovers behind the wall of his room. The narration is hermetic, devoid of dialogues and written text, but we understand that something is threatening the alternate world and our mission is both to try to return home in one piece and to stop this imminent danger, because it also risks invading everyday reality . The protagonist moves between platforms and stairs within various decadent environments, interacting with switches and mechanisms of various types and above all trying to avoid the strange creatures that roam nearby. As it soon turns out, these creatures are the real projection of the optical illusions experienced by pareidolia, because once they are invested in light they go back to being the simple everyday objects they actually resemble, with a rather funny effect. The fact that enemies become inanimate objects when invested with light determines the basis of the puzzle design, which is played largely on the contrast between light and shadow: switches, pressure sensors and other mechanisms allow you to turn on precious cones of light that can block the pre-set path of the enemies or transform them into objects that can be moved and used thanks to their weight (by placing them above the switches) or as support points to reach elevated areas. The levels are designed in a very brilliant way around these basic principles, which become progressively more complicated with the inclusion of different creatures, characterized by different and increasingly complex behavior patterns, but the construction of the puzzles revolves around the idea of contrast between light and shadow. The puzzles are generally very well structured and quite challenging, with the levels tending to propose quite different situations, but in principle the main concepts around which the puzzles revolve are always the same, which can tend to make them monotonous at times. long go. In short, we are quite far from the variegated and changing construction of the puzzle design of a Braid, to mention another game that can come to mind when tackling the levels of Creaks, but the introduction of always new elements, even if marginal, succeedshowever to keep the interest high until the end, also considering that the game does not last very long. Unmistakable style We have already talked about it, but it is worth going back to the aesthetic aspect of Creaks for a moment, to reiterate how Amanita Design is able to build worlds with a truly exceptional charisma. A recent example always on Apple Arcade is the excellent Pilgrims and we find further confirmation of this in this new title, which adopts a graphic style that is even more impactful if possible, increasing the evocative effect of the ~hand~ drawing, with a stroke which could be defined as expressionist. Obviously the similarities with previous productions such as Samorost and Machinarium are noted, but Creaks introduces a dark note for the first time, in a precarious balance between the dreamlike and the grotesque with a disturbing tone. There is a remarkable care even in small details: each scenario is different and meticulously detailed, the animations are complex and harmonious, which also emerges in the short cutscenes which underline the passage from one level to another, silently narrating the strange story, in short, what is revealed on the screen is a real show of dotted and animated drawings with great skill. The paintings to be discovered around the scenarios also contribute to enriching the strange world staged: these are in themselves bizarre and fascinating original pictorial works, which sometimes hide inside them real mini-games that make it all the more eccentric. All this is accompanied by a rarefied soundtrack that perfectly presses the game action. There is a remarkable study of sound design in Creaks, from the sound effects that increase the tension and underline the atmosphere between the lugubrious and the fairytale to the musical breaks, which often combine to underline the construction of the puzzles emerging with greater force once we are getting closer to the solution.", "date": "2020-07-16", "grade": "8.6"}
