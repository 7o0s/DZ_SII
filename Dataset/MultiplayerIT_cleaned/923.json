{"name": "Pariah", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pariah.html", "text": "The first introductory cut-scenes are intriguing. We play a cynical doctor with the responsibility of escorting a woman infected with a deadly virus, but once shot down in the middle of nowhere by an army of fleeing convicts, we find ourselves infected and forced to save both the world and ourselves. The first discordant note however concerns the movies: in order to be able to add blur and bloom effects - or to speed up loading on the console ... - they are indeed made with the game engine, but pre-rendered, and moreover in low resolution, a legacy of the Xbox version. Although the final effect is perfectly acceptable on the Microsoft platform, in late 2005 you shouldn't see such grainy and confused movies on PC. Unfortunately, even the tension and expectation aroused by the initial sequence are quickly diluted in the subsequent firefights, only to never again manifest themselves in the continuation of a plot that is not very consistent and told in a fragmentary way. of his cards on the narrative experience, introducing well-characterized characters, at least on paper, but letting them move apparently without a guide along anonymous levels and without specific indications on the progress that is being made in unveiling the alleged mysteries that form the basis of the plot itself. All we know is our name, the fact that enemies are shooting at us and that we must force our way through linear levels where the only indication of which direction to take is the fact that there is only one. In short, Pariah does not explain himself, and given the considerable brevity of the game, you will find yourself in the presence of the final boss almost suddenly, practically without having understood the reason. Certainly not a work worthy of the Digital Extremes signature (Unreal was of a completely different narrative thickness) although the game is actually the result of the work of the lesser known Groove Games. From a gameplay point of view, Pariah definitely has something more to say, although much is not exactly his own. In fact, the ~quotes~ to Halo are prevalent and by observing the functioning of the energy bar and the type of vehicles and open spaces in which the action takes place, one cannot fail to detect a certain feeling of deja-vu. A general lack of originality that does not prevent Pariah from turning out to be, overall, a good level FPS, with some innovative features of considerable potential which, if better expressed, would have made it more attractive. In the first place, the weapon improvement system: each one proves to be useful in some way, and this is a great asset, but once you have decided to introduce the modules for their upgrade, you can perceive the anxiety of having to find more ways to change them all. Many modifications turn out to be perfectly useless even when you are lucky enough to understand what they are for (some explanatory text would have helped) while others make the weapons themselves something like a tool worthy of the Apocalypse. The best upgrade is undoubtedly the one for the grenade launcher, which inserts a remote detonator in full Duke Nukem 3D style and will give you more than a few moments of healthy fun. Too bad that once you have earned the sniper rifle, you will hardly use anything else, given that - like Far Cry - the abundance of open spaces favors its use and abuse. In fact, as in the case of the Ubisoft title, the artificial intelligence routines, which, although they require a minimum of tactics during traditional firefights, do not let themselves be in the least broken by the sight of a colleague's head blown to pieces by a bullet. Large portions of the game can be overcome simply by targeting dazed soldiers from a distance who won't stand up or defend themselves as long as we stay at a safe distance. The vehicles add some spice, mainly thanks to the physics engine that makes driving them more fun and challenging than their actual usefulness. Whether it had been real vehicles or simply a significant armor bonus that would allow us to withstand more blows, it wouldn't have made much difference in terms of completing the levels, but running around on a nervous four-wheeler is pleasant and makes it all more interesting. Technically Pariah performs just fine, with clean graphics and detailed textures, although the color palette used is at least as monotonous as the reproduced settings. The futuristic design is very reminiscent of the Halo settings (for a change) with hilly landscapes dotted with bunkers and small similar buildings. For hereWhile the number of polygons used for non-impression maps (rocks like buildings appear a bit cubed), the excellent character models more than compensate. The Havok physics engine is well implemented even if more for aesthetic than functional applications, beyond the aforementioned use of vehicles. The effects of explosions aren't particularly convincing, but the satisfaction of blowing up enemies like puppets isn't negligible, as is the ability to tear down their shelters, from concrete columns to bulletproof panels on the walls. Comment Pariah is half a disappointment. From a concept with original ideas and a plot with potential (the whole thing about the virus and the contagion is very disturbing at the beginning) a product is born that is not incomplete, but not very detailed in many aspects that should characterize a good FPS. Despite the assumptions, the plot ends up disappearing among the anonymous shootouts with enemies with no personality, and the fights themselves struggle to be interesting despite the weapon modification system. Over everything then hovers the shadow of Halo, unfortunately chosen as a model, as if the copy fails to get close to the original, it only belittles itself. Fortunately, a good level of graphics and sound are involved to improve the fortunes of the game (even the Italian dubbing stands out for its excellent quality). A note of merit also for the original level editor, which on PC as on console, allows you to create discrete ready-to-use maps in a few moments. A ~fast food~ style version of traditional modding, perhaps not very justified on a platform like the PC, but with its own functionality, consistent with the ~user friendly~ perspective that permeates the entire product. Pros Technically good Sound and voice acting excellent Fun and functional editor Cons Trivial and fragmented plot Monotonous environments Trite gameplay: poor and misdirected innovation Pariah has generated a considerable hype around itself since 2004, promoting itself as a modern shooter that combines the tradition of the genre on PC with the experience accumulated over the years on consoles. You don't need a trained eye to recognize the clear intention of referring back to Halo in defining multiple aspects of the game, from the settings to the gameplay, up to the use of vehicles and the attempt at a cinematic plot. Let's try to understand if the Bungie Studios lesson has been assimilated and reworked properly.", "date": "2005-06-06", "grade": null}
