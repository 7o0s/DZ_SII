{"name": "Cloning Clyde - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cloning-clyde-recensione.html", "text": "Escape from genetics! Clyde, dressed in a simple coat, which shows his back every time he climbs a ladder, must reach the end of each stage after destroying all the surveillance machines scattered in the most improbable places. To do this, he has at his disposal a series of karate blows, which can be combined with the jump, and a good number of transformations which he can perform with special machines, mixing his DNA with that of some unfortunate animals found in the various settings. Clyde can thus become a sheep man, frog, monkey, rather than a walking barrel of dynamite, each with its own peculiar characteristics that allow him to swim underwater, make longer jumps or climb walls. The levels have a really well-calibrated difficulty and learning the different skills takes place in a very simple way, making Clyde a real pastime that can be tackled by anyone. Death has no consequences, and once you understand how to solve the simple puzzles scattered here and there, there is only the incentive to replay the levels to find all the secrets and achieve all the objectives. In order to unlock all the stages, however, you must be able to evade all the clones created during the game. The problem is that you can only control one at a time and on several occasions you find yourself forced to diligently let dozens of characters out of the special loophole, with a slowdown in the flow of action that could easily have been avoided. Clyde can thus become a man sheep, frog, monkey, rather than a walking barrel of dynamite, each with its own peculiar characteristics Besides the single player mode, Cloning Clyde also has two multiplayer modes. In addition to the ability to play cooperatively with another player, there are several arenas for Versus, and both can be played both in split screen and via Xbox Live. The problem, however, with all of these is that they are a bit chaotic and that they will be able to make many players give up trying to dedicate some time to them. Unlike other games released on Live in this period, in fact, they do not seem to enjoy great popularity among online players, testifying to a game that seems to have been designed primarily for the single player campaign. A little cartoon Cloning Clyde, in its simplicity, manages to perfectly convey that feeling of an interactive cartoon that many platformers try in vain to achieve. The great fluidity, given to the well-modeled polygons on the screen, helps to give a nice touch of vitality to all the animations of the protagonist, and in all its mutations. Seeing him transform into a sheep, frog or dynamite man produces hilarious effects, especially as each change effectively underlines all the different game mechanics. Finally, the sound effects help to complete a fun picture with a good personality with captivating simplicity: games with this style are not often seen and Cloning Clyde is an excellent diversion among the many Fps and titles populated by trolls, ogres, drug dealers and schizophrenic criminals. Goals Like all Live Arcade games, Cloning Clyde can only earn 200 points, unlike the usual 1000. Many of these, however, are easily conquered, since they are linked to the protagonist's mutations from the very first levels. Taking them all takes time, but from the very first games there is something to feel gratified about. Comment Microsoft console owners have never been very lucky with platformers, which have always been in short supply since the days of the last generation of hardware. Cloning Clyde is a simple game, but very fun, full of good intentions and some original ideas that all try to fill this gap. The controls are intuitive, the difficulty is well calibrated and the stages follow one another without insurmountable obstacles for a perfect game to fill the evenings when returning from the sea or to entertain those who, returning from the office, want to have fun without too many thoughts. Some shortcomings distance it from the bliss of perfectly successful small games, but between the great playability, the excellent technical realization and the irony that pervades it, there is enough to recognize it as one of the best Live Arcade titles. Pros: Really nice graphics Original and fun Perfect for Live Arcade Cons: Too many clones to command A bit confusing multiplayer modes One wondered why Microsoft hadn't released much more on the Live Arcade after the first big batch of titles to coincide with the launch of the Xbox 360. The answer is probably in this August a little tired and por releases in video game stores, which has seen a handful of titles flooding the Marketplace to keep players busy in anticipation of next fall. After the legendary Street Fighter 2 it's the turn of Cloning Clyde, developed by the same authors of Outpost Kaloki, a crazy managerial game, one of the most popular of the first games published on the Live Arcade platform. The protagonist of the new Ninja Bee is a kind of digital Homer Simpson, who undergoes genetic cloning experiments to scrape together some money. The result is obviously comical, with our poor unfortunate hero found duplicated in dozens of copies in the offices of a multinational company. For those who want to platform, a fugitive genre on Xbox 360, Cloning Clyde is certainly an excellent choice, both for its quality and for the price.", "date": "2006-08-18", "grade": null}
