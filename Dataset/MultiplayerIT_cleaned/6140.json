This is not a figure of speech: the inhabitants have literally disappeared into thin air following a mysterious event, and in Everybody's Gone to the Rapture our task will be to explore the scenario, locate clues and read the ~luminous trace~ of the people who once inhabited that place. Following these testimonies, from the point of view of six different protagonists, we will be able to reconstruct the events of the plot and understand what really happened, starting from a series of hypotheses to finally arrive at our conclusions, after about five hours of a strongly characterized campaign by two elements: the atmosphere and the narration, both rendered excellently. Everybody's Gone to the Rapture is an extraordinary interactive tale, but it lacks the gameplay Nobody's story Silent witnesses of the tragic event, in the game we will not have precise geographical references except the maps that we will be able to consult from time to time, scattered here and there within the locations, for the use and consumption of tourists and civil protection workers. To guide our steps, however, there will be a mysterious luminous cursor which, hovering near certain buildings, will practically show us the places to visit in order to come across the ~shadows~ of the inhabitants of Yaughton and gradually discover the dynamics that governed the village life. Once in front of these ~hot spots~, we will have to tilt the controller up to ~tune in~ with the frequency of a dialogue that took place on the spot; or turn on the radios that we will find around or answer the phones that ring to capture further memories. We will thus meet Dr. Stephen Appleton and his wife Katherine: the first had returned to the city for a few weeks, arousing the curiosity of his acquaintances towards his American companion, dedicated to important scientific research. Research carried out using the equipment of the VALIS observatory, the latter citing which will make sci-fi literature enthusiasts understand what the game's references are; but we could also bring up the controversial film dedicated to ~Howard the Duck~, as well as ~The Day Came~ by M. Night Shyamalan, as well as ~The Lovely Bones~ by Peter Jackson. Stephen and Katherine, we said, conducted the experiment from which it all seems to have begun, opening a door that they shouldn't have opened and then trying to run for cover in some way. However, these are not the only people we will get to know, because there will also be others, many ties and plots to discover between dislikes, betrayals and hidden feelings, always following the path of an indirect narration, which leaves the user the task of understanding what happened, when and why; outlining the characters in a sometimes essential but effective way, thanks to an excellent dubbing also in Italian, a choice of fundamental importance by Sony. Leaving the dialogues in English or falling back on a less brilliant localization would in fact have impoverished the experience to the point of making it almost irrelevant. Walking In further support of the narrative component, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture boasts a soundtrack of extraordinary quality, cinematic level, which manages to excite on more than one occasion and emphasize moments and sequences that otherwise would have had a lower specific weight. The interweaving of music and images is particularly well studied in the game, which can undoubtedly count on a wise direction, which leaves nothing to chance and tries to cage the playful part as a result, but we'll get to that later. In fact, it must be emphasized that the product of The Chinese Room constitutes an excellent test of versatility for the CryEngine, considering the variety of landscapes and situations that we will be able to observe throughout history. The lighting system is the great protagonist, while walking among houses and tree-lined avenues, trying to follow the road signs and those strange signs on the maps to take a ~long ride~ and thus overcome the roadblocks set up by the police forces in the moment in which the news of an epidemic to be stemmed has spread. Excellent lights, therefore, but also an excellent texture system, capable of always avoiding the repetition of surfaces as well as the appearance of low-definition textures. There is some repetition only in the presence of the vehicles, in particular the red car, but it is a completely plausible detail in that context. The day-night cycle proves invarious occasions of its dynamism, through time-lapse effects also inserted to support the narration, and therefore we find ourselves shooting at different times of the day. Finally, in the final stages we see the unleashing of the elements, with rain and lightning effectively refracting off surfaces, creating visually compelling pools of water. Playstation 4 trophies There are nineteen Trophies present in Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, and they are clearly linked to the actions that we can perform with a view to exploring the scenario. Finding all the graffiti on the walls, reading all the maps around, playing with a toy train and using all the paths between one area and another allow you to unlock most of the achievements. We absolutely invite you not to consult the Trophies list to avoid a huge spoiler. No one is Alone An excellent proof of versatility for the CryEngine, we said, but as far as performance is concerned, things are different. The feeling is that the graphics engine is struggling, despite the very low speed of movement of the camera, and the frame rate is obviously affected, whose thirty frames per second appear highly inconstant and subject to declines. We must also add that, however accurate, the experience cleverly glosses over a whole series of elements that could have constituted a further challenge in terms of technical realization, in this case there is no character that is not represented by simple luminous particles, nor some elements have been included which, however, we do not believe it is appropriate to talk about in the review phase: the spoiler risk is very high and a detail would be enough to reveal too much of the story. Having said that, the problems of Everybody's Gone to the Rapture certainly do not lie in the technical realization, perfectly adequate to the experience that The Chinese Room intended to package, but in the severely limited gameplay. In the introduction we talked about ~interactive storytelling~ not surprisingly, because the interaction in the game is reduced to a minimum and the freedom to move within the scenario collides with an abundance of closed doors, impassable fences and invisible walls . The slowness of the movements, which slow down further when you are near an ~interesting~ place, is too often heavy to digest, especially when you have to cross large open spaces and it seems that the road never ends. Inserting the possibility of running, even for short stretches, would certainly have limited the boredom of so many sequences and the frustration of having taken the wrong path and having found ourselves back at the starting point (which can happen, not having a map always available) . We immediately had the suspicion that the reduced movement speed was an expedient to artificially increase the duration of the adventure, and we had confirmation of this within a few hours. However, we think that the majority of users will hardly let go (ah, ah, ah) on this aspect, and that a patch will be clamored for to at least increase the speed of movement on long journeys. (Side note: in reality, in the game it is possible to run by holding down the R2 back button for a long time, only that apparently the developers forgot to communicate this. The function is in fact not indicated in the layout of the commands from the options menu and it seems is mentioned only and exclusively in the online manual of the game.) In short, the developers have placed clear constraints, imposing to live the experience as they designed it: it is a completely legitimate choice, but which necessarily had to be enriched with Things to do. There is no puzzle solving in Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, there are no tasks to complete that go beyond finding light trails and witnessing dialogues. It's all too passive, and although there are disturbing traits in exploring empty houses, you never take advantage of the opportunity for a twist, a leap from your chair.", "date": "2015-08-10", "grade": "7.0"}
