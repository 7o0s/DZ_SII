Certainly, over the years there have been examples of value such as Kingdom Rush, the Anomaly series, Revenge of the Titans or Orcs Must Die but to really break into the hearts of players lately only Bloons TD 6 has probably succeeded, driven, like it often happens in these cases, from an explosion of notoriety due to influencers and streamers who have dedicated themselves to it constantly for a few weeks. Dungeon Defenders: Awakened, this time our heroes will be five In this rather desolate panorama, if compared to much more prolific genres, Dungeon Defenders easily entered which, strong in cartoon graphics and simple mechanics, was the first to have the idea of putting cooperation between players as the basis for the development of the entire gaming experience. It was 2011, however, and more than ten years after its first appearance, today we return to talk about it again to celebrate the arrival of its third chapter on consoles, twelve months after its landing on Steam, but ready to be forgiven with new and updated content. Will it be worth the wait? Let's find out in our review of Dungeon Defenders: Awakened. Still gameplay If you have a winning formula, you don't necessarily have to change or twist it to continue to be successful. A few small touches of the chisel on one side, a new paint job, some new special effects and here, as if by magic, the third iteration of your flagship series is ready to shine again. This at least in the world of dreams, given that the market, now bulimic, is hungry and longing for novelty, for curated and fresh experiences that remove that aftertaste already savored by a brand new video game, even if paid for at a budget price. Let's understand, we certainly didn't expect a total upheaval, with the risk of ending up upside down as happened with Torchlight III, but at least we would have liked to see a pinch of further commitment to justify this third chapter, especially after Dungeon Defenders II and the free to play model, the series had practically already fired all of its latest cartridges. Instead, when you start playing Dungeon Defenders: Awakened you immediately realize that the production seems to go with the handbrake on: the story is not as brilliant or funny as in the past and even the four characters, in the guise of Monk, Wizard, Huntress and Warrior, they bring essentially nothing new as a dowry, in short, nothing that manages to rekindle the spark and instill in the player the will to commit to defending the magic crystals again from the continuous assault of hordes of orcs and angry monsters. Dungeon Defenders: Awakened, the Hero deck is directly inherited from Dungeon Defenders II Furthermore, unlike the PC version, the game mechanics on consoles are slowed down and decidedly less fluid, with control managed by the rather cumbersome pad, even for those used to playing regularly on consoles. We can safely say that this third chapter is a centrifuge of the first two from which the best ideas are taken, in short, interesting for those who are new to this episode but not for those who have already spent hours and hours on the previous ones. In fact, of the twenty maps available, more than half are weighted contents with some small reinterpretation from the original Dungeon Defenders and also the models of the enemies and their abilities reappear almost unchanged. The difference compared to the first chapter is therefore found in the deck of heroes, borrowed from Dungeon Defenders II, thanks to which you can quickly change characters during the set up phases and which will allow you to grow all four champions chosen 'unison, replacing equipment and enhancing skills through a simple system of talent points. The addition of the fifth hero, a futuristic android armed with lasers, however, breaks this idyll, with the interface and the game structure calibrated precisely on only four heroes, thus complicating the switch. If the gameplay is linear and without noteworthy flashes, leveraging the classic campaign and the Rift mode to give depth to the end game, with waves of stronger enemies and with new skills, a technical sector takes care of further showing the side unable to render well on console. Let's start from the chosen color palette, extremely different from the first chapters with even brighter colors that end up creating only confusion when multiple units mix on the screen. Just the behavior of the enemies is then unsatisfactory and it often happens to find them stucki around corners, with a choice to greatly reduce the frame of the animations on the distance during the most agitated moments for a final result that is really not very pleasant to see. Unfortunately, these are frequent situations and it is a compromise that we just could not digest, having fewer enemies but more cared for, in terms of animations and behavior, would most likely have been the ideal choice.
