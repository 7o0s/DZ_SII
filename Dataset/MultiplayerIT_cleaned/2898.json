{"name": "13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/13-sentinels-aegis-rim-recensione.html", "text": "In the last preview we limited ourselves to discovering the surface of the new video game developed by Vanillaware that mixes the strong emphasis on storytelling with unexpected strategic gameplay with a top-down view. Too little to perhaps be able to enhance and intrigue those who don't know the authors well and don't know what to expect from them. Having reached the end of the adventure, however, we realized that even the most experienced will be surprised by how much George Kamitani has managed to pull out of the hat this time: first of all, they distance themselves from the traditional fantasy setting that has always distinguished Vanillaware's works , while maintaining that artistic style that even in its excesses (here to be honest not present, or at least not at the levels of Dragon's Crown) leaves you speechless. Having deviated towards a sci-fi approach has allowed Kamitani to indulge in mad joy, setting up a plot that has nothing to envy to Dark with its time jumps and seasoning it, at the same time, with a playful counterpart that draws liberally from 'eternal struggle between the kaij and the mecha destined to prevent or slow down their invasion of the Earth. Leaning on these two aspects, which travel on parallel but essential tracks, the review of 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim talks about a game that presents itself as an immersive and wonderful experience, much more rooted in the concept of visual novel but able to offer, to anyone who knows how to go beyond certain aspects, a story that will not fail to surprise you until its epilogue. War of the Worlds It is difficult to talk about the plot of 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, not only for a matter of spoilers but because just rethinking the amount of information that bombards us with surgical precision over the course of at least thirty hours of play is stunning. We are facing one of those stories that cannot be told, you have to experience it firsthand both to understand its emotional intensity and all the various winks at the topical topics of the sci-fi genre, and to understand the common thread of per se: going back to the aforementioned Dark, it is as if a friend of yours does not want to see the series and asks you to explain it to him. You could try but you'd find yourself in no time like Charlie in It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, hallucinating in front of a bulletin board full of red threads while the friend in question regrets having made that request. We are talking about George Kamitani, on the other hand, as eclectic and visionary as he is obsessed with food within his productions - yes, he is present here too. All we can tell you about the story is that it is distributed along five timelines (1940, 1980, 2020, 2060 and 2100) through which we will travel with all thirteen protagonists, in a desperate attempt to prevent the destruction of the Earth to the work of lethal robotic creatures: the kaij, in fact. In this alternation of time jumps we find androids indistinguishable from humans, false memories and numerous other factors that combine to create thirteen incredibly deep narratives, interlaced with each other, whose pieces eventually fit perfectly into that enormous puzzle that is the plot . The main timeline is 1985, which brings with it various pop culture references of that period, from Hollywood blockbusters to Japanese productions. Details whose familiarity will allow you to appreciate the game even more but which in any case do not prevent those who are less knowledgeable from fully enjoying the experience. It is not possible to complete the entire narrative arc of a character in a single round: sometimes to continue it will be necessary to play as another, go forward a piece and then move on to another one, bouncing between various events that after a initial confusion slowly begin to make sense. Its tiled structure and the consequent interweaving of stories that derive from it makes the understanding of the plot slower, without a doubt, but satisfying since we are offered small scattered clues and never the long tedious explanation; paying attention to the details it is possible to reconstruct the events step by step, which in any case keep us suspended by a thread until the very last bars, making 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim challenge our expectations with a small but incredibly significant twist or confirm that suspicion that had been gnawing at for some time, always through real action or veiled suggestions. Although there is a practical archive to consult, it is always sipped information, easy to consult and not too verbose to make us give up reading. The non-linearity of the general plot also extends to the individual narratives. Sometimes the gioco will proceed in a straight line, especially in the early stages, but once certain points are reached, the branches will become much denser, forcing us to replay the section more than once to see what would have happened if, or access that path that was previously closed to us. It's not always immediate to understand what it takes to move forward and it sometimes happened to move at random but the sections are so short that the risk of falling into excessive repetitiveness is really minimal. In any case, if we realize that we have made a mistake, we can retrace our steps by reloading a particular narrative sequence, marked by a specific symbol, and resume from there without necessarily reaching the end of a narrative segment that we have already completed. This is the main strength of 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim. How it tells its own story, that is, the fluidity with which every single piece and character falls into place without feeling forced. Or again, the way in which the game reveals its cards, sipping the secrets without really hiding them (indeed, sometimes they are in plain sight but we don't have the means to notice them), enticing players to continue until everything fits together . If you are looking for an intelligently told story that is always able to amaze and intrigue you, Vanillaware has what you need. Sentinels versus kaij Up to now we have talked about the plot and its structure but 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim also has a gameplay component which, although separate, is inextricably linked with the narrative. When we write separate we mean it literally: from the main menu you access the Adventure section when you want to continue with the story, turning into more or less passive spectators of the situation, but sometimes to continue it will be necessary to take the field and this is where it comes into play. I play the Battle. Here we find different areas in which to defeat waves of kaij, each one different from the other and for which it is necessary to deploy the right pilots with the relative Sentinels - this is how the robots we will use to fight are called. These are sequences that are not entirely in real time, most of the time to be resolved within two minutes with the action however being paused when we select a character to decide what to make him do. We have to choose a maximum of six pilots to deploy in attack, while the rest will form the defense that will take care of reacting independently to threats, each with its own mecha belonging to a different generation - which here take the place of the classes. From the first to the fourth we have those specialized in melee, in support, in the long distance and finally the more eclectic units characterized by ample mobility and the possibility of using both close and ranged attacks by exploiting particular technologies. Our task is to defend a specific point on the map, destroying the waves of enemies that will try to conquer it or, in general, completing mission objectives. Very simple premises, as simple as the graphics that depict allies and threats as simple icons on a city map. Although at first glance this may give the impression that the battles are mere fillers, mini-games placed there to take a break from the narrative, in practice you quickly discover how they are very strategic battles and with increasing difficulty thanks to the introduction of new enemies or improved versions of them. If you are wondering why such a minimalist stylistic choice compared to the beautiful tables that make up the story, it is easy to say: the amount of enemies on the screen reaches several hundred, something that experienced with an approach other than the top-down would have made experience hell. Thus it is instead possible to create challenging, flowing and satisfying clashes, especially if you aim to obtain the highest degree of evaluation. It's a choice that may not find everyone's favor and we understand that but the gratification that comes from getting the best result or meeting optional conditions in the later and more difficult stages is addictive, as is chaining the right sequence of attacks together so that neither you nor the target you are defending take damage while enemies are literally decimated. The higher the level of challenge, the more efficient your Sentinels must be: in this case a customization system intervenes dedicated on the one hand to the offensive and on the other to the structure of our mecha, of which we will enhance the individual parts to make it stronger, more resistant, etc. etc. Doing so requires spending metachips, the obtainable in-game currency both progreding with history and fighting in the field. Each Sentinel stands on its own, so it's up to us to choose who to invest in from time to time, although the advice is to create a homogeneous team without leaving anyone behind because they are all indispensable in their own way. Also, making a pilot fight too much will lead them to a Neuroblock, rendering them unusable for a fight while waiting for the load on their mind to ease and allow them to return to the game. So it is always good to have a backup plan, because it is true that this condition can be canceled with the simple push of a button but, with a view to earning more metachips and mystery points (useful for unlocking archive entries) it is advisable string together as many victories as possible: forcing a Neuroblock to cancel resets the multiplier, forcing you to start over. Finally, the pilots themselves will be able to level up by gaining experience based on their contribution to the battle, gradually unlocking traits that will help to form a more focused team. There is a clear distinction between the two sides, Adventure and Battle, and one would think that it would have been better to keep them together so as not to create a sense of disconnection. However, we must take into account the fact that we are going through a history that has already been lived and that the present, if we want to consider it this way, consists precisely of the combat phases: inserting them into the complex narrative plot would have been complicated to manage and above all out of context. We are not at the point of saying that the plot is subservient to the gameplay, because there is a close collaboration, but we must not forget that the thirteen protagonists have made their journey to get there, to the battle that will decide once and for all the fate of the world and the future. As you play, you realize how keeping them separate proves to be the best solution, to enjoy both properly. Exceptional artistic sector The production values of 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim are incredible. Vanillaware has given its best from an artistic point of view, creating what appear to be real moving paintings: every place has a main color that determines its atmosphere, from the fresh blue hue of the roofs in the early morning to the kaleidoscopic hues of red and yellow during sunsets, and again, the areas most devastated by the fury of the kaij refer to Giger. What makes it all the more beautiful is the way in which the individual settings change depending on the time of day you visit them. There is an attention to detail that takes the quality of the study to a new level and although the areas are rather small, exploring them by capturing the particular plays of light and shadow is a further pleasure that enriches an already excellent game. The absence of loading between one area and another finally allows you to enjoy the adventure seamlessly, experiencing everything that this sci-fi Japan of the 80s (and beyond) has to offer.", "date": "2020-09-15", "grade": "9.0"}
