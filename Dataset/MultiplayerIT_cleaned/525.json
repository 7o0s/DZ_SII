{"name": "Laboratorio di videogiochi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/laboratorio-di-videogiochi-la-recensione.html", "text": "Surprisingly announced just over a month ago, Video Game Lab is coming to Nintendo Switch on June 11th; in Europe it will be available only digitally, at a price of 29.99 Euros. As it will be clearer by reading our review, it is a ~game~ for creating games, a development software for newbies, which does everything possible to make all the work that exists behind a video game fun and intuitive. In particular, we immediately anticipate it to you, the one relating to programming. To guide you in the educational and creative paths of the game there are two point entities, Bob and Alice, your ~professors~; but above all there are the Nodons, talking creatures, each associated with a precise structural function and which reminded us of the protagonists of Inside Out, personifications of basic human emotions. Here the characterization is less deep and structured, but the idea is precisely to animate the concepts underlying the creation of video games. The Nodon Button is a rather frantic type, which is used to associate a button with a function. The Nodon Try Again is a nostalgic dude, continually brooding over what isn't, but could have been; it is he who takes care, placed in the right place and in the right way, to restart a game. There is the Nodon Contatore, fundamental in managing some logical processes that determine the mechanics of a work. The Motivo Nodon, to graphically modify your character; The Nodon persona, that character literally makes him appear. And then the Sound Effect Nodon, the Mondo Nodon... there are so many, well done, and they contribute to making the entire creative experience more pleasant and enjoyable. An experience that, despite appearances and premises, is by no means simple. Lessons Game Lab has two main modes: Free Programming, which we're setting aside for now, and seven lessons that gradually introduce you to creating a game. Each of these deals with a different genre, and is developed in various stages, which vary in number according to the complexity of the subject matter. It starts from a simple fixed screen multiplayer game, to get to the construction of a three-dimensional racing game. The best way to enjoy Videogame Workshop, in terms of interaction, is with the touch screen in handheld mode; using it on the TV, there is the possibility of relying on buttons or motion sensors. We preferred the latter option, both for speed and intuitiveness, although it is not comparable to the speed and accuracy of the touch screen. If you have the opportunity and the space, the ideal option to enjoy the title in docked mode is to connect a mouse, and use that to move the cursor around the screen. As already mentioned, the lessons are held by Bob: he guides you step by step, illustrating what to do at all times, and why you are doing it. The tenor of the dialogues is pleasant, ironic, as are the Nodons who gradually flood the game screen. It is literally impossible to get it wrong: during lessons, you can only click on the right option. Which limits creativity, but is functional for learning the concepts covered faster. You continuously switch from the programming interface (a warm-colored grid) to the actual game, so as to progressively experience the changes made. If it is impossible to make mistakes during the lessons, your skills will be tested during the checkpoints between a topic and the other: ~practical~ exams on what has been learned. In these short tests, the goal is to get the character to pick an apple: the way in which this becomes possible always varies. Initially it is enough to apply the Nodon Control Stick to the protagonist, so as to be able to move him; in advanced exams, it is necessary to connect several procedural Nodons, altering their internal values, so - for example - a platform will be able to rotate at a certain angle, delivering the apple to you. These exams must be passed in order to access the next lesson. And, from the middle onwards, they're anything but simple. To the point that you can access the ~Alice's manual~, a practical archive of the topics covered in the past, so as to review the concept which, in theory, should lead you to the solution of the problem. In case too much time passes (about ten minutes), the game allows you to continue even though you haven't passed the test: a sensation that helps everyone, but with a not exactly satisfying feeling. Free programming At the end of each lesson you will have a small working video game: these are short experiences, lasting a few minutes. A 2D shooter and platformer, a puzzle game and a 3D racingle, two simple minigames (one of which uses motion sensors to move a sphere). Once the lessons are over, you should have the necessary skills to approach free programming which, as the name suggests, leaves you alone with the grid. The latest exams in the game are quite challenging, but that's nothing compared to this mode. Although Nintendo has done everything to make learning as pleasant and intuitive as possible, unfortunately the subject matter is complex in itself, and Video Game Workshop manages to simplify it only partially. It's amazing how easy it is to introduce a character and make him move with the buttons you want, even in three dimensions (you can move the view of the interface, from above or from the side). Having minimal experience with more professional tools such as Unity, we found camera management particularly interesting: the simplicity with which you can ~hook~ to a subject is truly remarkable, and how you can alter them in just a few steps. If the Nodon objects are easily interpretable, and the same - albeit to a lesser extent - can be said for the various inputs and outputs, it is the Nodon ~processes~ that make the creation complicated. Basically, those that allow you to give logical and numerical commands to your video game. There are values for the constants, some Nodons to create comparisons, which are then connected to each other to generate certain functions: create the ~end~ of a level, stage limits, make it clear when - in a racing - a character has won and the other lost. Giving these instructions is not as trivial as one might think at the beginning: if you are guided in the lessons, in free programming you often feel lost. When an object or characters behave as we want, the satisfaction is enormous, but in general the Nodon ~processes~ are much more difficult to master and, we imagine, could be inaccessible to a user of very young people or in general with little patience . The other flaw of the video game workshop lies in the absence of lessons related to game design. During the courses - of course - concepts related to level design are put into practice, because enemies and platforms are distributed in very specific positions. However, unlike programming topics, our guide rarely explains why we're positioning an element in that particular way, and not another. Personalization and sharing Once a project is completed, in addition to playing it, you can also share it online through a code; of course, you can also download creations for which you have the access key. As there is no online community yet, we were unable to test the feature. The certainty is that it will not be possible to play particularly long games, but only short experiences. At the same time, we have a feeling that particularly gifted people, those who have the time and patience to master Process Nodons, will be able to create amazing designs. In the right hands, we are convinced that Video Game Workshop can generate some amazing little works. The user has great freedom, the objects present are many, and the possibilities of manipulating them are truly extreme: someone might even be able to create a first person shooter, or a three-dimensional platformer with shooter contamination. The question isn't whether this is possible, but how many people will have the determination to do it, considering the steep learning curve and the fact that, at best, your creation will only be played by other Game Lab users. In any case, some may discover a hidden talent, and perhaps move from this software to professional programs. More than aspiring game designers, graphic designers and musicians, Video Game Workshop is more aimed at young programmers. They are the ones who will be better at understanding the software, they are the ones who have the most extensive tools to explore the potential of the work. On a visual level, customization is rather poor: you can naturally choose the hue of a particular object, or the lighting of an area. But the drawing tools built into the game are far too simple and limited to create anything truly original. The same thing can be said for the music and sound effects. There are many, and it's really nice to alter the arrangements and vary the instruments, but - from what we've experienced - there is no serious, profound possibility of altering the music present.", "date": "2021-06-10", "grade": "S.V."}
