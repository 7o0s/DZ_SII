{"name": "Splatterhouse - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/splatterhouse-recensione.html", "text": "What was it yesterday In an age when video gaming rarely explored the territory of violence, gore, or horror, Splatterhouse landed in arcades like a flying saucer laden with monstrosities. A beefy maniac, dressed in the manner of the infamous Jason, faced a horror bestiary never seen in an electronic game with punches, flying and sliding kicks, blows, spanner shots, shotguns and marble ball launches. The monstrous bodies of the enemies liquefied, flaked or decomposed under the blows of the Jason on duty, while the environments alternated rooms full of meat on which enormous toothed leeches ate, dungeons of torture, chambers infested with poltergeists ready to hit us with their furnishings, intestines populated by diaphanous embryos. Often the environmental gimmicks have an effect on the interaction: in some underground guts the demon-infested dogs could be distracted by letting them devour the already eliminated corpses of the creatures. Compared to the playful formula of the beat'em up first model, the one with horizontal scrolling and no depth, the game was in itself nothing original: it was, in fact, the umpteenth reinterpretation of a trend so broad as to include within it experiments like Vigilante or Shinobi. Splatterhouse was not even very precise in terms of control, or extremely varied in terms of available moves.: flying kick, slide, high and low hit completed the basic offer, with the only variations available in the form of weapons producing succulent animations in the unfortunate offended. The strong point of the game, extremely repetitive and demanding to the point of frustration, was the horrific content, which the ludic formula reinforced and dished out to the player, working at the minimum wage of originality and with a rigor worthy of an insensitive bureaucracy. What is it today Not only at the time of its release about twenty years ago but still today, in an era of so-called ~violent video games~, Splatterhouse remains one of the most extreme examples of videogame aesthetics, fused with an archaic and ruthless game structure. The graphic design of the PC Engine conversion is quite faithful to the original from the hall (which still remains far superior in detail and animations) and, if time has made the way in which the horrors have been reproduced obsolete, they continue to do well note. On the audio side, the arcade - PC Engine comparison is particularly evident: if all the melodies, organ refrains and macabre jingles typical of the horror repertoire are respected, the same cannot be said for the tonal quality of the sounds offered by the chipset, nor for the many , desperate, frightening cries of some enemies, lost here. The game is also much more playable than the original arcade counterpart, which was a real offense to the player and required such amounts of tension and concentration as to induce the danger of broken glass in the mildest patron. But even so Splatterhouse can unsettle and unnerve, if played in the right atmosphere and with the aim of winning. Its peculiarity is that it presents itself as a videogame nightmare both externally and on an interactive level, as a fully-fledged playable horror, as a projection of the avatar's disturbance onto the player. Recommended for strong stomachs, lovers of extreme games and horror aesthetics. But not at all. A leading exponent of the most horrific, violent and nervous videogame trend, Splatterhouse is an underground riot of Barkerian monstrosities, explosions of biological sewage, infernal assaults on the player. As disturbing in terms of aesthetics as it is in game mechanics, the PC Engine conversion  quite faithful to the original coin-op  is ready to spoil the nights of two thousand players at a cost of 800 Wii Points.", "date": "2007-04-04", "grade": null}
