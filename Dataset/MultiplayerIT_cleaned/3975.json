{"name": "Apparition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/apparition-recensione.html", "text": "It's the Halloween period and, as always, many medium-small development studios are crowding the market with horror titles, obviously to try to exploit the theme of the party as a lure for potential buyers. Apparition is one of them. It had actually been available for a few months in Steam Early Access, but now the final version has arrived in time for the party. Sadly this is an overall unremarkable project, which doesn't really add anything to the genre. We try to understand why in our review. Plot and inventory Apparition tells the story of a paranormal hunter who travels the world looking for signs of the existence of ghosts, demons and the like. One day our unnamed hero decides to go to Green Creek, a charming wooded town where heinous crimes have been committed by a mysterious serial killer. Despite the years that have passed since the first crime, the people who go to the place continue to die (the right question is: why do they keep going there? But let's overlook it). Our aim will therefore be to solve the mystery behind so much horror, finding signs of the presence of the paranormal. We are at the clich fair, but in reality there would not be too much to complain if the realization was at least decent. Instead we are faced with an unambitious product, designed essentially for Let's Play on YouTube and for streaming broadcasts on Twitch, that is, it is full of artificially caused jumps on the chair and original ideas as a necklace of flowers in Hawaii. Once a game has started, you must first of all equip yourself: at the beginning you have a few objects, such as a candle stub to shed light, a camera to immortalize the various clues, a lighter, multipurpose batteries, a strange stick with a skull on it and little else. However, by finding clues to the presence of the paranormal in Green Creek, you will get points that can be spent to unlock advanced objects, to be used in subsequent games, such as a crowbar, a camera, an easel, a map of the place and more, to be used to unlock more clues and grow your score. Having decided what to take with us, we can venture into the woods, where danger awaits us. Game mechanics Apparition is designed for very short games, in the order of half an hour maximum. The protagonist arrives in Green Creek in the middle of the night and has to explore the area until the next morning. In fact we are faced with a tiny open world in which the goal is to hunt for hidden objects. The clues to the presence of the paranormal that can be found are of various types, but the main ones are questions to ask a restless spirit, using the classic Ouija board, and body bags with who knows what or who inside (it is not known what paranormal they have , but so be it). The questions are basically sheets scattered by no one knows who in various points of the map, which, once collected, add questions to an accessible list using the Ouija board in front of an extinguished bonfire. Another sign of the paranormal is represented by some monstrous creatures roaming the woods, all very dangerous for the protagonist's health. However, it is enough to photograph them from afar to bring home the loot and accumulate points. In fact, Apparition is all here: you go around the map, explore the few interesting areas several times (wooden houses, shacks, some camping tents and little else) and accumulate points to get the best equipment that allows to unblock otherwise inaccessible passages. For example, in one of the houses there is a closed trapdoor that can only be opened with a crowbar: unfortunately the object cannot be found by exploring but must be unlocked and equipped before starting the game. This means that to unlock and find everything, so as to reconstruct the slender history of Green Creek, you must necessarily play several times. Too bad that, as already mentioned, the map is tiny and that, once the patterns of supernatural creatures have been understood, avoiding them becomes a piece of cake. The only mechanic that makes the classic jumps on the chair, but in the most incorrect way possible, is the sudden appearance on the screen of static images of the monsters. These brief visions have the only effect of degrading the sanity of the protagonist, to the point of driving him to madness. In reality, they have another effect: to infuriate the player in search of a less childish horror. The tension, the little that there is, is built with the typical mechanics of the genre: bestial verses coming from who knows where, absolute darkness that lets you glimpse only the profilesof objects, the sound of footsteps when monsters appear, rain, wind and all the rest of the sample that from Amnesia onwards is never lacking in horror films. Also in this case there would be nothing wrong with the lack of originality, if the monsters weren't suckers who stop worrying in the third game. From a technical point of view, Apparition is a modest production from which we didn't expect anything more than what it has to offer, i.e. many stock 3D models, a barely functional lighting system and creatures that are not exactly imaginative in characterization, but adequate for the theme. After all, we are talking about a title created by practically one person, so we can't complain too much. There is even less to say about the soundtrack: it is so anonymous that while writing the review we realized that we had not paid attention to the presence or absence of music and we had to restart the game one last time. In short, you will have understood that they do not really remain impressed, like the whole game, after all.", "date": "2018-10-31", "grade": "4.0"}
