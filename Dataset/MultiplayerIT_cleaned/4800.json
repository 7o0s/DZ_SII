Role-playing games are influenced by the mechanics of action titles, adventures often introduce elements of growth of the protagonists and moral choices and even shooters love to attract the player with statistics and percentages related to weapon damage. Drifting Lands is the demonstration of how this meeting can give life to interesting and sometimes unusual ideas and the beautiful thought of inserting a Diablo-like equipment system into a scrolling shooter teased us right away. A few well-made screenshots and a fascinating presentation video convinced us to get our hands on the title and try it out for ourselves, so that we could talk about an experiment as original as it is interesting on these pages. Our greatest fears, of course, were hidden behind the repetitiveness that this kind of games usually carries with you, but the growth of spaceships could represent the solution to this problem on paper. After several hours of play we are therefore ready for our final verdict. Let's forget about the plot There are no particular narrative premises as a backdrop to Drifing Lands, as mere pretexts to board our ship and go and blow up the dozens of other ships that will oppose us. Three basic models to choose from, from the fast but low-armored spaceship to the slow and resistant colossus, obviously passing from the balanced one. With only three ships available one cannot expect who knows what variety in the game but each of them has a set of skills that allows you to have a different approach to battles, enough to arouse curiosity in the player and instill in him the desire to try different alternatives from the initial option. Exactly as if we were talking about the Diablo classes, in fact, each vehicle has different sets of passive and active skills at its disposal, which the player can freely buy and select between one game and another, in a hangar that acts as a central hub. There's nothing complex about it and if you've ever gotten your hands on any branch-based RPG you'll know exactly what awaits you in Drifting Lands. Then there are also stat points and characteristics to keep in check to maximize damage, crit chance or resistances, all in line with the best hack 'n' slash out there. Unfortunately, however, the Alkemi-branded production shows its side when examining the gameplay, due to a slow pace and a not exactly excellent variety of enemies. The controls are all in all responsive but the precision necessary to be able to fully appreciate the bullet hells is not perceived. In short, the development team lacks a bit of experience, there is a lack of fluidity in the movements of the shuttle and there is also a lack of internships capable of remaining etched in the player's memories. While on the one hand the decision to generate hundreds of game schemes is a great gimmick to basically give the product infinite longevity, on the other it makes everything too flat and unrefined, leaving the most demanding players rather cold towards the title. Even the backdrops do not help, with a very clean but very little evocative appearance, then inevitably ending up, given the enormous amount of stages, to have the same assets recycled ad nauseam. Without going to bother the giants like Ikaruga, where memorizing the attack patterns, the waves and even memorizing every single shot fired was essential to be able to fully enjoy the experience, on Drifting Lands everything is oriented towards a much more casual, where arriving alive and well at the end of the mission is absolutely more important than performing in spectacular scores. Drifting Lands thus becomes a game dominated by more accentuated ~farming~, where the need to repeat levels after levels to improve one's ship is the only incentive to continue. A real shame if we think of the potential that this production hid under the armor. The gameplay, rather slow as we said, is enriched by specific bonus multipliers, a mana bar and a shuttle energy bar, solutions that however do not serve to improve the final result. Hunting for the right loot The real difference in the style of play is made by the weapons that are obtained for the levels, rather than the spaceships themselves, significantly altering the type of shot. We have laser weapons, short-range shotguns and an abnormal amount of machine guns with very different ranges and ranges of fire. The problem is that the player has to adapt towhat the game puts on the plate, necessarily having to prefer the most powerful weapons to continue smoothly between the various levels of the story. For example, we found it much more useful to change weapons by opting for the one with the highest damage per second rather than keeping a less strong one that we liked better. In fact, levels and difficulties rise regardless of the player's progression, forcing him to constantly update to keep up. To bring a little variety to all of this, some secondary missions take care of it that try to slightly vary the usual scheme of total destruction, perhaps requiring the release of rare equipment at a precise point in the level but nothing that really makes one cry for a miracle. To save the production from mediocrity, then, an excellent soundtrack takes care of it, which makes the walks in the atmosphere less heavy to face, a small value thrown at random among a quantity of hardly forgettable defects, including a management of the menus and inventories really impractical, especially with the pad.", "date": "2017-06-28", "grade": "6.5"}
