In the first level the player is faced with a minimal aesthetic which, even if accompanied by excellent animations, was combined with a musically valid but equally dry audio proposal and with an extremely basic environmental interaction, arousing a feeling of embarrassed disorientation. Kid Chamaleon starts on the sly. The introduction forms the basis for the aesthetic and narrative imagery of the game, a kind of mixture between a children's adventure comic and Tron. The boss of a cutting-edge game, capable of taking the player into other virtual worlds, is starting to lock up the patrons inside the game, beating them and condemning them to oblivion in cyberspace. What was it yesterday The invitation is to take on the role of Kid Chameleon, entering the cartoony game environments originated by the computer to fully exploit the metamorphic potential of the avatar and defeat the system. If the cyber themes end here, the suggestion of the virtuality of the game experience is explicit at the beginning and end of the level, when the enemies disappear and the backdrops reveal themselves as covering the underlying, essential wireframe, a mix between perspective lines and nuts 'n blocks bolts. Cleanliness, well-animated minimalism and attention to insignificant detail at the expense of impact are therefore not Kid Chamaleon's real limits, but in a certain sense they fall within its suggestion, they act as a thematic departure without the arrival of the real game and proper, of its central node: the transformations. What is it today The core of the Kid Chameleon experience, still valid today, are the nine transformations. Kid Chameleon has no powers, he can only jump on enemies and climb platforms too high to reach with a simple jump. He's a non-avatar in a T-shirt and jeans, bare and quite helpless. But it makes its true performance explicit by assuming the other identities. As a Samurai he is very fast, makes prodigious leaps, attacks with the katana. As a medieval knight he is extremely heavy and damaging to enemies, and can climb. As a Berserker, he can headbutt through walls. In the form of Eyeclops he has a beam that reveals secret blocks. He can spin around like Cyclone, transform into a kind of mummified centaur fused with a tank and shoot skulls, he can cling to walls like a fly or scan levels with X-rays to discover secret wireframe passages underneath. And so, having started quietly, Kid Chameleon begins to catch the player and slowly drag him along a hundred levels which often, yes, turn out to be simple, but other times they are equipped with multiple exits, pitfalls, inter-passages, vertical and labyrinthine structures, and they are always and in any case calibrated on the necessary abilities of the transformations, on their limits and merits. What is it today Heaven be praised for the automatic save of the position made possible by the emulation: at the time, the game criminally came out without a buffer battery, seeing the strength of its longevity compromised from the start and causing a critical prejudice that continues to recur. But Kid Chameleon is a game to rediscover. The nine transformations, which give access to further hits and special functions related to the collection of gems in the game (an integral part of the gameplay and not mere scoring), are inextricably linked to the design of the levels, and are delightfully characterized, with their presentation in the middle path between a basic macrocephalic tendency and the universes (horror, sci-fi, comic, Japanese) of reference. Nothing that recalls the ingenious and economic incisiveness of Mario's design, the unbridled racing of Sonic or the gimmicks of Yoshi's Island, but there is enough for the shipwreck to be sweet and long in the dreamy, childish world of comic virtuality that this small meta - virtual world manages to disclose. Kid Chameleon wasn't and isn't anything revolutionary - it's a nice simple way to do some ~old-fashioned~ gaming leaps. But at the same time, Sega's original platformer is an opportunity to enjoy its aesthetics and let yourself be carried away in a bland atmosphere of longing for the virtuality of game worlds. Kid Chameleon comes from an era in which two-dimensional platformers still dominated the gaming sphere, in the wake of the unstoppable advance of Nintendo's playful experiments with the Mario saga. The stylistic features of the platform game dominated the offer of the games of thethe time and many other companies had invested the imagination of their designers on the platform genre, in turn developing a ~mascot policy~ of their own. Fifteen years after its publication for Sega Megadrive, today, at the cost of 800 Wii Points, Kid Chameleon's ~reflection~ on game worlds may seem obsolete and the limits of Kid's charisma are evident: yet, in terms of pure fun, this game is not likely to disappoint fans of platform games looking for a long and childishly fascinating experience.", "date": "2007-07-23", "grade": null}
