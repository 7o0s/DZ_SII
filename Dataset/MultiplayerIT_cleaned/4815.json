Not even his own authors. After publishing the first and only expansion of the original game, Forgotten Shores, the guys at Ustwo had started experimenting with new ideas, playing a bit with virtual reality, and the same lead designer, Ken Wong, declared that the whole team he wanted to turn the page. However, something has obviously changed in the meantime: Wong has left the team to found his own development studio in Hong Kong, while Ustwo Games has expanded in number. Either due to the insecurity of creating something new, or because many of the new entries were passionate about Monument Valley, the London developer has thus decided to do an about-face. Announced during the last WWDC and published the same day on the App Store, Monument Valley 2 is not, however, a simple attempt to make an easy cash by once again squeezing what has been one of the most popular mobile games of recent years, and indeed manages to find its own identity, deepening and (unexpectedly) improving an already impeccable experience even more. +1 The circle of life From the very first screens it is evident that Monument Valley 2 takes up the idea, the mechanics and the style at the base of the first episode. The goal is once again to interact with architectures that seem to be taken from a painting by M.C. Escher, rotating or moving some platforms to create new paths, so as to lead your alter ego towards the end of the level. Colored castles, towers, gardens, bridges and columns: the sense of wonder you feel every time small optical illusions and perspective games create an impossible path is the same and identical as it was three years ago. The new levers of Ustwo have not limited themselves to recycling the mechanics and ideas of the first Monument Valley, but rather this sequel hides many small unpublished ideas in its fourteen levels. Some puzzles ask you to alter the light of a room, others take place on several floors, while at the end of each chapter you are asked to ~draw~ a symbol through extremely elegant mechanics. However, one of the most important innovations concerns the narrative level. Concluded the story of Ida in the previous episode, Monument Valley 2 tells of a mother and her child, and how the relationship between the two changes level after level. Initially you control Ro, the mother, trying to solve the small puzzles of each scenario while the daughter just stays close to her. As she grows up, the child will begin to become more independent, until she has to separate from her parent and embark on her own personal journey. The relationship between this mother and her daughter is told in a deliberately didactic way precisely to allow those who play to empathize with the characters, but despite this there is no shortage of touches of class. The feelings and state of mind of the two characters are also reflected in the atmosphere of each level, in the graphic style used and in the design of the environments. The most colorful and lively levels are those in which Ro is with her little girl. When the two separate, the scenarios suddenly become gray and dull. When the daughter begins to face the first trials alone, the architectures become more uncertain and confusing, with various crossroads and doors that reflect the sense of loss of the character. But then the little girl takes her own path, experiments, and so did the developers, inserting new perspectives and visual styles. Contrary to the first Monument Valley, the story told by this sequel is much more explicit, allowing the player to have a common thread to follow from the beginning to the end of this short and tender experience. Perhaps the fact that the story is so didactic makes it easier to become attached to the two protagonists, but at the same time it also makes it less spontaneous. After all, one of the most memorable elements of the old episode was the bond that was formed between Ida (the player) and a funny yellow totem. An implied relationship, which developed through the gameplay and which probably found its effectiveness precisely in the fact that it was not so explicit.", "date": "2017-06-11", "grade": "9.0"}
