Beyond the name, the game actually has little to do with the latest adventure of the blue hedgehog for PC and consoles. Once the application has been launched and a short tutorial has been completed, we find ourselves in front of an endless runner similar to the Temple Run, therefore with a third-person view, characterized however by four different lanes on which to move to avoid obstacles along the way, which can also be avoided by taking leaps or making slides. Why four lanes instead of the traditional three? It is easy to say: the experience developed by Hardlight is completely based on competitive multiplayer, which means that in each match four real players will be placed in the same speed race, with the objective of course to cross the finish line first. The formula is therefore very simple and immediate, but at the same time interesting: the large roster of unlockable characters guarantees many different skills that can be used during matches to slow down the opponents, whether they are in front of or behind us, and this aspect of game somehow recalls the frenetic battles of Mario Kart. Fireballs? Loose mines? Electric shocks? Nothing is missing, but above all there is a fairly clear distinction between the protagonists which leads to choosing one's avatar on the basis of the approach we prefer, focused on the offensive or on speed. Porcupines in competition Beyond some inevitable hiccups, due to the fluctuating quality of the connection of the users you will be dealing with, the games of Sonic Forces: Speed Battle take place in a fluid and convincing way, without particular problems and offering spectacular sequences, which change the visual also make it more difficult to avoid obstacles and thus maintain one's advantage or recover from an uphill race. Collecting the inevitable rings allows us to accelerate, as well as travel the traditional speed ramps, but the key to success clearly lies in precision and quick reflexes, because any impact can slow us down enough to lose. At the end of each race, useful points are collected to rise in the global ranking and thus unlock new scenarios, in a very similar way to what was seen in the blockbuster Clash Royale. This means that by dedicating more time to the game we will be rewarded with a greater variety of settings, in addition to the aforementioned unlocking of new characters, all of which can be upgraded using the rings collected and some cards obtainable through the crates. The freemium aspects of this production are manifested precisely in the waiting times for the opening of the loot boxes, but also and above all in the advertising trailers that start automatically at the end of each game, which can be skipped only after a few seconds. In short, the experience offered by Sonic Forces: Speed Battle is fun and all in all original, at least from a structural point of view; accompanied by a well-made technical sector, capable of rendering well the speed that we would expect from the blue hedgehog and his friends.", "date": "2017-11-07", "grade": "7.5"}
