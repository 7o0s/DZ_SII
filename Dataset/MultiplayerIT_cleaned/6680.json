{"name": "Frozen Synapse Prime", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/142245-frozen-synapse-prime-strategia-portami-via.html", "text": "In 2011 the developers of Mode 7 Games created the excellent Frozen Synapse, a turn-based strategy game for PC and mobile that was different from the usual, with tactical elements of a certain thickness and a system for the automatic generation of scenarios that potentially made every game different on the other. Three years later, the game was technically reworked and made its first debut on the PlayStation Vita, thanks to a ~hybrid~ control system, which used both the physical commands and the touch screen of the Sony portable console; and subsequently on PlayStation 3, moreover with a view to the Instant Game Collection and a download that PlayStation Plus subscribers were able to make for free, at least until a couple of weeks ago. A new ~fixed~ version, therefore, edited by Double Eleven and characterized by the same visual restyling appreciated on PC and handheld, which passes from the minimalism of the original graphics to the three-dimensionality of an aseptic environment, but at the same time terribly anonymous and difficult to ~read~ during the action. A similar argument can be made for the controls, which in this case depend solely on the DualShock and therefore cannot count on the immediacy of the touch screen or mouse, but rather are made heavier by an excessive use of dialog boxes, including confirmations and relatively long loads, which slow down the progress of the games a little too much. On PlayStation 3 Frozen Synapse Prime is unfortunately less fascinating and fun than the original Oh my bugs! Frozen Synapse Prime unfortunately suffers from a rather annoying bug: once you have downloaded and installed the game on PlayStation 3, when you first start it it will ask you to download an update, after which it will crash forever. To solve the problem you will have to delete and download the file again, then launch it by refusing to apply the update, get to the main screen and close the application. At the next attempt you will be able to update without problems. All the faces of Frozen Synapse Frozen Synapse Prime is set in a dystopian future, in which a group of ~rebels~ organizes a series of operations in order to overthrow the established totalitarian order. The single player campaign, made up of over fifty missions, manages to propose fairly varied situations, in which our objective may be to eliminate the enemies present on the map or to escort a VIP towards an escape area, or even to resist for a handful of turns while a team technician hacks a system. During our turn we will have the possibility to move the available units and act on a ~wheel~ which contains various modifiers, capable of influencing not only the movement of the troops but also the way they approach any opponents. In fact, the attack takes place automatically, as soon as a target is within reach, but the directionality of our ~attention~, the stability of the shot and a whole series of other factors depend on the choices we make in this phase. Once the team's moves have been determined, we will be able to activate a sort of preview, lasting five seconds, which will show us what is about to happen before giving definitive confirmation and causing the system to ~calculate~ the progress of the turn. Yes, because one thing is the prediction, which does not include the maneuvers of the enemies, and one thing is what will actually happen once we have given consent to proceed. An enemy that we thought would remain stationary could instead choose to follow a different path and take us by surprise, or get dangerously close to a unit that we have the task of proceeding, or still take advantage of the crack offered by a window to strike us when we still don't let's wait. Playstation 3 trophies The thirty Trophies of Frozen Synapse Prime are obtained by completing the most varied operations: from the linearity of completing the individual stages, the tutorials and the campaign to the ~numerical~ achievements based on the amount of kills, passing through those obtained by experimenting with particular maneuvers. It's your turn In short, the Frozen Synapse Prime experience appears relatively simple on paper, but requires some time and practice to master, so as to enter the strategic spirit that the developers intended to make on the screen. The initial impact is therefore rough, angular and often frustrating, but then leaves room for great satisfaction when we manage to develop containment or attack tactics that prove to be effective right away, successfully predicting what the enemies they are preparing to do. Unfortunately, as already mentioned, this plantso multifaceted and deep it doesn't go well with the controls via DualShock, which are rather slow and cumbersome; nor does it take any advantage of an interface that seems taken verbatim from the PlayStation Vita version of the game, therefore with frankly enormous voices (see the starting screen) and an excessive use of dialogue boxes. This heaviness, together with the length of the loads, inevitably ends up breaking the rhythm and making progression tiring, without prejudice to the overall quality of the product. Unfortunately we didn't even appreciate the graphic restyling, which on the one hand undoubtedly represents a step forward for a title that originally had almost amateurish references in the visual style, but on the other hand it takes away from the legibility of the map, making it difficult to locate at a glance keep an eye on the units, also resulting rather anonymous. Mediocre and repetitive in the sound accompaniment, the game offers in addition to the campaign a couple of interesting extra options: the Skirmish, with random levels in which you simply have to eliminate the enemy team, without too many frills, and a competitive multiplayer which however does not include the of the PC version, limited to one-on-one battles.", "date": "2014-12-17", "grade": "7.0"}
