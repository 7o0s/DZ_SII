{"name": "Gunman Chronicles", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gunman-chronicles.html", "text": "A few stories Gunman was originally intended to be a multiplayer mod for Quake titled Gunmanchip 101. All of this was back in the day when Team Fortress and Rocket Arena were all the rage. Gunman for Quake never saw the light of day, and when you think about it, it wasn't a bad thing: it would have risked being lost in John Carmack's game change list, and subsequently being forgotten. When Half-Life was released, Herb Flower and his crew began working on a single-player modification, but soon the project took other turns, first becoming a total-conversion and then a game intended for sale, the one everyone is eagerly awaiting all 'Now. The story of the Gunman and his General instead begins in the future, precisely on Banzure Prime (a planet in the west of the galaxy). Their task is to investigate the disruption of the connections of their scientific laboratory. It seemed like a simple mission to everyone, but they soon realized that it wasn't like that: a hostile alien race, the Xenomes, had reached the planet and planted its bases. Many men were killed, while only a few lucky ones managed to escape thanks to the heroic gesture of their superior, who was killed by the enemies. You are one of them and upon your return, you are given the task of replacing the General, who has become a hero. Now, 5 years later, a new race of aliens based on the Xenomes' DNA is spreading again. As the leader of the Gunmans, the only law in this area of the galaxy, you must find their source and destroy them without mercy. The work was done, and here are the results If you think that Gunman: Chronicles is just a simple single-player adventure, you are very wrong. The work that Rewolf Software and Valve have done with the Half-Life engine is truly extraordinary. Do you think that 1200 new sound effects have been used and 70 levels, 30 monsters, 19 Mb of textures, 8 programmable weapons (which we will talk about in more detail later), and drivable vehicles (nothing like this had been seen in HL) and much more were created? other. All this means that the excellent set of features already present in the '98 game, has been greatly improved. Gunman never gets boring and when we are about to have enough of one world, we are transported in a logical way to another planet, which differ greatly in quality and gameplay. In this way Gunman is broken into 4 real different parts, increasing its longevity. It starts with the Aztec-style jungle of the unexplored planet: plants, birds and dinosaurs characteristic of the place will be the masters. You can immediately notice the good work of the modellers, observing the various animals present in the game (especially the butterflies: they are really cute when they move in groups) or one of the most beautiful shows ever: the Renasuarus, a dinosaur of enormous dimensions that he will show up in very unpleasant and original ways. We then move to Ferrin Moon, a place filled with laboratories and robot-like aliens of unknown origin; here too, as for all the other planets, the different shades of color used for the textures and models immediately stand out. At some point in Ferrin Moon, we will see the second Gunman show: the meteor. You can see it coming big, from the sky, but the strong impact and its disastrous consequences won't be long in coming, so it's highly discouraged (except obviously masochism :D) to stay and watch the show for a long time. After more ~tours~ we will go from the western settings of Icnus to the underground laboratories of Rebar, where the game will end. Now let's move on to artificial intelligence (AI) and the new features introduced in Gunman compared to the ~father~ Half-Life. Enemies are now much smarter, faster to move, smarter to hide or set traps. If you wait for a bandit at the front door and he comes through the back, you need not be surprised anymore. You don't even have to do it anymore when the demolisher will place a contact mine in strategic places or when a Gunman, with a significantly lower firepower than yours, will take refuge and await your arrival. And what do you think about a drivable armored vehicle in an FPS? There will also be this, made very well among other things, for the first time in a game of its kind. Easy to use and with a very powerful fire, the tank will be very useful for you to overcome the most challenging parts of the western planet, where there are many resistant sentry-guns that would prevent you from continuing your mission. 1001 ways to fry your opponents If we have to establish which is the carGunman's most innovative and beautiful feature, surely our eye immediately falls on the weapons: there are 8 in all, but each one can be programmed to your liking for any type of situation. As an example, I will take the Multiple Unit Launch Engine (for friends M.U.L.E.), an evolution of the classic Rocket Launcher; here are all the configurations that you can apply to the weapon in question: LAUNCH WHEN FIRED (the simple shot after pressing the trigger) LAUNCH WHEN LOCKED (it fires only when the trigger is pressed and the sight identifies a target) FLIGHTPATH GUIDED (the rocket follows the red laser) FLIGHTPATH HOMING (the rocket pursues the targets) FLIGHTPATH SPIRAL (2 rockets are launched to form a double spiral path) TRIGGER ON IMPACT (if the rocket reaches the target, it explodes) TRIGGER ON PROXIMITY (if the rocket is close to the target, it explodes) TRIGGER TIMED (when the rocket touches the ground, it works like a simple timed grenade, exploding after 5 seconds) TRIGGER WHEN TRIPPED (the rocket will stick to the walls and a trip-mine will be activated) PAYLOAD EXPLOSIVE ( standard explosion) PAYLOAD CLUSTERBOMB (having reached the objective, it splits into 6 small explosive grenades) In case you don't have the M.U.L.E. Gunman will be able to use the ammunition of the weapon as grenades, always programmable as above. Each of the 8 weapons in the game clearly has different customizations, which you will be taught during training along with driving the powerful tank. However, when you collect a new one, not all functions will always be usable immediately, but only after having collected an upgrade. Multiplayer As Rewolf Software itself announced some time ago, in this version of Gunman: Chronicles there will be only a taste of what we will find in the future. The work was mainly concentrated on the off-line part and by choice it was decided to do everything only in the form of a basic deathmatch. In this mode we will find all the weapons of the game, and we could get to play up to 32 players at the same time. The maps that will initially be included are practically pieces of the single-player game modified for the need and unfortunately at the moment it is not possible to drive any vehicle in them. However, President Herb Flower has not ruled out that patches will be released in the future that add modes such as Capture The Flag, Opposing Force style. For now, however, you can still enjoy ~fragging~ your friends with the widely programmable arsenal available: for how long will it be enough? Conclusion We have turned it from all its sides, and finally now we can give the final decree. For Half-Life fans, Gunman: Chronicles is definitely a must but it has reached such a level that it can be purchased by any good connoisseur of single-player adventures. Taking into account the age of the engine on which the game runs, the work of the developers to improve the code, textures and models has been truly remarkable; the icing on the cake is definitely the CD full of beautiful new audio tracks that will accompany you on your adventure. There's no denying it: if you need some shopping advice, Gunman Chronicles is one of those games to absolutely put in your shopping cart. Introduction Having a version of Gunman: Chronicles in your hands (even if beta) first of all is certainly a great satisfaction. 72 levels, more than 40 hours of gameplay, 4 worlds to explore and a futuristic arsenal, all based on the Half-Life engine, which does not look its age at all (it went Gold precisely on November 8, 1998). These are the main features of the game, made by Rewolf Software (with the help of Valve) which will be sold as a stand-alone in the next few days (as I write this review, it should have already gone Gold). After a classic installation, I immediately launch the executable and enjoy the splendid introductory movie...", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
