{"name": "Arena of Valor", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/arena-of-valor-recensione.html", "text": "The fashion that is now pushing Battle Royale had already manifested itself some time ago by putting MOBAs on the pedestal. In the space of a couple of years, starting from 2012, there has been a continuous proliferation of Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas, to the point of showing monthly titles worthy of being tried: games that, unfortunately, for one reason or another other, they have seen their users dwindle more and more by losing players with the same speed with which they conquered it in the first period of life. It was a vicious circle where new productions came out, were proclaimed as absolute novelties capable of revolutionizing a genre and then were miserably lost in thin air without leaving a trace. Digging into our memory, there are very few true rivals of League of Legends who survived the genocide, with only Heroes of the Storm and DOTA 2 able to remain standing and manage their market shares very well. The most curious thing of all is that almost no one at the time had thought of transporting MOBAs to consoles as well, effectively bringing a genre closer to the largest portion of the casual public, perhaps because the management of the controls was particularly difficult to adapt to the controller or because the demand in that period did not justify a possible investment. Only Guardians of Middle Earth had broken this dogma for a few months, then surrendered to the inevitable and usual collapse. It therefore took mobile phones to revive the genre on new platforms and only last year Vain Glory and Arena of Valor recorded a large number of accesses, surprising insiders and users. It is rare to see a title born on mobile and arrive on consoles but the success of Nintendo Switch has prompted Tencent to give it a serious try, with a truly classic path: Arena of Valor started in closed beta giving only a taste of what it could give to fans of MOBAs, to then consolidate in open beta and in the most recent launch with the free to play model. The definitive MOBA on consoles There isn't much to tell as regards the basic design of Arena of Valor, given that the bases are markedly inspired by the giant Riot, not only in terms of map structure, lane management and minions but also in terms of graphic style, heroes and towers. In short, seen in this way in passing, the game could give the impression of being a mere clone determined to ride the success written by someone else, but the fact that it is unique of its kind on consoles places it overwhelmingly as a forerunner and ram's head, transforming it in that frontrunner who could kick off the invasion. For now, however, there is no sign of this assault on consoles and despite the good numbers of these days, players now seem to be distracted from the various Battle Royales due perhaps also to a lack of adequate communication which could have slightly changed the cards on the table. Fortunately, we are particularly fond of Arena of Valor, given that thanks to Tencent production our hours on the move have passed quickly in recent months, and now that the game is ready to be stripped properly we could not help but hurry with the review. It's not difficult to understand why, since Arena of Valor has everything a MOBA can offer in an unprecedented portable package. There are normal and classified 5v5 modes, unlockable only after reaching the level cap with the account, but also ARAMs, custom games and 1v1 and 3v3 for a set that is perhaps not too varied but certainly solid. Very well structured not only as regards the modalities, but also perfectly adjusted for everything that gravitates around it, including a varied although rather canonical pool of heroes, the usual management of skins and virtual currency with which to customize your favorites and the inevitable Arcana, bonuses to be included in the customization branches to increase the various statistics of the fighters in the game. We are talking about a system that is now a few years old and has already been seen on League of Legends but which does not seem to have aged badly, so as to satisfy those looking for a challenging MOBA at the right point on consoles. Difficult controls? It just takes a little practice The developers of Arena of Valor have made a particular effort to re-propose the old touch control system seen on Mobile by adapting it to the Switch Joy-Con, for an overall satisfactory result. It is perhaps not perfect and can be improved especially for melee heroes, but even skillshot-based spells, teleporters and everything that requires accurate management of directionality responds exactly as one would expect. There is no mouse and keyboard immediacy but that would have been forif exaggerated, expect the opposite. The only flaw, if you will but which is difficult to find a solution, is related to the auto-targeting of the attacks which often prefer heroic targets to units, limiting the player's freedom. A situation that you learn to manage quickly and turn in your favor. In case you have never played Arena of Valor before, however, know that it is really identical to League of Legends in account management, in the level of the characters in the game and even in the shop where you can buy items, which can be combined in different variants and perfected to give life to specific builds based on crit, damage or resistances: an element that has always kept the community alive and involved. The only difference is that all the construction of the hero's equipment can now take place well away from the core, in fact you just need to press a button on the controller and open the context menu where you can quickly buy the available items. In our weeks of testing we have never encountered connectivity problems, with the exception of the very first days after launch and the title manages to defend itself well also visually, with well-finished animations, nice effects and in general bright and lively colors, both in dock and portable mode without ever presenting frame rate problems, a clear improvement over what was seen on mobile despite the 30 fps. The need for a continuous connection perhaps does not make it exactly perfect for Switch, but now with the free of tethering and the offers of more and more gigs from the various companies this may no longer be a limit for many players. Therefore, only the character design of Arena of Valor remains questionable, uninspired and really devoid of any original idea even in the use of individual skills, even if it includes well-known characters already present in the imagination of players such as Lu Bu and other heroes of the arc narrative of the Three Kingdoms, a little too little to be able to define itself as interesting.", "date": "2018-10-07", "grade": "8.0"}
