The last few years have seen an alternation of important chapters and spin-offs with both 3D and two-dimensional mechanics, but the titles that apparently seemed the most important ones, on which more efforts and bigger budgets were invested, in the end turned out to be the most sometimes real flops. Even the recent Sonic 4, which made the most optimistic fans hope for a return to the golden years of the series, has left many with a bad taste in the mouth, either for a technical realization that is not up to par, or for a certain lack of style or excessive brevity. It is strange that instead, the various spin-offs for portable consoles have thought of keeping Sonic's honor high: from Sonic Advance to the Rush series, the guys from the Dimps team have always created little pearls that combined interesting gameplay ideas with a frenetic and, above all, supersonic speed experience. Surprisingly, the same is true for this Sonic Colors on Nintendo DS which, silencing those who feared it would only be the stupid brother of the Wii version, embarrasses Sonic 4 and gives the Nintendo portable console one of the blue hedgehog's best adventures in a while of time at this point. At the speed of colors The home version and the portable version of Sonic Colors only share the setting, the story and some of the game ideas. Eggman is carrying out his evil plans inside a space amusement park, and Sonic has the predictable purpose of stopping him, this time by visiting different themed planets and beating the bosses that await him in each of them. Then that's it. From mid-air dash and slide to homing attack, all gameplay elements, attacks or special abilities on Nintendo DS take on a very different, more frantic and faster feel as the action moves on. quickly from one screen to another on the console, up and down as if she were crazy. It is clear that, to create Sonic Colors DS, Dimps used Sonic Rush as a basis to model, taking practically all the best elements and enriching them with new and interesting additions. These novelties are mainly represented by the Wisps, the small aliens captured by Eggman and scattered along each of the levels: characterized by different colors, each of these creatures gives Sonic particular abilities, ranging from transforming into a rocket fired upwards to the ability to absorb everything that is around. Resorting to the Wisp is not always necessary to pass a level, and indeed often it can be easily done without. Still, the variety they add to each scenario is impressive, allowing you to move like never before in another Sonic: the blue Wisp turns the hedgehog into a laser beam that bounces from side to side, while the yellow one gives the ability to dig underground and avoid enemies, obstacles, or entire parts of a level. Being able to jump from wall to wall is another interesting addition, although it inevitably slows down the action. Hats off to the developers since, compared to the Rush series, this new Sonic demonstrates a better, meticulous and perfectly successful work in the level design care: probably most players prefer to dart at very high speed through the scenarios without ever stopping and looking at each other around, yet the game is able to satisfy even those looking for a less hurried experience. In fact, each level can be explored, stimulated by the quantity of objects to collect and alternative paths to find, while some secondary missions and the strict ranking system encourage you to replay the same scenario over and over again. The boss battles, then, are as spectacular and ingenious as those of Sonic Rush, with frenetic battles in which 2D and 3D mechanics alternate pleasantly. From time to time it happens to be catapulted into a new type of special level, which requires the use of the touch screen and, vaguely reminiscent of the bonus scenarios of Sonic 2, move the camera behind the protagonist and challenge the player to collect a certain number of colored balls. The DS version of Colors is a riot of colors and liveliness, both in mechanics and in aesthetics: graphically pleasing and quite varied, the game always manages to maintain a high and stable framerate, while each planet is characterized by an absolutely original style. It's almost a pity that the adventure is so short: unlike the Nintendo Wii version, each planet has an almost laughable number of levels, mFortunately, there is no shortage of timed challenges or an entire multiplayer mode with which to continue the experience even after the final showdown with Eggman.", "date": "2010-11-29", "grade": "8.5"}
