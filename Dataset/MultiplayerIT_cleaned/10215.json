In the case of Assassin's Creed 2, one of the best products that appeared during 2009, Ubisoft has foreseen the release of two expansions intended to fill the holes in the Animus memory sequences; the first, entitled The Battle of Forl, has been available on Xbox Live and PSN for a few days at the affordable price of 320 Microsoft Points and 3.99 euros respectively. Catherine and her friends The contents of the DLC are practically inserted almost at the end of the plot narrated in the main game; consequently it is necessary to have reached a precise point in the story of Ezio Auditore - or to have concluded it - in order to access the memory in question. As the title suggests, The Battle of Forl takes place entirely within or near the Romagna city already visited during the assassin's adventure; in this case, however, the protagonist's main relationship is with the character of Caterina Sforza - and marginally of Niccol Macchiavelli -, in a rapid succession of events with a strong emotional rate which, to avoid enjoying the surprise, we will avoid mentioning. Without a doubt, Caterina Sforza herself should be indicated among the greatest qualities of this expansion, an expression of that decidedly pragmatic, lustful and very little romantic Italian nobility that constitutes one of the leitmotifs of the Ubisoft product. Nonetheless, he is fundamentally a positive character, an ally of Ezio and who should in the premises provide help to the protagonist, then finally finding himself on the contrary to request it from the young Auditore. Unfortunately the quite interesting plot of The Battle of Forl is not supported by a balance and a satisfactory gameplay development. First, much of the time spent on this mission is spent fighting; starting from the assumption that this component certainly does not represent the best aspect of Assassin's Creed 2, this situation is made heavier by the large number of enemies that it will be necessary to face at the same time, often making the aggressive approach preferable with consequent furious pressing of the keys rather than the more reasoned and tactical one. Secondly, the artificial intelligence of one's companions reveals gaps especially in the cloying sequence of the siege of the citadel, certainly the most frustrating point of this DLC. The extreme brevity of The Battle of Forl, which can be completed in about an hour of play, the total absence of new objectives (or trophies), objects or places to unlock and the modest incisiveness of the events within the main plot therefore undermine the final assessment of Ubisoft's effort. The only extra element of note must be sought in the presence of a ~special memory~, thanks to which it is possible to use Leonardo's flying machine again to take a ride over Forl; without the choreographic power of the Venetian equivalent and orphan of a real objective, however, this passage is soon reduced to a rambling and not very incisive parenthesis.", "date": "2010-02-03", "grade": "5.0"}
