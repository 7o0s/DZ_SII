Having practically made the history of the video game, this genre so popular between the 80s and 90s has practically disappeared without a trace, the victim of a technological progress that could no longer accept the narrow confines of a single 4:3 screen, having to spanning larger environments, parallactic scrolling, and more complex level design. It is emblematic that Mario himself started in such a setting, when he still found himself fighting Donkey Kong, and substantially contributed to overcoming this setting with the revolution of Super Mario Bros. The place where we can still find some hints of this legendary genre is then the mobile market, in addition to the indie field, and Candies 'n Curses is a bit part of this historic tradition. Or at least, we like to think that it comes close, given that the graphic setting is in fact that and the pixelated style could be part of the nostalgic reenactment. In fact, its characteristics are reminiscent in many respects of classics such as Tumble Pop, Zupapa, Rodland or the mythological Bubble Bobble: we find ourselves forced into a single screen divided into four levels of platforms, dealing with an overcrowding of enemies they occupy a large part of the available space and with the need to continuously clear the area up to the end-of-level boss. A particular roguelike-style structure is also added to this classic mechanics, which makes us continually restart from the first level at each final death but maintaining the experience level and part of the previously earned upgrades from time to time, in order to make us still more and more competitive with each new attempt, even if forced to start (almost) all over again. The story is presented with a hilarious opening skit in a teenage horror comedy style, which shows the protagonist Molli launching herself as a challenge in what turns out to be quite a mess: revealing how the rumors about an alleged haunted house are all made up by spending one night there inside of. Except that the house is actually really haunted, indeed it is a sort of melting pot of various ectoplasmic presences that our heroine finds herself facing armed only with a torch. A very haunted house The mechanics of the game require you to move the protagonist with quick taps on the touch screen within a fixed pattern with platforms arranged on four levels, allowing right-left movement on the same platform and up-down to switch from one to another . The crux of the matter is to hit the ghosts that fill the settings with the light of the torch: therefore it is necessary to hit them in the right direction because if you are touched in any other position we suffer a consequent drop in energy and when this drops to zero the game is inexorable over. This system presents some uncertainty because when the screen is overloaded with ghosts the contacts between the sprites become difficult to understand and we often find ourselves losing energy without understanding exactly what happened, but on the other hand this can be avoided with an efficient work of continuous and fast elimination of enemies. The roguelike-style element always makes us start again from the first level but maintaining the experience acquired, therefore there is in any case a constant progression that stimulates us to always start again, while the acquisition of souls and ectoplasms during the game, real in-game currencies, allows you to invest them in upgrades for the torch and for any secondary accessory, other things that remain from time to time even after game over. The setting of the levels remains substantially the same from setting to setting, with a boss that appears after Molli has eliminated a certain pre-set amount of enemies and which represents the greatest variation in an otherwise rather monotonous gameplay in the long run, beyond the small strategic variations that require the different types of standard ghosts to deal with. Despite this basic simplicity, however, the immediacy of the controls and the irresistible charm of the graphic characterization keep us rather attached to Candies 'n Curses even after several games. Being free-to-play, the game focuses on the possibility of seeing ads or buying continues so as not to have to start from scratch, or on buying souls with real money to be able to unlock upgrades faster. The latter is probably the most dubious aspect of the mechanism, because the upgrades require very large amounts of in-game currency to be unlocked and this selectivity appears artificiously exaggerated to encourage compulsive buying. In any case, Candies 'n Curses can be easily played without spending anything, otherwise at the modest price of 5.49 euros it is possible to unlock the game without advertising.", "date": "2018-10-31", "grade": "8.0"}
