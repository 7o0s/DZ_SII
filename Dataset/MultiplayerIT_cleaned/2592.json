It could be said that a team that wins does not change, except that Dadish was anything but a perfect title and would probably have needed a sequel that would improve some features rather than simply adding more meat to the fire. Dadish 2 is therefore a more of the same in the most literal sense of the term, for the sake of all those who had appreciated the original. Gameplay and controls Consistent with what was done by the predecessor, even in Dadish 2 the story does not represent a pillar of the playful experience, despite being quite funny and being able to count on lines of dialogue capable of eliciting a few smiles. The protagonist is always the same radish who has to find and save his numerous and colorful little children who this time got lost during a visit to their father's workplace: in short, little more than a pretext to justify 50 levels which end with the precisely with the reunification with one of the children and who adopt solutions and structures completely similar to those of the first chapter. The stages are therefore rather short and linear, with a coefficient of challenge that is all based on the fact that a minimal contact of the protagonist with an enemy or a pointed surface is enough to go down and thus have to start over from the beginning. However, the rhythms are much more staid than a Super Meat Boy or a Celeste, so the difficulty never reaches truly hardcore peaks, even if moments of frustration cannot be excluded for causes unfortunately unrelated to the level design. Just like in the first episode, here too the touch controls never give the impression of being precise to the right point, although the inputs are reduced to touching two distinct portions of the screen to go in the two directions and perform a tap to jump. It's a pity to note that Young did not want to take advantage of this second episode to improve a situation that was certainly not flawless, even if it must be said that with the support for wireless controllers there was at least a small sop. Technical realization and contents The total immobility of Dadish 2 is also evident by looking at the graphics of the product, completely indistinguishable from that of the predecessor: in short, pixel art is fine, maintaining a style is fine but it was reasonable to expect a little more on this front too. Thomas Young's title therefore remains as aesthetically pleasing as it is anonymous, with a pinch of originality that involves only the characters on the screen but which is otherwise copied word for word from the ABC of the old school two-dimensional platform. The same goes for the sound, which does not feature any noteworthy reason, either in terms of music or in terms of effects and here too it is, however, quite recycled from the first episode. In short, as mentioned at the beginning, we find ourselves almost embarrassed to review a game so equal to itself, but this is what Dadish 2 offers: new levels for the exact same playful experience, for better or for worse. If you really want to split hairs, some portions of the stage that deviate slightly from the status quo and some new types of enemies could be ascribed to the list of novelties, but these are really almost imperceptible details in the context of a product obviously designed to rest on its laurels .", "date": "2021-02-12", "grade": "7.0"}
