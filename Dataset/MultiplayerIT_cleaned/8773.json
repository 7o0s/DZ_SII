Indeed, it is necessary to go back to the disputed Dark Sector to see the company entirely dedicated to a project of its own given that in recent years it had contributed to the development of the PlayStation 3 conversion of the first BioShock and to the multiplayer component of BioShock 2 and Homefront. It is therefore thanks to the trust of 2K Games and of an important but not extremely well-known franchise that the Canadian boys have been able to collect the gaming legacy of Jackie Estacado to try to amaze us again. A rather heavy legacy given that the prequel, developed by Starbreeze Studios, despite obvious defects in its gameplay was literally adored by a large number of gamers for the engaging story told, to the point of electing it a cult of its time. Will the Digital Extremes guys have managed to live up to expectations? Where were we? Two years have passed since the episodes told in the epilogue of the first The Darkness. Jackie, our protagonist, is now the Don of the most impressive mafia family in the city. No one has the courage to oppose him or even timidly try to test his strength and abilities. He's rich, he's powerful, he's even respected and loved by his goons but he's still sad. It's sad because no woman has been able to fill the void in her heart left by the death of Jenny Romano, the only girl who had been able to stay close to Jackie and had loved him madly, also managing to keep the darkness at bay within her. him and, in a tragic moment told in an incredibly engaging way in the first The Darkness, she had been killed in front of his eyes to protect him. Just Jenny's ghost will haunt our protagonist for most of the sequel in a single player campaign which unfortunately will never come close to the narrative thickness of the first chapter, neither in terms of complexity nor depth but above all for longevity. It is indeed true that The Darkness II gets rid of all those delays represented by the useless secondary quests and the vacuous exploratory moments between one subway and the next but at the same time unfortunately fails to offer those purely narrative phases in which the psychological terror was well highlighted experienced by Jackie and her atrocious difficulty in curbing the darkness and its infinite traps. And so, alongside the beautiful introductory sequence set in a restaurant and also seen in the game demo, we happen to play other semi-interactive sequences that try, not with great success, to give narrative depth to a gameplay that is otherwise completely unbalanced towards pure action. In particular during our fight against the Brotherhood and its boss Victor Valente intent on taking control of The Darkness, we will return over and over again to try to escape from a strange asylum whose existence will only be explained at the end of the adventure through a nice epilogue (even with a double ending) and the audacious cliffhanger that gives us hope for a third chapter. But as mentioned at the beginning of the paragraph, alongside a problem of the thickness of the story being told, what makes one turn up the nose the most once the campaign of The Darkness II is completed, is realizing that it took just six hours to see the titles queue, just a little more if you play at the two highest difficulty levels (out of the four available). There is no doubt that we are not there on the longevity front but the multiplayer component consisting of eighteen missions partially helps us, seven of which are connected to each other to form a real additional campaign. The work done by Digital Extremes on this front is truly commendable despite being completely dedicated to the cooperative aspect without a competitive multiplayer. In practice, the player is given the opportunity to choose between four different characters, each with its own special weapon that feeds on darkness, a power and three specific talent trees. In this case the gameplay leans strongly towards pure action with numerous phases where you have to defend targets and resist attacks of increasing difficulty but there are even bosses and more generally you can see the developer's work in offering new locations and situations very excited game that give their best when four people play online at the same time. It is also possible to play offline, but unfortunately in solitary lacking the split screen our advice is todon't miss at least the multiplayer campaign which adds a couple of abundant hours and offers an interesting parallel look at what is told in the single player. Jaaaaaackie... you're miiiiio! And since we've started hinting at some of the action, let's dive into the details. The Darkness II, like its prequel, falls right into the genre of first-person shooters. However, unlike the work done by Starbreeze Studios with its predecessor, and above all in total contrast to what has been said about the story, Digital Extremes has really done a great job by offering the player incredible freedom on the fighting style to adopt. Now it is possible to equip two light weapons and one heavy, the former also in hybrid akimbo mode (a pistol and an uzi for example, rather than two machine guns) with the backbones that are used to fire and the digital cross to change the paraphernalia. Instead, the triggers are required to use the tentacles of Darkness that will accompany Jackie in her brief adventure made of blood and flesh as long as she is in the dark. In practice, the right tentacle is used to cut horizontally and vertically obstacles and above all enemies while the left one allows you to interact with the scenario by collecting practically any element and even stunned enemies. It will thus be possible to rip a door off a car or take a sign off the ground to use it as a shield and possibly throw it at your opponents to cut them in half. Poles, rods, bars and other sharp blunt objects can be used to impale enemies and with the help of a particular talent it will even be possible to detonate any type of object thrown at criminals on contact. Freedom is total and the intense combat that often sees dozens of opponents on the screen at the same time manages to give enormous satisfaction when you have full control of the Darkness. As mentioned above, it is also possible to collect opponents when they are stunned and perform particular executions, these too unlockable by investing in talents, to restore energy, ammunition, rather than earning a temporary shield of darkness or recharging Jackie's special powers. The latter are of two types, which can be called up with the triangle and circle keys, and allow you to launch a swarm of insects rather than loading your weapons with bullets of darkness: much more powerful than normal and above all infinite for a short period of time. And we come to talk about talents. Each killing committed allows you to earn Essence in a variable amount based on the choreography and fantasy of the assassination. This ~substance~ can then be spent by interacting with special altars scattered throughout the levels to acquire numerous talents divided into four different ramifications. The idea is interesting and works quite well because it forces the player to specialize since he will never be able to enhance all the skills with a single passage of the campaign but will have to make a choice based on the fighting style. But that's not all because obviously there are also the darklings involved, the small and immoral beings that the Darkness is able to summon. Forget the specializations seen in the first episode: now Jackie will be accompanied by a single completely autonomous demon except for a couple of scripted sequences in which we can use it to help Estacado. The choice does not weigh particularly heavily in terms of gameplay and indeed seems to offer something more on the narrative front since a sort of brotherly bond will be built between our protagonist and his favorite darkling during the game. And then it's always nice to see him go around on his own to urinate on dead enemies or bite off their heads to distract them. Playstation 3 trophies The game offers the classic 51 trophies: in addition to the inevitable platinum that can be unlocked by collecting all the others, we find three gold, four silver, 31 bronze and 12 hidden. At a first pass of the two single and multiplayer campaigns, we did not struggle to conquer exactly half of the available trophies which are therefore linked to the completion of the two adventures and to some contextual actions such as the murder of certain enemies. There is obviously no shortage of all those trophies related to killing criminals in absurd and choreographic ways capable of stimulating a certain amount of imagination and the need to repeat some passages over and over again. Lights and shadows The dualism between darkness and brightness that pervades The Darkness II has both technical and gameplay repercussions. Let's start with the latter. Digital Extremes' project focuses much of its tactical aspect on theJackie's need to stay in the dark as much as possible. In fact, when exposed to light, our protagonist will lose the powers of darkness and his energy will no longer regenerate automatically. When immersed in the light, the view loses focus and clears up to simulate excessive glare, making aiming and moving around in search of shelter concretely difficult. It therefore becomes essential to shoot lampposts, chandeliers and more generally any destructible light source in the shortest possible time, an action that in the long run tends to become a bit boring in its repetitiveness and at the same time the developer was able to vary the type of enemies introducing opponents equipped with portable beacon and flashbang. Precisely on the enemy front there are also bad guys equipped with armor or shields to take cover but unfortunately from the point of view of intelligence we are quite in the habit: the less protected opponents tend very much to take cover and get stuck behind their positions, while the more resistant ones they use the head-on charge tactic without worrying too much about our firepower. Information known since the day of its announcement, The Darkness II is completely made in cel shading thanks to the artistic decision to draw and color by hand most of the graphic assets of the game. The result is really pleasant with very evident color contrasts that make the title rather original at a glance. In particular, the incredible violence of the game in terms of dismemberment, disembowelment and free gore, stand out well with a bright palette where the red of the blood stands out on the scenario. All of this is then combined with animations of the bodies and above all of the well-made facials which duly compensate for a general poverty of details in the polygonal models and above all in the scenarios, despite the fact that these offer great interaction thanks to the tentacles of Darkness. The work done on the frame rate is also very good, which is always firmly anchored on thirty frames per second but, on the other hand, the almost total absence of particles and volumetric fumes as well as the management of the lights reduced to the bone helps in this sense. On the other hand, it is a pity for the absence of a noteworthy soundtrack while on the dubbing front we note the excellent localization of the speech in Italian despite evident lip synchronization problems and it is interesting the choice of 2K Games to leave the original dubbing selectable in English language.", "date": "2012-02-07", "grade": "8.3"}
