If Atlus cradles the Nintendo handheld with the Etrian Odyssey series, on PlayStation Vita it is small software houses such as Experience Inc. that experiment and try new ways to reinvigorate a genre that is slowly dying out. Stranger of Sword City, in this sense, is an anomaly because it was also released for Xbox and PC, but it lends itself above all to the fleeting games that a portable console allows for two simple reasons: first, it is better to play it in small doses; second, it's better to throw the PlayStation Vita out the window than to kick the Xbox One first and then the TV screen. Does that seem a little exaggerated to you? Read on... Stranger of Sword City is a tremendously difficult RPG that will test your patience Lost after midnight The premise of Stranger of Sword City is the best part of the game: probably inspired by the story Four past midnight by Stephen King and the legendary television series Lost, the adventure begins on board a plane that leaves from Japan and ends in another dimension. We are the passengers, the ~Strangers~ who, coming from another reality, possess supernatural abilities a bit like the Kryptonians who arrive on Earth, but without the blue overalls and red fluttering capes. Even if, in fact, there are the latter: just imagine them or, even better, choose a particularly imaginative portrait among the many available in two versions when we create our character. One of Experience Inc.'s best ideas was to propose an option a la Star Ocean: The Last Hope International, thanks to which it is possible to select the beautiful illustrations by En Okishiji or the decidedly more cartoonish and - let's face it - more banal ones by Yoko Tsukamoto. Once our alter ego and his companions have been created, we will get to know the bizarre characters who live in this world and we will discover that the only way to get home is hidden in the crystallized blood of the Lineage, particularly insidious monsters that only we are able to to break down. The problem is that there are three factions competing for these crystals, and it will be up to us to choose who to trust: our decisions will influence the story and the ending of the game. Unfortunately the story, which starts in the fourth, soon leaves much more room for gameplay, and although it may seem counterintuitive, it is not a particularly positive factor, since the drive to play to discover the secrets of this world and the fate that awaits our group of foreigners, anonymous cannon fodder for monsters hiding in labyrinths full of traps and loot... PSVita trophies Given the general difficulty of the game, it is obvious that getting your hands on 27 bronze, 15 silver and two gold trophies will not be a walk, if you aim for the platinum one. In addition to completing the game, among other things, you will have to hunt down numerous Lineages and find the best items. You are dead! The very long tutorial of Stranger of Sword City only lets you glimpse the potential of the game and, indeed, risks boring anyone with a minimum of experience with dungeon crawlers. The title signed by Experience Inc. in fact does not offer anything particularly innovative, apart from a whole series of inconveniences that soon end up transforming it into one of the most frustrating exponents of the genre. The foundations are the usual: a party is created, carefully choosing not only the illustrations that portray our allies, but also and above all the role that each of them will assume in combat in an attempt to form a versatile team in every respect. When the introductory phase finally ends and you are free to explore the first game areas, Stranger of Sword City is ready to bring us to our knees and make us regret being born. The dynamics are those of first-person dungeon crawlers: you explore a labyrinth ideally divided into boxes in search of loot, kill enemies, gain experience points and level up to become more powerful and have a better chance of defeating our real targets. The game also offers the unprecedented dynamic of ambushes, which allows us to stop at a point on the map and wait, invisible, for the passage of a stronger enemy than usual: if we defeat him before he runs away, we will earn much more experience points and items . The problem, in fact, is to succeed in the enterprise. The difficulty of Strangerof Sword City is nothing short of surreal: already in the first dungeon it happens that you eliminate a solitary enemy in a few seconds and then come across, shortly after, a group of opponents against whom there is no hope of victory. It is not easy to establish the superfine balance of titles such as Etrian Odyssey, which have several episodes and revisions behind them, but Experience Inc. in this case has not even tried, and the impression is that the game puts patience to the test of the player and his willingness to devote himself to an exasperating grind of experience points released with a dropper. As if that weren't enough, the permanent death of the units is also included: there is a value that depends on the age of the characters and which determines the number of times they can die before disappearing completely. The cost to restore this value is exorbitant - like everything else in the game, for that matter - and at some point you find yourself restarting the game to fix some inadvertent mistake that deprived us of a character we had grown for hours and hours and for which we have no replacement. The flip side, of course, is the enormous satisfaction one feels when defeating an enemy after carefully planning the battle, but are those few moments of jubilation really worth the hours and hours of frustration?", "date": "2016-04-21", "grade": "5.0"}
