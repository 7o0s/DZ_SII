Both are related to the idea of supplementary content of a video game to be purchased separately. Over the years, however, a distinction has become necessary. The expansions have been around for several decades, well before the infamous horse armor DLC from The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion introduced the modern concept of ~downloadable content~. The distinction is all about content: DLCs are now seen as insignificant additions that are charged dearly. The expansions, for their part, which have become rarer, are large pieces of the game that add hours of gameplay and, often, expand the basic experience in several directions. Many developers, when placing expansions on the market, are keen to underline this difference, partly to ennoble their product, partly because it is right to distinguish a set of clothes sold for its weight in gold from, perhaps, a new campaign. Eternal Lords definitely falls within the set of expansions and adds so much content to Age of Wonders III (here you will find our review of the base game) to be considered essential for fans. We are faced with a really big job that greatly improves the already excellent starting point. It would really be a shame for someone to mistake such an offer for regular DLC. Is Eternal Lords the perfect expansion? How much does it add to Age of Wonders III? The new campaign The most relevant addition is definitely the new campaign. Triumph Studios has designed it for already experienced players and has taken care to make it more difficult than the basic campaigns and that of the first expansion, Golden Realms. As Arvik, the heir to a realm of the Frostlings (one of the new races), you must reclaim your due. Arvik is not a normal human being, but a necromancer, therefore capable of controlling the undead (we'll talk about it later). During the campaign the player will not only have to fight against numerous enemies, including the aforementioned Frostlings and the Tigrans, another new race, but also make decisions that will lead him to one of three different endings. If we want to quantify everything, in terms of hours of play we are talking about several dozen, even if for a turn-based strategy it is always difficult to establish the actual longevity. In this case we say that the campaign is replayable at least three times to see all the endings, so there are all the various extras such as multiplayer or the random map generator, in which all the content of Eternal Lords has been integrated, which further lengthen the experience. Realistically, an enthusiast couldn't ask for more. But let's find out all the news in more detail. Races and classes Speaking of the campaign, we have already mentioned the two new races, namely the Frostlings and the Tigrans. The first, humanoid inhabitants of the north, led by a queen as powerful as she is haughty, live as brigands raiding the warmer regions. They specialize in ice magic and the most brutal offensive techniques. The latter are half men and half felines. They mostly live in desert areas. Their god is the Sun, and they specialize in building huge tombs. In combat they are quick attackers and like to transform into panthers. The aforementioned class of necromancers should instead be quite clear in the philosophy that distinguishes it. Controlling the undead means having the power to transform conquered cities and sites into huge graveyards, in which to produce armies of ghouls and other arcane creatures such as the Banshee or the Bone Collectors. The new units offer new tactics to approach battles, which we remember being fought directly by the player, with the new campaign that seems to be made to try them, since it offers almost immediately challenging fights providing us with an army made up of very different units and clashes against high-level enemies. Obviously the best comes out in the advanced stages, when the fighting between larger armies begins. More news In addition to those already listed, Eternal Lords offers many other new features for Age of Wonders III players. Among these are cataclysms, destructive natural events that can literally turn the tide of a game. For example, imagine that you are clearly behind an opponent and need time to regroup. If you're lucky, an army of trolls will come to attack and distract him. If you're unlucky the army of trolls will attack you, or you'll find yourself immersed in fog with your vision of the units greatly reduced. Another interesting novelty, which gives greater depth to the game, is the nnew system of influence on races. Now attacking a city of dwarves will displease all the dwarven population, likewise, razing a city of humans will enrage all humans in the kingdom. Improving relations with the various races serves to obtain various bonuses, both in terms of extra skills and in terms of greater economic income (happy citizens pay taxes more willingly). The love of the people also allows you to obtain a new type of victory, called the Unifier, which requires you to build Beacon units after growing affinity with a race. There are other secondary novelties, such as new treasures, new objects and the possibility of playing multiplayer by email, a mode added for everyone through a free update.", "date": "2015-04-20", "grade": null}
