We had described most of the contents and innovations implemented with this DLC with detail and expertise in our previous trial that we invite you to consult; for this reason in the review you are reading we will try to summarize them very quickly to try to concentrate on our evaluations and on the judgment of the new work by the guys from Warsaw. But what we can already tell you is that we could never have hoped for a better way to say goodbye to Geralt and the Witcher saga. And so even if the white-haired Strigo will be confined to the cellar of games without sequels, at least we can consider ourselves satisfied with the last adventure spent in his company. Blood and Wine is the excellent DLC that rounds off The Witcher saga in style Once upon a time... The story of Blood and Wine, exactly as it happened with Hearts of Stone, can be considered parallel to that of Wild Hunt. Taking advantage of the artifice of an unprecedented region, Touissant, completely unrelated to the war with the Wild Hunt and the Nilfgaardian Empire, the developers were able to set up a narrative arc that involves Geralt simply for his role as Strigo and demon hunter and beasts. For this reason, those who are still struggling with the base game will be able to easily choose when to devote themselves to the DLC, provided they have reached at least the end of the first act. In reality it is clear from the moment you set foot in the new, splendid area, that the add-on is dedicated body and soul to those who The Witcher 3 has already digested it, given that it will be essential to have a protagonist of level 34 or less, upgraded and equipped properly. Also like Hearts of Stone, it will be possible to start the expansion directly from the main menu, completely ignoring the base game. In doing so we will end up with an enhanced Geralt complete with medium-power basic equipment and with numerous skill points to spend. It will not be possible to follow the Wild Hunt main quest, but the base game will still be required to be able to play Blood and Wine in this way too, since it is to all intents and purposes a normal DLC. However, where the expansion differs strongly from the previous one is precisely in the story and in particular in the missions. If Hearts of Stone shone for the main plot but, in our opinion, was very poor in secondary activities, Blood and Wine is without risk of contradiction a much more complete and articulated add-on. Both the main quest and above all the secondary missions and the sea of activities, unpublished mini-games, collectibles and pure exploration stimuli are completely on another level: much better integrated into the scenario and above all decidedly more numerous and varied. Toussaint, with its green hills, vineyards, fairy-tale, romantic and light-hearted atmosphere, rural buildings, palaces of power with evident elven architecture but, above all, its poor inhabitants, errant knights and master winegrowers, returns a connotation of originality and an alienating feeling that in an instant made us feel in a world so different from the one to which The Witcher has accustomed us, but at the same time also familiar. There will in fact be the characters who will enter the scene and who will be well known to those who have devoured the books of the saga, but above all that gloomy atmosphere and that impression of being one step away from an inevitable catastrophe is always present. The whole plot revolves around a beast with a thirst for black magic who is carrying out a series of horrifying murders, apparently without following any logical thread. In reality, Geralt will soon discover that the serial killer is following a very specific direction, condemning the knights who have not respected the virtues of the chivalric order and who are guilty of nefarious sins. And soon supernatural forces, vampires, horrible curses and tortures will come into play. In short, everything to which the saga has always accustomed us and with which it has been able to amaze us on several occasions. For information, we can tell you that, to complete only and exclusively the main quest, plus a handful of practically essential secondary ones to make the most of the gameplay novelties, it will hardly take you less than 15-18 hours. Probably even more. If, on the other hand, you want to devote your heart and soul to all the contents of the DLC, you can easily double this number, and we are probably making a downward estimate. For the numbersovi fans but especially for the old And if we really can't find negative elements to criticize on the narrative aspect, the same can be said in terms of its mechanics. It's amazing how CD Projekt, although it can afford to rest on its laurels and ~limit itself~ to distributing these new contents without worrying in the least about the base game, still finds the time and desire to fix and improve the gameplay. Especially at the interface level which, for the umpteenth time, has been largely rethought, adding a series of options and features loudly requested by players and necessary to speed up menu navigation and inventory and journal management of quests which, given the amount of content, could fill up too quickly with dozens of items that are difficult to manage. All these small but incisive innovations will surely delight players who return to The Witcher, perhaps after leaving it aside for months, and will also be implemented for free in the base game with the inevitable patch that will anticipate the distribution of the DLC by a few days . Blood and Wine will then bring an important addition regarding mutations that will have repercussions on the entire system of talents for those who have purchased the expansion. By spending skill points and major mutagens, in fact, we will be able to unlock twelve different mutations that will give us as many unpublished passive bonuses. However, we will be able to have only one active and its color, which respects the usual four of the mutagens, will allow the player to mount up to four additional talents of the same color in addition to the twelve usual slots. Obviously a separate discussion can be made for the yellow mutations that will allow you to activate talents of multiple colors. These passive bonuses are able to significantly alter your style of play by introducing the possibility of inflicting much more damage with weapons and signs or, for example, the ability to freeze the enemy with Aard magic or, again, the ability to become invulnerable for a few seconds if you are mortally wounded. It is obvious and obvious that, basically, the management of the character and above all the combat system remain those that made The Witcher 3 famous - and for some odious -, but the developer's ability to continuously introduce some new variable to the system. And then of course there will be a sea of new equipment, including both a brand new Witcher outfit - that of the Manticore - but also the possibility of dyeing the individual pieces of the outfits owned so as to offer a small possibility of more customization. Furthermore, it will also be possible to recover the recipes to enhance the previous Strigo equipment by a further level, bringing them to the rank of grand master and thus unlocking an incremental bonus linked to the number of pieces actually equipped. And there's even a housing component, thanks, given that Geralt will get his hands, fairly early in the game, on a winery, Corvo Bianco and, like the new Ezio Auditores in Monteriggioni, we will be able to spend all our money to restore it and make it self-sufficient, complete with a table for armor, whetstones, a stable and even a comfortable bed to rest on. This small additional component which soon turns out to have almost only an aesthetic function, also allows you to get your hands on the alchemy laboratory, a crucial element to be able to ~disassemble~ the possessed mutagens and reduce them to their primary color. Obviously with a view to exploiting them later with the new character growth system. Add to that sea of stuff an expanded bestiary with a handful of new creatures, encounters with special enemies and real bosses, and in a moment you too will realize that Blood and Wine is indeed an expansion with all the trappings in which the months of work by CD Projekt are clearly evident. Beautifully poetic Technically there is little to add to what has already been said in the past review of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and the one relating to the first Hearts of Stone expansion. The title is always and in any case excellent from a graphic point of view with the addition, on this occasion, of the unprecedented splendor guaranteed by the new area, Toussaint. The wine atmosphere that is so reminiscent of the splendid French and Tuscan hills, with its bright colours, green trees and flowering bushes is perfectly recreated and combines beautifully with the darker areas of cemeteries and ruined areas and with the wonderful capital full of life and fascinating elven architecture. You will get lost with great pleasure in the area implemented with Blood and Winand which, due to its vastness, is probably slightly less than the extension of Skellige, but adds much more land and above all has a decidedly higher density of points of interest. As if all this weren't enough, the DLC also contains a handful of unreleased songs of excellent workmanship, including the brand new theme and a couple of revisited songs for the occasion. The English dubbing remains set to the usual quality, while the Italian is relegated to subtitles only. However, we have to complain about a long series of bugs and problems that afflicted our review code. In fact, we encountered numerous graphic imperfections: from the interpenetration of models and objects to animations that entered a loop or that were interrupted, leaving humans and animals ~stuck~. On a couple of occasions we were also unable to complete some side missions due to enemies not appearing or getting stuck under the ground. Probably this time the developer had less time than expected to work on cleaning up the code and it seemed right to point out this one, obvious negative side of Blood and Wine.", "date": "2016-05-25", "grade": "8.8"}
