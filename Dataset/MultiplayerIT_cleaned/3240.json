In addition to being two very successful titles since their debut, they have also been re-proposed a few months apart on PC and, in the case of Bayonetta, the re-edition paired with the sequel has also been added on Nintendo Switch. However redundant, however, it seemed right to analyze these new ports too, above all to avoid any problems due to the technical aspect. Bayonetta: the now mature and experienced witch The witch born at Platinum Games from the brilliant inventiveness of Hideki Kamiya and his team still represents a real point of reference for stylish action today. The genre born precisely from the same Japanese author with Devil May Cry had been able to reach, with Bayonetta, a definitive state of grace. Unfortunately, the PlayStation 3 version suffered from a number of technical problems that had sunk its perception by users, without ruining the reputation acquired over time also and above all thanks to the Xbox 360 version, substantially better than the counterpart. The first chapter of the trilogy (waiting for the third title to show up again) tells the awakening and return to the fore of the witch who gives the game its name, capable as she is of fighting masterfully and adding to her melee skills also four guns on as many limbs. The campaign, divided into the usual iconic missions, ends in a dozen hours without too many narrative peaks, but with that taste for trash that has always been the prerogative of the genre since its inception. Despite the tamarra and not very thorough facade, Bayonetta's imagery is still more interesting and refined than one might expect from such a title, thanks also to the deepening of the universe that took place subsequently with the second chapter, the latter but exclusive to Nintendo. From the gameplay point of view, the icing on the cake of an action system already run in over the years can be found in the so-called Witch Time: a technique practiced by the witches of Umbra and useful for slowing down the time around them. In the use of the gameplay this element only adds a very important plan to the sequence of combos: dodging. Being able to use this technique at the right time involves slowing down time for our opponents and not for us, a detail that allows us to completely change the tide of battle. Activating the Witch Time means giving us time to deal more blows, to easily fight more enemies together and also to activate a series of quick time events that become the flagship of some of the most inspired boss fights of the decade. The choice to include this mechanic is what made Bayonetta the masterpiece it is still today, capable of not suffering in the slightest from the passage of time. Mastering the styles, the different combinations of firearms and the Witch Time means reaching the maximum expression of the gameplay of the game, pushing us to want to complete each encounter without ever being hit. think the usual scores so dear to Platinum Games games. Each section is in fact divided into ~verses~ at the end of which a score is assigned which is an average of the values achieved during the segment itself. From a technical point of view, on PS4 Pro the game performs very well, maintaining the granite 60fps already seen a few years ago on PC and making all Sony users forget the past with pleasure. Difficult to expect a jaw-breaking title from the point of view of the polygonal count, but the Bayonetta curves are still all in their place and, let's face it, this is the only thing that really matters. Vanquish: ten years and many slips later Looking back, we realize that ten years ago in Platinum Games, among many, there was still Shinji Mikami who, in addition to being Kamiya's mentor, is also one of the most important game designers in the history of the medium. Vanquish really represents an emblem of games capable of showcasing his genius. Although it does not represent his most successful title, as well as an intellectual property that has never been revived, Platinum Games' third-person shooter is still playfully unattainable by most of its competitors. We are in a future in which the human being is called to space colonization and, under the control of DARPA agent Sam Gideon, we are called upon to repel the attack by the Order of the Red Star directed at the orbiting station where we are. Qhis narrative arc is short and without particular peaks of intensity, on the other hand Platinum Games is certainly not known for its extraordinarily deep plots. Despite this, the progression in the story runs smoothly and can be seen and heard, above all thanks to a gameplay with a very high adrenaline rate. Exactly like in the case of Bayonetta, but like in many other games in the history of the Japanese team, Vanquish builds all its progression on the shoulders of a single and ingenious gameplay element: the slide. Taking advantage of Sam's special suit equipped with thrusters, it is in fact possible to launch at high speed for tens of meters on the asphalt. This element makes the progression within the maps and the clashes among the most interesting and original that the genre has given us. Although one may feel immortal, the slide is also capable of overheating the suit to the point of making survival difficult, inserting that tactical element into the equation which pushes the player to dose his matches between a sprint and a cover, so as not to always stay one step away from death. Just the covers conclude a run-in and very successful system, above all because they took weight from another giant of the genre: Gears of War. What unfortunately still leaves the title dry-mouthed today is its poor longevity and the almost total lack of extras, elements that make it an almost one-shot experience. Adrenaline-pumping, successful and unforgettable, but still fast and narratively inclusive. This only cons of the production is certainly dampened by a price and a total offer which, in this collection, makes the expense made absolutely sensible and which will hardly make you regret even a single cent. From a technical point of view, Vanquish also takes up the excellent work carried out on the remastering released on PC and we baste a console version that on PS4 Pro never drops a single frame and that brings back all the excellent sensations we had a few years ago. It too, like the witch of Umbra, certainly does not stand out for its polygonal count and details, but even today it can be seen and does not disturb too much even an eye accustomed to modern-day photorealism.", "date": "2020-02-17", "grade": "8.7"}
