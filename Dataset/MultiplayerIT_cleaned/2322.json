The FS2000 engine was decidedly poor: very heavy (the framerate even on very powerful computers was decidedly insufficient, so as to make correct and precise control of the vehicle), not entirely visually satisfying (the major flaw was the small number of structures and/or vegetation between one inhabited area and another) and with problems loading the new textures and new models to display (all manifested with small, but very annoying little pauses during these loads). The new simulator is different, very different: the graphics engine has been rewritten and new technical and graphic solutions have been implemented to provide an exciting experience also from a graphic point of view. Let's start with the major innovation: the AutoGen. This new feature allows you to always have realistic scenarios and not to have desert areas where instead there are populous or nature-rich territories. But how does this AutoGen work? Each area is characterized by urbanization and vegetation data and it will be the task of the new feature to fill the area over which we will fly over (only when we are below a certain altitude) with houses (the most varied) and vegetation in order to recreate the most real possible representation. What is surprising is that the presence of a greater number of objects in the field of view does not seem to negatively affect the performance of the game: in fact, it goes from 10 fps in maximum resolution conditions (maximum details) to 60/70 frames per second with a lower resolution and less visual quality (in my case I'm talking about a decidedly not latest generation processor, a pentium 600 and a Gforce2 graphics card). However, I recommend setting the visual settings so as not to go below 20 frames, otherwise it will be difficult to precisely control the aircraft. In addition to the AutoGen novelty, Flight Simulator 2002's graphics overall are much improved and very satisfying (it is true that in a simulation of this type the visual aspect is not the most important characteristic, but certainly in this case one cannot than to congratulate the development team for the excellent work done). And I add that those very annoying slowdowns in FS2000 are almost completely absent in the new chapter, even if the texture loading times, which occur every time we load or choose a new flight, have increased slightly (it lasts about ten seconds). Lots of news One of the many innovations is the virtual cockpit. With your joystick or your control stick (which however must have the hat-switch) you can look around inside the cockpit of your aircraft. That's right: you will be able to look at the panel, the cockpit, the exterior from every possible angle and not just from the usual fixed angles. Of course the control panel is fully interactive and functional. One of the major limitations in FS2000 was the discontinuity between the cockpit (still present in FS2002 and completely identical to before) and the outside world. With the ~virtual cockpit~ everything is much more realistic; you can switch from the control panel view to the exterior view simply by moving your gaze. Also the feeling of actually being in the cockpit is much greater (much better than having a dummy panel at the bottom of the screen). VRF pilots will benefit greatly from this. Lots of news The other big news of this version is the ATC system, acronym for Air Traffic Control. As the manual points out, you will be able to fly completely disregarding this new function (that is, you will not be obliged to communicate your position to anyone). Only if you want to do things right and achieve maximum realism (and the greatest satisfaction), then you will have to learn to use radio communications. Nothing too complicated, but interesting and engaging so much that you won't be able to do without it anymore. AI Traffic (Artificial Intelligence Traffic) has been implemented together with the interactive ATC system. In practice, the airspace and airport will be occupied by other aircraft that will take your presence into account and will behave accordingly (although it happened to me that during take-off a plane crashed into me.. maybe it's my fault that I was literally lost looking for the runway to take off from). The implemented AI Traffic causes the sky to be animated and in andIn fact, in the vicinity of large airports, there is considerable traffic. But are there also flaws? Unfortunately. Let's start with the first: the price. The PRO version costs around 100 euros and the normal one a little less, but still definitely more than the other video games. However, the criticism of the price is easily circumvented if one considers that the longevity of the product is practically close to infinity if one considers that AI traffic randomly generates air traffic, that the whole globe is included in the scenarios and that thanks to programs of third parties the program will be updated in every single part (scenarios, planes and all the rest). Another small flaw: the weather conditions have remained almost unchanged, but the transition from one area with certain weather conditions to another with different ones is not gradual but sharp and instantaneous. Nothing that compromises playability, but realism in these cases if he's going to be blessed. Another sad note: the manual is only in PDF format (to tell the story, the whole manual is well done and really impressive also in terms of quantity). But the fact that inside the box there isn't a shred of manual (except for the introduction of a few pages) could annoy some buyers (I don't feel like making judgments, but I must say that I can understand that after spending a certain sum, it would also be nice not to have to print 400 plus pages of the manual at one's own expense). Successful landing. I'd like to talk a little about the multiplayer game, which can give more reasons for joy for fans of the series. After installing a special program (something like gamespy, but faster and lighter) you can view all the sessions in progress and you can enter a channel to watch and ask for information on the ~mission~ to be carried out. Roger Wilko or some other voice chat program is usually required to better coordinate the game over the network. Too bad there isn't the possibility of flying in a general server that collects all the virtual pilots (it would be very interesting to create a persistent virtual world in which to fly and communicate with the other pilots, without necessarily having to enter a server created by someone else user). Evolution or revolution? In conclusion, Flight Simulator 2002 is a very interesting evolution of the series (already well made). Considering the target audience for which this product is intended, it can be said with certainty that FS has reached a truly remarkable level. This version is what fans of the series have been waiting for for a long time. And for everyone else? Well I can only say that I (who am not a DOC enthusiast) got goosebumps when with my Boeing 747, I lined up at the runway and after requesting take-off at the control tower, I reached the maximum the power of the engines. Truly an experience that I recommend to everyone (for a moment I really felt in the cockpit of that monster with wings). What more do you want from a simulation? Meaning of Flight Simulator I would like to start by explaining what FS is and what can be expected from a title of the series baked by Microsoft: a civilian flight simulator. However, it is not enough, it must be added that, to optimize the market share on which it can refer, Flight Simulator tries to satisfy the appetites of the various lovers of the genre. This means that you can't expect from FS a realistic and complex simulation like the old and very expensive Elite Flight Simulator (unknown to most users). Flight Simulator is not FAA certified; this means that it cannot be used in place of a real flight simulator (one of those used to gain experience without risking one's life, before setting foot in a real cockpit); the fact remains that FS is realistic enough to offer a tool to have fun and learn a lot about civil flight (or learn while having fun).", "date": "2001-12-10", "grade": null}
