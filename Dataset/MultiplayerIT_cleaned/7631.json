{"name": "Siete tutti delle marionette", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/123098-puppeteer-siete-tutti-delle-marionette.html", "text": "The approach to the world of video games is different from person to person, there are many differences in terms of years of ~militancy~ on the back, too many are the tastes and often also the perception of the quality of a title. Obviously, the subjective component must always be accompanied by an objective one, and for this reason there is an element that has the same importance as the qualitative one when judging or choosing a video game: the variety and the possibility of being able to choose beyond the usual types, also in order to feed one's gaming soul with different experiences. For over a year, Puppetteer has been under our radar as a candidate to be a different title from the usual, which is based on rather original assumptions. Gavin Moore (project director) has always enjoyed text adventures, where you could imagine anything and everything just by reading the words; he is a great admirer of Japanese puppet theatres, those where the background (from now on scenography) is changed ~under the butt~ of the puppets themselves while they are being played. Precisely from this last aspect and from the desire to give life to the imagination, the talented developer decided to create a two-dimensional platform / adventure that mimics the Japanese theater. The levels are in fact set in a stage and there is even the participation of a virtual audience, which reacts to what the player does by applauding, surprising himself or shouting/sighing in dangerous conditions; all narrated by an off-screen speaking voice. The main protagonist (his name is Kutaro) is kidnapped to Earth by the evil King Bear, who has imprisoned him in a dark castle and transformed him into a puppet with no head or soul. At this point, however, luck comes to your aid, as Kutaro becomes an improvised hero capable of ~dressing~ the most disparate heads, each of which will give him a sort of super power. Kutaro must free the moon goddess and recover the seven lunar fragments, while the Bear King is imprisoning more and more souls that will ensure his unchallenged domination. Who pulls the strings? The initial tutorial presents the commands through which it is possible to manage Kutaro, and ends with the acquisition of what represents the main weapon of the young puppet: Calibrus, an enormous magical scissor capable of cutting anything, from cloth to unfortunate and imaginative enemies. Thanks to Calibrus it is possible to make real cuts of the environment horizontally, vertically, diagonally but also in a circular shape, and it is often the way by which one advances and moves on to the next scenography. Those who feared playing only in fixed screens (ala Super Mario Bros., the original one) may feel relieved because scrolling exists, and how, only that it happens in reverse: it is the background that moves around the player, who always remains at puppet theater interior. To make the idea clearer, think of the character as if he were on a treadmill that moves constantly. Beyond the jump and the attack, during the adventure the protagonist acquires the powers of the four paladins who in the past tried to defeat King Bear without success. A shield capable of reflecting some types of attacks, a diving head jump, the ability to throw bombs and a harpoon to grab enemies and platforms. Kutaro is initially accompanied by a flying cat, Yin Yang, which can be controlled with the right analog (or in cooperation thanks to another pad or PlayStation Move) and which thanks to the R2 key becomes essential for exploring the background, revealing secret heads or moon sparks, interact with secondary characters and thus lend a hand to the main protagonist. In the cauldron that the game offers, there is therefore everything you would expect, including skill tests, the classic bosses to face and variations on the theme such as races and bonus scenes, which can only be accessed using the skill (with the digital cross down) of the required head. In fact, Kutaro can carry up to three heads at the same time, which also represent energy points and literally detach after being hit, unless you recover them quickly. Their collection is one of the cornerstones of the adventure, there are over sixty of them and beyond the different aesthetic impact and the possibility of accessing the bonus sequences already mentioned, they are very useful for obtaining advantages in different points of the scenario. Often and willingly, in fact, the portrait of a head appears in the background which, if ~activated~, allows you to modify it, travel more quickly through a setting or receive help during events.you battle them against the bosses. Precisely the latter are positioned within the classic canons of the genre; in fact, each enemy has recurring types of attack that must be memorized to avoid suffering damage. Once the weak point has been discovered, it is necessary to hit a vital element of the boss and repeat the practice a total of three times, to then finally access a spectacular ~quick time event~ sequence which leads to its definitive defeat. Told like this, the title seems to be yet another exponent of a genre which in reality is not so widespread, with the interesting addition of Yin Yang to exploit secrets and collect lunar heads / sparks. The initial part of our article, however, has already mentioned what Puppeteer wants to convey and how it does it well. It is an imaginative title, supported by a unique visual style and told like a fairy tale full of twists and turns, aimed above all at a younger audience but also at those who still let themselves be surprised when they have a pad in hand. All the characters and backgrounds are made like puppets, the Japanese Kabuki theater style is absolutely peculiar and the continuous dialogues of the narrator, but also of the main protagonists who sometimes quibble with the same voiceover, give a different sense of identification than usual , which often elicits a few smiles and entertains better than many other exponents of the genre. There is no shortage of pieces worthy of a musical and among the various dialogues there is for example the one inside the forest, where a nice flamingo talks far too much for the tastes of the main protagonists. At one point Kutaro's alter ego invites the flamingo to stop talking so long to explain things, and to use 140 characters like Twitter, which is enough and more to express a concept. Puppeteer constantly surprises the player with an out-of-the-box platformer, our review! Playstation 3 trophies Puppeteer offers 63 trophies, strangely all bronze except three silver and one gold. The discounted ones are linked to the completion of each scene and act, and then move on to completing the bonus scenes within the time limit and killing a certain number of enemies using the skills available. The gold trophy is obtained by using all the abilities of the heads with the backgrounds, the silver ones by finding all the heads and freeing the souls from the clutches of the King Bear. 1, 2, 3... Puppeteer is divided into seven acts, each of which consists of three scenes with an initial and final gloss; if we really want to find fault, the dialogues break the rhythm a bit especially in the early stages of the adventure, when there is a desire to put the pad in hand but sometimes you have to put up with too long stories that perhaps could have been better distributed. The visual diversification of situations is really excellent, the game has an incredible variety; each act proposes a completely different setting, always with an exceptional, colorful and captivating graphic style. The bosses in the same way have peculiar characteristics compared to the others, in particular for example the generals Cavallo and Toro are extremely successful in their dualism of competing in the desert and ignoring Kutaro until he puts heavily, it must be said , the spanners in the works. Then there are Monkey, the robot dog, the Sun and Triton... in terms of setting we have the classic ones but revisited thanks to the graphic style, such as snow and volcanoes, and other more imaginative ones such as those made up of suspended magic cards, running trains , enchanted forests and everything you would expect from a real fairy tale. At this point, one might wonder why the grade was good but not excellent. Puppetter, unfortunately, gets stuck on some videogame and storytelling aspects that do not allow him to make the complete leap in quality. First of all, the level of challenge, really too low even if you consider that it is aimed at a younger audience than the writer. If on the one hand in 2013 the possibility of restarting shortly before following a death is seen as an advantage, within the Sony Japan Studios title it is really too easy to go ahead and defeat the bosses if you are not too hasty. Do you think that we beat the final boss in its multiple iterations without losing a head, and we arrived at the end of the adventure with no less than sixty lives on the back, since every hundred lunar sparks earn one. The extreme variety and the element of surprise manage to mitigate this problem not a little, but this low difficulty invalidates the collection of the same sparks and secret heads, if not for the pure pleasure of doing it. LThe bonus scenes themselves are not particularly inspired and therefore the game lacks those elements that make platformers masterpieces and is ~limited~ to being a beautiful experience that is fun and never boring, but which once finished it fulfills its purpose. It would have been enough to introduce difficulty levels to make Quicktime more difficult, fewer lives available and tougher enemies, but so be it. Connected to this is the fact that narration and variety, although excellent, fail to convey that ~magic~ that one would expect and which is typical of animation masterpieces; perhaps also for the caricatural narration itself, which precisely favors amusement and the variety of situations. Let me be clear, Puppetter entertains and surprises, but does not warm the heart as perhaps we would expect given the premises on which it is based. From a purely technical point of view, the title flows smoothly without ever problems and the idea of changing the background under the player's butt is accompanied by an excellent visual effect of movement. The camera always shows the action in the best way and the response to the commands is perfect, if we add the style we have already talked about, Puppeteer is a jewel capable of satisfying even the most demanding palates without having to go towards brute power. Even the sound sector is the flagship of the production; the music is masterfully orchestrated and blends well with what is shown on the video, the support for multi-channel audio allows for example the audience's applause on the rear channels and therefore behind one's back, increasing the sense of identification. Among the many goodies we happened to leave the protagonist still while we read something on the computer. The audience began to rumble and converse blissfully, when we started moving again there was a voice that ordered silence, which made us laugh heartily. The dubbing is completely in Italian and we must say that the work done is for once superior to the English counterpart. Where, in fact, the narrative voice and that of the protagonists are annoying in the long run in the Anglo-Saxon version, the Italian one by the mouth of Pieraldo Ferrante and the other voice actors manages to remain pleasant for the entire duration of the adventure. We completed Puppeteer in about ten hours of gameplay; once the interactive end credits have concluded, it is possible to replay all the acts in ~Plus~ mode and having the special abilities available immediately. In this way it is possible to collect the remaining heads and souls, while in the main menu there are six books to see and listen to, which allow you to unlock an additional trophy.", "date": "2013-09-11", "grade": "8.5"}
