Pete Wanat, executive producer, exclaims with a smug smile from behind a pair of 80s sunglasses: ~The only orgy I want to see in this game is an orgy of violence!!~. Hell YEAH, Pete! Very remarkable! Weapons. Point. Wanted wanted to hit the mark, and how many are convinced they can: if the result obtained with the film was modest, the one obtained with the video game seems almost less small. Probably because that minus is only the result of the fact that usually, games originating from a film are that pretext that some find to make fun of the stigmatized and phantom ~casual players~ (and who would they be?), and this time it's not possible to think entirely only because there are a couple of gimmicks that we didn't expect to find so complete in a purely commercial operation. Even if on few occasions, the manual skills of the Grins - still immature - get noticed, but the real problem becomes the absence of work in terms of design, and above all the material for which these skills have been used (the free interpretation of the Original Wanted, a comic series, offered by the film), which undoubtedly, and rightly, is treated with contempt. Come on Grin, a few more favors for the big production companies and maybe you'll come out safe and sound and with something to say the way you want to say it. If nothing else, bluntly said, they at least have made available to us in a ~pure and flat~ shooter a dynamic and well-set cover system compared to what was released a little while ago by Capcom with much more hype. However the difference between a cool agent raised on steroids and this invincible solitary assassin, talkative, sarcastic and lover of the insult for effect seems like the difference between a cheeseburger and a baconburger from some fast food chain. The places where we are pushed with force do not let themselves be discovered because they were designed precisely not to be, often they do not stimulate us in any way, and usually what we find around a corner is identical to what was there before, even identically. bland. We lack the pleasure of moving in that environment, and we progress above all out of a spirit of completion, and partly because we are now launched at breakneck speed down the slope, and the push drags us along. Straight is the way to success, because such a design serves above all to exponentially multiply the firefights. And I pay The feeling that we've been given the training path of America's new police recruits, the one where you walk down the alley and shoot silhouettes with the apprehension of not having to shoot civilian ones, is very strong - the silhouettes are a couple and cloned in series, there is no apprehension because there are only those of the bad guys on duty, the pre-installed spring that makes them move is standard (some like to call it script), the shot is always sideways at the edge of tolerable, and our job is just to keep them above our scope as we turn to find the right angle to hit them best. Shooting, just shooting, always shooting, not even testing skill of any kind, and when that happens, Game Over, and try again knowing what will happen. And the slow-motion in the fatal blows perhaps had the conception elaborated by a Sam Peckinpah behind it - it does not cynically underline violence, but tries to make it, as per the recipe magnetized on the fridge of almost every videogame producer, absolutely and nothing but ~fun~ . On balance, the only thing that remains impressed is the extreme insaneness that in our opinion ends up characterizing Wanted: as a player pointed out to us a few days ago, you know the scene from ~The Naked Gun~ in which Frank Drebin exchanges gunshots with a robber while both take cover behind the same cover? It happens frequently, but we laugh at the unwanted result, we don't laugh complacently at the tasty parody. Everything then ends up being infiltrated by sequences which, calling them dynamic in-engine cut sequences, does not render what they appear as transpositions of shooters programmed in flash. If your satisfaction passes through an obsessive-compulsive repetition of the gesture of shooting someone who mechanically looks out from behind a column, this game was tailor-made for you. Or, if what is proposed does not satisfy you, you can easily dare and make it work as you like best, transforming it with your rules: for example, a race with friends to see who can run to get to the point of passage to the next level by jumping more enemies possible, or whoever kills the most enemies sganciando only occasional knees and slashes with the knife (also because passing the pad will be the only multiplayer possible). In this case, it's not so much what Wanted conveys as content or how it conveys it, but how the player manages to use the vehicle without looking at it too much. Even those who approach it like this have the possibility of being able to transform Wanted into an experience that is functional in its own way for their entertainment, perhaps beyond what Grin would have imagined, and demonstrating that Wanted, for the few who do not buy it with their eyes closed for what it offers, it has the potential to be entertaining. Fun as throwing bread at the table. However, Mark Millar liked the film adaptation. Glad he... You probably already know that Wanted was born primarily as a graphic novel (that's what they're called now, let's update, even if even Alan Moore never had a problem calling them ~comics~) by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones, and was later relaunched in film as an action blockbuster tailored for Angelina Jolie. Whether or not you trust Millar's sincerity when he thinks of offering a witty and provocative treatment of characters usually called supervillains, it goes without saying here that the source material is his own series. Wesley is the Wesley of the film, which is precisely a free interpretation of the original, and appears as someone who uses only his index finger to pull the trigger (and we could say not very effectively, but frequently, ~the middle finger~, in combination with a forked tongue). Now, start from the movie and make a video game out of it, and you'll find yourself battling a mega giant mechanical spider - no really, this is a joke, not this time - a fleet of helicopters (and I loved them as a kid) and a thousand of assassins. Wesley, or his father Cross, the protagonists, allow themselves to be hated and admired just as they hope, together with their being a bit Bourne, a bit Bond, a bit Bad-Ass, a bit... Wesley & Cross. That when they think in action, they even think for you. However, we begin to look at things from Wesley's point of view: mother murdered as a necessary childhood trauma, father severe and absent, the characters of those who raised him and those who repeatedly tried to kill him are confused, the final duel with an appointment. We still have to understand how the very bad ones (cha-cha-cha) can pass over mines without detonating them. Or what concrete reason do they all have for not all arriving at the same time, even if they are all hiding in two adjoining and communicating rooms, and they know we are arriving alone. Or why someone didn't take steps to circulate a circular among the marauders to tell them that the tactic to use is not to hide: guys, my bullets can make a curve and hit you where I want! And as if all this were not enough, we also often find ourselves dealing with a dancer frame rate and with the cumbersome phrase ~New Concept Art Unlocked~ ready to distract us during yet another firefight thanks to its size that occupies half screen. ...all happy? The motivation to look into the only room you could enter that wasn't part of the corridor that would take you to the next cutscene is, drum roll, an unlockable in the form of a sheet that gravitates in the air. Oh! It was really worth it not to go straight to the elevator! And it's basically the only other thing you'll collect besides the predictable catchphrases - which in theory would be used with irony, but which hardly distinguish from those that are actually used with conviction. And in front of us, very defiant, here are the supervillains. With their ~foreign~ accent and pauses in mid-sentence, which add three nastiness points to their End-of-Level Boss Association prize card. And their own hordes of militia rushing towards us to be slaughtered. They make us fond of the action button, because the input always comes with that, and it intensifies in a wide range of movements, whether they are trotting in continuous sequence between one cover and another, or sowing lead. Really, we understand that Grin has learned with Bionic Commando Rearmed that moving from one surface to another is a mechanism that works, and we are glad that they wanted to have their say, but maybe it's time to put their mark on other pages in the manual. Not that it is in itself malfunctioning or not very suitable for the context, far from it as we have said, but it is only the only and obvious possibility available to us to use ~creatively~, perceived almost immediately as very repetitive but without that growth and that return of enthusiasm necessary to make repetition enjoyable. Obviously Wesley, or his father, spthey plow above all with pistols, they are of two types and they alternate with a third dual wield held machine gun, it is a more refined weapon and imposes a short range, they are professional executioners on the other hand and the engraving tool must somehow convey at first glance the skill and courage of its owner in doing their job. And so, the gesture of shooting is elaborated in a series of variations, with a nice overrated bloom effect powder here and there, used as a flavor enhancer. The completion time varies between 4 and 6 hours.
