In the first place, the much vaunted freedom of action and movement within what is in any case a huge scenario, which extends for several kilometres, always remains at the service of missions which often make speed and punctuality is a fundamental requirement: many times you have to show up for appointment X at point Y proceeding at full speed, without even stopping to look at the splendid landscape. Secondly, the structure of the missions allows us to decide whether or not to dedicate ourselves to secondary objectives (as in almost all products of the same genre), but it certainly does not force us to take care of all the enemies we come across during the path: we can very well go straight to the turn goal and complete the job ignoring the fact that we have a small army on our heels. Indeed, to be honest in many cases we are really obliged not to worry too much about the details and to move quickly. Finally, one has to ask oneself if the Codemasters series really wants to continue on the path of realism at all costs. Going out on a mission with your team, reaching the designated position, observing the enemy's movements for hours and then returning to base because someone above has decided to cancel the attack: this is certainly realistic. But is it also fun? In Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising you find yourself going a long way on foot, within missions that are all very similar, which are certainly plausible and ~realistic~ in their sometimes being boring, but which end up being a bit too far from what the concept of fun is. Neverland Once the campaign has begun, a Call of Duty-style introduction presents us with the historical reality of the island of Skira, currently under the control of the Chinese contingent. Our task is to return it to the Russians through a series of operations aimed at ~setting the record straight~ and then opening the door to decisive diplomatic action. With the battlefield represented by the entire island, it is clear that we will have to prepare for long sessions of running in the fields as we try to reach the areas indicated by the headquarters on the map. Our alter ego is in command of a team of four men, so we have at all times three companions ready to follow our orders and to cover our backs in case of danger. We can simply tell them to follow us, send them to scout or literally assault an enemy position, a tactic that almost never pays off. The possibilities available to us are many, but given the presence of a small number of buildings we must limit ourselves to cleaning them up in person or having others do it, while it is impossible to plan Rainbow Six actions to eliminate any unwanted guests inside them. Considering the fact that we are always in the open and facing scattered groups of enemies, perhaps the best strategy is to attack on two fronts, thus sending our companions to the right of the enemy while we move to his left for a while ' of healthy crossfire. Impressions about artificial intelligence are mixed. Our teammates, for example, always prove to be very smart and quickly spot any threat, even hundreds of meters away. In frontal firefights, however, they often prove to be short-sighted and end up getting killed. Which would also fit, since it's not an arcade FPS. As for the enemies, let's say that two distinct situations occur: in ranged combat the AI is impeccable, with the soldiers ducking and starting to crawl to hide as soon as they notice that we have opened fire, then demonstrating also be excellent marksmen and have a keen eye on our movements; up close, on the other hand, they appear slow and awkward, sometimes even steadfast in their position despite knowing that we are around the corner. Fight hard without fear Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising is undoubtedly a challenging game, which even at the normal difficulty level forces you to restart from a checkpoint simply because you underestimated the ability of the last enemy you challenged to a duel. As already mentioned, the Chinese soldiers we find ourselves facing are often excellent shooters and above all they are corroborated by a constant numerical superiority, which leads us to study alternative approach strategies to the classic ~venI go there and I break you~. The game uses a realistic aiming system, in which you have to really seize the moment to land a headshot since it is very difficult to avoid ~shaking~ while aiming the weapon. At the same time however, it is not very realistic that the blows inflicted on the body not only do not kill the enemies, but also do not cause them to collapse. Distinguishing one's targets is far from easy, and in this sense the absolute uselessness of the infrared viewer is surprising, which nine times out of ten is of no help in identifying opponents. The night sight of certain sniper rifles is much better, which makes the targets ~luminous~ and allows us to hit them much more easily. Regarding the hits scored, there seems to be no hard and fast rule: forget about the precision of Call of Duty or Ghost Recon itself, to which Operation Flashpoint really resembles a lot, because here there is some effort and you also have to deal with situations apparently inexplicable, in which one has the distinct sensation of having hit the mark, and yet... The matter becomes even more complicated when we shoot with a sniper rifle and we find ourselves at a great distance from the target: in that case we have to calculate the descending trajectory of the projectile through a series of trials and errors that defeat the effect of surprise. It's fortunate that the developers didn't take the influence of the wind into consideration as well. As for the opposite situation, i.e. our character's resistance to attacks, it all depends on the type of blow we suffer: if we are taken in the head, it is immediate death, while wounds to the chest or limbs trigger a hemorrhage that can be stopped by opening your inventory and using a medkit. Let it be clear that in this way we don't come back as new, on the contrary we bring some problems with us for the rest of the mission: if we have been wounded in the leg, for example, we won't be able to run for a while; if instead they have wounded us in the arm, the aim could be affected. Arms and baggage The management of weapons, equipment and vehicles is characterized by the most complete freedom, therefore remaining within the confines of what is asked of us by the mission we can take a ride in a jeep or an armored car, pilot a helicopter and so on. The weapons available to us change according to the stage, but we can replace them without problems (both the primary and the secondary) by taking advantage of the crates that are located near certain locations, or by taking them from killed enemies. It is a pity that such an open and elastic system does not provides for the possibility, in extreme cases, of asking a friend to lend us a weapon or to give us some magazines. In fact, sometimes you end up with only the service pistol and without the possibility of going back to get something because the spaces to cover are really too large. Furthermore, in case you want to steal something from the corpses, it is important to do it quickly because they tend to disappear quickly. During one of the last missions, for example, we are asked to destroy armored vehicles but without being given a rocket launcher: we must necessarily steal it from an enemy by contravening the usual caution in clashes, getting dangerously close to a still hot area. As mentioned at the beginning, the game is made up of eleven relatively short and not very ~imaginative~ missions, which are accompanied by six extra missions which, however, can be completed in just a few minutes. In short, the life expectancy of the Codemasters product is not very high if you take into consideration the single game alone. In multiplayer, fortunately, things are different: it is possible to play the campaign or single missions in cooperative mode or to dedicate oneself to the ~annihilation~ (the classic deathmatch) or ~infiltration~ (a variant of the usual conquest of the territory) mode for a total of thirty-two players at the same time. There is also an editor where you can create your own missions, placing troops and posts on the island map. Technical realization Played on an Athlon64 X2 5000+ with 2GB RAM and an ATI Radeon HD 4870 video card with 1GB RAM, at 1680x1050 dots, with v-sync on and 2X anti-aliasing, Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising runs at 38 constant fps and without particular uncertainties, showing off graphics that are in many ways splendid. It is clear that the developers have staked everything on the yield of the vegetation: the island of Skira appears completely devoid of urban settlements proper, therefore the only buildings in which you come across are part of enemy positions that are anything but complex. The extension of the map and its horizontal and vertical development give dI have a great sense of freedom. High resolution certainly helps to notice a greater number of details, as well as revealing small imperfections that can be annoying: octagonal objects instead of round ones, beautiful but completely ~flat~ grass, but above all polygonal models that are too simple and similar to each other, equipped of animations that sometimes leave something to be desired. It's not possible to watch your character move, but the run from first person doesn't look great. The robust graphics engine, however, encounters some difficulties and occurs in small episodes of pop-ups when we move at higher speeds than normal, for example when we are on board a vehicle. Furthermore, the interactivity with the environment is rather limited, even the impact with the wooden workstations does not produce results even if you are driving a tank. The lighting system is really convincing, with the alternation of light and shadow depending on the conditions of the sky, while unfortunately the explosions leave something to be desired. The sound commentary is realistic and functional to the action, enhanced by an Italian dubbing which, at least in the main voice, releases passion, strength and emotions that are out of the ordinary, such as to compensate for the flatness of the accompanying interpretations.", "date": "2009-10-06", "grade": "8.0"}
