It took Square Enix almost six years to complete the thirteenth chapter of the series, passing through two generations of consoles and looking down on the growing loss of popularity of its genre and the uncertain pace of the Japanese market as a whole. The one coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 should therefore come as a sort of exclamation point after too many suspensions, a turning point if not from a development point of view - after all, putting more than a shine and spending a fortune is not a model to export - at least from the productive one. The result of such a gigantic effort is certainly a title to buy, aware however of a series of limits caused by the very desire to exaggerate, to dilute the experience to the extremes, so much so as to invalidate the excellent work done on several aspects of an experience that in any case remains something absolutely distinguishable within the videogame panorama. Two worlds in conflict The game is introduced gently, with a series of early stages aimed at familiarizing the user with the main mechanics, as well as introducing him to an overall successful plot, excellent in intertwining the stories of the individual characters so as to characterize them gradually always moreover. The two warring worlds, the science-fiction Cocoon and the primordial Pulse, therefore form the backdrop to a series of events which, as per tradition, will be traceable to some extremely powerful entity, to conspiracies of enormous proportions and great upheavals, resulting however connected to the protagonists who in some cases will discover that they are intimately linked to what is happening and therefore to each other, with the balance of power of the group punctuated by well-written dialogues in support of a number of different emotions and problems. Some typically oriental drifts remain such as the excessive verbosity of certain exchanges or the tendency to overexpose the user to the emotions of the protagonists, reaching the caricature or momentarily diverting attention from what is most important happening in the game world, however the narrative sector of Final Fantasy XIII can be elected without too much hesitation to one of the most valid of recent times. The inevitable computer graphics movies are present as always and are used to underline the most choreographic moments, often in the sequences in the sky or with a lot of field in front of the camera, alternating with a series of cutscenes created with the equally well-studied game engine, in able to integrate effectively both the action and the interludes in CGI. In short, the desire to tell a story is at the center of everything, so much so that it invades the gameplay by imposing on the user a series of different but non-modifiable parties, composed according to the events that follow one another, for almost all of the first fifteen hours of game: a double-faced decision which on the one hand allows you to keep on the desired tracks but on the other ends up further accentuating what is the great defect of the title, or rather its linearity. Playstation 3 trophies Final Fantasy XIII offers 36 different trophies of which 9 silver and 5 gold, in addition to the inevitable platinum. A good twenty are earned by completing the game entirely while the remainder are more linked to collectible items such as having walked 10,000 steps in the world, having collected all the weapons and accessories present in the title, or having developed all the skills of all characters. The trophy that is collected by completing the final battle with 5 stars, the highest ranking, is also particularly difficult. Rights to the goal Pad in hand the very first hours are valid and the long sequence of corridors that characterize them does not cause discomfort, so much has been concentrated on mastering the restyling of the classic game formula operated by Square Enix. The revolution implemented by the twelfth chapter was mediated here with what was expressed in the past, returning to having the clashes take place on a separate field from that of navigating along the maps but committing to create a dynamic and at the same time strategic combat system. The result is a combat system that soon becomes the most valuable element of the entire title, capable as it is of combining the possibility of directly controlling a single character with that of giving a behavioral indication to the other two team members. The Active Time Battle, always present on the screen, loads continuously by providing a series of slots that can be filled with the actions to be performed by one's alter ego, coordinating in real time with the other two companions controlled by the inartificial intelligence so as to knock down the opponents as quickly as possible. Perhaps looking for the right tactic to raise their Crisis gauge to the maximum, to be filled in such a way as to inflict a much higher amount of damage than it would otherwise. The traditional level growth system has been abandoned in favor of the Cristalium, which allows each of the six classes present and available to the as many recruitable characters to progress individually, who will purchase an increasing number each during the adventure. These specializations range from the self-explanatory Attacker or Therapist up to the mage, here Occultist, and the tank, here Sentinel, passing through the Saboteur and the Synergist, respectively responsible for casting malus on enemies and bonuses on allies. The tree inside each class allows you to spend the appropriate points earned in battle to obtain new skills but also increase the physical and magical statistics, initially presenting a small number of possible choices but making up for it after the middle of the game by making a number available via upper route of branches to the main route. The union of the above is an exceptional mixture of immediacy and strategy that engages asking to cleverly manage the slots of the Active Time Battle and to modify the specialization of the party members according to the needs, rewarding with a multitude of possible choices . Here comes the paradox. The developers have succeeded in the enterprise of reviving the formula of the genre with great taste, making the fights potentially beautiful, and then ruining at least in part what was done with an unhinged progression of the adventure. As mentioned at the beginning, the first chapters were rightly characterized by a strong linearity. Less brilliant was the choice to continue on the same path for something more than the first twenty hours of actual play, forcing to repeat a series of long sections of the level characterized by clashes of medium difficulty, preparatory to what are often the frustrating boss fights, in memory of this writer ever so challenging. The circle is vicious because if it is true that there are no chance encounters, the choice to avoid those imposed to ward off boredom has repercussions on the extreme commitment required at the end of each section of each chapter, perhaps arriving there too weak to use a different strategy from defending oneself strenuously by attacking only when one is sure not to lose the pens. Once in Pulse, things change slightly, since some secondary missions become available to be carried out in the plain of Archylte and in a series of optional areas, but the possibility of hunting special enemies, riding chocobos and completing other activities secondary is postponed for too long and is often linked to a rate of challenge such as to suggest its postponement after the very long second part of the adventure, like the decidedly linear first. The absence of cities, non-player characters to talk to and all the usual contours of the series is therefore only a small deficit that would have been very tolerable if accompanied by a less stretched progression and a lower challenge rate. Final Fantasy XIII does not lack variety, quite the opposite, it only dilutes it beyond the tolerable for those who are not strongly motivated, diminishing its depth. Daydreaming Technically Final Fantasy XIII is a good game, with more than convincing models, beautiful animations and a certain ability to keep the average quality always at the same level, lacking only in the lighting which is far too static by the standards. Visually however, it is something extraordinary, enough to leave behind the polygon count or some less performing texture than the average. Each environment, whether internal or external, hyper-technological or wild, is perfectly characterized and different from the previous one, with views capable of leaving you breathless however suggestive. The enemies themselves appear in impressive numbers and often in multiple versions, as expected, demonstrating a very fervent imagination. Films in computer graphics and interlude scenes, as mentioned, are very well shot and integrate masterfully into each part played: once you get to Nautilus, a sort of amusement park located a dozen hours after departure, you witness a beautiful fireworks display for complexity and then we start walking again with the same structures of the video in the background, among a crowd made up of an enviable quantity of different models; to leave you breathless. The money, the time and the pasion merged into the Square Enix project can all be seen, so as to make this one of the most evocative and satisfying titles for the eyes of the current generation. There are no big flaws and potentially annoying elements, such as the uploads in the transition between the map and the battlefield, are reduced to historic lows, leaving only a free camera that is too slow and often set by default to the wrong angles, a reason of regret. We refer to the specific video comparison that will arrive in the next few days, the differences between the two versions, given that the review focused solely on the PlayStation 3 version. The audio sector is also beautiful, which is not only of great variety, but fits perfectly into any moment adapting to the most disparate needs, emphasizing the moods of each member of the cast and proving to be highly versatile even during fights, when the music inevitably repeats itself. The English dubbing, like the virtual acting, is excellent and accompanied by Italian subtitles.", "date": "2010-03-05", "grade": "8.3"}
