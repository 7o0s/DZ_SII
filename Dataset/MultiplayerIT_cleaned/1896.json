{"name": "Bandits - Phoenix Rising", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bandits-phoenix-rising.html", "text": "Self destruction You will never, never forget the moment, the land that trembled: the air caught fire and then... silence. So sang the poet (umh...). Jericho is one of the few metropolises that survived the nuclear holocaust and the subsequent era of barbarism, and it has succeeded by barricading itself behind its immense walls, closing itself off from any contact with the outside world, denying itself to the eager gaze of those who, outside, live in the jungle of violence and oppression. It is natural that around this mysterious city, an obscure object of desire, the most uncontrolled rumors turn, and that rumors become legends, and that legends drive men to the most absurd undertakings. Bandits is one such story, the story of an absurd enterprise. The player is given control of the dynamic duo Fennec and Rewdalf (or rather: of their car), leaders of the Wolfpack gang: during the twenty-four missions of the game we will have to accompany them in their ascent with machine gun shots that will transform them from desperate into eternal escape to happy inhabitants of Jericho. Bandits looks like a classic car combat game: aboard a highly maneuverable well-armed vehicle you roam the nuclearized lands of the future to make a clean sweep of equally (indeed, much more!) motorized opponents, solving a few simple tasks in the meantime. We were saying that it looks like a car combat game: in reality, on closer inspection, the gameplay turns out to be typical of an FPS. Except that you will also see your vehicle, in third person, at the center of the frame: but in fact the controls and the playful experience are comparable in all respects to a classic first person shooter, albeit with some interesting additions linked to the particular means of transport, such as the handbrake and relative drifts and reversals, ~turbo~ discharges and the possibility of literally jumping over the opponents. Furthermore, since the turret of the machine gun is mobile, by pressing a key it is possible to ~block~ the movement of the turret thus passing from a relative character control to a relative screen: easier to do than to describe it, in a few words it allows strafe around enemy vehicles, circling them and continuing to shoot at them. As deadly as difficult to master. But apart from this preciousness, the controls are easy to master, immediate and intuitive, responding with the necessary promptness. As in any good FPS (even disguised as a racing game) the mouse and keyboard combination is by far the best while the pad requires a longer run-in. No cockpit and no alternative view (it is only possible to adjust the distance from the camera to the vehicle) and very unrealistic car physics (but fun and functional to the game) confirm the idea of being in front of an FPS in disguise. Gameplay The first minutes of playful experience will be marked by pure enthusiasm: the Swedish developers have made available to the player vast, extensive territories, often suggestive and overflowing with jumps, mounds, rocky gorges, destroyed bridges, bumps and everything that can give bottom of your stash of Travelgum. We then find ourselves screeching through these barren deserts just for the sake of it, enjoying the bouncing, the overturning, the scary jumps, the screeching on the edge of a ravine, the wild rides that our vehicle allows us: we will be able to go every corner of the pitch, no roads, no tracks, no rules. Once this first adrenaline has been discharged, however, one is seized by a disheartening sense of emptiness. These Bandits deserts are in name and in fact: monochromatic, monotonous, empty. The structures are there (enemy strongholds, ruins) but they are few and so scattered in these huge scenarios that they only increase the sense of ~lack~. A similar sense of monotony tarnishes the structure of the missions: they are extremely simple, linear and devoid of substance, limiting themselves to elementary combinations of stop the convoy / find the key, unlock the door (yes: a nuclear war was not enough to erase the heinous habit of finding_key_unlocking_door, everlasting plague of easygoing game design!) / steal the object, go back to base and so on: brief interludes, mere screens to justify the natural essence of the game: combat and action. The danger of monotony must have been well in mind to the developers who decided to alternate normal missions with some real car races by winning which you can earn new weapons for our vehicle. But Bandits is, and so it wants to be, like the post-atomic cowboys ofwhose deeds he narrates: rough, fast, violent, adrenaline-pumping. The ideal Bandits player would have to scream like a rodeo at each blown-up opponent, then hurtle through a canyon, leaping a cliff, in search of the next fight. Speed, lead and petrol. Technique The graphics support these intentions: they are extremely fast, fluid, functional, beautiful even if not sensational, with a very high definition of the textures and a fairly extensive visual depth only sometimes limited by a providential fogging: the GRiN proprietary engine performs his work excellently. But that sense of emptiness remains: and it is not enough to say that it is a desert (or a steppe, or a frozen wasteland: during the game the scenarios will change several times) some more elements could, should have been there to make everything more varied it's pleasant. Of absolute value, at least spectacular, the light effects: at certain moments an extremely suggestive light goes down, fiery sunsets worthy of a Leone film made even brighter by the excellently made explosions. Equally positive judgment for the sound sector which indeed denotes an even greater care: not only the dialogues between the two protagonists at the beginning of each stage and the suggestions of the hyperkinetic Rewdalf (very well voiced with an exhilarating Scottish accent: who has listened to the janitor of Simpson in the original knows what I'm talking about) deserve a mention but it is above all the music that is the host. During the action it will be possible to zap between various ~radio stations~ (but are there also in the post-nuclear war?) passing through a large number of metal, rock, techno country and techno tracks: the atmosphere of a furious cannon ride is insured! The selection of weapons with which to equip the vehicle will also be fundamental because the opponents will immediately prove to be tough bones: in reality, the whole difficulty of the game is quite high, reaching peaks of annoying frustration in some situations. Multiplayer Completing the campaign in the single player will be a difficult undertaking but it is also the only one that Bandits offers... Thus we come to what is perhaps one of the greatest weaknesses of the GRiN title: the multiplayer side is extremely meager, limiting itself to deathmatch in single or in teams. Very little for a title that with multiplayer could have turned into a must buy! The structure of the game would have lent itself very well to unleashed online battles between gangs of motorized warriors: the possibilities for making the multiplayer gaming experience extraordinary could have been innumerable if only the developers had shown greater sensitivity for this sector. Imagine the different communities, the customization of weapons and vehicles, the tournaments, the various game modes (control of a territory, real car races, capture the flag...) that could have been (and are not) not it only adds to the disappointment. Sin. Final Judgements: the day after Ultimately Bandits does not disappoint the expectations of those looking for immediate action, speed, atmosphere, ~noisy~ fun: on the other hand the almost total absence of any thickness, the limited multiplayer, a certain sense of monotony not curbed by a difficulty from the peaks discouraging makes it mandatory to try the demo before any purchase. A good title, interesting in some respects, but which lacks something - perhaps greater attention to detail - to be able to recommend it without reservations. Now only one thing is missing in this title: an Italian distributor. It would really be a shame to miss out on a title that is certainly not perfect but still interesting. Self destruction Mad Max has been roaming the barren post-atomic deserts of the collective imagination for almost a quarter of a century now. The series of three films with Mel Gibson has in fact founded, or at least canonized in its most typical elements, a whole sub-genre of science fiction: a desert world from which emerge the crumbling ruins of a self-destructing civilization, where gangs of outlaws they fight for a few gallons of gasoline. A sort of low-tech western with a precise and codified aesthetic: faded leather jackets, dusty roads, ruins in the sand, wild violence, motorized gangs, the smell of blood and petrol, burnt flesh and red-hot steel. The scarcity of resources has made the continuous movement and nomadism the only possibility of life: at the center of this system is therefore the automobile, which from a status symbol of well-being and a peaceful family life has become the primary source of survival and a good reason to kill someone. This imaginary is the exaltation of a strange utopia: the hope that the decline of technology - so powerful that it cancels itself - leads to a new exaltation of the body: a very strange body, however, so intimately linked with the machine that it becomes an extension of it prosthetics: it is no longer the machine, the technology, that is the prosthesis, tool, of the human but on the contrary it is the man who is the prosthesis of the machine, the organism that allows the machine to survive even the collapse of technological civilization, to survive itself. Mad Max (in Italy Interceptor: the road warrior, 1979) launched the Australian Mel Gibson in the firmament of film stars: will Bandits - The Phoenix Rising be able to project the Swedes GRiN Entertainment into the empyrean of developers?", "date": "2002-12-03", "grade": null}
