In search of immortality Not a crack of the whip is heard, yet my subjects toil incessantly to get their pharaoh's name written into the pages of history, both because I treat them well and because the unions don't even know what they are! The latest trend among scholars is the theory that we ancient Egyptians didn't necessarily use slaves to build the pyramids, so my men and architects do it in their spare time and happily haul huge blocks of marble from barges across the river to the construction site or, alternatively, willingly spend a few hours in the scorching sun to tear slabs of stone from quarries outside the city and cover my monument to immortality. I couldn't wish for better: the pharaoh's job is hard but it also gives its satisfactions and my ultimate goal in Immortal Cities is precisely to make this city prosper and become a demigod, guaranteeing long life to my lineage... indeed, possibly life eternal! ~The Sons of the Nile~ can be considered the illegitimate heir of Pharaoh, a successful management dating back to a few years ago, set in turn in Ancient Egypt and developed substantially by the same team, now reunited under the Tilted Mill label. Despite a similar game mechanic, it differs from it not only for the graphics and the jump to three dimensions but also for a greater attention to the human aspect of the simulation: its most appealing elements, in fact, are the accurate setting history and the promise of a ~city builder~ focused more on the inhabitants and their needs than on the city itself and its resources. The result is a relatively original product, which challenges both fans and laymen of the genre to try their hand at a complex and at times truly rewarding simulation. Egyptophiles will certainly appreciate the historical consistency and the interesting knowledge filtered through the game tips and the integrated guide. The player will really learn firsthand how important the flooding of the Nile was for crops, to what extent the cult of the gods was rooted in the daily life of the ancient Egyptians and how decisive the role of priests was in their society. A city that lives and breathes The map of Egypt, from which we can check our possessions and the cities of Egypt; surrounding. In the main menu, the player has the option to choose whether to jump into the complete mode, which provides for a series of campaigns managed over several generations of pharaohs, or to try his hand at a single campaign or a single scenario. The paper manual is very concise but adequately integrated by the online guide, accessible at every stage of the game. This, as has been said, also provides some historical information. To familiarize yourself with the interface, it is advisable to go through the tutorials. The game mechanics is basically divided into three phases: construction and development of the city, management of its inhabitants and relations with the outside world. The first two are terrifyingly in-depth and on the other hand they are the ones that distinguish the game from other management games out there. The strategic component is much more superficial, almost as a contour to what is the actual construction of the city... but it would have been humanly and technically difficult to guarantee the same richness and depth of gameplay on this front too, it's a question of playability! The game is divided into three phases: construction and development of the city, management of its inhabitants and relations with the outside world. A city that lives and breathes In fact, although the defense of our territory from enemy incursions or attacks by marauders is a priority, war is not at all: we are not forced to attack neighboring cities and populations to expand our domains, also because relations with the external are essentially limited to commercial exchanges, aimed at obtaining raw materials otherwise unavailable. We cannot directly influence the outcome of battles, nor watch their progress, for that matter: our task ends with the acquisition and training of troops. When we want to attack another city or an enemy settlement, we just select the corresponding icon on the map of Egypt, view a report on the balance of forces in the field and decide whether to proceed or not, based on the military resources available to us and a vague prediction of victory or defeat. In short, the maniacs of military and strategic simulations are warned that this is not the title for them. An overview of the city,dominated by the pyramid of the pharaoh. There are many management and construction tools: starting from the roads and the basic infrastructures, ending with the temples dedicated to the cult of the innumerable Egyptian deities and the inevitable pyramids that will hand down our name over the centuries, passing from the most humble to the sumptuous noble palaces, without forgetting the personal palace of the pharaoh, another emblem of his prestige. The positioning of the buildings, technically speaking, is simple and intuitive, if we exclude the shipyards and the docks on the coast, which for some obscure reason are more difficult to place: generally, it is sufficient to select with a left click of the mouse the desired type of structure or inhabitant, to then place it on the map with another simple click, perhaps after having changed its orientation. From a managerial and strategic point of view, however, urban planning turns out to be rather complex: to do anything, from shopping to their work, the inhabitants of the city have to move and the greater the distances to travel, the less time they can dedicate to every activity. Although the game maps are relatively extensive, the only way to prevent our subjects from getting lost in endless journeys is to concentrate most of the houses and structures in the center, which in the long run is practically impossible, especially if we consider that it is not always easy to keep the Nile, its precious resources and other raw materials at hand! Urban planning turns out to be quite complex. A city that lives and breathes One of the royal princes, returning to the palace. The management and control of resources takes place through three blocks of statistics, linked to as many buttons in the game interface: it will be necessary to constantly monitor the data relating to the population (availability of accommodation, level of satisfaction and any problems of each social caste), raw materials (quantity of food and construction materials) and prestige of the pharaoh (linked to various variables and derived from the splendor of his palace, from military enterprises, from the construction of monuments, tombs and temples...). It is important to underline that it is not possible to directly manage the activities of citizens, since they are controlled by artificial intelligence and therefore autonomous: it is up to us to provide the housing and production facilities they need and to get them busy so that the city prospers. Each family nucleus is made up of a small workforce of two or more people: generally the father works in the fields or produces something, the children help him or get him the necessary resources and the mother takes care of the house and the shopping. You can follow everyone's activities and verify their expectations and needs, although the behavioral models of the characters in this simulation are certainly not as evolved as those of the Sims. As long as families have enough food, temples to pray to the gods they are devoted to, and decent fringe benefits, they won't give us trouble. The only unfortunate inconvenience is that our subjects have a long memory and the bad habit of complaining about the lack of adequate services or structures even long after we have remedied it: the citizen who has not been able to offer a proper burial to a family member he will sulk indefinitely regardless of our efforts to provide better funeral services promptly. In this regard, it is advisable not to take too lightly the religious life of one's subjects: there is a crowd of divinities to satisfy in the temples and never enough priests to do it! A pharaonic enterprise The pharaoh spares no expense in beautifying his lavish palace. The actual game engine is relatively elementary: ultimately, everything revolves around the pharaoh's prestige, as well as popular satisfaction. When citizens are dissatisfied with the accommodations, consumer goods, and temples of worship we make available to them, they stop being productive. Even before the citizens, however, we must worry about our reputation with the nobles and educated classes of the population, since they will put themselves at our service only if we have shown that we are up to it with construction and military enterprises worthy of their respect and because without scribes , architects, priests and army commanders our society would have no future. The same goes for the neighboring cities, which will be willing to submit to our will or to trade with us, only once the fame of the pharaoh has reached them. The objective development factors, linked to the infrastructureskings and the actual means of production are held in less consideration: it doesn't matter how good the last flood of the Nile was or how many brick factories we have at our disposal to expand the city, if the fields managed by the nobles are not held under control by debt collectors or if the number of architects is insufficient; similarly the social and religious life of our possessions is paralyzed, without enough priests ready to manage it, and we can forget about defending the walls or launching campaigns of conquest, without a qualified commander at the head of our troops... Everything revolves around the pharaoh's prestige, as well as popular satisfaction. A pharaonic enterprise The map and scenario editor to create customized campaigns. The level of challenge is good, even in the easiest mode and also for a savvy player, given the depth of the simulation and the complexity of the economic and social structure on which it rests. The presence of a campaign and scenario editor contributes to further prolonging the longevity. Some unexpected factors, such as the whims of the gods or the unpredictability of the Nile, can make the game a little frustrating at times. The learning curve is certainly above average: it takes some time to master all the management and construction options available, as well as to understand the mechanisms underlying the game. In the light of what has been written so far, it must be recognized that the three tutorials accessible from the main menu (and recommended not only for beginners) are exhaustive and well structured. An additional strategic guide is also proposed on the second disc, which however is not available in Italian. 360 digital fresco The graphics are discreet, not excellent but evocative enough to effectively simulate the colors and flavor of the daily life of our small virtual community. Above all, it offers a good level of detail and an impressive zoom function, which allows you to go from a wide overview of the city to a close-up shot of a single inhabitant caught up in everyday affairs. Camera control is managed entirely via mouse and is immediately practical and intuitive: the wheel allows you to zoom in or out of the displayed area and the right button to rotate it 360, to get to snooping around every corner of the city, spy from the windows of houses and even enlarge the cobblestones of the streets! Too bad for some graphic bugs: after a particularly abundant flood of the Nile, for example, it can happen to see citizens walking in high water as if nothing had happened, others occasionally inexplicably cross walls and layers of land or insistently craniate a statue that he has the misfortune to be in their path. However, there are already patches available that will probably fix even these small flaws. 360 digital fresco The interface does not differ much from that of most management systems, even if the statistics panels are a bit compressed and risk confusing a neophyte of the genre, as well as the numerous construction options that attack us in the crowded drop-down menus . The musical accompaniment is far from intrusive, perhaps too anonymous. The sound effects are sufficiently varied and boast a decent level of quality. A note of merit goes above all to the comments of the characters, which can be heard by zooming in on them: the speech is convincing and does not fail to offer even some original jokes, as well as direct feedback on the economic and social situation of the city (a pity it is not been dubbed). The localization is appreciable, despite some slight inaccuracies in the translation. Comment The developers have used the expression ~people sim~ to define Sons of the Nile and in fact they have managed to offer us something new, which brilliantly departs from the traditional ~city builders~ to give absolute priority to the management of human resources of our virtual civilization, rather than economic and military ones, and to offer an intriguing and multi-faceted simulation. It presents a complex challenge even to veterans of the genre and is a game of great depth, to be peeled layer by layer. For these same reasons, however, it is not a title suitable for everyone: it requires a certain application to face the learning curve and perhaps a little effort to go beyond some game design flaws, which in any case does not affect the fun. Fans of the memorable Pharaoh will appreciate it and the most persistent players will discover an almost inexhaustible source of entertainment.
