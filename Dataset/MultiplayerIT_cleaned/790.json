There is very little to discuss about these basic choices since they concern the personal sphere of every gamer. In fairness to readers, it is fair to say that whoever is writing definitely enjoyed Doom 3 and literally loved Quake 4. But there is still a lot to write before reaching conclusions War of the Worlds The narrative component has never been the strong point of Quake (as well as the other id successes). However, the fourth chapter of the saga tends to be linked to the second episode, bringing the plot back to a struggle of all humanity against the alien threat of the Strogg, a race decidedly similar to the ~Trekkian~ Borg in that they too assimilate any form of life and they ~recycle~ it into new half-organic and half-mechanical vital forms, always for their plans of absolute domination of the universe. But Quake's villains are even more crude, violent, absolutely disinterested in any form of contact, however minimal, with the enemy other than literal annihilation. We play the role of a certain Matthew Kane who is in a corner of the universe in the company of thousands of other fellow soldiers in an attempt to stop the advance Strogg War of the Worlds In this not exactly idyllic picture, we play the role of a certain Matthew Kane who is in a corner of the universe in the company of thousands of other soldiers in an attempt to stop the Strogg advance. Without giving you any preview of the events, we must praise the work of Raven who, although he used very few dialogues, manages to immerse the player in the dimension of war, making us go behind the lines in some moments while other teams are trying to carry out an offensive on the enemy, reporting via radio what is happening to other fellow soldiers, without forgetting some very ~Halian~ situations with sudden arrivals of reinforcements through the landing of immense spaceships. There are also some real twists, told directly with images and interactively, but of which you will not read a single line here so as not to spoil the surprise. It's Old School Baby As anticipated at the beginning of this review, Quake 4 moves clearly on the coordinates of the ~old school~ FPS, the id-style one, so to speak. Simulation, tactics and static situations are banned. The watchword of Quake is incessant action, even if there are many variations on the theme of the classic ~fragmentation~ in a room. First, quite frequently we will not be alone to fight against the Strogg but will have various fellow soldiers to help us in the fight. Even if it is not possible to give any order to the soldiers (who will in any case shoot madly at them) the right balance will still be important between sending them excessively ahead since our absence can cause their rapid elimination but not even pushing us heroically against the enemy without them because in this case we will probably perish. The most interesting novelty concerns some interludes that will take place on various mechanical means. But don't think of Halo as a point of reference for a Call of Duty In addition to various end-of-level monsters, as well as some platform and puzzle contamination, as well as other id-style situations but still full of some variations in the environments and in the development of the conflict, the most interesting novelty concerns some interludes that will take place on various mechanical means (space shuttles, mechs, tanks). However, don't think of Halo as a point of reference for a Call of Duty: some levels will in fact see us only maintaining a turret on top of a vehicle and we will not be able to go down or decide the speed in any way. In others we will completely control the vehicle but it will still be linear and obligatory routes that will act as a ~trait d'union~ between one level on foot and another. As previously written, giving an objective judgment on the choice to continue in the wake traced by Doom 3 and to remain resolutely anchored to tradition is decidedly not simple. In this subcategory of First Person Shooter, however, it can be safely said that Quake 4it definitely has no rivals, offering moments of pure ~fraggatoria~ ecstasy and a sensational pace in the over 10 hours of gameplay that you will need to finish it (especially if you use the quick save very frequently). For more experienced players, the advice is to play it at least at the third level of difficulty to avoid finding it too easy to continue (excluding the final battle which is already really difficult at normal). Wonderful display of power From a technical point of view, Quake 4 represents everything a PC user wants if they have recently upgraded. Raven's programmers have taken the Doom 3 graphics engine and have managed to significantly improve the results obtained by id: the light and shadow management system leaves you even more speechless with visual results incomparable to anything previously seen. Unlike Doom 3 (and its add-on Resurrection of Evil), Quake 4, while sharing a large part of the internal environments, offers a much higher chromatic variety (some levels on bright blue bordering on artistic), mechanical structures even more amazing, a detail of the background textures and characters that can't fail to leave anyone who has the opportunity to see it on a latest generation PC stunned. A masterpiece of sublime level, to the point that I consider it entirely legitimate to wonder if this magnificence will be replicated in the Xbox 360 version Wonderful display of power However, the presence of some small drawbacks cannot be denied: the first concerns the physics which, although considerably improved compared to Doom 3, does not reach the qualitative peaks of Half-Life 2. Some external settings do not always present all the textures of good level (especially those of the rocks). Finally, a still decidedly sore point on most PC productions concerns the autodetect. Had it been for the latter I would have had to play at a resolution of 800x600 pixels without vertical sync and without any antialiasing. Not trusting these parameters, I increased the resolution to 1024x768 pixels, inserted vertical sync and 2X antialiasing: my 3.5 GHz processor, 2 GB of RAM and the 256 MB GeForce 6800 Ultra held up without any problems. problem the impact, guaranteeing a fluidity on 60 frames in any game situation except in some exterior where the FPS per second actually dropped considerably but for very short stretches of the gaming experience. A masterpiece of sublime level, to the point that I consider it entirely legitimate to wonder if this magnificence will be replicated in the Xbox 360 version Silence is golden? Much less enthusiastic tones for the sound component of Quake 4. If the sound effects are discreet (but not wonderful) and the localization in Italian is equally convincing (although there are some qualitative drops and some sensational errors such as sentences spoken by two different voice actors for the same character), much less satisfaction comes from the music. Let's start immediately by saying that we have chosen to adopt a style similar to that of Doom 3 with many and many hours of gameplay that did not have any background music. If for D3 this was appreciable both for the much more horrific atmosphere and for the use of sound effects as an ~industrial~ basis, in Quake 4 there are instead no justifications whatsoever for this decision. Moreover, then the musical tracks, when present, border on almost absolute anonymity, referring to epic themes already heard a billion times on other war-related games, but never reaching any qualitative peak. Multiplayer the game mode, not the site If, as previously written, the single experience is characterized by a certain continuity with the playful coordinates of id from the 90s, it can be said that as regards multiplayer, the Ravens have been even more faithful to the line, absolutely orthodox. Deathmatch, Team DM and Capture The Flag, many servers awaiting you full of scammers, 16 players and online violence: if you loved Quake 3 Arena and want to play it with a latest generation graphics engine, you will also love the multiplayer of Quake IV. If you were expecting any form of novelty then you will be greatly disappointed. Deathmatch, Team DM and Capture The Flag, many servers waiting for you full of fraggers, 16 players and online violence Quake 4 360! A new chapter in the mammoth saga that has marked the evolution of FPS on PC can only be an event and, thanks to the improvements made on the Doom 3 engine by the Ravens, it seems that id has hit the mark with a solid and edgy old school shooter effective. Quake 4 is also in the pipeline on Xbox 360 and at X05 in Amsterdam, Todd Hollenshead (CEO of id) showed us an advanced version of the code conversion at length, which we also got to try out. The game, apart from some fluidity problems probably related to the optimizations still to be made, was completely similar to the PC counterpart. The ability to adapt the gameplay to the Joypad, rather than to the mouse-keyboard combination, remains to be seen, but these factors, as well as greater frame rate stability, can only be evaluated in the review in mid-December. For now, enjoy the exclusive long film, shot in Amsterdam with footage taken from the Xbox 360 version of Quake 4! The book Masters of Doom is the book, written by David Kushner and published in Italy by Multiplayer.it Edizioni, which tells the story of the two Johns who were the first to create the genre that best represents the frenetic and adrenaline-pumping spirit of videogames, the first-person shooter person. From DooM to Quake, passing through Wolfenstein 3D and the first shareware experiments, John Carmack and John Romero, with id Software, have been able to revolutionize and mature a market, the video game market, which today is second to none. More information Buy online Final comment Here we are, after Doom 3, another of the biggest names in video game history returns in the new millennium. With the other id masterpiece, Quake 4 undoubtedly shares many things: first of all the graphics engine that the Ravens still push to higher qualitative peaks, taking the player's breath away on more than one occasion thanks to a system of lights and shadows unmatched, to top-level textures and even more amazing mechanical structures in the background. Furthermore, with Doom 3, Quake 4 clearly shares the coordinates of the ~old school~ FPS, the one in the id style, so to speak: simulation, tactics and static situations are banned. The watchword of Quake is incessant action, even if there are many variations on the theme of the classic ~fragmentation~ in a room, starting with the use of mechanical means (but in a very linear way, like Call of Duty so to speak ) and by the presence of other fellow soldiers (but no orders to give never!). If we add an immersive background to all this, which will make us experience the Strogg war in a very strong and suggestive way, you can easily understand why Quake 4 is to be considered the best FPS in the sub-category of those with an ~arcade~ setting. A pity that such a masterpiece (because this is what it is) is tarnished by a negative peak in the sound component (in particular as regards the music) bordering on the inexplicable for a title of such high value. Finally, the total absence of novelties for multiplayer and fidelity to the 90s id line are the discriminating factors to truly understand if Quake 4 is the right title for you. Pros Shocking graphics Masterful pace and game action Faithful to the line of id tradition but full of successful variations on the theme Cons Sound (especially the music) not up to the rest With excessive use of Quick Save it won't last you more than 10 hours Anyone who doesn't like old school id probably won't like Quake 4 A universal name In the world of video games, over the years, there have been many beautiful games, many masterpieces, but only very few titles are capable of attracting attention in a literally universal way. Undoubtedly the name of Quake falls into this small rather elitist category, associated almost symbiotically with that of Doom. Over the last 15 months both have seen their saga enriched by a new chapter, both are powered by the same graphics engine, both have received rather mixed feedback between players and insiders.", "date": "2005-10-24", "grade": null}
