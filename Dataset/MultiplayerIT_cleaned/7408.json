However, the Wii U version was still missing, awaited by many onlookers to verify which of the two generations of consoles would be closest from a technical point of view. Now that we've had a chance to test it thoroughly, here are our thoughts on it While still a great game, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag on Wii U is the least successful version I am a pirate and a gentleman From a strictly content point of view, this Wii U version of Assassin's Cred IV: Black Flag is identical in all respects to the offer for the other platforms, therefore we refer you to our previous review to find out every detail of the latest addition to the saga ubisoft. Here we will focus, as usual, on the characteristics of porting in the strict sense, analyzing in particular the differences that emerge from a technical and control point of view. It must be said that, as recently revealed by the French software house itself, the Wii U version starts with the unpleasant handicap caused by being the only release that will not be able to enjoy future additional content released via DLC: an element whose impact is undoubtedly very variable from one player to another, but which in fact deprives the product of a card with which to play in comparison with other platforms. While making an effort to put peace in his heart for yet another penalizing decision, a Nintendo user who decides to buy Assassin's Cred IV: Black Flag would still be faced with a product that graphically does not reflect the gap between the Wii U hardware and that of past generation consoles. Net of a cosmetic rendering distinguishable for very slight details from the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, the game appears here weighed down by a frame rate that practically always settles below the threshold of 30 frames per second, losing further shots when the situation gets worse agitated, especially in combat phases. Not that the title was exempt from similar problems on the platforms mentioned above (far from it), but in a direct comparison Assassin's Cred IV: Black Flag on Wii U is certainly less fluid, with consequences that sometimes also marginally affect the gameplay when a drop in frame rate does not allow you to perform the desired action with the necessary promptness, an eventuality which can mainly occur during the stunt run. Trying to see the glass half full, it must be said that the Nintendo hardware manages to score some hits, especially as regards the definition of the textures, which in some cases appears more defined than what was seen in the competing versions: given that these are trifles that do not even involve the entire graphic sector of the title - and which are easier to grasp during the interlude sequences rather than during the actual playful action - we can still speak of a moderate counterbalance to the problems of frame rates expressed above. Leaving aside the parallels with other platforms for a moment, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is still a very nice game to look at, capable of staging a great variety of settings and reaching remarkable peaks of spectacularity especially during the exhilarating naval battles . Real killers don't use touchscreens Although subjected to various improvements and modifications in the passage from one chapter to another, the control system developed by Ubisoft is still far from absolute perfection, and therefore also in Assassin's Cred IV: Black Flag for Wii U managing Edward's movements is an easy operation but which occasionally leaves room for some grumbling for commands that are not perfectly interpreted by the character on the screen. From this point of view we are therefore on the same side as the performances verified on the other platforms, while thanks to the Gamepad it was reasonable to expect some significant integration delegated to the touchscreen: a wish that was only partially fulfilled by Ubisoft, which preferred not to tread hand using the second screen as a mere extension of the game interface. By selecting the default configuration, a large part of the surface of the display of the controller is occupied by the map, surrounded by indicators relating to Edward's health and notoriety, the amount of money available and the equipment contested at that moment. It's a pity to note that interaction with the touch screen is really reduced to a minimum, being able to count only on the zoom function and a couple of virtual keys that occasionally avoid having to interrupt the game action to access certain content. Too bad, because there was plenty of room for maneuver: it would have been enough to delegate all the functions of the menus to the Gamepad (change of equipment, crafting, reading documents, etc., etc.) to make the progress of the adventure more pleasant and fluid, but anyway And. On the other hand, the possibility of completely eliminating the HUD on the TV screen to exploit only the one present on the touch screen is contemplated, a solution that is not particularly convenient, however, which forces you to have to turn too frequently to the controller display. Finally, there is the always welcome option that allows you to play directly on the Gamepad: in this case you have to deal with writings and indicators that become really microscopic, however obtaining in exchange an excellent visual rendering that manages to mitigate the aliasing effect, giving to the game graphics a slightly softer look.", "date": "2013-12-12", "grade": "8.7"}
