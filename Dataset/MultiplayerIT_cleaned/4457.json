We know for example that Super Mario will not cut his mustache, that every year we will see a new Call of Duty, that Half Life 3 will never be released and that each Street Fighter game will come in different editions, each with new characters, stages and gameplay changes . When Capcom assured that there would be no further versions of Street Fighter V, deep down we already knew that it would be a sailor's promise. Not so much (not only) because the series has accustomed us to ~Super~ and ~Ultra~ editions since the 90s, but above all in light of the bad debut of the fifth chapter. Since its launch in 2016, Street Fighter V has been a fighting game with great gameplay, solid mechanics and a pace that is ideal for online tournaments and exhibitions. Yet, the poverty of content and single-player modes, the instability of matchmaking and the absence of side options have annoyed and disheartened all those who don't just want to compete with other people in a fighting game. The team led by Yoshinori Ono has thus rolled up their sleeves, gradually improving the experience with technical fixes, a (real) story mode, periodic challenges, online options and new content to unlock, including additional arenas, frills and fighters. A process of improvement that lasted two years and culminated with the recent launch of the Arcade Edition. In order not to fragment the community and dissatisfy the loyalists of the first hour, the update can be downloaded free of charge for all those who already have the original Street Fighter V, while those who purchase it in the shop will find the twelve additional characters introduced with Seasons 1 and 2. comeback One of the main novelties of Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition is the one that gives its name to this edition. The traditional Arcade mode (in which to face a series of matches against artificial intelligence, up to a boss fight) was one of the most incomprehensible shortcomings of the original game. It took two years for such a seemingly trivial feature to be introduced, but after many excuses, promises and postponements, Capcom tries to make up for the delay by doing things right. The one that arrived in Street Fighter V is not a simple Arcade option, but a celebration of the entire franchise, starting from its origins and arriving to the present day. It is possible to take six different paths, each of which is linked to a particular chapter of the saga: from the first Street Fighter of 1987 to Street Fighter V, passing through the acclaimed Alpha series or Street Fighter III: New Generation. By choosing Street Fighter II, for example, you only face the characters that were present in the roster of that specific chapter (Chun-li, Guile, Ken, Balrog, Vega...), and there are no shortage of references and winks: the final boss is obviously M.Bison, some music is an arrangement of historical themes, while costumes and arenas are chosen to be as coherent as possible with the original game. Some historical information is given on the release of Street Fighter II and on the innovations introduced at the time, while there is also the classic bonus level in which you have to destroy barrels with punches and kicks. The ability to unlock illustrations and endings for each character encourages you to complete each branch of the Arcade mode with all fighters. Furthermore, unlike the disappointing Story and Survival modes, Capcom has this time been careful to offer a balanced and non-trivial difficulty curve: the level of the opponents grows as you progress through the Arcade, until you get to a boss battle quite challenging. Make way for Sakura The release of Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition also marks the beginning of the third season of characters that will enrich the roster. Over the next few months, well-known faces such as Blanka, Sagat and Cody will return, together with the new entries Falke and G, but to open the dances there is the fan girl preferred by fans of the series. Sakura takes up most of the techniques seen in Street Fighter IV, adding to her arsenal a whole series of new attacks and abilities that make her more versatile and unpredictable. In fact, depending on the V-Trigger chosen, the combos it is able to create and the tools to rely on change. To regain the trust of fans, Season 3 couldn't have started with a more suitable character. Triggered Joining the Arcade mode are a handful of other options. The team battles already seen in Street Fighter IV are back, allowing teams of up to five people to face each other, customizing the type of match and elimination rules. Equally interesting are the Battaglsie Extras, periodic challenges where you can win costumes, nameplates, experience points or Fight Money. The prizes can be quite greedy, but to take part in these challenges you have to pay an entrance ticket to Fight Money: so you have to be careful if you don't want to burn precious credits in failed attempts. There are many less obvious (but equally welcome) news of Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition: a clearer sound warns that the Critical Art is ready to be used, the loading times have decreased before entering the game, and new options in the Training modes allow you to clearly control the frames of the attacks, to immediately understand how advantageous it is to use certain techniques and combos. The most important news for the most competitive enthusiasts, however, is the addition of a second V-Trigger for each character. Similar to the Street Fighter IV Ultras, it is now possible to choose which of the two V-Triggers to use before entering the game. In some cases the new V-Trigger enhances particular fighting styles, in others it puts a patch on the weak points of the character, in still others it gives new attacks to create unprecedented combos. The V-Trigger 2 shuffles the cards, stimulates you to try the entire roster again and, above all, allows you to infuse more personality into your character.", "date": "2018-01-21", "grade": "9.0"}
