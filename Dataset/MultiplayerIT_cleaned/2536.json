{"name": "FOG - Battle Royale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fog-battle-royale-recensione.html", "text": "The MOBA genre and the battle royale genre undoubtedly have some elements in common, for example the fact that in both cases our character starts from scratch and has to follow a growth path limited to a single game, acquiring new equipment to become more strong. However, if on the one hand the competition is limited to a few participants, in the context of a team experience devoted to balance and strategy, on the other hand you find yourself facing a frenetic all-against-all in which only the last man standing wins the match. Well, what would a mix of these two formulas look like? Let's find out in the review of FOG - Battle Royale. Gameplay The first thing FOG - Battle Royale asks us to do is choose the type of character we want to control among three different options: Thief, Inquisitor or Bounty Hunter. Each of them boasts a different growth path, with the possibility of unlocking numerous classes, all equipped with specific skills and characteristics. Once a game is started, the gameplay of the game is revealed right from the start to be completely similar to a MOBA with direct controls, in this case a virtual stick that can be repositioned on the left side of the screen and some huge icons on the right side, unfortunately not resizable at the moment, which allow you to carry out the basic attack, use special moves, use objects and perform a shot. The inevitable cooldowns add the strategic depth necessary to make the clashes interesting, but the similarities with the multiplayer online battle arena do not stop there: during the match we will be able to ~grow~ also and above all by eliminating minions of various shapes and sizes, breaking crates and collecting on the fly weapons (just stand on them, if they are better than ours, or touch them) and useful resources to become more competitive. While the traditional mortal circle around the large map shrinks, sometimes forcing us to follow impervious roads due to the peculiarities of the scenario , the thirty players on the server inevitably end up meeting. At that point duels come to life here too in perfect MOBA style, in which timing and distance have enormous value and can make the difference between victory and defeat. Unfortunately in FOG - Battle Royale the impacts are not valued, on the contrary the shots tend to ~slip~ in an inconsistent way, making the detection of collisions confusing. However, this is not the only element of the game that would need a fix, given that the beta nature of the Playneta project makes itself felt with some crazy controls and even rather annoying glitches. However, it is appropriate to look at the proverbial glass half full: we are faced with an open construction site which, net of the pay-to-win implications very clearly linked to the monetization system chosen by the authors, appears to have great potential and a load of freshness that can the difference in the long run, provided of course that the support is punctual and precise. Structure and technique We were talking about the ~work in progress~, which is inevitably also reflected in the structure of FOG - Battle Royale: also in order not to break up the user base, the game offers a single mode which nonetheless works well, with a fast and (relatively) matchmaking few latency issues. As already reported, however, there are some annoying glitches and the translation of the texts into Italian is largely incomplete. From the point of view of the technical realization, a very essential sound sector has been opted for, while the graphics draw on fantasy imagery to give life to captivating protagonists, characterized by a convincing design and many unlockable aesthetic customizations. The options allow you to push everything to the maximum in terms of resolution and frame rate, and it is naturally in this way that the title gives its best.", "date": "2021-02-17", "grade": "7.0"}
