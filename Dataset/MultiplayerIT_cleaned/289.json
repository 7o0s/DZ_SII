{"name": "Dark Messiah of Might &amp; Magic - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dark-messiah-of-might-amp-magic-recensione.html", "text": "Fantasy beast The above hype, as well as thanks to targeted strategies on the part of the manufacturer, was also born spontaneously, because the programmers behind the Dark Messiah project are respectable (they are the developers of the beautiful and underrated first-person RPG Arx Fatalis), because the game uses the Half-Life 2 engine and in the past it was sponsored by Gabe Newell in fat and bone, because the license and the settings are those of the very famous Might & Magic. The story tells of the events that took place in the world of Ashan, where after a very long period of battles to prevent the demons from conquering the territory, men, elves and dwarves managed to emerge victorious. The success of the war was mainly due to the wizard Sar-Elam, who managed to drive out the demons and lock them up in a limbo of eternal fire created with his own soul. In time, however, a tiny breach opened in this spiritual prison, and 67 years after Sar-Elam's death his disciple Sar-Shazzar prophesied that one day a half-demon, half-man child would be born who would be called The Dark Messiah and that he would destroy the demon prison forever. It is here that Sareth enters the scene, the protagonist of which the player must take control, who will find himself having to recover the skull of Sar-Elam, necessary to close again the limbo in which the demons have been confined. The setting is that of a first-person shooter with a fantasy setting and rhythms far from frenzy, embellished with a large amount of RPG elements such as the development (albeit limited) of the character. Warrior, wizard or assassin? For the ~what will I do when I grow up~ series, Dark Messiah has a system that allows the player to earn points as the adventure progresses and then assign them to certain skills that are broadly divided into three different categories: skills magic, combat skills, and stealth skills. The user can therefore choose whether to specialize in one of these three branches, becoming respectively a real warrior, wizard or assassin, or to balance everything and, as the good Captain Findus did with cod, take only the best of each class (of course such a thing prevents you from acquiring all the skills of a specific class). The fights with white weapons are quite well implemented and even if who knows what tactical skill is not required to win the fights, the resulting show is always of a good standard and the fun never fails. These clashes, as already mentioned in the hands-on, are probably the most brutal ever seen in a video game, and not so much for the violence itself but for the dynamics and vehemence that the polygonal characters almost always manage to convey . [C] My dear, if you weren't a gentleman you would soon regret looking out there; Ah, I really don't understand modern art [/C] the fights with white weapons are quite well implemented Warrior, wizard or assassin? Everything is then embellished by the numerous spells available, which in addition to being quite useful, also give a certain depth to the game mechanics, allowing the user to face a fight in various ways: you can opt for a direct attack with fireballs , lightning or whatever, stealthily place traps and then lure enemies onto them, use telekinesis to exploit elements of the scenario, hypnotize a hostile creature to fight alongside us and so on. To complete it all comes the more than discreet management of physics and the various ~environmental aids~ that the programmers have disseminated throughout the game, so that statues can be brought down on the unfortunate ones on duty, exploit sharp spikes to stab those who don't go there genius, use small tables, wooden crates or chairs as thrown weapons, or simply send an enemy flying off a cliff by kicking them. As already mentioned, the most fun way to play is probably to create an intermediate class that can exploit warrior, mage and assassin skills, expertly mixing the combat tactics of each. Slashing a bunch of goblins with a broadsword, then slaying orcs with fireballs and finally sneaking up behind an armed guard to slit their throats, well we assure you it's pretty fun. The duration of the single player campaign is about 10-12 hours, and for the most savvy users we recommend starting directly on the difficult level because at the normal level some fights are a little too easy and not very satisfying. Multiplayer The multiplayer of Dark Messiah of Might & Magic ricasks for the installation of Steam, from Valve. Load times are outrageously long here too. The multiplayer modes are: deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag, colosseum (a kind of combat arena), crusade (a kind of counter-strike where instead of terrorists and anti-terrorists face undead and humans). In online multiplayer you will have to choose a precise class of belonging between assassin, archer, priestess, magician and warrior. The abilities of each class are numerous, and many of them do not appear at all in the single player mode (for example the ability to play dead, being able to shoot multiple arrows at the same time, new spells and so on). The tactical potential, especially in some of these modes, is particularly interesting and makes the multiplayer add a considerable amount of longevity to the game. Graphics and sound From a graphic point of view, the Arkane Studios creature fails to amaze us as we would have expected, and while boasting character design and artistic quality, it presents some scenarios with low polygon-count and low-resolution textures placed here and there, to clash with more defined ones. The only thing that stands out is the lighting (in case you can activate HDR), which gives spectacular effects and guarantees a discreet injection of realism to the environments. No one expected a miracle from a graphics engine that is now more than two years old, but a few more little tricks would not have been unwelcome, especially in light of the fact that the hardware requirements to better enjoy Dark Messiah are disproportionate to what it offers on screen. loading times between levels are unnerving Graphics and sound Unfortunately the problems with excessive RAM requirements have not been resolved, and unless you have 2 GB equipped you will face an unnerving load time between levels, as well as occasional disk swaps while playing (in the if you only have 512 MB of RAM and you are not a master of Zen practice, we advise you to leave it alone). The Italian dubbing cannot be counted among the best ever heard in the history of video games but it does its job well anyway and, summing up, it stands at good levels (particularly noteworthy are the voice of Xana and those of the goblins, shrill and clumsy). The music is very evocative and well made. Conclusions Dark Messiah of Might & Magic is a fun, well-balanced and engaging game that every fan of fantasy FPS shouldn't miss, but in some respects it's also a real disappointment: Arkane Studios' title doesn't reach the graphical standards it would be reasonable to expect in such a production and above all it is heavily penalized by preposterous loading times and an inexplicable greed for hardware resources. Ultimately we can say that instead of the Messiah we were all waiting for, a good game has simply arrived, capable of making several hours of entertainment pass but not revolutionizing or adding something essential to the world of first-person shooters.Pros Fun and varied Excellent fantasy atmosphere Good online multiplayer mode Cons Graphics not great Unjustified hardware demands Uninspired plot and storytelling ~The Dark Messiah has finally arrived among us.~ An introductory hat of this kind might seem written by a hardened beast of Satan, who slaughters kids and howls at the moon, but no: the wait for this Dark Messiah of Might & Magic has been matured in a climate of strong hype, with information , movies and images wisely sipped and released with a timing able to always keep interest in the title high. Therefore, many players who love first person shooters and fantasy games have long fantasized about images of orcs, wizards, goblins and dragons as if they were a Max calendar, and now that Ubisoft has finally released its little gem (after a substantial delay ), it is appropriate to say: ~finally~. But it is known that excessive hype can often be as useful to the producer as it is counterproductive for the player, and the expectations made very high by the media bombardment could be, sometimes more, sometimes less, disappointed.
