{"name": "Anno 1800 Console Edition  Il capolavoro Ubisoft Blue Byte arriva su console!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/anno-1800-console-edition-recensione.html", "text": "Why is Anno 1800 a masterpiece? We have already dedicated a very long article to this answer, but this is the review of Anno 1800 Console Edition and a review is very necessary. Ready? It's a masterpiece because it has stunning graphics, an amazing level of detail, an outstanding urban system and an economy that makes your head spin. It also hides a dizzying amount of systems and subsystems, which multiply in number if we take into consideration the additional paid content where two new settings are also introduced, Africa and the Arctic, in addition to the two already present in the base game , Europe and the Caribbean. Surprise porting Anno 1800 Console Edition: Perfectionists will go crazy discovering the number of customizations present Too bad, but not too fearful, that this new version for the latest generation consoles must at the moment give up the numerous expansions released; however, you will find some of the lesser cosmetic packages as cold consolation. While it's a disappointment not to be able to aspire to the wonderful complete package available on PC, even in its basic form Anno 1800 is a wonderful title and full of gameplay. There is talk of hundreds of hours between a rare transport campaign and a sandbox mode already as you will find it potentially infinite. There is so much game that many users probably won't feel the need to want more; those who want more and more, will have to hope that Blue Byte brings the four season passes (each consisting of three major expansions) also on consoles. However, this is not so obvious: Anno 1800 is a complex game, particularly greedy for RAM, and on a PC to make full use of all its contents it is recommended to have 32 GB available; while 16 - or those of PS5 and Xbox Series X | S - are more than enough for less extreme use. Maybe choices will have to be made, maybe not, in the meantime let's enjoy a game that we didn't even think would ever arrive on consoles. Anno 1800 is a product that could drive you crazy, especially if you regret the nights with Caesar and Pharaoh and would like something just as beautiful and catalysing. In Anno 1800 the player's aim is to build an increasingly prosperous city on an unspecified, but clearly non-existent, archipelago of Central European islands. You start with an already built port/warehouse and a ship; we will therefore have to deal with streets, market and houses. The first to arrive will be the farmers, with their thatched houses and their simple primary needs: fish to put on the table, which will require a fishing pier, and decent clothes, which will need a herd of sheep and a weaver. The more the people's requests are met, the more the houses will be occupied up to their maximum ceiling, providing us with more workers for each square built. Anno 1800 Console Edition is essential and superfluous Anno 1800 Console Edition: the islands of the game do not allow a great use of the railways, but for the advanced technologies these will be fundamental When a house is fully occupied, we will finally be able to improve it by making it evolve into a higher class: in this case, we will move from a shack to the first one or two-storey houses, mainly made of wood and stone. This is how workers will arrive, more erudite than the first and naturally with more needs: a church for example, meat and soap which are two products that will draw on a single resource represented by pigs, then a pub where you can finally revel and let the beer flow in rivers. Speaking of beer: to produce it you will need wheat, hops, a malthouse and finally a brewery; of course each of these buildings will need a certain number of workers of different ranks to function, and all will require maintenance costs which will be absorbed by taxes. After the workers will come the engineers, the theatre, the museum, increasingly large and glittering houses, tracks and trains, even electric light, illuminations and everything that has characterized the industrial revolution, for better or for worse. Welcome to the Caribbean Anno 1800 Console Edition: there are those who prefer to build in an organic and natural way, and those who instead want to maximize production and income, which side are you on? The wealthy, however, are not the type to be easily satisfied. Sooner or later you will discover that the island you call home will not be able to satisfy all the needs of the more specialized citizens, so you will have to rely on trade or go and colonize new islands. Inevitably, the time will also come to organize the first expedition to the new world, where in a totally different setting you will have to create a new colony to cultivate andproduce everything that cannot be found on the old continent: rubber, rum, bananas, coffee and much more. At this point you will have already become familiar with the trade routes which, you will discover, will also have to be defended by the most belligerent AIs. The combat system of Anno 1800 is exclusively naval and in the sandbox mode, just like the diplomatic part, it can even be completely excluded to better concentrate on the real focus of the game. Special shipments Anno 1800 Console Edition: each island has its raw materials, sooner or later you will have to expand your possessions or start importing (and exporting!) goods We talked about a game full of subsystems and there would be many things to tell you. For example, naval expeditions are played as a sort of exciting game book, whose choices are conditioned by the special units that we can insert in the free slots of the boats. An expert sailor or a reinforced hull can make all the difference in saving the crew in the most thorny situations. Special units can also be used in some city buildings, in order to take advantage of bonuses that allow, for example, to increase the harvest of particular resources, or enhance the health coverage of a hospital. The rest, damn it, it's good that you find out for yourself by playing and enjoying the top quality graphics of Anno 1800, so full of details that we are sure that some of you will spend hours just admiring your creations, from every angle, during the day and at night, in the rain and on the sunniest days. console edition Anno 1800 Console Edition: the war takes place only by sea, but you also need to defend your coasts with cannons and other defense systems Technically, the console version is doing very well: the beauty of Anno 1800 has remained intact, although there is a certain parsimony in the definition of the textures that scale in quality very often just to keep the application light. Cheats that will prove to be essential to keep Anno 1800 playable even when our empires extend between multiple islands on two different continents. In this version the game interface has been completely redesigned, and relies heavily on several radial menus that can be recalled instantly, at any time, completely replacing the menu at the bottom of the screen that distinguishes the PC version. While the comparison with the comfort, precision and speed of a mouse remains unequal, the solution found is decidedly functional. If you are used to holding a pad, especially to come to terms with a pad, these are problems that practically do not exist. However, we still don't understand why all these adaptations of strategy and management consoles do not include a version compatible with mice and keyboards ...", "date": "2023-03-21", "grade": "9.0"}
