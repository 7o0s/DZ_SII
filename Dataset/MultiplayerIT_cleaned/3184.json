Many think that trash video games, i.e. video games focused on vulgar, blasphemous and, more generally, bad taste concepts and contents, are a recent invention in the world of video games. In reality they have always existed, as demonstrated by the numerous exponents that can be found in the software libraries of vintage systems such as the Commodore 64, Oric II, or ZX Spectrum, just to name a few. Alongside the videogame productions with a more canonical imagery, there have always been small or large works which, moved by an adolescent anarchic spirit, more excess of pimples than Max Stirner, have staged the obscene. After all, becoming a rebel isn't difficult: show a nun having sex with a priest and at fifteen you'll think you've made who knows what ferocious indictment against religion, or tell of a politician who puffs cocaine and does business with the underworld and you will feel like the Martin Scorsese of the Noantri in less than no time. Wanking Simulator, literally: ~masturbation simulator~, a first-person action game with open maps, follows exactly this vein, imitating in form and largely also in substance, that Goat Simulator that first parodied the videogame genre more serious of all, that of Farming Simulators or Flight Simulators, using physics to create surreal game situations, and erecting polygonal interpenetrations and nonsense into poetry. But if the title of Coffee Stain was born from a successful joke, that of MrCiastku seems to want to do everything to appear as politically incorrect as possible. History Winston Gay is back in Gay Bay (wow)! The corrupt government took his house after neighbors reported him for making too much noise while masturbating, and now he wants revenge. Wanking Simulator begins with our avenger in his underwear explaining his tragic story. Parked his pink van on the outskirts of Gay Bay, a small town made up of a church, a school bigger than the inhabited area and a handful of houses, he has to start working to get justice. As? At the beginning he is assigned a series of objectives: steal documents, take the priest's book from the church altar, talk to an old professor of his who has always loved him and others, which evolve into a kind of campaign that becomes increasingly absurd from chapter to chapter. Winston, however, has only one way to pursue his goals ... actually two: to destroy everything that comes before him and masturbate. By destroying everything we really mean going around kicking and punching everything, spreading death and devastation. Consider that with a simple kick, Winston manages to turn entire rooms upside down. Gameplay After killing his enemies, be they policemen, infernal demons, soldiers or ordinary citizens, the Super Saiyan of masturbation enthusiasts can masturbate (the penis cannot be seen, but the movement of the hand and the sounds are very clear) on their corpses, making the amount of sperm in his scrotum, which he can then use to launch devastating attacks such as a jet of destruction or a real explosive splash, capable of blowing up cars, people and furniture. If desired, he can also use his mana pool (yes, in addition to the sperm gauge he has a mana gauge) to run at breakneck speed and, after double jumping, punch the ground with a punch that creates a wave of devastating impact. Winston actually has various powers related to masturbation and mana, some selectable immediately, others to be purchased from creepy-looking shopkeepers and strange merchandise, scattered around the maps without real logic. The money to make purchases is left by the corpses of enemies and has the shape of the classic wad of banknotes. In addition to powers, Winston can buy weapons such as axes, machetes or shovels, which make his attacks more powerful, or various consumable items, such as hand grenades, Molotov cocktails, large rocks and other amenities, the use of which should be quite clear. Once all the objectives of a map have been achieved, you move on to the next one, where the script repeats itself almost identical to the previous one, only with different objectives and situations. Horribly beautiful One Wanking Simulator would like to hate it. Let's say really. We are facing the fair of graphic glitches and approximation. A game with a rambling design in which there is not a single element finished to the right point: the maps seem randomly drawn, the 3D models are from a stock site, the animations are terrible, the artificial intelligence of the enemies is practically non-existent, the campaign has notsense, the hits do not give clear feedback when they hit and the bugs that plague the whole experience are very numerous. There is also that typical right-handed cannarolo humor, which is so politically incorrect in the eyes of the simplest minds, with continuous jokes about gays and transsexuals, probably aimed at raising scandal but in fact simply very sad. Yet in some moments MrCiastku's game is truly liberating. It seems like a boy's dream, torn between wanting to satisfy his destructive impulses and wanting to repress them, which becomes reality. How to say it without getting arrested... let's see... Here, having a dozen opponents reach you and then blowing them all up at the same time with a squirt of explosive sperm is damned funny, as is entering a house and making kick all the furniture away, or watch opponents wedged into walls and floors after sweeping them away with shovels. In other games we would be horrified by certain problems with the graphics engine, but not in Wanking Simulator. It's like the game itself is the perfect context for some bugs. At one point there is also a driving phase, done very badly, but always so over the top as to be joyfully awful. Contents It must be said that all the campaign missions are dotted with easter eggs and little extras that break the gameplay a bit. Despite this, don't expect who knows how much content. To finish a Wanking Simulator mission we are talking about a couple of tens of minutes. Counting that there are six missions in total, you do the math. To lengthen the broth we think destruction for its own sake, which if you want is the only activity that really makes sense (would anyone buy a similar game for the sake of the story?), and the gimmick of not allowing you to save the game, which forces to start over a mission in case of death, an occurrence not too rare given the high number of enemies to be faced simultaneously and the bugs that occasionally kill for no apparent reason. For the rest, MrCiastku's game offers four extra modes: Sandbox, in which you can play the missions of the main campaign with customized options (for example, you can eliminate the police and you can select infinite mana and sperm); Challenges, five in total, in which you have to carry out the assigned tasks in the shortest possible time; Arena, basically a horde mode in which you fight against waves of enemies of increasing strength and intensity, and Parkour, in which you use Winston's agility to run up buildings. At launch, the first free DLC was also released, called Wankhan, in which the goal is to save oneself from the Onanism-19 virus (to say the level of humor). As a final note, we report that Wanking Simulator is also compatible with VR viewers (we tested it flat) and that, if you are interested, you can download a demo from the Steam page of the game, so as to get a more precise idea of what we are talking about .", "date": "2020-03-18", "grade": "6.0"}
