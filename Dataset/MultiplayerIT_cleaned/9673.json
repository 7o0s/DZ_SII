The use of a strong puzzle component in a role-playing context inspired other subsequent projects, including the atypical yet very entertaining Might and Magic: Clash of Heroes. And it is precisely this last game that the guys from Axion Logic were inspired by with their latest title for iPhone and iPod Touch: chronoSgear, it is better to say it immediately, offers the same and identical combat system introduced by Clash of Heroes, and it is precisely this that makes it different from all the other RPGs available on the App Store. The cartoon graphic style is another element in common with the Nintendo DS game, but at least the developers had the good sense to propose an original setting and storyline. The trio of mobsters As Starck, a young member of the Amici mafia family, the player is faced with several tasks, including going back in time and eliminating a member of the rival clan. A bit The Godfather and a bit Back to the Future, chronoSgear projects the clichs of the underworld organization in a very intriguing way in a futuristic setting, although it is often difficult to take it seriously: this is due both to the amount of awkward names of Italian origin, and to the constant coaxing of the characters. The manga style initially jars a bit, but it doesn't take much to get used to, especially since many of the illustrations, as well as the cutscenes narrated in comic form, are extremely pleasant to look at. In the game world, you move through a directional pad that appears wherever you touch the screen. Unfortunately, especially due to only two axes of movement, moving is rather cumbersome and uncomfortable, which makes having to reach your goal between one fight and another quite annoying. Once in battle, things get much more interesting, but if those who have played Clash of Heroes know the mechanics well, all the others need a brief explanation: each battle consists in fact of a sort of turn-based board game, in in which the two opponents deploy their units, facing each other. The battlefield consists of a grid on which your soldiers are arranged more or less randomly, but the player can only move units in his own half of the field. Wanting to simplify, on your turn you can move certain units from one column to another, and once you have created a vertical row of three identical soldiers, they will prepare an attack. Similarly, by placing three horizontally it is possible to create a barrier that acts as a shield against enemy attacks. Once one of the players' energy is depleted, the game ends. There are several limits and rules that make the game very intricate and strategic, but this mix of turn-based battles and Tic-Tac-Toe is ultimately much more fun, rewarding and brainy than it initially seems. There is also no shortage of special techniques and bosses capable of giving more variety to the battles, but although the mechanics are perfectly taken from Clash of Heroes, the stylistic care and graphic vivacity that characterized his battles are missing. Fortunately, the developers have given the possibility to always escape from the hateful random encounters, but the bad balance of the difficulty forces the player to grind sessions that are far too long. Finally, those who want can also face a friend in local multiplayer mode, although it is hoped that Axion Logic will soon integrate Game Center and the ability to challenge each other online.
