{"name": "Magic Brick Wars", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/magic-brick-wars-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Magic Brick Wars, the new title from Halfbrick Studios, starts from a rather bitter observation: seeing such a talented team, author of games like Fruit Ninja and Jetpack Joyride, limiting themselves to making a clone of Clash Royale doesn't put good humor and indeed leaves rather perplexed with respect to the current state of the mobile market, the protagonist in recent months of changes that have certainly destabilized it, see the launch of Apple Arcade. The space dedicated to freemium productions has therefore turned into a sort of minefield, but if not even an important reality like the Australian company takes risks, creating something new and original, then there is cause for concern. Closed this necessary parenthesis, as you will have understood Magic Brick Wars is a multiplayer-based strategy in which two players have the task of placing their units on the playing field so that they touch the enemy base and explode like kamikazes, determining the loss of some of the hearts that make up the vital energy indicator. The game is won by the one who survives, it is clear, but there are a couple of substantial differences compared to the already mentioned Clash Royale: in the first place, the characters move strictly vertically, remaining within the confines of the column on which we placed them; secondly, you don't live only on attack but also on defense, with the possibility of placing Tetris-style tetrominoes that can slow down the opponent's advance. Inside them, hence the name of the game, there may be blocks which, once destroyed, give life to a special effect linked to fire, ice and so on. Gameplay and structure If from the point of view of the actual action Magic Brick Wars boasts some differences compared to the Supercell blockbuster, the same cannot be said of the management of the deck and the crates, which is practically cloned from Clash Royale. As matches are won, it is possible not only to level up, but also to obtain coins and cards to be used for upgrading and/or unlocking new units. The roster is clearly very rich and varied, and the horror theme is respected by the presence of various skeletons in the form of pirates, wizards, stealthy fighters, etc. You can also find some protagonists of the games developed by Halfbrick Studios: a nice touch that fans of the team will certainly appreciate. When you are not challenging other users, then, you can use the energy you have collected to explore dungeons and destroy stone blocks that contain useful resources: a very simple and unattractive extra activity, but which allows you to increase ~revenue~ without submitting to the expectations, even quite long, for the opening of the boxes. Unfortunately, the gameplay and the technical realization of Magic Brick Wars didn't drive us crazy. The formula developed by the developers is derivative to say the least, but above all it thrives on grafts that don't seem to fit too much with this type of strategic experience. Considering then that a large part of the game appears at least already seen, the desire to grow one's deck and unlock new units becomes inversely proportional to the time we have already spent with the aforementioned Clash Royale, undoubtedly more effective and convincing in representing certain mechanics. The speech extends to the technical realization, which beyond the assets copied from the Supercell title fails to break through, presenting somewhat limited animations and a final result that does not seem up to the team's previous works.", "date": "2019-11-19", "grade": "6.5"}
