Considering the indisputable value of the first Black & White, which perhaps lost a bit of bite after a few hours of play (for reasons that we will explain later) but undoubtedly presented numerous innovations and brilliant ideas, and considering that ~The Genius~ seems have fun experimenting in the first chapters of each saga to then correct the shot and make the sequels the true pillars of the series, we can say that the premises for a Black & White 2 masterpiece were more concrete than ever, and moreover this time it is not nothing has been done to ensnare potential buyers, as has happened in the past (albeit without premeditation). For those who believe that Black & White is a song by Michael Jackson, here is a brief overview: Black & White took the basic concepts of Populous (helping the development of a civilization by playing the role of a God) adding an intuitive interface Dungeon Keeper-style graphics and the extraordinary novelty of a giant creature, representative of the God on earth, with incredible artificial intelligence and command learning capabilities. For the past four years Lionhead has been trying to fix all of Black & White's problems AAA sought divine entity One of the focal points of B&W was represented by the possibility of having a neutral attitude, evil or benign, with very specific consequences on different aspects of the game. Despite stellar ratings in specialized magazines well justified by the objective technical and conceptual magnificence of the game (AI algorithms never seen before, indisputable originality, majestic graphics), in the long run the first Black & White remained indigestible to many players, who mostly didn't they managed to metabolize the repetitive mechanics, the almost always very slow pace of action, the impossibility of educating the creature exactly according to one's wishes and in general the high level of commitment necessary to fully enjoy the gaming experience. Over the past four years Lionhead has tried to correct all these problems, and the first step was to spice up and make the RTS aspect of Black & White 2 more central by hiring Ron Millar, producer of masterpieces such as Diablo, Warcraft 2 and Starcraft (this considered by many fans to be the best real-time strategy game in history). [C] Here are the four selectable beasts. Cute huh? By selecting one, the others will become sad [/C] The hard work of divinity In B&W2 we find ourselves having to help the Greek people, saving a small part of them from the Aztec troops and then working to make them prosper, in defiance of the Aztecs themselves and their Japanese allies who will try for the duration of the game to hinder our plans. The first thing you notice when starting a game is the evolution of the old interface, enriched by convenient menus and retractable indicators. Fans of the first B&W will take a few minutes to settle in, since the mouse keys are reversed compared to the prequel, but the basic concept of a simple and intuitive but at the same time complete graphic interface, which allows the player to use only the mouse without ever putting his hand to the keyboard, it's the same as it used to be. Once you have chosen a beast among the four available (five in the collector's edition where the tiger is also selectable, present only as an enemy in the normal version), i.e. monkey, lion, wolf or cow, you find yourself in a long tutorial that takes place in the first two worlds and recalls that of B&W1 in a ~leaner~ and faster version. The basic scheme of the game remains the one already known: as a deity you must contribute to the social, cultural and military development of the Greek civilization, but never having direct control of the population or the creature (as instead happens in the RTS with all the trappings of the case) and being able to operate only within the ~circle of influence~, a well-defined area that represents the area within which the population's faith in the divinity extends. One of the points that have been most revisited is that of the ~feedback~ that citizens and creatures give to the player to communicate their wishes The hard work of divinity The creature itself, its earthly representative, and a series of special powers that cannot be lacking in any self-respecting god come to the aid of the player: we speak of the possibility of moving gobjects, to speed up the alternation of day and night at will, or of a whole series of miracles that can be acquired as one progresses in the story. One of the points that have been most revisited is that of the ~feedback~ that citizens and creatures give to the player to communicate their wishes. First of all, in the city center we find three columns that lower and rise: two are to indicate the wishes of the citizens, complete with statues that symbolize the desire itself (a woman carrying a sheaf of wheat on her shoulder indicates a desire for food , and so on), the third instead indicates the alignment of the player; in the center of these three columns, moreover, a sort of hologram indicates which are the most pressing desires of our people in terms of buildings or constructions in general. Even without looking at the city center it is possible to know the most widespread desire among the population by observing the flashing icon placed in the lower left corner of the screen or simply by listening: in fact, citizens often speak to the deity expressing their wishes, such as ~ need food! or we need to procreate (very common desire even outside of B&W2, to be honest). [C] With balloon feedback, it's easy to learn. much more; simple to educate the beast A number of handy pop-up menus make life a lot easier [/C] Poor creature! The creature has become much easier to educate, perhaps even too much. If in B&W1 the educational experience often became frustrating, since one had to constantly keep an eye on the beast and intervene promptly by inciting or discouraging a particular action with caresses or blows, the player's life has now been greatly simplified: just before making a any action the creature will communicate its will to us thanks to the help of a balloon, within which a bar will also appear which from red becomes progressively green, so that from time to time we will know not only what the creature is about to do , but also how much he is usually inclined to do so, and it will be possible to intervene promptly with cuddles or blows to better shape his character. Each of the actions performed by the creature is then recorded in a special pop-up menu, which in addition to notifying us of the alignment and health of the big puppy will allow us to intervene at any time on its education, recalling the desired action and modifying its associated behaviour. Jousting at best you can make the beast a perfect ally, regardless of whether you want to follow the path of good or evil: you can, for example, teach the creature to spare its citizens and perhaps entertain them with amusing ballets, but at the same time feeding on the enemy troops, guarding the city walls and in your spare time helping with the work in the fields or in the mines. In addition to free will, which is the default mode in which it is influenced exclusively by the education imparted, our furry friend can be assigned a precise role between builder, collector, entertainer or soldier. However, making him remain confined to particular tasks for too long leads to the loss of free will, with the risk of finding himself a kind of automaton instead of an intelligent creature. To impress or conquer? Depending on the good or evil deity approach, the repercussions that will have on every aspect of the game are quite marked. By choosing to be a benign god, you will be able to leverage the majesty of the city to impress the enemy people and convince them with good manners to emigrate, joining the Greek cause. To do this you have to take care of the city from an aesthetic and urban point of view, building more and more impressive buildings and keeping the morale of the citizens high. The possible constructions include numerous typologies, such as villas, manors, palaces, armories, foundries, sawmills, nursery schools, taverns, rest homes, temples, altars, markets, ornamental objects, skyscrapers or even marvels, real architectural marvels with powers special. Each building can be cloned with simple drag & drop operations, and is more practical if connected to others via roads; these, in addition to being very easy to ~draw~ on the ground, do not require the use of any resources and therefore allow you to indulge yourself at will. New buildings and new divine powers, such as being able to use miracles or being able to make the creature use them, can be purchased through the appropriate menu by means of ~tributes~, which represent the currency of B&W2. Tributes increase with faith and the number of followers, and can be earned by completing the primary and secondary missions of each world. Stfollowing the path of goodness, even the creature and the surrounding environment change in appearance, resulting in more pleasant and less threatening: for example my wolf, which is 100% benign alignment, has become completely candid white and has a good-natured, moreover the vegetation is greener and more luxuriant than the norm. By choosing to pursue the path of war, the game certainly becomes more lively, and from a certain point of view even more fun. There are only two classes of warriors available, infantry and archers, and they can be recruited from among the adults who populate the city by simply clicking on the barracks and widening the selection circle until the desired amount of recruits is reached. Soldiers can be divided into several platoons, they increase in skill as they gain experience (RPG style) and their quantity is limited only by the number of villagers living in the settlement. Also present are siege weapons, such as catapults, which can be created after building a siege laboratory. Troop control is very simple and intuitive, and is not individualized for each individual soldier but acts directly on the entire battalion. The RTS element is very streamlined and feels deeper when planning defensively than when attacking, but the more difficult battles still require a good deal of strategy To impress or conquer? Each troop has a flag by which soldiers can be ordered to move, defend a particular position, climb the city walls to control the territory from above, attack an objective or occupy a city. The RTS element is therefore very simplified, and seems deeper in the defensive planning phase than during attacks, but the more difficult battles still require a good dose of strategy and divine aid: in addition to being able to interact with the environment using boulders , fiery objects or other fanciful little things, it will in fact be vital to resort to attack miracles to facilitate the task for your soldiers, or to preserve their health with healing or protection spells. In the toughest battles the creature plays a central role, and especially if well trained in the role of soldier it becomes lethal for the opposing militias. Unlike what was seen in B&W1, the fight between two creatures is now managed automatically by the artificial intelligence, relieving the player from the frustrating task of making the creature perform the moves, which, although fun to see, were really frustrating to perform due to a bad management of the camera that constantly moved the reference points. The balance between good and evil is handled well, and whichever attitude you choose to adopt, the game has something different to offer. However, one impression I got from the gold version in our possession is that conquering the opponents with the majesty of the cities is a bit too easy, so much so that I often reached the main objective (conquering the land) before most of the secondary goals; however, Lionhead ensures that the difficulty of the version you will find in stores has significantly increased, and in any case the more you advance in the game, the more the difficulty grows. The diversity of game experiences that are created by behaving as a perfect villain or as a good Samaritan certainly gives a certain re-playability value, also given the possibility of changing creatures (remember that each beast has its own basic character and set of custom animations). For reasons of time, two worlds were excluded from the final version (originally there were a total of ten), and unfortunately longevity suffers, especially if you aim straight at the main objectives without taking things calmly and completing all the side missions. In this way, however, much of the taste of a game is lost which in some way must be ~lived~ by dedicating oneself to the education of the creature, to urban planning, to the cultural expansion of civilization, and furthermore it is not possible to scrape together enough tributes to buy all available buildings and miracles. Few justifications instead for the total lack of any multiplayer mode, a defect that will perhaps be remedied in some future expansion. Another small problem is represented by the pointer, not always fluid in its movements and which occasionally freezes off the screen, coming to its senses only after a few seconds, but even in this case the Lionheads reassure users: everything will be solved with the first patch, which will be released practically simultaneously with the game.
