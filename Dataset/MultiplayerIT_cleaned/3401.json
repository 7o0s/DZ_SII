Whether you were more Capcomian or part of the Neo Geo elite, one thing is indisputable: The King of Fighters is a historical pillar of the fighting game genre, which in certain episodes has reached heights unattainable by any other similar production. You may prefer the combat system offered by other series or other publishers specialized in the same area, but the charisma of the SNK brand, with its huge and stellar cast, cannot leave even the worst detractors of the 100 Mega Shock indifferent. For this reason it must be admitted that it is with many prejudices that we approached The King of Fighters: All Star, a mobile title from Netmarble which, at first glance, takes the historical series of SNK and demolishes it, without too many words. The wonderful 2D bitmap sprites are rigorously transformed into three-dimensional models, well done but a little anonymous compared to the original counterparts; the technical and deep combat system becomes a button masher in which you have to touch an icon to execute a move, which could be enough to enrage any gamer who in the 90s lived being able to make crescents and specials as a remarkable personal achievement . However, having made the due initial outburst, distancing oneself from personal experience and looking at the game from a new perspective, The King of Fighters: All Star takes on a much less aberrant aspect. On the contrary, it is configured as a good tribute, within the limits of a mobile experience with easy monetization, to a historical title which, if nothing else, continues to echo even between smartphones and tablets. On the other hand, the success of a year now in Japan and subsequently in South Korea demonstrates how the operation of transforming King of Fighters into a mobile RPG is largely successful. Ready-to-wear fighting game We are faced with a reinterpretation of the fighting game in a mobile sense, which goes far beyond its being reduced to a portable game, given that it is a substantial change in the classic structure of the series. First of all, in its action phases The King of Fighters: All Star is almost a scrolling beat 'em up, which is different from the classic mechanics. Battles in arenas alternate with one-on-one matches, but the pace of play and the dynamics of the fight are very different from the classic fighting game. The missions that we undertake show the protagonist from a lateral perspective, with the possibility of moving even in depth in the scenarios and the aim of the game is essentially to eliminate all the opponents that appear on the screen, using the moves with the right timing in order to organize the better the attacks by calculating the various cooldowns of the special techniques. Furthermore, the general structure is the one that has come to be configured as typical of the mobile RPG, with quests to complete and the possibility of collecting a large number of characters that push towards the inevitable gacha mechanics. The starting material is a notable strength for a game so composed: considering the large number of SNK characters already present in the King of Fighters series and the charisma of these, the transformation into RPG based on the collection of fighters certainly started from a advantage basis. To the collection of characters is then added that of the cards corresponding to the special moves, capable of greatly expanding the techniques and attack possibilities of the fighters. There is a rather bland story behind it which is essentially an excuse to get involved: it is a question of choosing an initial character and carrying out various quests set within the various chapters of KoF, starting from the 94 tournament to get to those more recent, obviously colliding with the various characters belonging to the different casts and historical villains, but not only. To further increase longevity, Netmarble has seen fit to expand the audience of fighters to conquer, adding new original characters and even a little cross-over with Samurai Shodown and also Tekken. It must be said that the character design, although rather set on the usual fan service that leads to filling the cast of more or less provocative female characters, recalls the classic illustrations by Shinkiro, historical character designer of thea series, which is undoubtedly a good thing in a game so focused on the characters. The 3D reinterpretations make a good impression on mobile devices but it is above all the animations that convince in a particular way, also considering the type of product we are dealing with. Summons, or the gacha system, obviously become a central element of the game and it is easy to understand how monetization frequently comes into play for the most assiduous collectors, given that the chances of obtaining rare characters increase with the investment of real money. However, it must be said that even the standard game as free-to-play allows you to easily build a remarkable lineup of protagonists to choose from, each characterized by its own historical fighting style and some of the original special moves. The game modes also allow for PvP and cooperative multiplayer, as well as further variations on the theme that do not deviate too much from the standard gameplay.", "date": "2019-10-30", "grade": "7.3"}
