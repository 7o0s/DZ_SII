The protagonist of Belpaese: Homecoming is an incompetent scoundrel, perfect for politics He is a handsome young man, but he has no desire to work and prefers to devote himself to women and drinks, conquering the scene with his two-tone glasses that recall Doctor Jacoby in Twin Peaks and the many peasants who populate the streets. of our cities. Of course, he considers ideas that are as bizarre as they are easy and in bad taste brilliant, such as trying to sell pens with little women on them that can lengthen and shorten the skirt. Who better than him could enter the Italian political arena? However, his immediate problem is another: forced to return home to southern Italy, he must be able to tell his mother, a typical local woman, all food, housework and Padre Pio, that he has not finished his studies ... or he has to try to make her believe he's made it, buying himself a degree. The adventure of the beautiful tome begins in the square of his village, where the half-necked poster of a politician stands out, dangerously resembling Donald Trump, behind which three old men sit all day chatting about who knows what. In the middle of the square is a huge-headed street artist holding a mandolin, immediately behind him is the entrance to the local branch of a populist party, to which the politician in the above poster belongs, while in a more secluded corner there is an Italian-American tourist looking for Italian art to bring home. Wandering around the rest of the country, whose graphic details are barely outlined, but clearly recognizable in their Italian style from the shapes and colors, he will also meet an old woman who spends her days spitting, a German tourist who loves sunbathing naked on the local beach , an English chef who can't wait to revolutionize spaghetti and another wide selection of characters who seem to come out of an Italian comedy, luckily a good one. The art of getting by Belpaese: Homecoming is a classic point-and-click adventure, the perfect genre to playfully stage our art of getting by, between objects to find and ingenious puzzles to solve to entangle the various characters. This is the first episode of a series, which in any case can be played in perfect autonomy, because it closes in a more than satisfactory way. Structurally it is divided into two parts: in the first we will have to try to return home, while in the second we will have to go into politics (in a certain sense). Sleep makes time pass In the gameplay, however, the division is not so clear-cut, if not for some macro objectives to be achieved, to which all the others act as a corollary. The game system is very reminiscent of the classics of the genre: clicking on an object examines it or collects it. By opening the inventory it is possible to review the owned objects (note that each slot is decorated with a white plate) and select them to use them on other objects, from the inventory or from the scenario. Obviously by clicking on the non-player characters it is possible to talk to them, so as to obtain information on how to continue the adventure or learn more about them. In general, the puzzles are not very easy to solve, also due to the fact that some must be tackled during the day and others at night, with time passing when we make the protagonist fall asleep on a deck chair facing the sea. It is evident that the Fazz Brothers, the developers, have taken the classics of the genre as a reference. As a difficulty we are not on the side of the first Sierra adventures, nor of those modern narratives that resolve themselves. In some circumstances it is not very easy to understand the logic of the puzzles, also because the suggestions that are given encourage us to think more than to give us the real solution (it is not a defect, mind you). Just to give an example, we know that the aforementioned Italian-American tourist is looking for Italian art, but we are not told about what specifically. The setting also has the typical colors of the Italian villages At a certain point, however, we find ourselves in a place with objects arranged in such a way as to look like a decadent contemporary work of art (let's say so). Just connect the dots, to understand how to continue. Overall, to complete Belpaese: Homecoming it takes about four hours which, given the affordable price, are more than fine. However, we can move a few notes to the game. For example the resolution of alsome puzzles force you to go back and forth several times to make time pass, while in other cases it seems to be blocked despite having understood perfectly what to do (perhaps you still have to talk to a certain character, or you haven't done everything in the right order Right). In the long run, the lack of a few more scenarios is also felt, despite the parsimony being more than understandable, given the production level.", "date": "2017-10-29", "grade": "8.0"}
