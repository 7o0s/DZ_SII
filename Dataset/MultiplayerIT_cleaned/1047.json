In the review of Santorini: Pocket Game we talk instead of a production designed for this purpose: a casual simulation game in which, against the background of the splendid Greek island, we will have the task of managing tourist facilities and aiming for success. The very pleasant low poly graphic style of the new title developed by Nanoo Company, the authoring team of Merge Dungeon, pleasantly welcomes us into the game while a guitar plays in the background and we are shown the simple Farmville-style management mechanics that govern the experience. Ready to go? Gameplay Santorini: Pocket Game, the traditional coins to collect. There is undoubtedly a purely visual component in Santorini: Pocket Game, the one that pushes us to admire the glimpses of the island, the places we have unlocked up to that moment and of course our terraced creations: gatherings made up of hotels, accommodation, bars, restaurants and so on. Combinations that can be more or less successful depending on how they are built or how much they are upgraded. The progression system leads us to advance rapidly within the map, marking the ability to access locations with increasing experience level which previously were closed to us and which in turn offer us new, evocative landscapes. What better way to remember them than the simple and immediate Photo Mode that can be activated with a single touch? Santorini: Pocket Game, some of the buildings unlockable with coins. The interest in the growth of our virtual impresario therefore goes hand in hand with the beauty of the places that we will be able to discover, in the context of a reproduction that does not intend to faithfully represent the characteristics of Santorini but to capture its spirit and atmospheres. Too bad that the gameplay itself is immediately rather limited. In the end, the situations are the same that you will certainly have faced over and over again: buildings to build and improve, areas to unlock, money and resources to collect with a series of taps on the screen, but above all waiting times that become progressively longer and obviously microtransactions and advertising trailers to shorten them. Structure and technique As already mentioned, the graphics of Santorini: Pocket Game can count on a pleasant, colorful, clean and essential style, in a sort of diorama that flows smoothly on the screen as we move from one structure to another, compulsively collecting the coins produced with the spend some time. It is clear that the interface plays a fundamental role, well implemented and readable in any situation. In short, the atmosphere is all there and also the numbers to support the game, with over two hundred buildings available and various different landscapes the visual variety of experience. Too bad for the freemium structure and its many limitations, which give life to the traditional dead times between one construction and another, while the musical theme continues to repeat itself.", "date": "2021-05-14", "grade": "6.0"}
