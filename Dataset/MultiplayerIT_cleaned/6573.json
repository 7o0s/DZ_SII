According to the authors of Radiation Island, on a mysterious and apparently uninhabited island. Referring to the Philadelphia Experiment, an event that would have occurred in 1943 and which serves as the basis for many conspiracy theories, the game created by Atypical Games (yes, those of the Sky Gamblers series) tries to offer the traditional experience on iOS devices survival, but with some elements of variation. What immediately catches the eye is the technical realization, with a decidedly vast and detailed scenario, to be explored freely, equipped with a day / night cycle and a good number of effects that enhance the surfaces. The rendering of the animations is less brilliant, both as regards the animals and the zombies (yes, there are also zombies), and it is a pity because this aspect penalizes the sector as a whole, hand in hand with an essential sound and never incisive. Beyond the graphics, Radiation Island imposes a certain type of progression and at first it is undoubtedly angular, also due to touch controls that are not always precise, as well as a combat system that just can't communicate the impacts decently, resulting ethereal and slippery regardless of the weapon used. Everything else is crafting and exploration, aspects which fortunately work very well and raise the level of experience. Aside from the initial slowness and some rough edges, Radiation Island offers a valuable survival experience It starts from Minecraft and ends up To master the art of crafting tools and items, you have to go around collecting various resources, then use a simple interface to create whatever you need from time to time. A rudimentary ax to defend ourselves from the first pitfalls, or something more sophisticated, to then arrive at the lethal mix of bow and arrows for eliminations from a distance, as well as real firearms; but also crates and campfires, the latter indispensable for overcoming the night and its rigid temperatures. Being a survival game, Radiation Island confronts us with these and other tasks, therefore not only with a level of health to keep an eye on, but also with the hunger that bites and forces us to often and willingly draw from the inventory to put something in your teeth. We don't know if the approach chosen by Atypical Games is the ~right~ one for a mobile game, given that we are talking about a tough and sometimes boring initial phase, which could push many to abandon the experience before going live, when the plot finally begins to unravel and something more eventful happens. At this juncture there is also a worsening of the challenge, with various pitfalls threatening us and the loss of the last objects collected in the event of a game over. In short, it cannot be said that Radiation Island lacks courage and substance (moreover, the game can be purchased for just 2.99 euros and does not include any in-app purchase or element of further monetization), given that even the completion of the adventure is rewarded with unlocking a new mode. It remains to be understood, amid more or less marked enthusiasm for the specific genre, who will have the determination to go all the way.", "date": "2015-02-12", "grade": "8.0"}
