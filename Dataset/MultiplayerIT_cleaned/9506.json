The story is simple and on the other hand not too important within the game structure: a small but well-matched group of insects must get by day by day keeping their base intact and collecting food where possible, to store it inside of the ~den~ and defend it as much as possible from the attacks of the enemies. The protagonists of the story are an ant, a beetle and a spider, each with its own physical characteristics and fighting styles, three characters who, despite coming from different contexts, even from clans at war with each other, find themselves having to fight side by side against overwhelming enemy forces. The concept is rather particular, and presents itself as a ~blended video game~, a hybrid between shooter, RPG and strategic tower defense playable in ~adventure~ mode, or the main option, or ~coliseum~ in which we essentially find ourselves eliminating the enemies within limited play areas and without the base. Taking into consideration the adventure, the fundamental purpose is the protection of one's base and one's food supply, which however must also be progressively increased by exploring the various game settings (appropriately represented in scale with respect to the size of the insects). The game action is represented with a top view, while the protagonists (usable one at a time but interchangeable at any time) move through a control system which, although based on a controller emulation, behaves decidedly well through ~virtual analog sticks~ placed at the lower and opposite corners of the screen, one dedicated to the movement of the character, the other to direct the attacks in 360 degrees. That dirty trio The three characters have different and complementary characteristics: the ant is the classic intermediate fighter, endowed with good energy and speed and the ability for long-range attacks through machine guns and various firearms (yes, because here the insects shoot), the beetle it is large and armored, capable of making devastating melee physical attacks but very slow while the spider has good speed and lethal melee attacks but with poor defensive and stamina capabilities. The ~role~ element in all of this is given by the possibility of accumulating experience points and increasing the statistics of each fighter, improving their performance. Similarly, it is possible to purchase defensive elements for your base, such as turrets and protection systems, which can also be purchased and progressively improved with the use of financial resources (obviously even insects think in dollars). The commitment is therefore to prevent the base from falling under enemy blows and at the same time explore the environments in search of food and special objects, obviously trying to keep the three insects alive. From time to time the game presents us with some side quests which, if completed, grant experience points and extra money but can also incur penalties if disregarded. Although the tasks are therefore simple to understand and the things to manage are not excessively numerous, the pace of the game continuously stimulates the player to make decisions and to keep the base, the surrounding environment and the state of the characters under control, with enemies of various typology that require a careful mix of forces and different abilities of the three heroic insects in an excellently balanced mix of combat skills and resource management. The technical sector is remarkable: the graphics above all, while not shining for a particularly charismatic characterization, stage rich and well-detailed settings, as well as an impressive number of enemies and stray shots on the screen in some cases and an enhanced dynamic lighting system from the day/night cycle.
