{"name": "Unto the End", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/unto-the-end-recensione.html", "text": "As we will see in the course of the review, Unto the End is a minimalist work, both in what it tells and in the forms of representation. Wanting to make a comparison, one thinks of an Another World developed following the soulslike philosophy, but we confess that it is difficult to insert the 2 Ton Studios game within a specific genre, given that it also offers survival and other adventure elements. Sure, everything is so bare-bones that it's almost a sin to make cross-references, they would be so useless and misleading the concept of the game. But let's go in order. history The characters of Unto the End have no name and the story they live is actually very simple to tell. A man goes hunting after saying goodbye to his wife and son, but falls into an underground cave from which it is impossible to retrace his steps. His goal throughout the adventure will therefore be to return home overcoming the dangers that will arise before him, whether they are natural traps or warriors of some tribes fighting each other, who do not welcome his presence in their territories . The hunter only has a sword and a knife, but by searching around he can collect some raw materials with which to build a torch, prepare medicine, or improve his equipment. As we have mentioned, the survival part is very minimal, in the sense that in all there are four raw materials to find, the improvements to the equipment are fixed and can be counted on the fingers of one hand and the medicine is only one. The only constraint is that most of the crafting operations are carried out by lighting bonfires (in fixed areas), where you can also heal wounds and train to fight in an interactive flashback. Combat system The combat system is just as simple. The hunter can parry up, down, counter-attack and roll to evade blows. Obviously he can also attack, with a slash or with a two-handed strike (which forces him to put down the torch). If desired, he can also throw his knife to hurt and stun opponents, but that's really all. Despite the few moves available, the clashes are quite technical, as well as really difficult. Unfortunately our hero is not very agile and every time you do something you have to take into account how the animation and collision system works if you don't want to find yourself caught. For example, throwing a knife at an enemy too close means immediately suffering a blow, while dodging by ending up on the opponent or a wall involves the loss of the sword, which must then be retrieved while trying not to get killed. Furthermore, the parry system is effective, but the speed of some enemies, as well as unfortunately their excessive reactivity, makes it really difficult to apply it perfectly. The substance is that you find yourself dying repeatedly, with some fights requiring very precise execution of the moves and others in which one is led to think that the CPU is cheating so much is it able to anticipate our techniques and correct its own in the running often unnaturally. Adventure Exploration is much simpler which, despite the difficulties, is always affordable and does not stress the player by asking him to overcome impossible situations. Some jumps are more complicated than others, some puzzles take a few more seconds to decipher, but nothing prohibitive. To get home, our hunter has to jump rocks and crevasses, climb using the walls to perform a kind of double jump, dodge traps, pull levers, find keys (two in total in the whole game) and little else. More complicated, but optional, is what we can define as the macro puzzle of the entire adventure, i.e. a series of actions that accompany the hunter from the start of the game and which yield him six objects, some useful, some not. The problem, in this case, is that the unwary or unlucky player can completely miss the existence of this kind of subplot, thus running into the negative ending. Unto the End does not give any explanations to the player, who must learn to decipher the various elements useful for his mission completely on his own. At one point the hero finds himself at a crossroads, after a fall, and can go right or left without knowing what is on either side. In the first game we chose to follow one of the two paths, finding ourselves unable to go back due to an insurmountable obstacle. Not bad, we thought: evidently there was nothing important on the other side. There was actually one of the items needed to unlock the positive ending. fortonce you know what to do Unto the End doesn't last very long (just over an hour, however the first time you finish it in about three hours) and therefore we replayed it without much effort to unlock the unlockable. Graphics Where 2 Ton Studios' game stands out is in the graphics. More than anything in style, perfectly in line with the gameplay. So the game environments are represented with very few objects, however composed with such care as to create a truly intriguing and melancholic atmosphere. The visual style is really dry both in the scenarios, with very few sources of lighting in the interiors and a predominance of snow in the exteriors, and in the characters, whether they are friends or enemies, with the latter having different traits depending on the tribe or species which they belong. Needless to say, the soundtrack follows the same compositional philosophy, never overlapping the action, giving the whole adventure a sense of profound compactness, beyond any possible baroque style.", "date": "2020-12-14", "grade": "8.0"}
