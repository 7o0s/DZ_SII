{"name": "Sparatutto d'annata", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/71426-skysmash-1918-sparatutto-dannata.html", "text": "Avoiding a hail of bullets is a subtle art that older gamers know well: fifteen or twenty years ago arcades and bars were full of vertical (or horizontal) scrolling shooters, and it is known that in this particular genre of games it is essential to extricate oneself in the midst of enemy fire, even more than sinking one's shots. SkySmash 1918 for iPhone captures perfectly understand the meaning of these sentences and puts us in control of a US fighter plane during the last stages of the First World War. Despite the references to a precise historical scenario (see also the names of the nine stages available), it is clear that everything that happens on the screen has very little bearing on reality. Our plane moves agile along the entire playing area and beyond (it is possible to move, albeit slightly, even beyond the side borders of the screen), while an entire army made up of air and ground troops unloads tons of lead. Tons, more likely. Our cannon fires bursts automatically and can be upgraded by collecting the bonuses left by destroyed enemies, with the result that the range of fire becomes wider and allows us to destroy a greater number of vehicles without too many movements. There are no alternative weapons other than the smart bomb, which is activated by double-tapping the screen and sweeps away anything buzzing around it... or almost. Spectacular battles The thing that immediately strikes you about SkySmash 1918 is undoubtedly its technical realization, understood in this case both in terms of graphics and sound. The first is extraordinarily defined and detailed (it is no coincidence that the game seems to be a bit difficult to run on iPhone 3Gs), showing some small uncertainty in the frame rate but offering a truly enjoyable show at all times. All the vehicles that we are facing are well designed, characterized by an excellent use of colors, and move within well-crafted scenarios, rich in elements and quite different from each other. The missions involve the destroying a certain number of enemies rather than simply exploring the level, and when you reach the desired percentage it's time to face a boss as big as it is bad. These are always huge and improbable vehicles, equipped with cannons that shoot in every direction and that really make life difficult for us. A lot of action is accompanied by an amazing sound both in terms of music and effects, among the best we have heard so far in the mobile sector in terms of quantity and quality. One finger on the stick The second thing that strikes you is the control system, very special and with great potential. Instead of resorting to the usual virtual pad, in fact, SkySmash 1918 allows us to control the plane by moving a single finger on the screen. This can work in an absolute or relative way: in the first case, the control of the plane is direct and without half measures, but often we end up making unwanted movements, for example when we lift our finger from the screen for some reason; in the second case, however, the plane follows our movements faithfully but without paying too much attention to the portion of the screen we are touching. After doing various tests, we found ourselves much better with the relative control system. The difficulty is far from low and can certainly be a stumbling block for casual gamers. Avoiding some attacks is very difficult and the starting conditions, with the non-upgraded cannon, are far from favourable. In short, expect to lose a large number of games before finding the right feeling with the game. Internships become available immediately once completed, so at least there won't be the frustration of having to start all over again...
