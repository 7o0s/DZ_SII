Now is the time to get serious. We've spent the last month on Pandaria, the island added to the world of World of Warcraft with the recent expansion. Returning to play Blizzard's MMORPG after a season off was not easy, it must be admitted: we had to get used to the new mechanics introduced by the 5.0 update and readjust to a decidedly different style of play from that of the last titles we've tried, Guild Wars 2 above all. Still, there's always something magical about the universe created by Blizzard, a charm that's hard to resist even when you've spent so many years (a full seven, at this point) in the company of Dwarves, Trolls, Orcs and so on. . After the disappointing management of Cataclysm, our fear was to find ourselves dealing with a superficial expansion. In this sense, fortunately, Blizzard has once again amazed us. Pandas in the fog For years, Pandaria was only mentioned. We knew it existed, out there somewhere, hidden in the fog of the ideas of Chris Metzen et al. Finally being able to reach and explore it was a more surprising experience than expected. From this point of view, the work done in the creation of this new setting is absolutely titanic. Mind you, that of World of Warcraft is a boundless universe and one could easily have drawn on the mythology left open: the Emerald Dream, the Burning Legion or the much abused Ancient Gods. Blizzard instead has decided to materialize the myths and legends of a race born almost as a joke at the time of Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne. The notorious conflict between the Horde and the Alliance that leads us to Pandaria is somewhat set aside at the beginning of this expansion, to make room for the pandaren, their world, their culture and their enemies and allies. Pandaria oozes history and mythology. We expected it to be a little more colorful perhaps, but darker areas like the Wastelands or the Tong Long Steppes contrast with picturesque areas like the Valley of the Four Winds or the dazzling Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Overall, the sheer size and geographic complexity of Pandaria is unprecedented in the World of Warcraft universe. The level of detail achieved is incredible, thanks above all to the new proprietary tools that have allowed Blizzard to create excellent high-resolution textures. As usual, the excellent art direction hides the age of the engine, which in the case of Mists of Pandaria seems almost rejuvenated. The quest loops are mostly designed to get us to know and love the pandaren, and it's really impossible not to fall in love with these good-natured cooking and martial arts experts. The quotations are wasted, as per Blizzard tradition, between the mythical terracotta armies of the Mogu and the Shandaren clan who protect the Serpentine Wall by imitating the Night's Guardians of the Song of Ice and Fire. Every race that lives on Pandaria, from the goofy Hozen to the creepy Klaxxi, is explained in detail as we get drawn into their conflicts and problems. Azeroth's history is virtually ignored; this is a whole new world, to be known in every nuance. There is no shortage of forced ret-cons, especially as regards the bond that unites Zandalari Trolls, Titans and Mogu, but the intricate relationship between the Sha, physical manifestations of negative feelings, and the peaceful pandaren certainly does not make us regret other matters that have remained temporarily in suspended; it is indeed a breath of fresh air that offers a new perspective and a totally new adventure, raising the stakes for when the war finally arrives on the shores of Pandaria. The road to 90 Mists of Pandaria does not deviate in the slightest from the traditional ~ad hub~ structure of the previous expansions, but still adopts a slightly different system, also reflected in the Companies relating to the completion of each area. The player is still led by the hand from one hub to another, but is often in the position of deciding in what order to tackle the multiple hubs they have access to. The completion of the area is in fact indicated by the resolution of the various narrative cycles, rather than by the resolution of an arid number of missions. The rewards are always generous and the game now offers one or more objects based on the active specialization at the time of completing the mission: this therefore allows you to build hybrid or specific equipment and improve them as zones and levels pass. There is therefore the sensation of a more organic growth, counterbalanced however by a sense of urgency entirely based on reachingjoining the last level rather than some key moments in the growth process itself. This occurs precisely because the classes learn a single spell at level 87, then unlocking only the last choice of Talents at level 90, together with the ability to mount flying mounts even in Pandaria. In parallel, the variety of missions can sometimes leave you dumbfounded. As always, there are those characterized by the typical Blizzard humor that require the performance of very particular tasks (exterminate a tribe of enemies at the command of a gigantic yeti, for one thing, or save a young pandaren kidnapped by the ~fearsome~ Leprorats) and which often almost entirely modify the interface like a mini-game, but are often interspersed from the traditional missions based on the systematic killing of enemies or collection of objects. In general, the mission cycles are a narrative crescendo and become increasingly complex, resulting in real mini-bosses to be fought by implementing particular strategies, exciting and very entertaining missions but a little too dilated over time. This phase of growth, however, is not particularly tedious, thanks to the variety of objectives, but also to the possibility of alternating missions with other secondary activities such as Expeditions, Battlefields and more with a couple of clicks, but it must be admitted that the leveling process, despite Blizzard's brilliant ideas to disguise it, is also beginning to feel the weight of the years a bit. Pokmon and Farmville Criticized and controversial to no end, the two innovations presented by Blizzard in the past months have aroused many perplexities in us too, but a few minutes were enough to understand their potential. All things considered, Pet Battles and Personal Garden are two of the best additions to the expansion. The mascots (Italian translation of companion pets) have always been one of the most popular aspects of the game, especially among collectors: even an economy revolves around them, both real and virtual. The decision to transform them into a real game within a game may seem risky, yet it turns out to be successful and extraordinarily well-finished. Blizzard has not only retouched all the existing pets, but has created over a hundred completely new ones, mostly scattered around the world, among the local fauna. It's as close to the coveted ~online~ Pokmon that fans of the Nintendo franchise have wanted for a lifetime. The feeling, then, is just that: you look for the little creatures around the map, they face each other, with a little skill and luck they are captured, then they are trained by making them fight against other mascots, wild or other players. The most common pets can be caged and given away, traded or sold; each being has an individual level and up to six special attacks that can be learned and selected for up to three per combat. At that point, the Pet Battles border on plagiarism of the Nintendo series: the abilities of many pets are the same as those of Pikachu and associates, and even the combat system is completely similar. Simple, intuitive and ~addictive~, this feature has incredible potential that Blizzard would do well to keep an eye on. The personal garden in the village of Mezzocolle, in the Valley of the Four Winds, obviously mimics Farmville, the infamous browser-game. By completing certain missions and increasing your reputation with the Farmers faction and (new!) its members individually, you will also increase the space in which you can let your green thumb run wild, planting seeds, trees and more. Later, we will be able to manage this space with various tools that will help us cultivate even better materials, useful for cooking the most effective dishes in the game and receiving small rewards and bonuses. The maintenance of our garden is not mandatory and takes just a few minutes a day, but it's a very nice mini-game that helps immerse us in the rural atmosphere of Pandaria. Day after day Upon reaching max level, 90, the player is suddenly faced with a wall, in terms of non-instanced PvE. Of course, you can devote yourself to any activity that crosses your mind, from the aforementioned Battles between mascots to the completion of the various Companies; you can continue to explore Pandaria to complete the areas perhaps left open in the race for the cap, but in any case there is no escaping the matter of daily missions. We are perplexed by the emphasis placed on this aspect of the game, introduced by Blizzard at the time of The Burning Crusade and increasingly elaborated over the years. In Mists of Pandaria it perhaps reaches the point of massima expression because the endgame of the game is closely linked to the daily missions. Completing the daily missions is essential to increase the level of reputation with the numerous factions of Pandaria, this time without an Insignia that allows you to increase the relative reputation by repeating the instances: the only way, precisely, is to complete the daily missions proposed in industrial quantities. Ironically, some factions are unlocked by reaching a certain level of reputation with still other factions (this is the case with the Shandaren and the Honorable Celestials, for example) and consequently it is necessary to dedicate some of our time to these missions every day, if you wish to unlock the items, recipes and mounts exclusive to the various factions. Even to equip yourself in the best way, it is important to take care of your reputation: the objects that can be purchased with Valor points, epic or purple in short, today require a certain level of reputation with this or that faction. Although no daily mission is mandatory, it is clear that to equip yourself and face the most difficult challenges it is necessary to heal the various reputations, an activity that soon becomes quite monotonous, despite the various cycles of missions being selected randomly every day to maintain a minimum of variety . In short, to become the best you have to work hard: it's right and you certainly never sit idly by; there's always something to do when you go online, but in the context of an overriding activity like reputation building we would have liked an alternative to what, right now, seems to all intents and purposes a form of time -sink. Instance after instance Instances have always been the flagship of World of Warcraft, and the entire PvE endgame revolves around them again this time. In Mists of Pandaria, Blizzard has surpassed itself by conceiving some of the most interesting bosses ever, but at the same time sacrificing the complexity of the maps in favor of a very fast and painless gaming experience. We are a little sorry to see that most of the new instances basically take the form of a precise and guided path, abandoning the freedom granted by old and glorious instances such as Blackrock Dungeons or Maraudon, but it is also true that the speed with which they start, explore and conclude is almost liberating, when compared to certain instances of the past that took even an hour or more to complete. This is especially true in the case of Scenarios, new mini-instances specially designed for three players short on time and looking for some money or other resources. This is clearly yet another step towards casual-players, as also demonstrated by the surgical revamp of the Scarlet Monastery and Scholomance, or the level of general difficulty decidedly calibrated downwards. We'll be blunt: the new instances in heroic mode are a joke. No particular preparation is required, nor the ~farming~ of normal instances to scrape together the right equipment. Once you reach 90, you can practically throw yourself headlong into heroic instances without the slightest problem, wearing what you received by completing the missions of the last explored area. The bosses, on the other hand, while not particularly difficult, require a minimum of practice and coordination: structured like real miniature raid-bosses, they all require the use of specific strategies. For example, during the fight with Taran Zhu, in the Shandaren Monastery, it will be necessary to pray, by clicking on a special icon, to unload one's anger and remove any penalties. Or, during the Siege of Niuzao Temple, General Pa'valak's bombs must be returned to the sender to neutralize his shield. The new raid-bosses are even more original, if possible, although they still remain extremely accessible even to novices through the ~raid finder~ tool, which returns with great fanfare after being implemented only at the conclusion of the previous expansion, with a series of improvements designed to make the experience as enjoyable as possible. Uncivilized players permitting, of course. In short, it seems that the real difficulty lies in the raids organized by ten and twenty-five players and in the brand new Challenge mode, which allows you to face the instances of five players with normalized equipment. By completing them within a certain time limit, you receive excellent rewards: needless to say, an extreme knowledge of your class, map and strategies is required to successfully tackle this mission. At this point, the Mists of Pandaria endgame is well defined, at least in ter", "date": "2012-10-24", "grade": "9.1"}
