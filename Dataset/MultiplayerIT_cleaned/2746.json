{"name": "Planet Zoo: Tropical Pack", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/planet-zoo-tropical-pack-recensione.html", "text": "Frontier Developments' game expansions are often quite predictable in the type and amount of content. Once a theme has been chosen, the English software works on it following a standard and well-tested formula, slightly different depending on the title, which makes you feel like you haven't wasted your money but which at the same time lengthens the experience just enough to prepare for the next expansion. In their case, therefore, the important thing is not so much to understand what a new DLC has to offer, but only whether or not the additions fall within our tastes. As we will see in the course of the review, Planet Zoo: Tropical Pack does not change an iota from this point of view. The new animals The style chosen for the new objects is that of Bali Once Planet Zoo has been started with the Tropical Pack expansion installed, we will have two possibilities to exploit it: in free construction, or in the scenario added to the career mode. The pack adds five new species taken from the tropical forests of three continents: Africa, Southeast Asia and South America, all recreated with the usual great care. So now our zoos can be enriched by the fossa, the lar gibbon, the red hedgehog, the water monitor lizard and the variegated sloth, the latter a show animal. Don't expect big news in terms of game systems, because there aren't any. The goal for each animal always remains the same: to rebuild its habitat, thanks to about two hundred new dedicated objects, and to watch it live its life in a protected environment, perhaps making it reproduce, for our joy and for the patrons of the zoo. Do you want to make the gibbon happy? Give him trees to climb and you'll hear him scream with joy (literally). Would you like to know that your red cherry tree would not want to live anywhere else on the planet? Fill his habitat with mud so he can roll around as he pleases. Do you want to find out what life is like in a video game editorial office early in the morning? Look at the evolutions of the variegated sloth. Of course feed everyone if you don't want them to die, including the editors. As you will have also understood from the numbers, which are identical to those of the previous expansions, there is nothing revolutionary in the Tropical Pack. After all, this is normal. Mission Bali The new animals in the Tropical Pack are crafted with the same great care as always As for the new scenic objects, Frontier Developments has chosen to draw mainly from architecture and elements typical of Southeast Asia, probably because they are more characterizing and because it had already introduced African and South American elements in previous expansions. In particular he looked to the style of Bali, both for the structures and for the vegetation. So expect to build lush green habitats with wooden constructions and scenery that looks like it's taken from ancient temples found in the forest, even when they're just rest stops for thirsty tourists. Overall, excellent areas can be created, very beautiful to look at, which are fully exploited by the new animals, in particular by the gibbons, the most relevant of the group, due to their tendency to interact with multiple objects in the scenario. We talked about Bali not by chance, given that the new scenario of the campaign is set right on the Indonesian island. Our goal will be the same as always: fix a zoo that is in danger of falling apart. In this case the fault lies with this Tiffany, a rich and incompetent heiress who has made all possible mistakes in the management of the zoo given to her by her father. It will be up to us to fix the situation and make her make a lot of money, as well as find out what a character from her past wants (without giving advances, don't expect who knows what intrigues). The scenario is the best way to immediately enjoy the new contents of the expansion, discovering them practically all in one go. Fortunately, Frontier has abandoned the formula that wanted the new expansions to provide individual maps for time trials, and has embraced again the broader career enrichment formula, as it already did with the Twilight Pack. In this way, the addition of new contents, which take on a different weight in the whole experience and don't seem thrown there just to give new life to the editor. Be that as it may, the challenge proposed is the same as always, without particular jolts, so much so that the things to do are more or less those that anyone who has played Planet Zoo since the launch (dates back to 2019) will immediately recognize. Frankly it was hard to expect anything different, but there's little to complain about. Ultimately the speech is always the same: withconsidering that they are of the highest quality, are you interested in the added animals? Whatever the answer, you know what to do.", "date": "2023-04-03", "grade": null}
