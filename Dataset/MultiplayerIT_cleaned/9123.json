A sort of Left 4 Dead that is extremely more tactical and, if possible, even more hardcore and brutal, given that basically the management of destructibility and damage remained heavily dependent on what was seen in the original Ubisoft title. The players appreciated it, some novices approached even for the first time in the game and the initiative was promoted almost everywhere, leaving open the hope that this was only the first step towards something more structured. And somehow it was, given that just a year later the French publisher announced Rainbow Six Quarantine: a stand-alone spin-off that starting from that timed mode, promised to offer a game in its own right with a focus on PvE, or on a small group of players who had to deal with a threat managed by artificial intelligence. Then there was the Covid pandemic, or maybe some development and design problems; no one will ever really tell us, but after a long radio silence, at least 3 substantial postponements and an inevitable title change, we can now finally judge Rainbow Six Extraction with our review that has kept us busy longer than expected to finally be able to issue a verdict on this complex, stratified, sometimes prohibitive experience and, we hope, supported over time by Ubisoft exactly as it is still happening today with Siege. The starting point created by Ubisoft is in fact interesting, certainly engaging, but it has too many flaws and limitations to be considered a point of arrival. Now follow us and we will explain in detail what works and what instead has left us more dumbfounded in Rainbow Six Extraction. The story of an unclear invasion The destructibility of scenery is a crucial element of Rainbow Six Extraction's gameplay On the narrative front Rainbow Six Extraction offers very little surprising: an undefined alien race, the Archaeans, has chosen to storm the Earth by attacking a series of cities and structures. The reasons are not known, nor are the methods of conquest clear: what matters is that where the aliens arrive, a strange blackish mush forms, the Archeloma, capable of slowing down and, in the long run, intoxicating humans and also able to harden excessively to protect the natural habitat of the extraterrestrial. Clearly the attacker is also capable of reproducing without stopping through the nests that develop in the areas controlled by the black matter. But humanity has not been caught unprepared: after years of training and field activities to stop any terrorist threat, the Rainbow team is restructured under a new global banner: REACT, an association whose sole purpose is to collect every possible information on the invader, studying the best countermeasures and then deploying the most expert forces to counter the threat. And guess who will lead this organization with unlimited resources? We could stop here to summarize and tell the story behind Rainbow Six Extraction and this should allow you to understand, in a moment, that the new Ubisoft title does not focuses on a crackling plot, an intense and layered narrative arc or who knows what twists and turns: there is not even a real campaign, but everything is based on the ad libitum repetition of a specific gameplay loop essential for the progression of the own account and therefore for the unlocking of further contents that enrich this structure. Those who want to deepen the narrative events can do so through a long series of secondary objectives to be carried out during the games which lead to the progressive unlocking of a codex full of information on the enemies, the operators, weapons, equipment and evolution of the alien assault. A repetitive but addictive gameplay One of the more advanced Archaeons is able to mimic the behavior of the operator Sledge Just to be even clearer, Rainbow Six Extraction is a first-person shooter that is based on the dynamics and mechanics typical of multiplayer action but with a very strong propensity for tactics and team strategy. The title, while constantly requiring a connection, can also be played alone but is designed and structured to offer maximum enjoyment to a team of 3 players who will have to deal with a seriesof missions of increasing difficulty, within an expedition in a territory besieged by Archaean aliens, to then proceed with the extraction once the objectives have been completed. The gameplay loop is extremely interesting: when starting a new game, the players 3 missions randomly drawn from a pool of a dozen different objectives are offered. These must be tackled in sequence, one at a time and one after the other, within 3 different areas of the selected map. The team will arrive in the first section, will try to complete the task and, at that point, will have to choose whether to proceed to the next area by passing through an airlock that offers a few seconds of shelter and, in fact, blocks the possibility of returning to its steps, or to proceed with the extraction to save the experience accumulated up to that point. Each subsequent mission tends to be more difficult than the previous one because the number of enemies increases and the area becomes more impervious; moreover, some objectives can be failed if the players do not behave quickly and adequately, but this does not in any way affect the possibility of proceeding to the next segment. The most interesting part, however, is the tactical component and the degree of challenge of Extraction which are borrowed from the experience that Ubisoft has gained with Siege. In fact, as the difficulty level rises, it becomes more and more crucial to proceed with great attention, adopting a stealth approach where possible since very few shots are enough to die and above all too much noise can awaken aliens and nests and start an assault mass of the enemy which, at best, leaves the 3 team members in very poor health. Tachanka's turret offers valuable shelter against the toughest Archaeans In addition, the game presents another dynamic that adds spice to the action: if you end up on the ground and are not picked up in time by a companion, or suffer a second mortal wound, your operator is covered in saving foam and enters in a sort of stasis, being excluded from the rest of the match. At that point it will be up to the companions still alive to choose what to do: escape as quickly as possible from the extraction, or carry the sleeping companion on their shoulders in an attempt to extract him too, or perhaps leave the wounded soldier in the extraction area and proceed to the next airlock to attempt to complete another objective. Where for some reason your operator remains on the battlefield wrapped in foam instead, it will become unusable until the moment in which we choose to face the same area of game and, at that point, we will have access to a dedicated rescue mission. If this is successful, the soldier will return to our disposal, otherwise he will suffer a significant penalty in terms of experience. All this dynamic of progression and management of the degree of challenge is certainly the most engaging element of Rainbow Six Extraction, that which stimulates replayability and generates pathos and attention when you face the most demanding missions with your favorite operator. But at the same time this peculiar design shows the side to some problems that afflict the progression of the game. The contents of Rainbow Six Extraction Covers are key in Rainbow Six Extraction To better explain the negative sides of the Ubisoft title, it is essential to take a small step back and delve into its progression structure and the amount of content present. The game offers 18 different operators, all taken from Rainbow Six Siege complete with paraphernalia, gadgets, special abilities and, of course, design. There are also 12 different maps, divided into 4 scenarios of increasing difficulty: New York, San Francisco, Alaska and Truth & Consequences, the city where the invasion originated. To have access to all the game elements, the title offers a double progression system. On the one hand we have the account level which is enhanced simply by playing and allows you to have access to the new maps and therefore to the increased difficulty levels, the extra modes relating to the endgame, the additional blocks of operators, given that at the beginning we will be able access only a small group of them, and also the gadgets with which to equip soldiers which are of 2 types: utilities such as armor or the famous Siege drone, and throwables with multiple types of grenades and explosives.In addition, each individual operator has his own level of experience which, clearly, grows by using that military during the games and allows you to unlock further primary and secondary weaponswaves and to improve efficiency in battle by enhancing its special ability. While the general level of the account only increases, that of the operators is subject to any risks encountered in battle that we talked about above. In fact, if your soldier is fatally shot during the game and is not recovered in the next match, he will suffer a very substantial penalty that will make him lose even a couple of levels, making him unusable for a certain number of subsequent clashes. Furthermore, it is not even enough to be very good because the simple use and injury of an operator causes him a sort of battle fatigue that will make him start with a lower than standard amount of life if we do not decide to put him to rest for some games, not selecting him . This mechanic is valid until we reach the level cap, set at 10, with that operator, but we guarantee that the climb will not be simple and painless. One of the more difficult missions involves opening a portal to an area controlled by the Archaeans In fact, Rainbow Six Extraction constantly forces you to change soldiers every couple of games, leading you to hit your head against various balancing problems. First of all, not all operators have the same degree of utility in battle. The choice to rely on a competitive team shooter such as Siege, with its peculiar design, is in fact limiting when you have to bring the same operators with you in a PvE title. Several abilities seemed to us really not very useful, while others are practically essential and it will not infrequently feel useless during a game simply because you are using a ~second~ level operator. As if this were not enough, since the usable weapons are dependent from the level of the operator himself, for a whole series of matches you will be practically forced to take up a rifle that you don't like which, sometimes, even annoys the other team members. To give you an example, Doc, one of the 2 healers available, can only use a shotgun until he reaches level 4. Clearly a shotgun cannot be silenced and we guarantee that tackling a mission, even at a difficulty level low, where every shot you fire risks waking up all enemies in the area, it's not the height of pleasure. And the other companions, especially if met through matchmaking, will do everything to make you notice it. Combine these 2 elements - the progressive unlocking of the paraphernalia and the need to continuously rotate the operators - and here in Rainbow Six Extraction you will really feel masters of the match only when all the variables fit together perfectly: that is, when your favorite operators are available, you have made them grow enough and the rest of the team is made up of people capable of understanding and willingness. You will have to be good at understanding the types of enemies you are facing, as soon as possible Of course, we said it: in Extraction you can also play alone, or perhaps in 2 with your best friend, but even here some balancing problems arise. The Ubisoft title, probably due to a design that favors the endgame and the highest-level challenge, has some impressive difficulty steps: as long as you stay within the first 2 areas, New York and San Francisco, if you are experienced enough and with the trigger at the ready, you might just be able to get away with it. But from Alaska onwards, when there are safe mutations (random bonuses that the game attributes to the Archaeans at the beginning of each game and for all 3 missions of the match) and perhaps the most difficult quests are combined, you will not have no chance. Playing with 2 other companions becomes mandatory and, if for some reason, they are not your friends or do not deign to enable voice chat or use the ping system perfectly, get ready to be left dry. And maybe just to lose your favorite operator for a few games, finding yourself plunged into the frustrating vortex described above. then it turns into a hardcore challenge not for the faint of heart. If you have the patience and above all the right teammates, its gameplay loop will suck you in and give you enormous satisfaction, never tiring even though, basically, the mechanics are particularly repetitive.
