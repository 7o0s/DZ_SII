{"name": "Verdun", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/150226-verdun-giu-la-testa.html", "text": "In February 1916, the historic hostility between France and Germany culminated in one of the bloodiest battles recorded in history. The enormous trap designed by the Germans to amass and bombard the French forces turned into a hell that lasted almost a year, ten terrible months of skirmishes that cost the lives of more than three hundred thousand soldiers. And things could have been worse given the total employment of almost two million and four hundred thousand personnel all committed to fighting for the nerve center Verdun. But the huge network of trenches dug by the two sides has transformed what should have been a blitzkrieg into a strenuous fight for every meter of ground, a war within a war fought in the mud between disease, snipers, bombings and suicide charges. With Verdun, the three developers involved in this project have tried to faithfully reproduce the ferocious dynamics of this terrible clash without forgetting terrible instruments of death such as nerve gas that the Germans have not scruple to use to try to unblock a situation to say the least. little uncomfortable. The strengths of Verdun are the original setting and an undoubtedly intriguing concept Head down in the mud Verdun is a multiplayer shooter featuring a 32-player mode called Frontlines. Four players per team and four teams per side battle it out over large faithfully reproduced sections of a massive battlefield spanning six different regions. The aim is to advance as much as possible during offensive turns and to defend your trenches during enemy offensives. Each line-up has three minutes available before having to retreat to then attack again in a continuous coming and going that can undergo sudden accelerations if the attacker moves with the right timing. The trenches to be conquered are three on each side and the total duration of the battle is thirty-five minutes. Whoever reaches the last enemy trench or has conquered more trenches when time runs out wins. In all of this it is essential to exploit every single protection whether it is a hole, the wreckage of an airplane or a defensive barrier. Taking care, of course, of the countless roads dug into the earth that allow enemies to go unnoticed by exploiting the same tunnels that protect us. The slightest distraction, in essence, can turn into a rapid defeat thanks also to the high mortality of a title that aims at realism. Realism that includes a faithful representation of ballistics but also a very high useful shot. In essence, a simple rifle is lethal even at a great distance and this means that the passage from one trench to another is damn risky. But the maps are full of trenches, craters and various defensive elements that allow you to advance by making short runs and exposing yourself as little as possible. In this way it is possible to make life difficult for enemy shooters who have to deal with an aiming system without digital pointers or assistance of any kind. Without a sniper rifle, aiming passes through the classic iron sight and when the shot is raised to counterbalance the ballistics, the body of the weapon goes to occupy the view covering the enemy. Things get even worse when we're holed up in a trench amid clouds of gas, sudden reversals in front and with a cumbersome weapon in front of the face. This is where Verdun's positional audio comes into play which is essential to survive even if it sometimes betrays us due to inopportune glitches. But when things work properly, the sound of footsteps in the mud and the language spoken by the soldiers around us can prove to be fundamental in order not to be surprised in the chaos of the trench and in these situations it is good not to forget the mini map which indicates the position of the line-up and team mates. Among other things, the uniforms belong to authentic army corps to which specific equipment corresponds. In short, studying the various uniforms can give us further help in studying the balance of the battle even if it is not said that all the teams have unlocked the special weapons that distinguish them. In fact, there is an experience system that includes a large number of levels, each of which gives two career points to spend at will to unlock the higher levels of the various troop specializations. One of the most interesting elements of the growth system is the experience gained by playing multiple times with the same companions. You don't need to have them as a friend on Steam, just come back to play with them to get the points you accumulated previously. From the Vosges to Flanders It is said that a crewadvanced action is better than the basic one unless specific situations are taken into consideration. In some cases it is good not to underestimate certain sights or devastating instruments of death such as the heavy machine gun which can carry out real massacres in a trench. But the generous range of all weapons and the high mortality also give newcomers the opportunity to play a fundamental role on the battlefield and this is even more true for the non-commissioned officer, the central figure of each team. The leader of a team can count on various bonuses which include two skills thanks to which it is possible to indicate to his companions the points to attack and where to direct the artillery in order to force a group of barricaded enemies to flee. Furthermore, the gas, a German prerogative, can be used to facilitate a charge as it has a prolonged effect and forces opponents to wear a mask, facing an animation that leaves them defenseless for several seconds. In short, the battlefield is dangerous and this danger often leads to moments of stalemate involving snipers and artillery strikes. But there is no risk that these stalemates will persist and that the balance of a game will be compromised by the so-called campers. The alternation of the front suddenly changes the pace of the game, dragging the players into total chaos. Suddenly a well-hidden sniper finds himself outside the territory of his deployment just as several soldiers rush into the attack to build up the initial momentum of the counter-offensive. The rhythm, in essence, grows even if the simulative attitude does not fade. The movement of the soldiers is rather slow, the aiming is not instantaneous and the reloading of the weapons leaves them vulnerable for endless moments. The battles, we have said, are fought in a huge network of trenches that crosses six different settings. Despite the centrality of the trenches, the panorama varies a lot starting from the Vosges to reach Flanders between tree-lined avenues, trenches full of withered foliage and barren areas invaded by fog. Unfortunately the technical sector is far from being impressive due to fluctuating textures and uninspiring explosions but to compensate there are pleasant effects some of which have progressively improved as in the case of smoke and gas curtains, light rays and depth of field. And to all this is added a decidedly varied trench design with tons of holes, steep ups and downs, sandbags, mazes of barbed wire and debris of all sorts. All elements that guarantee a valid and capable overall rendering, thanks to a large number of good quality audio samples, to guarantee a decidedly engaging atmosphere. This provided that you do not pay attention to the animations which represent the weak point of the technical sector with little doubt. On the other hand, the realization of the rain is valuable, which also has visible effects on the ground with lots of streams of water. Patch after patch, new features have popped up such as the fatigue bar and team voice chat as well as various balances that have significantly improved the usability of an interesting shooter whose biggest problem remains the variety. Of course, the frontline is the mode closest to the setting and is destined to grow further as the gameplay evolves but after a few hours the landscape becomes all too familiar and some variations on the theme, such as a city map or an alternative mode to objectives, could significantly broaden the horizons of Verdun. Horizons that for now stop at the only other mode available, that all too classic deathmatch which, despite being peculiar thanks to the setting, does not adapt to the gameplay of the title, proving to be much less interesting than the main mode.", "date": "2015-05-22", "grade": "7.5"}
