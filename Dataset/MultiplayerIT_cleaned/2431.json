{"name": "Anachronox: Quake 2 si reinventa RPG", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/anachronox-quake-2-si-reinventa-rpg.html", "text": "Final Fantasy <i>docet</i> Undoubtedly from the first hours of the game you can see the similarities between the gameplay expertly introduced by the famous saga of the PSX console (with the famous conversions on PC) and our Anachronox. Especially as regards the fights, given that the system used is the turn-based one regulated by the ~gauge~ or, in other words, ~bars that fill up, and when they are full your character can attack~. Anyone who knows this system knows what it means, for others I can only guarantee that it is a system of sure success and a very pleasant approach, given that it does not force you to madly hit, click and hope not to die... but neither to puff for long waited before resolving a combat. (Well, the mega-bosses stand on their own.) Also there are the usable characters in the game (mostly three at once, but seven in total that you will find throughout the game), which are very well characterized both in terms of graphics and in character and behavior. Each of them then enjoys exclusive abilities that will often represent the only way out of a dangerous or at least problematic situation. Moments for a few laughs will certainly not be lacking then, with that nice rogue Sly. Moped or souped-up scooter? The engine that moves the game is completely three-dimensional and it is the now aged engine of Quake 2, the famous Id Software masterpiece. It must be added that this title has remained in the gestation phase for a long time, we are talking about years, and certain choices that at the time seemed spot on can now turn up their noses when compared to today's quality standards. The first exclamations of embarrassment in front of the ~cubitness~ of the characters in the initial movie (which together with the others is made with the game engine) however diminishes as the hours of play go by. Indeed, the following question often came to mind: how well did they squeeze this engine out? Although there are obvious technical limitations in the quality of the backdrops that are impossible to eliminate, everything is very believable in the context in which we are inserted, and it can be seen that a good job has been done to improve the textures of the characters and buildings, galleries as much as possible , spaceships and game elements. From the point of view of optimization, there is nothing to complain about, also considering that the game is very fluid in almost any game condition, making the experience pleasant and immersive. Each location will have its own characteristics and in particular when you leave the city for the space port just outside the alien construction (but also for interplanetary travel...and I won't reveal more) you will notice how much work has been done from the point of view of the creation of landscapes with their own precise identity, made up of traditions, buildings and inhabitants. I have to make just one note though: I seem to have read that by tinkering with the configuration files (a rather annoying practice, especially for those who don't want to complicate their lives) you can set an intermediate video resolution, but basically the game only offers 2 options : high and low resolution which are 640x480 and 1280x960 respectively ! This means that to enjoy the game in high resolution, you either have a 19 monitor and a card capable of withstanding this resolution, or you are relegated to the now outdated 640. The game is very fluid in both modes, I repeat, only that the Anachronox audience will be divided into 2 groups, who will enjoy it to the fullest detail and who will have to be satisfied. rpg? No, it's better to say adventure. I don't think Anachronox can be classified in the RPG genre, due to the lack of making the character grow towards certain inclinations and with physical attributes that we choose (except for managing inventories and equipment), and also because the plot is all in all quite linear, except for ~missions~ of short importance that will reward us with some money or object. I would rather say that it fits into the adventure genre, and it does it in style! Let yourself be captured by the plot and the game dynamics will be a pleasure, and you will be amazed at how deep and immersive this game is, which offers established and fun gameplay, nothing to say. To be clear, the run-up to the next goal will be on the agenda, and there will hardly be moments of stalemate in which you will not know how to get by. Of course, it also takes a bit of ingenuity and, above all, don't forget the unique abilities of your characters! Outcome: promoted! I really liked Anachronox, and in my opinion represents the swan song of the Ion Storm. One last work that collectshe sees in himself the efforts to create a futuristic and at the same time imaginative world. Seasoned with adventure, sympathy when needed and dynamism. A game in which you will lose count of the hours needed to complete it (and they are not few) and that you will want to finish, and certainly not to quickly eliminate it from your existence, far from it! Will be hungry and curious to see how it ends! Considering that there aren't many worthy titles set up in this way in the PC field, excluding the conversions of FF 7 and FF 8, I would recommend it to all those who want to give a sprint to their thirst for adventure. But how many times have I said it's an adventure? (At least as many as Lucio Battisti, n.d.Pucci). Other photos 11 There is life in space Welcome to Anachronox, an alien satellite city, abandoned in the center of the universe, which has become home to desperate people, thieves and scum of all kinds. So says the back of the Anachronox package, a game that will actually project us into a city built inside a huge alien structure lost in space, a decidedly exotic picture, which you will learn to know and appreciate from the initial movie. A city halfway between Blade Runner and the most classic science fiction due to the presence of huge metal-industrial-apocalyptic structures in which races of all types, shapes, sizes and characters swarm! You are private detective Sylvester ~Sly~ Boots, grappling with a life full of debt and a decidedly declining investigative activity. Hunted by creditors and the local mafia, it will be your first task to try to get yourself out of the way by looking for a job that is right for you. Thus begins the long march through Anachronox, between meanders and alleys bordering on the paradoxical (at least for us earthlings) given that the city enjoys real gravitational walks! In fact, it will happen that you visit an environment and see people walking on opposite walls, often upside down... only to then discover that you too, turning down some street, will find yourself in the same position.", "date": "2001-07-27", "grade": null}
