At the beginning we only have the revolver available to face the enemies, but that's enough: the infrared system of the Wii-mote confirms its accuracy and allows us to hit all our targets. Jackals collapse under our fire, reacting differently depending on the wound: a blow to the legs makes them fall, a blow to the head quickly puts an end to their pathetic existence. The meeting with master Jian constitutes a first, important turning point in the story: he recognizes our alter ego as the only survivor of the Kusagari clan (a group of warriors specialized in fighting with swords and pistols), gives him the sword with which the bandits had tried to kill him and intends to teach him all the techniques he will need to fulfill his revenge. The Kusagari have been exterminated, and someone will pay for it. A new beginning Red Steel 2 is not really a sequel, in fact it has nothing to do with the story that is told in the first episode of the series. The setting is futuristic, probably post-apocalyptic, and the scenario is that of the Red West, with the plot developing within the city of Caldera and in its immediate vicinity. The protagonist has no name, he is simply the last of the Kusaragi and at a certain point he is called by master Jian ~The Protector~, to underline his role in the story: he will be the one to put an end to the violence perpetrated by the Jackals and their instigator , whose goal is to possess a legendary katana with mysterious powers. The streets are deserted, but there is still a lot of technology to regulate the life of Caldera: very high communication towers spread what seems to be the only means of telecommunication that survived the wars, the radio; and each building has electronic access points, often requiring the use of a key to enter. Jian's dojo becomes our first headquarters: assisted by the radio support of the beautiful Tamiko, we can check the bulletin board from time to time to find new missions to complete, each capable of returning us a certain amount of money. The first expeditions are extremely short and take place within very limited areas, which is rather disappointing; but the further you go in the story, the more you realize the exceptional work done by the Ubisoft developers with regard to the ~progression~ factor. Our character acquires new skills and can apply them immediately, because at the same time the missions expand, become more complex and confront us with more and more cunning and dangerous opponents. The enemies are in fact divided into different categories: at the beginning we find those who go down with a couple of blows, unable to carry out an offensive maneuver worthy of the name; later, decidedly stronger and more resistant bandits arrive, who must be faced differently according to their characteristics and attack patterns. For example, at some point it will happen to come across a huge enemy, who wields a heavy mallet and spins it to damage us even from a certain distance. The only way to defeat him is to hit him several times on the back, performing a special maneuver that is taught to us by master Jian and which allows us to move quickly behind an opponent. Similarly, there are enemies who manage to charge their shots and wear heavy armor: to eliminate them we must first repel their attacks, then take advantage of their uncertainty to sink heavy blows. MotionPlus: why? As you surely know, Red Steel 2 requires Motion Plus to work. You must therefore put the shell on your Wii-mote (always do it, please), perform a quick calibration before each game (just place the controller on a horizontal plane for a few seconds) and then you are ready to give sword with the best possible motion detection. This solution, perhaps questionable from a commercial point of view (~hardcore~ games for Wii are not famous for their sales, therefore forcing the purchase of Motion Plus - bundled or not - could prove to be a counterproductive strategy), was adopted by Ubisoft to give a certain depth to the gameplay, something impossible to do using the basic characteristics of the Wii-mote. In fact, the control system distinguishes strong shots from weak ones, correctly detects the affondo and the position of the sword in the parry phase, and also allows extra applications such as those implemented in some nice minigames, in this case the rotation of the controller to guess the combination of the safes or for the activation of manual switches. Some special moves benefit particularly from the precision of the Motion Plus, in particular the Dragon technique: after charging the spiritual energy by holding down A and B, we can hit enemies from afar by moving the controller as if we were throwing a frisbee into their direction. In the game, each technique bears the name of an animal, and there are five in all: in addition to the aforementioned Dragon, there are the Bear (a powerful punch to the ground that throws enemies to the ground), the Eagle (a ascendant that throws the opponent in the air), the Cobra (based on the use of the revolver, it allows us to engage several targets at the same time and then fire) and the Tiger (a powerful counterattack). The techniques cannot be purchased using the money collected from the numerous chests or obtained following the completion of the missions: they will be taught to us by Jian, one at a time, throughout history. We mentioned earlier that the master's dojo is our first headquarters, but during the game we will see two more: the Sheriff's office and Songan's shop. Each of these places serves as a starting point for missions, and at the same time allows us to buy upgrades of various types: in Jian's dojo we can buy improvements for the katana and techniques, as well as ten different secret moves; in the Sheriff's office we can buy three other firearms that add to the starting revolver, as well as upgrades for each of them; in Songan's workshop we can instead get upgrades for the armor and the health bar, as well as bonuses that make our shots more effective compared to certain categories of enemies. The use of firearms in Red Steel 2 is really natural in the context of a fight, so it is possible to alternate slashing and pistol shots depending on the situation. The starting revolver has a good range and moderate power, but clearly the other three firearms offer a series of far from negligible advantages: the shotgun is lethal at close range, the carbine can eliminate enemies with a at once and even from afar, the machine gun proves to be excellent when the opponent is equipped with very resistant armor and we want to wear him down before a lunge. The technical aspect Most of you are wondering whether or not the game offers the holy grail that Wii owners have been chasing in vain for years, i.e. real-time, 1:1 motion mapping. Well, no. The detection is precise, there is no doubt, but during the fights it is far from unusual to perform the moves and only then see them reproduced on the screen. Furthermore, those who are accustomed to using the Wii-mote alone and do not know the Motion Plus will find themselves having to deal with a somewhat traumatic initial impact: it is not possible to play by hinting at the movements, rather one has to make sweeping gestures because the detection happens correctly. It may happen that in the most frenetic clashes this thing is difficult to do, and the result clearly translates into a series of sganassoni that our protagonist will perceive exactly at the height of the gums. We played Red Steel 2 at an average level and completed it in just over eight and a half hours, dying a few times and restarting from checkpoints that are fortunately always very abundant. The calibration of the difficulty seemed almost perfect to us, hand in hand with a concept of progression that is applied to all aspects of the gameplay with truly commendable results. The game's graphics use the cel shading technique in an excellent way, assisting it with a frame rate of sixty frames per second that practically never drops: the only moments in which slowdowns are noticed are when we destroy many crates in one fell swoop. In some situations there is really the feeling of being faced with a ~nextgen~ product, this above all thanks to a particularly inspired level design. Let's say that things ~take off~ after a couple of hours, from all points of view: the fights become more engaging and multifaceted, variety is added to the situations, the missions become more articulated and the settings are colored with visual solutions of big impact. The cutscenes are pre-calculated, but they load instantly and fit well into the context of the game, almost giving the impression of being rendered in real time.The management of uploads, in particular, is really excellent: some doors take longer than others to be opened, but the wait never lasts more than a handful of seconds. The sound sector is perfectly suited to the graphics, with really spot-on musical breaks and good quality effects. The only negative note is the dubbing in Italian, entrusted to the same team of ~professionals~ who some time ago took care of lending the voices to that masterpiece of Emergency Heroes, also for Wii: given the blazon of the Ubisoft product, perhaps it was the case to bet a little higher.", "date": "2010-03-23", "grade": "8.5"}
