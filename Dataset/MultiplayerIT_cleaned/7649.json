Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. The stories of medieval knights are generally full of adventures, spectacular duels, glorious victories. They were the greatest heroes of a dark historical period, and were looked up to by the common people. For a knight who achieved success and money, however, how many were there who did not earn the headlines? How many led a life without high notes or noteworthy deeds, how many met their death at the first opportunity, how many were betrayed and miserably perished in the middle of a cold forest? With Sword & Glory, in practice, the developers of Ifelse Media wanted to tell their story; the story of warriors affiliated to important clans or completely independent, of Christian or pagan faith, skilled and less skilled, in view not so much of their single life, which can even last a blink of an eye if this is their destiny, but of their entire dynasty. How exactly? Focusing on the concept of ~permadeath~, the permanent death of the character, which in this specific case translates into the passage of the wealth and objects earned on the battlefield to the heir, who in turn will try to make a name for himself by bringing his house to glory. Everything takes place in an action adventure context strongly characterized by precise stylistic choices, such as the black and white graphics (with only a few colors appearing from time to time to enhance certain elements), the essential but atmospheric musical accompaniment, the dialogues that recall the text adventures of 8-bit computers and, finally, a combat system that is simple but terribly effective in its brutality, in which you live or die even by a simple stroke of luck. Sword & Glory offers a reasoned but engaging experience, very original in some ideas and solutions Short life At the beginning of each new game, Sword & Glory asks us to select our character's affiliation to one of the factions that inhabit the Silver Valley: the Bear clan, made up of traditionalist warriors; the clan of the Eagle, powerful and explained; the poorly organized Elk clan; or no clan. Then we move on to faith, which can be Christian, pagan or agnostic. These are choices that define the quests and the characters with whom we will find ourselves interacting, with the possibility of using a cautious approach with the opponents or of immediately launching an attack, which makes us switch from the ~strategic~ view from the high to a two-dimensional context in the style of fighting games in matches, with the two warriors moving along a horizontal line and crossing each other until one begins to swing. At this juncture, the control system has two buttons, one for the attack and one for parrying with the shield, for a total of three possible manoeuvres: the quick shot, the slow and loaded one or the ~prudent~ one, which is carried out during the blockade. Opening a breach in the enemy's defense is essential to winning the battle, but as already mentioned, things in Sword & Glory can always take an unexpected turn and one misstep is enough to lose your life. In any case, it is precisely the concept of the Ifelse Media title, enriched in the course of many updates in recent months, that represents the strength of a production different from all the others, completely free and therefore worthy of a try by gamers looking for something original.", "date": "2013-08-31", "grade": "7.6"}
