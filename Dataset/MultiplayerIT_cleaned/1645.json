{"name": "Midnight Club 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/midnight-club-3.html", "text": "It still runs at midnight! For the uninitiated, Midnight Club 2 is the sequel to an interesting racing game released way back in November 2000, when PlayStation 2 made its official debut on European soil. Despite having undoubted qualities, Midnight Club: Street Racing went almost unnoticed among the ranks of a very numerous launch lineup, also due to a certainly not attractive graphic design and a repetitive gameplay in the long run. Two and a half years later, Rockstar San Diego tries again with a rather ambitious sequel, full of the hype generated in recent weeks and the experience gained by Rockstar with super-hits of the caliber of Grand Theft Auto 3 and the semi-sequel Vice city. At this point, it's worth mentioning that while the latest GTA for PlayStation 2 was developed by Rockstar North, Midnight Club is instead a creation of San Diego studios, formerly known as Angel Studios. Nonetheless, the kinship between the two franchises is clearly evident to our eyes, both from a cosmetic point of view and for the same anti-conventional characteristics that unite them. Street Racing, city follies Midnight Club 2 was born as an atypical racing, proposing the idea of clandestine racing in city settings, with a structure that is the element that most characterizes it compared to other productions. If in Burnout and Ridge Racer, there was a pre-established route, here instead the player is given full freedom, whose common sense is entrusted with the choice of the shortest or least busy road through a maze of alleys, urban roads and ring roads. The only constraint imposed on us is that of the sequential crossing of a series of checkpoints that lead to the finish line of each race. However, between one checkpoint and the next it will be possible both to follow the main road and to venture into alternative routes which, if very often they turn into dead ends or time-wasting traps, other times they offer us the possibility of taking advantage of unexpected shortcuts. The latter present themselves to us in various forms, such as for example the transit through the atrium of a building, for apparently insurmountable stairways, or with dizzying leaps from hills or from cranes transformed for the occasion into trampolines. As is now customary for the latest generation driving games, the programmers have chosen for Midnight Club 2 settings derived from typical glimpses of really existing cities. In Los Angeles and Tokyo, already present in the original, this time Paris has also joined, which in numerous competitions offers us the view of the Eiffel Tower and other famous locations. Our career as a street racer begins in glittering Los Angeles which, with the neon lights and frenzy of a metropolis that is alive even at night, represents the ideal scenario for clandestine racing. Wandering around the city streets, we will be able to meet and hire other racing fanatics, classic neighborhood ~bullies~ to challenge by dazzling them with the lights of our car. Each ~challenge~ is developed through three races, at the end of which the prize is awarded, consisting of the vehicle booklet of the defeated contender. This is how the career mode develops which, through the three city settings, will lead us to the possession of numerous racing cars that will replace the shabby bandwagon initially in our possession. The biggest news in this regard is that we will be able to conquer and therefore also drive powerful motorcycles, often more suitable than 4-wheeled vehicles to face particular competitions. Our motoring feats will also be rewarded with the conquest of new skills to be exploited in driving, such as for example the possibility of making lightning-fast departures with related tire squeezing, of controlling the weight of our vehicle during the frequent flight phases following jumps, or to enhance the nitro, an additional boost already supplied at the beginning of the career. In addition to the main mode, we also find the inevitable single race, an interesting track editor and an online game option, unfortunately not yet usable in Europe. I'm looking for new sensations The driving style is undeniably arcadey, so it is not surprising that the control of the cars is somewhat simplistic and that no differences of any kind are detectable between driving one vehicle rather than another. The immediacy of the control and the punctual response of the commands are in any case indispensable in a game that makes speed its strong point. The frenzy and spectacularity of the races succeed in the no easy task of keeping themrci with bated breath until the finish line, giving us moments of uncontrollable exaltation or panic, perceptible sensations for example by slaloming through city traffic, or facing an intersection at full speed, perhaps passing under the trailer of a lorry. Fun is guaranteed, even if, as already happened in the first chapter, a certain feeling of already seen, of repetitiveness begins to be felt after a few hours of play. The longevity factor, ensured by a good number of competitions, is in any case subject to the digestion of a level of difficulty that is not always balanced, and is generally rather difficult. If you accept the challenge proposed by Mindnight Club 2, be ready to find bread for your teeth. It reminds me so much of a certain Grand Theft Auto... From a technical point of view, Midnight Club 2 proves to be very inconsistent. If the speed and good fluidity of the graphics engine are undoubtedly appreciable, the same cannot be said of the general aspect of the game, which appears dated, albeit improved compared to the original. However, the excellent lighting effects cannot hide the defects already found in the first version and you will have to get used to living with a certain aliasing and with a certainly not exceptional cleaning of the image. The resemblance to the graphic style of the latest Grand Theft Autos is clear, as is the use of the same graphics engine, which however would have needed some updating. The sound sector is probably even less exciting, mainly due to music that is not always suitable for competition situations and is often not able to amplify the adrenaline component as it should have. Finally, I point out that the game has not undergone any dubbing in our language, although the texts have been translated into Italian. We leave the judgment on the online gaming component suspended for the moment, inaccessible for the moment from Europe. Conclusions Midnight Club 2, improved and grown in its potential, represents a welcome surprise in the panorama of arcade driving games. However, it is not free from defects and it is a real pity that Rockstar San Diego have not been able to recreate a graphic design worthy of the name, which is indispensable if we consider the level of the latest productions for PlayStation 2. however, that's all and fans of the genre shouldn't struggle to find a valid reason to buy Midnight Club 2. Highly recommended, if the predecessor and Burnout 2 had already thrilled you. Otherwise, you just have to wait for the release of driving games with a less radically arcade philosophy. And it's a real pity that, at least for now, it is not possible to take advantage of the online game mode from Europe, one of the title's greatest strengths. Pros: Fun and spectacular Good number of competitions It is also possible to drive motorbikes There is also an online game mode ... Cons: ... unfortunately not yet usable In the long run a bit repetitive Difficulty high and not always well balanced Dated graphics In a historic moment of videogames in which the racing simulation genre appears anything but crowded with interpreters, leaving the task of representing it to Gran Turismo and a select few others, the current, perhaps less exclusive but equally satisfying, purely arcade driving games. Of course, the compromise with the driving system chosen by titles such as Burnout and Need for Speed may not be acceptable to everyone, but if the ingredients of your gaming life are high speed, curves covered at the limit of 200 km/h and accidents from which not even a bolt would be able to come out intact, so keep reading the following lines, because I assure you that you will not regret it.", "date": "2003-05-30", "grade": null}
