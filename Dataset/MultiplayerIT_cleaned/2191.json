Let's be clear: entrusting this task to Panic Button, the development team now specialized in creating great little miracles on Switch, was certainly not a mistake for Electronic Arts . Their latest work with DOOM Eternal, moreover, speaks for itself: the studio has managed to obtain an excellent compromise between detail and performance, despite the graphic complexity of the id Software shooter. Apex Legends welcomes us to Nintendo Switch with this graphic quality. Apex Legends a technically simpler and more minimal title than the aforementioned DOOM Eternal, and this is probably what misled everyone, including Panic Button. In fact, if a purely single player experience allows for deeper and more radical optimizations, in a multiplayer-based shooter there are aspects that cannot be touched, otherwise there will be a substantial qualitative decline also on the gameplay front. what happened with the conversion of Apex Legends: despite the lowering of all the graphic parameters and the halving of the frame rate, the game still struggles to run on Nintendo Switch without incurring more or less marked blunders and uncertainties, which conspicuously penalize the enjoyment of the game and inevitably end up distorting it. Structure Apex Legends for Nintendo Switch waives detail and effects, but does not save the frame rate. Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale that at the end of 2019 had something like seventy million players. Developed by the authors of Titanfall and set in the same universe, the title tells of a deadly challenge, the Apex Games, which is seen by survivors, mercenaries and criminals as the only way to get the fame and money needed to start a new life in a different part of the galaxy. These fighters engage in a fight within a large map that gradually shrinks, making the duels more and more frequent. The aim is naturally to remain the only ones alive at the end of the match, using the points earned to unlock aesthetic elements as well as the characters that make up the game's roster, which can also be purchased with real money. Apex Legends for Nintendo Switch, the launch sequence highlights the fatigue of the graphics engine. Over the seasons, numerous new warriors have been introduced, literally doubling the initial endowment: the original Gibraltar, Lifeline, Bloodhound, Pathfinder, Wraith, Bangalore, Caustic and Mirage have been gradually added Octane, Wattson, Crypto, Loba, Revenant , Rampart, Horizon and Fuse. In short, many new Legends, each with its own peculiar abilities to use in battle. At the same time as the various seasons and the constant updates on the subject of balancing, Apex Legends has also been equipped with extra modes, often for a limited time, created to shuffle the cards on the table and increase the variety of experience in the eyes of users, who were also able to visit different locations than the classic Canyon of the Kings, relaunched in a modified version in Season 8. Gameplay Apex Legends for Nintendo Switch, a phase of the match. The formula at the base of Apex Legends, also present in full form on Nintendo Switch, provides for tag or trio matches, in which one is projected within the scenario within a team, choosing where to land from time to time and collecting weapons, armor and useful objects to make your character more competitive in view of the inevitable clashes that he will have to try to overcome to aspire to victory. The approach is that of a Call of Duty-style first-person shooter, and could not be differently considered the origins of the development team: fast and frenetic action, exasperated dynamism, the lack of reference points within the map in which to think and lurk, but also the strategic contribution of special abilities and Ultimates, which can change the face of confrontation at any moment. Apex Legends for Nintendo Switch, a cover to place behind to avoid enemy fire. On Nintendo Switch it is possible to activate the gyroscope to assist the work of the analog sticks, but such a solution to work effectively needs a really consistent frame rate, and as already mentioned this is not the case. ANDthere is also an option for cross-play, so as to challenge users on other platforms, however it is better to avoid: matchmaking is much faster, but the other players have an advantage in terms of fluidity, visibility and experience, and will massacre you without no mercy.Finally, a few words on the free-to-play format, which in the case of Apex Legends allows you to play multiplayer even without having a Nintendo Switch Online subscription, as has become tradition for this kind of productions and on most platforms . Technical realization Apex Legends for Nintendo Switch, our character looking for opponents on the map. So let's go back to the heart of the matter, namely the technical realization of Apex Legends on Nintendo Switch. It is possible that the graphics engine of the game has not allowed Panic Button to obtain the desired results despite the aforementioned and very visible cuts to the quality of the assets, of the characters, of the effects, of the resolution and the halving of the frame rate, which goes from 60 fps original at a target of 30 frames. The sensation, right from the start, is that of being faced with the PC version of the game that is run on a notebook with an integrated video card, lowering all the presets in the hope of obtaining a playable compromise. The difference is that in this case the developers could have introduced at least variable adjustments to ensure that the various Legends did not have such jagged outlines in the menus. As you probably know, Apex Legends runs on Switch at 720p in docked mode, but seeing it in action on a large 4K screen the resolution seems even lower, a bit like in the Wolfenstein episodes where a very dynamic scaler was used aggressive. Asset streaming is slow and struggles, which is noticeable right from the launch sequence. Then when you fight and the situation heats up, the frame-rate drops and the gameplay becomes inaccurate and chaotic. Do things improve in portable mode? Unfortunately not, indeed on the fluidity front there are even more frequent blunders, although in that case the 576p resolution gives a feeling of greater sharpness on the small screen.", "date": "2021-03-12", "grade": "6.5"}
