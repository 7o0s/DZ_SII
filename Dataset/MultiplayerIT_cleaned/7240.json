Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away, there was a prince determined to defend his homeland from the onslaught of a dark army made up of orcs, trolls, sorcerers and black knights. Luckily the prince was not alone, indeed the more he traveled the more he met warriors willing to follow him in his battle. Archers, knights, druids, thieves and wizards: his team became more formidable and varied every day, but at the same time the threats to face grew. This is the incipit of Lionheart Tactics, a decidedly classic turn-based RPG, created by Emerald City Games and produced by Kongregate for iOS devices. From the point of view of always different three-dimensional settings, which generally develop horizontally but sometimes also vertically, our mission in the game is to advance from one stage to another, facing more numerous and cunning groups of enemies from time to time, as well as dangerous bosses. The numbers supporting the single player campaign are respectable: sixteen classes and three races available for the party, over 170 missions, more than thirty different opponents, more than fifty locations and a huge amount of weapons and items that can be collect at the end of each battle or buy using the gold coins earned on the field, through a system of packs with random content. To this offer is added an asynchronous multiplayer mode in which we are given the possibility of challenging another player's team. Lionheart Tactics is an excellent strategic RPG for lovers of the genre, and it's also free Rich dish, I stick to it Lionheart Tactics can be downloaded from the App Store for free, and the limitations of the freemium model in this case appear anything but stringent: if one of our warriors dies or loses energy, you have to wait a certain number of minutes for him to come back to life or heal (in the second case nothing prevents us from using it anyway), but beyond this it is possible to play freely, without the obligation to spend a euro and without having to refer to the increasingly popular ~action points~, which actually limit the time of use of the experience. As mentioned, the connotations are those of traditional RPGs, with a turn-based system and a division of the maps into ~boxes~ on which to move, attack and possibly use special abilities. Lionheart Tactics makes use of very ~fast~ polygonal graphics to manage with your fingers, rotate and zoom; perhaps too fast, so much so that a ~brake~ or the introduction of fixed cameras would have been welcome to stem some issues relating to controls, specifically the selection of units and/or their targets, operations which unfortunately often turn out to be chaotic and imprecise . However, it is one of the few shadows, together with a not exactly intuitive interface between the missions (see the management of the characters and their equipment, which could be streamlined substantially), in the framework of a truly excellent product, which does not innovates the genre to which it belongs but which can count on a relative freshness in the mobile sector, as well as an indisputable charm among RPG lovers. In short, a solid experience, corroborated by an artificial intelligence of the enemies at times surprising and equipped with a technical sector that moves on two distinct fields: on the one hand the in-game graphics, really excellent; on the other the character design during the dialogues, less convincing.", "date": "2014-03-22", "grade": "8.3"}
