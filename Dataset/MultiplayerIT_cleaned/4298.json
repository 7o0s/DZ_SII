Yet underestimating the production of Dire Wolf Digital and branding it as a simple clone of the other titles would be extremely wrong, even if only for the double division of the game table capable of proposing new interesting strategies. Certainly the TES community is not as numerous as that of the other names just mentioned but it is still quite active and on the net it is not hard to find lists or strategies to compete online. The production, however, suffers greatly from its young age and today we are here to deal with the second large expansion that has arrived on the official servers, an expansion that bears the name of Houses of Morrowind and which tries in its own way to take even more detachment from its competitors proposing new mechanics and a substantial change to the construction of the decks. More space for ideas The Houses of Morrowind introduces the beauty of 149 sparkling cards to The Elder Scrolls: Legends, but the most important feature of all is the addition of three-attribute cards, which greatly vary the meta and, above all, the deck building. It is a new concept and distant from all other card games, where you always try to build a deck with the least possible number of cards and, consequently, variables to better control the management of the clash. Morrowind instead overturns this concept, offering the player the possibility of bringing his deck from a minimum of fifty to a minimum of seventy-five cards, a necessary requirement to be able to insert creatures and abilities with triple attributes. It was therefore to be understood if increasing the volume of the deck by 33%, it would still have been possible to be competitive and the answer was not long in coming, with decks that manage to keep up with those with two attributes even managing to climb the rankings of the ladder. There is also the other side of the coin to consider, where in Hearthstone a thirty-card deck is easily obtainable, possibly sacrificing a little arcane dust to craft the missing legendaries, to have a seventy-five-card competitive deck in The Elder Scrolls : Legends it will be necessary to work much harder, perhaps not a suitable choice for those who, perhaps, were intending to start trying their hand at the Bethesda-branded card game now. Taking pros and cons into consideration, the new mechanics are still interesting and offer the essential freshness to leave enough room for experimentation, while maintaining a solid foundation of gameplay: on balance, therefore, a success. You can also play solo! One of the most interesting elements added to The Elder Scrolls: Legends was the possibility of tackling single-player puzzles where you can test your intelligence, with pre-set goals to be achieved in the game that are not always so obvious or simple, on the contrary. To the delight of all the geniuses out there then here comes a rich update for this feature, with the specific intent to teach you the meaning of the new keywords added. Plot, Gathering, Betrayal and Exaltation are nothing particularly revolutionary but they go well with the mechanics of the base cards already present, adding a level of difficulty that the title lacked. Plot basically works like Hearthstone combo cards, allowing you to activate a particular ability if you played another card that turn; Exaltation on the other hand grants you extra bonuses by spending additional magicka at the cost of the card; Betrayal forces you to sacrifice another creature to activate its effect while Rally Power cards in your hand whenever a creature with this particular power attacks the enemy. The interactions are good and interesting, and while not upsetting the world of card games, we found ourselves having a lot of fun while creating decks that included these new keywords. We close this review, about which there is very little to say but which has a good general value by making two considerations on the number of cards currently present in The Elder Scrolls: Legends. With the arrival of the Houses of Morrowind, the total number of cards rises to about 900 units, a limit quantity in order to keep combinations and synergies under control. From the next expansion we therefore expect that something, in the TESL format, will be changed, with some cards that inevitably will have to enter the rotation to let the game quickly change meta and revolutions, a possibility however that at the moment is not foreseen at all. 'horizon. The only alternativewould be to continue aiming for increasingly numerous decks of cards, so as to increase the number of draws necessary to activate the combos and lower the success percentages.", "date": "2018-04-17", "grade": "7.8"}
