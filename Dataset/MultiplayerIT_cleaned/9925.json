A similar argument can be made for video games, which historically have always been fascinated by martial arts and have dedicated several titles to Bruce Lee in particular, even if the quality is not always excellent. In the case of Bruce Lee Dragon Warrior, available for iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad at a price of 1.59 euros, we are dealing with a very technical fighting game full of strategic elements, which in terms of combat dynamics refers to classics such as Mortal Kombat and Virtua Fighter. In addition to Bruce Lee clearly, the game offers us nine very different characters in terms of style, speed and power. Unfortunately, there is no online multiplayer, which would have really made a difference, but otherwise there is a good number of modes. The Way of the Dragon The fulcrum of the game is made up of the Story mode, which traces the life of Bruce Lee between one fight and another in a very fictional way. Welcomed into a martial arts school, Bruce has to demonstrate his skills to his master every time, accepting the numerous challenges that are thrown at him and successfully overcoming them. At the beginning, these are simple single fights, which then alternate with short tournaments, timed or survival challenges, with a level of difficulty that grows slowly and forces us to follow a careful and reasoned approach, to study our opponents and their attack routines before exposing us with our combos. Proceeding within the Story mode also and above all serves to unlock all the characters to be used later in Versus, Time Attack and Survival modes, as well as a series of suggestive images depicting Bruce Lee during different moments of his short career. The loading screen of each meeting is enriched by some sentences actually uttered by Lee, who evidently made the three years he spent studying Philosophy at university pay off. Once in action, the game offers us a control system based entirely on the touch screen, with a virtual d-pad on the left and two icons on the right for kicking and punching. To parry, just press the d-pad in the opposite direction to the opponent, and this applies whatever the height of the attack: an oversimplification for any fighting game, but on the iPhone it would have been tough to force players to also hold the low guard. It is possible to chain the blows to create different combos and use the ~ki~ bar (which is charged both when we suffer attacks and when we hit them) to create a whole series of special moves. The problem, in this case, are precisely the controls: forget the fluidity of any ~crescent~, here you have to proceed in ~Mortal Kombat~ style and therefore adopt a ~digital~ rather than ~analog~ approach, pressing each direction of the d -pad individually to compose the desired maneuver. With a little practice things become quite simple and natural, but it is clear that you can not expect the responsiveness and feel of a normal controller. The speech extends to the technical realization, which in terms of animations does not do much to underline the power of the blows and the impact of the same. It's a shame, because otherwise the developers have done great things: from polygonal models to scenarios (numerous and well designed), from the realism of the movements to the number of moves, passing through a perhaps essential but effective sound sector.
