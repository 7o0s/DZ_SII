{"name": "Burnout Dominator - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/burnout-dominator-recensione.html", "text": "No rules During the races, therefore, it becomes essential for the user to make the most of, and to his own advantage, the traffic, the weather or road surface conditions, as well as its particular conformation, to carry out reckless maneuvers or close a corner, bumping or ramming it, a opponent by subsequently crashing it into a tree or whatever (often opening up new routes, this is how shortcuts are discovered). In short, the famous Takedowns are not difficult to perform thanks to the good, intuitive and accurate, even if not perfect, guide system. By performing these actions, or by driving against the traffic and touching the cars that come towards us, a bar at the bottom left of the screen, which indicates the Turbo, is filling up. When this is full, pressing R1 activates and executes the ~burnout~, a propulsive thrust that makes our car much faster. In this ~condition~, if you are able to maintain control of the vehicle and continue your destructive work towards the opposing drivers, it is possible to further recharge the aforementioned bar, thus maintaining the ~superboost~ for longer in a sort of chain continues. If not, that is when you crash into a car or overthrow, the devastating fury of the user is further encouraged by an incredible feature: it is in fact possible to partially control the crazy car by pressing R1 again and using the analog stick left to route her and cut off others to run them over and get more Takedowns. The Kah Ra Shin As if that weren't enough, to reach more distant opponents, at this juncture you can use the Crashbraker, this time pressing R2. It consists in literally blowing up your car whose pieces in flight will hit the unfortunate opponents nearby. In the game whoever does the most damage wins, whoever destroys the others, don't forget that. It is not for nothing that EA has made its motto ~Stress out, calm in~ inspired by the oriental philosophy of Kah Ra Shin, on which we invite you to read, for more information on the subject, the special available by clicking here. In the main menu there are four basic options through which to access the various game modes. The first is also the main one of Burnout Dominator, that is the so-called ~World Tour~, in single player. In this mode it is possible to try your hand at a series of varied and in some ways crazy challenges: by selecting your car in one of the seven available categories, namely Vintage cars, Production cars, Modified cars, Hot rods, Supers, Racing cars race and Dominator, the gamer can face each of the thirteen challenges that make up each series. These vary in level of difficulty and kind of objectives to be achieved, and range from classic races, such as the ~Gran Prix~, or three consecutive races with a final score (in the last test it is possible to unlock, if defeated, the Dominator car) , to the ~elimination~ ones, passing through races whose only objective is to perform as many Takedowns as possible, such as in ~Furia Stradale~, where, as the name already suggests, it is essential to obtain as many points as possible by performing actions at limits of suicide (it is not for nothing that the points have been renamed Madness). In these situations, the burnout ~chains~ we mentioned earlier act as a multiplier, allowing you to reach otherwise unattainable scores. By winning races or passing certain tests, sometimes unrelated to the context of the race, new cars or extras are unlocked. Good try Closely followed, forgive the pun, the ~Record Challenge~ mode, where it is possible to try a series of tests aimed at allowing us to beat our best scores in the various previously completed series, ~Multiplayer~, which in spite of the name unfortunately it does not provide the online option, but the simple game of up to four challengers, in two at the same time in split-screen, taking turns if more, with the possibility in this case to compare the respective scores and times at the end of the three/four ran to determine the winner. To conclude the poker of options there is ~Driver details~, where it is possible to monitor everything concerning our performance in the game, from the Prizes won (cars, movies) to the Shortcuts discovered, passing through the classic Trophies. From a purely graphic point of view, BD is decidedly very well packaged. The engine, the famous Renderware (the same seen in games like Pes 2 or the previous Burnouts), does its job very well, so much so that the EA title is visually very beautiful. Of course, we are not at the level of the GT series, but everything has been studied down to the smallest detail, from the cars to the designn of the tracks, varied (settings such as hills, suburban roads, towns) and quite detailed, up to the ~special~ effects such as explosions or the ~matrix~ effect during the Takedowns. All without affecting the fluidity of the game and the sense of speed that is essential in this genre of arcade. As far as the audio sector is concerned, even in this chapter of the saga the sound is confirmed to be of a good level, with noises (roar of engines, skids, twisted metal) and well-crafted music. We particularly liked the soundtrack and at the start of the race you will often lose a few more seconds before the start looking for your favorite song to use as background, thanks to the L2 key. Comment Burnout Dominator is undoubtedly a worthy conclusion to the series on PS2. With a gameplay much more similar to Burnout 3: Takedown than to the last Burnout Revenge, and a valid audio/graphic sector, the last episode of the series manages to conquer the gamer with its good playability, the action and the degree of adrenaline-pumping fun that it manages to give. However, we expect a turning point in the series in the next chapter, something in the series begins to creak. Pros: Very entertaining and spectacular. Graphics and sound ok. 50/60Hz selector. Cons: Some races too difficult. Crash mode is missing. The Burnout series has always been considered synonymous with ~arcade~ and entertainment in the videogame field, obviously referring to driving games. Especially on PS2 where the EA title boasts a vast array of admirers. Waiting to see a new episode on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, the latest chapter of the saga is presented in local shops full of novelties but at the same time with a reference to tradition that never hurts, and an unusual philosophical inspiration to Kah Ra Shin . Naturally we are talking about Burnout Dominator, a game whose development was handled by an internal team of EA, which has focused a lot of its work on the frenetic aspect of the races, speed, as well as that of accidents and impacts. Let's say right away that the game mechanics, broadly speaking, more or less faithfully follow that of the previous Burnouts. In fact, it is about participating in car races in which unfair and risky actions are rewarded. After all, the concept of Burnout Dominator is simple and clear: play dirty, drive recklessly and act without rules.", "date": "2007-04-04", "grade": null}
