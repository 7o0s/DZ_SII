Distinguished by an increasing degree of difficulty, these three chapters are in turn composed of a variable number of ~scenario~-style events, for a total of over two hundred challenges. In the guise of an anonymous driver, from time to time we will find ourselves having to take an ~exam~ to join the Ferrari team, set certain times on the track, overtake our opponents with a handful of laps available and make improbable comebacks, the all by putting us at the wheel of different cars: from the 125 S of the 1940s to the 250 Testa Rossa of the late 1950s, from the 330 P4 Berlinetta of 1967 to the F40 of 1987, ending up aboard the famous Testarossa (1984), F355 Challenge (1995), Enzo (2002), and even the latest versions of the Formula 1 single-seater. From the point of view of the offer, there are no doubts about the completeness of Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends, which will delight Ferrari fans with its fifty cars. The speech on the success of the operation in purely qualitative terms is different, given that right from the start the game structure does not put in place any solution capable of increasing involvement: we are simply offered a series of events to be completed successfully, in in an aseptic way, without the possibility of customizing anything or making sense of the experience that goes beyond the three or four lines in English that the technicians from the garage will make to encourage us to give our best, warn us that there are only a few laps left to go at the end of the race and maybe congratulate on achievement of a goal. What you have you have to earn The big problem with Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends is that it is a ~career-centric~ product, i.e. the career not only represents its fulcrum, but it is also preparatory to unlocking cars and circuits that can be accessed in the fast race mode , in time attacks and even in competitive online multiplayer. In short, without completing it it is not possible in any way to enjoy the generous numbers of this title, and this will give you quite a few headaches because, on closer inspection, only the challenges of the ~Gold~ category have an affordable degree of difficulty, while the others require a decidedly ~hardcore~ commitment, far from an arcade-type approach. And speaking of approach, in the game we have three different driving styles available: beginner, normal and pro. The first integrates any type of assistance: from displaying the trajectories to assisted braking, passing through the various anti-lock and anti-spin systems; the normal setting constitutes the best compromise, in the sense that we have almost complete control of the car, in terms of braking and cornering, but at the same time we are given the possibility of avoiding the occurrence of continuous spins due to a lack of management of the grips; finally, pro style means turning off any help. Attention: tackling the races by selecting the ~normal~ style does not mean preventing the car from skidding and going off the track, on the contrary, from this point of view, the intentions of the developers appear very clear as it is never possible to complete a race in style Gran Turismo, or bouncing against opponents to compensate for an inattention. Colliding with another vehicle almost always results in a more than plausible accident and the loss of precious time which, which will force us to restart the event rather than pressing the Select key for automatic return to the track, this procedure too disadvantageous when the laps available are few. Xbox 360 goals Test Drive: Ferrari Racing Legends dispenses its forty-five Objectives, for a total of 1000 G, dividing them into two large groups: on the one hand those of 10 G, which are obtained by completing the simplest tasks, such as completing every single event; on the other hand those of 60, 80 and even 100 G, obtainable by reaching the end of the three eras that make up the career mode and climbing the rankings to become real legends. Running with a knife between your teeth In short, those who expected an accessible driving game like the two Test Drive Unlimited signed by Eden Games will be surprised by the necessary attemptsre to obtain the required time in the more advanced races, which will really take place in an atmosphere of great tension, since we will not be forgiven for even the slightest mistake. Despite this, it is difficult to define Ferrari Racing Legends as a real simulation, given that the fine adjustments that have always characterized this type of product are missing, and which perhaps would have made it possible to limit the oversteer with which we will have to deal so many times . The speech on the artificial intelligence of the opponents is different, well above the average: instead of following the usual pattern also seen in many noble productions, i.e. staying glued to the ideal trajectory without ever making a mistake or a flaw, the other drivers will produce themselves in skidded when put under pressure, they will sometimes try to hinder our overtaking by moving suddenly and will also end up colliding with each other, creating situations capable of making the challenges at least a minimum varied. As far as the technical sector is concerned, the excellent design of the cars, faithfully reproduced down to the details of the passenger compartment (one of the four views available), contrasts with rather dull scenarios, decidedly not very ~alive~ and worthy of note. The Madness Engine, the same seen in Shift 2: Unleashed, manages to manage the graphics by minimizing the frame rate drops and thus maintaining the thirty frames per second in most moments, which is certainly good for fluidity of the experience. Finally, the sound effects are excellent, especially the rumbles of the various cars.", "date": "2012-07-09", "grade": "6.2"}
