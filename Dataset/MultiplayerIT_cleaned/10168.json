One of the major criticisms that have been leveled at Capcom concerns the evident transformation imposed on the game which, if in the previous chapter involved more the structure of the gameplay itself, in the fifth chapter it pursued an evolution that led to a distortion of settings and atmospheres , considered by many to be very distant from those that characterized the first chapters of the survival horror par excellence. One can argue about the legitimate need to rejuvenate an evidently stale structure and to propose new experiences in step with the times, but the enthusiast loves certain characteristic woodiness of Resident Evil, he even comes to regret the presence of fixed cameras and the animation of the door that opens to cover the loading times of each room, and while the fourth chapter tried in some ways to act as a bridge between the ancient atmospheres and something new on the horizon, with the fifth the true fans found themselves somewhat lost. On the other hand, Capcom is a company that cares deeply about enthusiasts and traditions, despite being one of the most innovative publishers on the Japanese scene. So here is the ingenious idea: to exploit the consolidated DLC system to offer a real homage to the first chapter of the series, built on the very modern graphic system of the fifth chapter but characterized by the suggestions and atmospheres that made the original a classic of the gaming history. The result is this Nightmare Without Exit, an expansion that manages to capture the classic essence under the new cosmetics, while only managing up to a certain point in the task of fully satisfying the user, with a somewhat ephemeral though low cost. Curiosity To complete the nostalgia operation, Capcom has inserted a cheat to unlock the ~classic camera~ in this DLC. Interacting with the mansion's front door multiple times will eventually cause a ~?~ to appear. Pressing the key next to the question mark again, the framing will change and instead of placing itself behind the character we will find the historical fixed shots of the first chapters. Return to the villa The episode in question, according to reports from Capcom, had originally been thought of as an integral part of the main game, then eliminated for various reasons, including the need not to change the identity of the partner in order to give greater consistency to the game experience of player 2, in addition to the usual reasons of time and budget that we can imagine and which lead more and more often, in recent years, to operations of this type. In any case, the story fits perfectly into the background of the fifth chapter, covering a previous episode that was originally only mentioned in a dialogue between Chris and Sheva. We are in 2006 and the historic couple made up of Chris and Jill find themselves investigating the huge Victorian villa of the Spencers, sent by the BSAA on the strange experiments that seem to take place in the gloomy mansion. The villa is not the same as in the first chapter but a sort of duplicate: from the main hall to the general layout of the rooms, everything has been placed in such a way as to make the nostalgic strings of longtime players resonate. It's not just about the atmosphere and settings: the cadenced and lingering rhythm especially at the beginning, the arrangement of the classic ~thrilling moments~ (breaking glass, falling corpses from above, noises) and the presence of puzzles , up to the very opening of the doors to enter the various rooms, are all self-referential homages that will delight Resident Evil traditionalists. Obviously, the setting and the structure of the game remain the same as the main chapter, with their strengths and weaknesses, as well as the puzzles remain quite simple in line with those present in the main package. Even the enemies present are not very numerous: the introduction of new types of monsters with consequent new methods of approach is appreciated, but in essence it is only a couple of creatures that are repeated during the episode. Longevity is the major weakness of this DLC, amounting to just over an hour of play, a duration that however seems rightly proportionate to the price to pay for the download, or 400 Microsoft Points. Obviously, as happened in Resident Evil 5, also here the use in cooperatives with another player is highly recommended, the only situation in which it is possable to fully enjoy the gameplay built by Capcom. Xbox 360 goals Few objectives in this round: Nightmare Without Exit includes 5 objectives for a total of 100 points to collect, unlockable with the conclusion of the chapter at higher difficulty levels, with the collection of symbols scattered throughout the level and the achievement of a particular result during a clash that we are not here to reveal. From the savannah to the Victorian house The additional package is completed with the introduction of a new game mode, called ~Mercenaries Collection~, in which we find ourselves facing 8 levels in sequence with a setting similar to that of the normal Mercenaries option present in the original offer. Old acquaintance Berry Burton and the charming Excella Gionne are the two fighters available for this timed carnage, with the possibility of unlocking more later. The presence of online rankings exponentially increases the charm of this mode and the chances of returning to it once the various levels available have been completed, although it essentially offers little new compared to the original Mercenaries. Nightmare Without Exit fits perfectly into the context of Resident Evil 5, both as a missing piece of history finally explored in the right way, and as a technical realization, being packaged with the same care with which the chapter to which it belongs was built. The graphics sector is exactly what we would have expected from a ~next gen~ episode of the series inserted in the original settings, as well as the sound accompaniment. The weak point is to be found, as already mentioned, in the brevity of the story and in a level design that could have been richer in situations, between enemies and puzzles that are now a rather pale memory of those that characterized the first chapters. Given the return to the atmospheres and cadenced rhythms of the first chapter, we would have gladly also found a few more puzzles or some different situation in which the interaction does not necessarily have to take place with gunfire. However, this episode cannot be judged negatively, which demonstrates a very good approach by Capcom to the principle of the DLC, after the somewhat uncertain results of the ~Versus~.", "date": "2010-03-03", "grade": "7.5"}
