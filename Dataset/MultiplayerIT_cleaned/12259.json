{"name": "Indovina chi? - Mobile Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/indovina-chi-mobile-edition.html", "text": "In most cases, mobile video games must meet fundamental requirements: they must be immediate, usable for a short time and in any situation, but also engaging enough to make use of them. With this in mind, transforming a classic board game into a video game for mobile devices is an appropriate choice from every point of view, even more so if its structure is well suited to the technological reality of today's terminals. ~Guess who?~ it was played with a ~case~ that opened and had tiles that could be lowered, divided into two opposing groups: the player could look at his own but not those of his opponent, as it is obvious. On each tile there was the face of a character, with marked features so that it was intuitive to exclude or include him among the ~suspects~. In fact, each player is initially assigned a character and it is up to the opponent to find out who it is, using his turn to ask questions about his gender, physical appearance and possessed accessories. As you discard tiles that don't match the description, the circle of suspects narrows and finally you can try to make the name of the character to guess. Obviously, the winner is the first to discover the identity of the character hidden by the opponent. How to put all those cards in a cell phone? This was probably the biggest headache that LemonQuest was faced with, solving the question in the most intuitive way: your group of characters can be viewed by scrolling with the joystick of the mobile phone (or the corresponding number keys), and it is possible to cover or uncover each tile by pressing the FIRE button (or key 5). Of course, it is a much less ~visual~ approach than the original board game, in which with a glance you could check all the faces and discard the non-matching ones, but a little practice is enough to make it possible to move confidently between faces and avoid forgetting anyone. When our turn comes, we can therefore follow the classic procedure of ~Guess who?~, selecting a question among the many available and then discarding tiles once we have obtained an answer. Then it's up to the CPU to ask us a question and narrow down the number of suspects, until it comes to declaring the name of the mysterious character: whoever does it first wins. Guess who? - Mobile Edition allows us to play alone or with a friend (via bluetooth). In the first case, it is possible to choose the number of rounds of the game and subsequently access an advanced difficulty level. On a technical level, the game is presented in the best way: the graphics reproduce the various characters in great detail, and the interface translates our inputs quickly, without waiting between one phase of the game and another. It's a pity that the sound doesn't have the same strengths, as it boils down to rather repetitive and annoying music, which generally tends to mute on startup. The game is fully translated into Italian, making it truly accessible to everyone.
