Sony's Japan Studio title is essentially a sort of driving game, in which Move in hand, we are required to get to the end of the course, dodging cars, mopeds and a whole series of objects that fall on the road, avoiding attacks of the mobsters, all within a limited time and with a limited amount of lives. Do I jump or accelerate? The new Sony peripheral is exploited in every way: to accelerate you move the Move up and down, to jump it is given a quick stroke up, for the turbo, a deep thrust forward and to go left and right. .well you move it left and right! To all these movements are added the roundhouse kicks with the Move key, the ~low dodge~ with the stick trigger, while X and O are used to move sideways. A handy tutorial teaches us how to dexterify ourselves with all these movements to be memorized, but a couple of runs are enough to understand that some choices made are not exactly spot on. Having set the acceleration and the jump with very similar movements in fact makes us make gross mistakes in the game and moreover, moving quickly up and down to gain speed quickly becomes tiring and tiring. Secondly the Havok physics engine does a good job of realistically dropping and rolling objects such as crates, bins, various fruits and so on, too bad that what once seems not to be an obstacle the next time, rather coincidentally becomes one forced stop that makes us lose a life, all for no apparent reason. Even attacks on yakuza suffer from the same problem. Timing should be key both in avoiding the ones with the long sticks and kicking everyone else in the face. Unfortunately, the detection of our actions is not always precise, and we find ourselves thrown to the ground for no reason, with the conviction that we have easily overcome the human obstacle. There are not only flaws in the title of the Japanese software house, but also some good ideas. First of all, the various city tracks, although in fact very similar to each other, are full of crossroads and alternative routes, and invite you to replay the same area several times in search of the best evaluation, taking new roads and alleys, secondly to reaching of particular results we will unlock new ~cars~ such as the already mentioned little horse, or like a stroller or a very dirty shopping trolley, each with different characteristics of mobility, speed and resistance to shocks, it will therefore be up to us to decide what to ride according to our style of guide. A broken chair The technical aspect is rather good, the Japanese graphics have certainly done a good job in building small portions of well-detailed cities full of objects ready to make us fall to the ground, all embellished by very comical animations of the protagonist Tobyn whenever he ends up crashing face against something. So what about this Kung Fu Rider? It's a pity that a potentially very funny idea has been in some ways completely ruined by a confusing implementation of the commands on the Move. Despite a certain basic repetitiveness, Kung Fu Rider still manages to entertain, at least in the early stages, even if in the long run, between the imprecision of the controls and that of the collisions, there is a serious risk that the game could be set aside for something perhaps more limited, but more functional and responsive.", "date": "2010-10-05", "grade": null}
