{"name": "Power Stone 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/power-stone-2.html", "text": "Game modes The game comes with an introduction that is actually below the standards we are used to and does not represent one of the strong points of the game. Once on the main screen, we are slightly uncomfortable in front of all the modes available to us: 1-on-1, Arcade, Original, Adventure, Item Shop, Game Option, Extra Option and obviously SaveLoad. All these options fully reflect what the fun will be. In fact, each of these modalities differs from the others and each forms a piece of the splendid final mosaic. Apart from Game Option and Arcade (which still brings some novelties), we find ourselves displaced in front of the other choices. I will therefore analyze each of them one by one, including Arcade mode: Arcade: As in the best tradition of fighting games, by choosing this option you will face an interactive course against three computer-controlled opponents. The game determines how many competitors must remain alive and periodically you will encounter bosses. Once an arena is completed, you will often have to face some very fun platform-like sections. 1-on-1: playing in this mode you will face a path very similar to the one presented in the Arcade mode, therefore after completing a stage you can choose the next one between the two proposed. However, unlike the Arcade Mode, the challengers in each arena will not be four but two. Original: in this case you can challenge up to a maximum of three friends or three computer-controlled opponents for breathtaking challenges. Adventure: similar to 1-on-1, this mode also allows you to win items to sell and money to spend at the Item Shop. Item Shop: by entering this virtual shop you learn about the whole story behind the game, you can buy and sell items, mix them and try them on your favorite character. Extra Option: in this section you can change the parameters relating to the Adventure Mode. 1 on 1??? Power Stone 2 is full of innovations compared to both normal fighting games and its predecessor: not only game modes have been added, but also new locations (all highly destructible) and new characters (Gourmand, Accel, Julia, Pete and two secrets) . All to give great entertainment to the player. The graphics of the game have also been revised: the backgrounds are better than the first chapter, with excellent quality textures and obviously completely polygonal. The effects such as dynamic lights, water, smoke and fog are also good. A slightly less enthusiastic note should be reserved for the characters, who give the idea of being more cuboidal than those of the first episode, and above all composed of fewer polygons. However, this is not very serious, given the size of the characters inside the arenas. Unfortunately, however, one often has (especially in the Arcade mode) the feeling that everything is too confusing. The sound is at acceptable levels. It is certainly not one of the best heard so far but it performs its task with dignity. The music is nice and the sound effects are quite well done, especially those of some weapons such as the machine gun or the shattered crates. What's left for me to say? Longevity is guaranteed by the many modes available and by the well-calibrated difficulty level, but sometimes the enthusiasm is dampened by an impression of chaos. However, the game remains a decidedly fun title and I would recommend it to all those who want a bit of healthy action and don't want to learn dozens and dozens of moves that they will never use. 1 on 1??? PROS: Guaranteed fun Many game modes Good level graphics CONS: Sometimes too confusing Sound not at the highest level 1 year ago... It has been over a year since the first Power Stone made its appearance. The game in question was one of the most beautiful released for DC, both for its captivating graphics and for the incredible fun it offered. However, the title was not much appreciated by fighting game purists due to its out-of-the-ordinary playability, for many too confusing and not very reflective of the true spirit of this genre. After more than 12 months, Capcom has decided to revive this style of fighting game with a new and exciting sequel.", "date": "2000-10-16", "grade": null}
