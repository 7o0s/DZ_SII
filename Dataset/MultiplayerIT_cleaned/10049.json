The Yokohama-based software house has in fact developed an impressive series of beat'em ups among which all the episodes of the Guilty Gear series stand out, but also the spectacular Hokuto no Ken on Playstation 2 and the recent Battle Fantasia. It is not, therefore, a developer particularly inclined to follow the recent invasion of the market of titles suitable for beginners and neophytes, but rather, with their latest creation Blazblue: Calamity Trigger they confirm that they love, or at least have an eye towards all that slice of the public still passionate and anchored to the traditional values of video games, those grown up on bread and cabinets, so to speak. Blazblue: Calamity Trigger is a classic two-dimensional fighting match game, but made with a very effective style mixed between high definition 2D characters and three-dimensional backgrounds. The fusion between the fighters and the surrounding environment is perfectly successful thanks to an always uniform and coherent drawing style, Blazblue is a real orgy of sprites, colors and effects that follow one another on the screen. What is most surprising, however, is the work done on the battle system of this apparently simple game to learn, but decidedly profound to be properly tamed. The right compromise In Blazblue: Calamity Trigger the pad is used in such an intelligent way that it can be tamed immediately by any newbie to the genre. The secrets of the combat system, however, are well hidden in the game code and it takes hard training to be able to find them and make them your own. Only four keys are used, which can be mapped at will on the joypad: A, B, C and D. The latter is devoted to performing the ~Drive~ moves, translated: ~how to make a big mess and put on a show, intimidating the opponent, pressing a measly button~, while the other three are used for light, medium and heavy attacks. Great emphasis has been placed on aerial moves, which the game makes heavy use of on all characters. The directional cross (but the arcade stick is definitely preferable) is aimed at the movements of the character, the jumps and the parries. Under the basic commands, however, other much more complex ones are hidden. For example, by pressing A, B and C at the same time we can perform a Rapid Cancel which interrupts any move we were previously executing to give us the possibility to change strategy (make a block, a combo, an aerial). This technique momentarily drains the Heat gauge, which has Street Fighter, KOF or Guilty Gear's Super, Power or Tension in its equivalent. This ~extra power~ must be used to create the destructive Distortion Drives (particularly complex attacks) and the Astral Finishers which have the characteristic of making the opponent die instantly, almost a sort of ~Fatality~ a la Mortal Kombat . The peculiarity of this combat system lies in being able to entertain both those who have never tried a game of this genre (in this case they will use the main commands), and hardcore players, who in this case will soon be able to master combos and super more complex. The roster of characters present in Blazblue: Calamity Trigger consists of only 12 fighters divided between humans, hybrids and deformed blobs without consistency. Where the choice to limit the number of selectable characters may appear as a sort of lack of effort, after a few games you realize how perfectly balanced they are with each other, a detail of no small importance in a match-based fighting game that can be also play online. The protagonists are heavily inspired by Guilty Gear, but rather than appearing as clones, one gets the impression of being faced with the natural evolution of the same. All the characters have a great personality due to the masterful skill of the character designer who has been able to make them all different and unique, even if stylistically close. It seems that ARC System Works has put all its experience and background into the game trying to create the perfect 2D fighting game, starting from the origins (the ~perfect~ Street Fighter 2 had just 12 characters), mixing it with a lean combat system and modern in a graphic setting with a contemporary look. Modes and customization In addition to special moves such as Drives and Astrals, each character has the ability to perform custom moves that are completely unique to the rest of the roster. For example, Carl can command his puppet Nirvana, Rachel has the wind in her favor, still others use sticks or secondary weapons. This factor infuses even more depth to the gameplay and thus lengthens the already fairly high learning curve. Furthermore, each character has its own personal story that unfolds through the fights in the story mode, thanks to countless skits recited in Japanese and well translated with Italian subtitles. Although these stories may appear nonsense or in any case not very influential for the purposes of pure action, they represent a sort of pleasant background for all those who want to deepen the psychology and characterization of their favorite characters. The sketches are many and there are countless crossroads in which we are called to decide how to continue the dialogues. To complete the story of a fighter 100%, it is necessary to go through every crossroads that the narrative puts in front of us. In addition to this mode there is, of course, also a classic Arcade option that simulates the mechanics of an arcade cabinet, Score Attack, Training and the excellent Replay Theater that allows us to watch all the saved matches among those we have faced , or downloaded from the world rankings. Obviously, great importance has been given to the multiplayer sector, with many customization options both offline and online, in which Blazblue: Calamity Trigger performs very well thanks to the absence of obvious lag during matches. In every game session, including those against very distant opponents, no obvious signs of latency or errors due to the apparently amazing netcode were appreciated. To appreciate the ~hidden~ selection of the character that does not allow the opponent to be able to choose after seeing who we select. These are the small details that make the difference. Each mode works perfectly and is full of small details and options (transparency and position of the game HUD, speed of dialogues, etc.) which shows how much love and dedication ARC System Works has placed in their latest creature. Xbox 360 goals Of the 1000 points available for BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger, 780 are obtained by playing solo, the others necessarily on Xbox Live. They are not particularly difficult, except for one in particular, but they will require at least 25 hours of play to get to the full loot. In short, there is to sweat. Long live fighting games The three-dimensional backgrounds of the Blazblue stages are full of details and animated scenes that make them a real feast for the eyes, thanks also to the choreographed introductions that present the characters on screen. The latter, also in high definition, are very detailed and animated with a massive amount of drawings and movements. Wonderful, for example, is Rachel's stage which contains a sea of rose petals that move and shift as we pass. If we really want to find some nit-picking, we can say that not all stages ~blend~ well with the characters and they sometimes suffer from too many jaggies. The audio sector is made up of excellent music and effects, supported by a very large amount of well-acted Japanese speech and subtitled in our language. Blazblue: Calamity Trigger does not lack in any aspect, indeed excelling in many fundamentals for a fighting game: playability, immediacy and depth make it one of the best 2D fighting games ever, marking the rebirth of ARC System Works and the definitive one of this genre which until not long ago it seemed destined for the margins of retogaming.
