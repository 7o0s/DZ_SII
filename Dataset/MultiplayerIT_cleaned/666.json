{"name": "Tony Hawk's American Wasteland", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tony-hawks-american-wasteland.html", "text": "The main mode of Tony Hawk's American Wasteland is the Story mode which obviously focuses on our character, an anonymous skater from the Midwest who decides to leave Los Angeles in search of a place where it is possible to skate freely all together. The idea works until we meet Mindy, who will practically become our tutor from then on, when we will be catapulted into an adventure that will take us around Los Angeles far and wide, changing our style and clothing, completing new objectives and above all learning new evolutions. It will be very important to maintain the right relationship with the group of local skaters that we will meet and with their meeting point, the Skate Ranch. The first time we arrive at the Skate Ranch it will seem particularly bare and uncared for, but many missions focus on gaining new buildings to beautify and improve the Ranch, until it is full of ramps and obstacles to overcome, like a real training ground . Initially our skater will not be able to perform any evolution, not even the simplest, but wandering through the alleys of Los Angeles and taking advantage of the excellent control system we will quickly learn even the craziest and most difficult tricks. The novelty introduced in this American Wasteland is the possibility of performing evolutions even on foot and riding a BMX. If walking isn't particularly captivating, we can still learn some wall climb moves, on the contrary using BMXs can be a valid alternative to the board with wheels. The controls are also well studied in this case, with the left analog to control the bike, the right for the evolutions and a button to pedal. Some missions will put us to the test with the BMXs and it will be essential to overcome them to advance in the game and earn the very useful cash rewards to customize our look. Taking advantage of the excellent control system we will learn to perform even the craziest and most difficult numbers in a short time When presenting the title, the comparison with Rockstar's GTA was used, obviously not for the similarity between the missions and the type of game, but for the possibility of roaming freely around the city without interruptions, the now famous free roaming, without loading and recovering missions in the most diverse places. In reality, after thoroughly testing the Activision title, we can undoubtedly admit that the comparison is certainly exaggerated. Indeed, in Tony Hawk's American Wasteland the city of Los Angeles is divided into small neighborhoods in which in fact we will move freely, but to move from one area to another we will cross connecting areas that respond exclusively to the need to allow the loading of the area next to our console. However, no loading will be visible and we will be able to take advantage of these areas, almost always full of ramps and buildings, to perfect our jumps and our grinds. If in GTA then even the simplest missions require a certain application and often we have to wander in search of the objective, in the Story mode of the Activision title we will almost always be placed in front of the mission to be accomplished, in an all too obvious way and often we will reach the required results without much effort. In addition to the Story mode there is the Classic mode in which we will find some of the most famous levels of past games a little rearranged and reworked, the feeling remains the same, with a little nostalgia and some small twists when we notice the small changes made by the developers.. Technically, the Activision game is absolutely enjoyable, with good polygonal models, excellent animations and with a game engine that is not affected by intricate situations at all and maintains a constant frame rate. The levels are not excessively large, on the contrary, but are treated in detail. On the online gaming front, we recall that this possibility can be exploited by up to eight players both via Xbox live and Sony's online service, unfortunately as always nothing to do for Nintendo users. The online game is very fun, it is divided into several modes: score-based challenges, capture the flag, goal attack, firefight, graffiti and mambo combo. All modes are fun even if some lead to having to change the canonical approach to the game, such as capture the flag and graffiti. The game turns into a crazy first person shooter in the firefight mode, where each player can shoot fireballs from their skateboard. Unfortunately, during the online game we realized that it is not possible to use the skater we created in Story Mode in any way, a truly inexplicable choice on the part of the player.the developers. All three versions support the game in split screen which with this year's edition has been enriched by the cooperative mode, excellent news for lovers of grind in company without the possibility of playing online. The three versions are practically identical, the one that technically suffers a little more is the PlayStation 2 which, however, recovers the ~visual disadvantage~ thanks to the excellent use of the joypad. There is little to add, the Tony Hawk saga is perfect for the Sony joypad. On the online gaming front, as always, unfortunately the Gamecube remains dry while both on Xbox and on PS2 we had fun without too many problems. Comment Tony Hawk's American Wasteland is certainly the best skateboard game available at the moment, of course it has some small flaws and the much-vaunted free roaming has only been partially introduced, however you will not find another game capable of recreating the same feeling with the skateboard . We were very impressed by the care dedicated by the developers to the plot of the game, which in this chapter of the series is better orchestrated even if sometimes too obvious, placing us in front of goals that are a little too simple. Good news also from the online front, quite accurate and with different methods capable of certainly giving many hours of fun in company. If you feel like skateboarding then this Christmas do not miss Tony Hawk's American Wasteland. Pro Story mode very well orchestrated Technically valuable Online game and split screen in cooperatives Cons Missions often too simple Game mechanics unchanged Free roaming only partially The alliance between Neversoft and Activision has recently churned out the seventh chapter of the series dedicated to the almost undisputed King of the skateboard, Tony Hawk. This seventh chapter, released for Xbox PlayStation 2 and Gamecube, promises to follow the line drawn by the previous two episodes, less focused on considering skateboarding as an extreme sport, but rather on inserting the lovers of evolutions with the board.", "date": "2005-12-28", "grade": null}
