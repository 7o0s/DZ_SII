The impression that the title was in the pipeline has been confirmed as correct, given that, in terms of disk space , the weight of the download remained almost unchanged. Brief summary for newcomers to the genre: Supercross is the stars and stripes relative of the more orthodox Motocross (to which Milestone dedicates another franchise, MXGP). The two series differ mainly in the attention to the public which is privileged (obviously) in the US variant. The tracks are therefore obtained inside stadiums or arenas, with the stands positioned a few meters from the centaurs; the bumps are also much more frequent and guarantee a show in some ways similar to that of freestyle. The bikes are divided into two categories according to the engine capacity: the 250cc are the less powerful ones, while the premier class is represented by the 450cc. The latter's championship runs throughout the U.S.A., while the 250cc championship branches out between the West and East Coasts, which share only a couple of events. Rich menu The offer for single player is rich: in addition to the classic championship (the official license guarantees all the tracks and drivers of the season that began a few days ago), single race and time attack, as usual, the career is the master. We start with a first test at the end of which, based on the placement, we receive offers from some teams; once sponsors and bikes have been chosen, we start with the quarter-litre category. The score deriving from the placements (and from the cleanliness of the guide) is transformed into prestige points to be spent to intervene both on an aesthetic and technical level. Between one official race and another there is the possibility of taking on private tests which provide a further chance to accumulate experience. Both the Compound, a famous free roaming area, and the Sfide deserve a mention. The first is as distant as possible from the Supercross philosophy: here you can indulge yourself in a vast area where you can reach speeds that are almost never reached during traditional tests; the second involves a series of skill tests that unlock exclusive gadgets. Moving on to the multiplayer offer, Milestone's racing offers, in addition to the classic internet races, the unprecedented Elimination, in which points are awarded based on the positioning of the players at the end of a series of countdowns, with the last classified starts from first position in the following round. Then there are Treasure Hunt and Checkpoint, along the lines of what we have seen in the past, which are set in the Compound and which represent a pleasant variation on the theme. For the first time the game runs on dedicated servers and the difference is evident: the search for lobbies is fast and lag-free, even if our judgments are conditioned by the fact that the tests were carried out in a period in which the title it was still available to the general public. The customization of the avatar is thorough (the possibility of creating female pilots has also been added), especially as regards outfits and accessories. The track editor could not be missing with the possibility of sharing your creations on Steam Workshop. Foolproof computer The difficulty level of Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame 3 at times is almost prohibitive. By activating all the aids and setting the Artificial Intelligence to a minimum, in some races we were almost never able to pass the penultimate position. The problem is that the computer adjusts itself excessively to the user's level, and this happens above all in the career mode, almost as if the system wanted to prevent you from being able to reach the top step of the podium without having first upgraded the bike. Generally speaking, if you manage to take the lead and ride without making big mistakes, you can easily aim for victory, but, unfortunately, if you find yourself in the middle of the group at the first corner, the ascent becomes a worthy task. of the labors of Hercules. The opponents show considerable aggression, often forcing him to go off track or fall, and take advantage of the first wrong jump to overtake the player en masse, leaving him with no way out. The case in which you find yourself in last position is emblematic: with a regular rhythm you manage to recover the twenty-first or twentieth place with a certain ease, but once the comeback has begun, the bikes of the last in the standings start shooting fast laps until you don't go back to being a tail light. Only at that point does the frantic pace of the opponents subside and then reappear every volta that we get closer again, in a sort of Dantesque circle. Usual physics problems The difficulty rate of the Milestone title is not only due to the severity of the computer, ready to punish the slightest off-piste (even aerial!) with the repositioning on the ascent of a bump (which often involves other ruinous falls), but above all by a driving model that leaves no room for hesitation. The key to getting a good lap time is to find the right rhythm (i.e. the flow) in going over the bumps (whoops), using the right analog stick of the joypad for this purpose. This practice requires constant concentration because exiting a curve too slowly can be enough to compromise the entire following straight. What should be a challenging task is made onerous, bordering on frustration, by a physics engine that is not up to par: once again the bikes seemed too light and able to move in the air with excessive ease, forcing the player to a surgical check of the vehicle, especially when accelerating out of the hairpin bends. The management of the ~scrubs~, i.e. the folds in flight that allow you to control the bike during landing, is one of the most evident improvements, but it is not always effective. A plague that heavily afflicts Monster Energy Supercross is the software that manages collisions: sometimes it is enough to pass too close to a curb (without even touching it) to find yourself upside down, others still a slight forward inclination of the axis of the motion leads to spectacular somersaults. In hindsight, this is nothing that we had not already highlighted in the previous preview and in last year's review: in short, the improvements, albeit tangible, are not sufficient to change a driving system that would need heavier tweaks. Technique The Unreal 4 graphics engine has also been confirmed for Supercross 3: on the one hand we find greater care in the creation of the tracks, now richer in detail, and the bikes, more realistic not so much for the use of more detailed models but for the adoption of a less bright color palette. Compared to the past, the rain peeps out and wets the track, also slightly changing the driving model. Unfortunately, however, there are still too many shortcomings that need to be fixed: the terrain does not change (except in an aesthetic way) as the bikes pass, and the padding that delimits the track is put back in its place after each passage, despite the fact that often end up against. The character models are very crass, particularly with regards to the animations which almost seem to have taken a step back from last year's version. The soundtrack quickly gets boring mainly due to the limited number of tracks and the ~commentary~, present only during the start, which could very well be done without. Thus we end up leaving only the rumbles of the motorbikes active, the sampling of which is finally satisfactory.", "date": "2020-02-06", "grade": "6.0"}
