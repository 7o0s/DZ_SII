{"name": "Voice of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/voice-of-cards-the-forsaken-maiden-la-recensione.html", "text": "The Voice of Cards series represents one of the most original productions among those by Square Enix. Sometimes to propose something ~new~ it is enough to look back, or to parallel media: here it was enough to draw heavily on board games and gamebooks (or game-books, or gamebooks, depending on how you want to call them) to to create a captivating and very accessible RPG. Proof of the goodness of the operation was the positive reception, by players and critics, of the first Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars, released last October 28, 2021. Now it's time for an encore: a new chapter is here and we can finally bring you the Voice of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden review. A title that you should not underestimate not only for its mechanics, but also for the names of the artists involved: we recall at least the presence of Yoko Taro as creative director, of Keiichi Okabe (music director) and finally of Kimihiko Fujisaka (character designer). There's more: if you want, you can start your adventure in the world of Voice of Cards right from The Forsaken Maiden, given that the latter - inspiration, style and game mechanics aside - is not linked to the narrative and characters of The Isle Dragon Roars. The plot: islands and priestesses The protagonists of Voice of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden It is not necessary to expect who knows what exceptionality from the events, characters and the game world of Voice of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden. Mind you, because we are not telling you to gloss over the new release of a series, that of Voice of Cards, however fascinating and inspired: simply, the goal has never been to innovate or dare within the standardized plot offered from any GDR. Over the years, by now, we have witnessed, read, experienced everything: probably there is nothing left to invent, or almost. From this point of view, The Forsaken Maiden prefers to play it safe. The protagonists themselves respond to the idea of u200bu200bthe ~few but good~: interesting design, predictable but not trivial personal stories, a few twists here and there in the course of the story. The hero is a fisherman like many others, determined to set sail for the open sea; with him is Jeri, a girl without a voice and - it seems - also with limited memory. But Jeri's fate soon knocks on the door: she was the new priestess of the small island, the one who was supposed to protect and guide her in the delicate balance between human settlements and magical forces. Something, or someone, prevented her from fulfilling this role. But there is still hope: it will be the protagonist who will host her on his ship and guide her on the other four islands that make up the archipelago that can be visited in Voice of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden. On each of them, facing bands of monsters, the two - accompanied by a funny little monster - will meet the native priestesses, recovering (hopefully) four magical artifacts useful for saving the starting island. The entire adventure can be completed in about 20 hours, depending on how quickly the clashes will be tackled. And speaking of duels Gameplay: cards, dice, boards Voice of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden also features inhabited locations, such as this starting village It has already been said how Voice of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden draws liberally from the world of board games. The gameplay, in turn, has cards, dice and boards at its disposal. The speech is particularly interesting as regards the clashes with wild monsters, which often and willingly space out the exploration of the individual islands, even that by sea. It is not one of those games that require the construction of a deck of cards: you already have those of the three protagonists (the members of the party) and their respective attacks (going up in level unlocks new ones). It is possible to play one card per character, offensive or defensive: the damage inflicted is shown on the card itself, but there are always random factors (such as the possibility of inflicting a critical hit). Special abilities sometimes require the use of a die, thus increasing even more the feeling of being grappling with a board game or a gamebook. Finally, the mechanics linked to crystals contribute to enriching the whole: earned at each new turn, they allow you to release skills that are far more powerful than normal. Diamonds and dice are key in Voice of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden The combat system, it must be said, is more complex to explain than to master, given that it is resolved, in all respects, in a simplified and accessible version of any boardgame. We are not in the least at the levels, say, of any Slay the Spire. To enrich the RPG component, however, we take care of the characteristics of the individual monsters (they have weaknesses and are resistant to certain types of attacks) and the equipment of the protagonists, which can naturally be improved by purchasing or unlocking new objects in the course of the narrative. Do not underestimate the threat of continuous clashes with enemies: there are truly insignificant monsters, never able to pose a threat ... but try to explore the same territory to the bitter end by facing each battle, and you will soon find yourself without health points . Like a real board game Voice of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden is a board game through and through Voice of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden is in all respects a real board game; it is not idle to spend a few more words on the subject. The combat system should have convinced you about this mix, but here's another not negligible detail: the entire experience, the entire title in short, are enjoyed as if you were in front of an interactive gamebook. Suffice it to say that each explorable environment consists of a board made up of cards, and that the protagonist moves from card to card. Initially they are all covered, so that little by little the fantasy world that forms the background to the narrative is composed. The artistic direction, from this point of view, is delightful. Perhaps just a console like Nintendo Switch allows you to make the most of a similar experience in portability: moving the pawn from box to box (or from card to card) is much more sensible and intuitive on a touch screen than a pad in hand. Of course, it must also be said that the possibility of customization and replayability are completely absent; after all, Voice of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden is offered at a sensible price (about 30 euros). At the first opportunity, perhaps thanks to a small discount, you could consider making it yours.", "date": "2022-02-21", "grade": "7.2"}
