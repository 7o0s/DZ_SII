{"name": "Fade to Silence", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fade-to-silence-recensione.html", "text": "Made by Black Forest Games and produced by THQ Nordic, Fade to Silence is a rich survival adventure that aims to mix various playful elements in a single package to offer fans a varied and stimulating game context. Judging from the premises, the new title born from the German team would seem to really put a lot of irons on the fire. Will it actually be like this? Let's find out with our review of the PlayStation 4 edition. Exploration and crafting in a highly corrupted world The world of Fade to Silence is dominated by a mysterious dark and destructive force that is literally plaguing all the territories under its influence. In less than no time we find ourselves catapulted into the role of Ash, a survivor subjugated by a specter who seems to want to test him. After peeping out of the cave where the man has returned to life for the umpteenth time, the first impact with the surrounding world is brutal: nothing remains of the village where he lived with his little daughter Allie, since in the meantime the Corruption has brought the surrounding plains, forests and ridges under its control, once again throwing the world into chaos. Paradoxically Ash is also the only hope to aspire to a better future, being somehow linked to the evil entity that afflicts the game world. This quality of his allows him to intervene to purify the corrupt territories by chasing away the fearsome threat, and it is precisely from these bases that the articulated survival system of the work arises. Before proceeding further, a small premise is needed. Fade to Silence provides for the selection of two difficulty levels: by opting for the Exploration mode you can have access to infinite lives and unlimited resources, but the authentic experience is obtained only by selecting the Survival variant. In this second case the player will have to deal with a limited number of lives and the threat - actually not so remote - of permanent death. To demonstrate that the latter is the approach with which to fully enjoy the features offered by the game, only the more complex mode allows you to unlock the Trophies. Moreover, the developers have tried to make the restart from the beginning stimulating by implementing the so-called Circle of Torment, a feature that helps reduce the adversity faced during the course of the game. These upgrades can only be activated if the corruption has overwhelmed Ash returning him to the primordial stage. In these situations, you will gain access to a skill tree that will give you the opportunity to activate some advantages, such as a higher number of Flames of Hope to manage to try to stay longer in the game, the opportunity to enjoy a substantial supply of timber already stowed in the inventory even before taking the first steps on the map, and so on. Initially you barely have a shelter and you have to earn everything else one step at a time with the sweat of your brow and lots and lots of elbow grease. The singular post-apocalyptic winter in which Fade to Silence drives us makes it essential to first of all provide for the lighting of a fire in order to avoid freezing to death. Among the indicators to be monitored, however, there is also the one that indicates the level of nutrition of the character. In the more advanced stages, however, it will become essential to keep an eye on a third voice that signals the imminent attack of the village by enemy forces. In short, to be successful in Fade to Silence it is necessary first of all to provide for one's livelihood, to collect resources as much as possible and finally to do everything possible to build a safer place to take refuge when the situation suddenly becomes more difficult to master; for example when real storms begin to rage across the snowy plains capable of dropping temperatures down to -90 degrees, or when it happens to end up in the crosshairs of the pile of wreckage under the control of corruption, which moves in the skies dropping car wrecks and other objects that are quite dangerous for the player's safety. Ultimately Fade to Silence requires us to think in a very pragmatic way, to proceed in small steps, letting concreteness prevail over the inevitable risks that progression throws in our faces. Yes, because although at first glance the title created by Black Forest Games may seem very punitive and somewhat complex to manage - also by virtue of a vast range of variables to be considered - the elements to make one's stay in the game a little safer game there are. To put it another way, Fade to Silence is a tough game but it isalso a fair game, where correct strategic planning is punctually rewarded by greater stability of the game itself. Management component: a village to be preserved at the cost of living In Fade to Silence survival also passes through the construction and management of a small self-sufficient community. It starts from the normal huts to get to more and more complex structures such as the factory, the forge or the medical center. There are also tools such as boundary walls, mortars and crossbows, useful for improving one's defense capabilities. Each of these units requires the use of a certain amount of resources recoverable through exploration, and possibly the presence of allies capable of exploiting their full potential. In fact, during the game it happens to come across other survivors and you can invite them to move to your village to contribute to the cause. Each of them has specific talents, therefore it is necessary to try to create a team with varied skills to optimize the timing and production of materials. Wild territories provide a wide range of opportunities to hunt, harvest timber and mine metals, but these hot spots are quite short-lived, causing the player to push further and further from his refuge, with all the risks that this entails. In this sense, the sled plays a very important role, which can be manufactured after having tamed at least one pair of wolves. In this way it is possible to start moving around the playing area more quickly, having the advantage of storing larger quantities of resources with each new journey undertaken among the ice. As mentioned, Ash is closely linked to corruption, and therefore he is the only individual who can try to eradicate it from the game world. Precisely because of this prerogative, the map is dotted with areas to be reclaimed; to be successful you must keep in mind the dangers deriving from the presence of fearsome creatures, as well as the physical wear and tear to which the protagonist is inevitably subjected. Although in terms of survival and resource management Fade to Silence does its duty well, the title of Black Forest Games in spite of itself lends itself to several flaws. Starting from the consistency of the combat system, which tries to follow the soulslike style with meager results. Ash is able to equip only one melee weapon that can be used with a simple attack or a charged shot, while in the defensive phase he can rely on the normal parry or dodge. Alternatively, he has a bow at his disposal, useful both for hunting and for medium and long distance fights. Although the desire to make the game stimulating also from this point of view can be glimpsed, the combat system of Fade to Silence has proved to be excessively woody and not particularly stimulating to use, thanks to the lack of variety of enemies and the impossibility of activating further combinations of shots that can somehow make the approach a little more varied. Among the sore points of Fade to Silence, one cannot help but mention the graphics sector, which is really very backward when compared to the standards of contemporary productions. We also find that better could have been done also with regard to the quality of the (few) dialogues between the characters, given the presence of a multiple-answer system and a trust growth criterion that are only sketchy. Instead, we found the decision to introduce the support of an online cooperative mode for two players appreciable, which really fits perfectly in a product with this structure.", "date": "2019-04-29", "grade": "6.8"}
