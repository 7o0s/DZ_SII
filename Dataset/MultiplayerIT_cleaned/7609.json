{"name": "Ancora un altro Boom", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/123352-boom-tanks-ancora-un-altro-boom-grazie.html", "text": "Tanks are back in vogue on the videogame scene mainly thanks to World of Tanks and its global success, managing to impose the use of an extremely powerful vehicle, but also heavy and slow, on the attention of the videogame public, perhaps accustomed to decidedly faster and more adrenaline-pumping in the field of war simulations. Boom! Tanks stages a particular representation of war, consistent with the decision to base itself on this means of war: aboard a tank, we find ourselves fighting against another tank placed at a medium distance on a variable battlefield, essentially storming of blows at each other until one of them explodes. Since there are no defensive maneuvers, all we can do is hit the enemy as fast and hard as possible, trying to take less damage than the opponent in the short span of a handful of seconds. A sort of single combat on tracks or a western-style challenge in which, just as befits a traditional duel, what counts is precision and timing. While the tank moves along a pre-established trajectory within the battlefield (for a few meters, actually, considering the average duration of the battles), the player is entrusted with control of the turret, which takes place in two consecutive phases : aiming, in which we find ourselves following the opponent's movement by moving the viewfinder and aligning it in order to frame the objective, and the fire phase, during which it is necessary to touch the screen with the right timing in order to block a moving cursor as close as possible to the center of a bar, thus obtaining a bonus to the amount of damage. Basically, the actual gameplay is limited to these two short actions repeated to the bitter end, but the complex progression system enriches the game experience, offering a continuous crescendo in the level of challenge, requiring careful management of your vehicle through new purchases, upgrades and various customizations. Boom! Tanks is a game with simple gameplay but it can be hard to put away Modeling and the spirit of destruction Basically, the whole game is based on two main elements: the combat phase, to tell the truth too essential but still able to give a certain level of satisfaction in the destruction of the opponent - moreover emphasized by the excellent realization of the graphic sector in these phases - and the model maker-collector spirit that inexorably captures anyone who dedicates himself to the game for a few minutes. The gameplay experience runs out in a few seconds and does not offer varied situations, but overall it is easy to get caught up in the progressive mechanism that leads to the continuous purchase of new tanks, their extreme enhancement and customization through the meticulous management of the paint and of camouflage. Thus, you find yourself spending a lot of time in the ~garage~ arranging your tank, and then launching it in ferocious grinding sessions between the various missions that are offered to us at each game, with the possibility of tackling a sort of main campaign, a series of missions proposed on a daily basis and various other clashes focused on border defense. The whole structure fits perfectly into the organization required to make the user spend money through in-app purchases, but the positive thing is that the game is enjoyable even without spending anything, considering that it is basically free-to-play. More than the impossibility of progressing, it may be the genuine desire to ~have more~ and more quickly that makes us open the virtual wallet, because the limitations placed on the player who does not want to spend are not particularly heavy, as they can be circumvented with a bit of a wait or just committing longer. Too bad that a real story is missing and the variation on the theme is limited to the change of some scenario and the clash with increasingly stronger tanks, always proposing the same sequence of actions to be carried out, which in the long run cannot fail to be monotonous .", "date": "2013-09-20", "grade": "7.0"}
