How many ways to make war Before moving on to the field test let's see what are the game modes available in A&A. Two campaigns are available in single: in the first we will have Russian, British and American forces available alternately during the missions and there will also be troops from other countries as reinforcements and to whom we will be able to give general orders. The other will instead see us on the side of the Germans and Japanese to rout the enemy and make the iron axis triumph. In both cases, the excellent historical fidelity with which the most important battles of the Second World War have been reconstructed should be underlined: in addition to the real names of soldiers and localities, the programmers have tried to faithfully reproduce the numerical quantities of the forces in the field and also the environmental characteristics of the places of the battle. A modality therefore also very instructive in a certain sense which however suffers from an excessive similarity between the various levels, with very few variations on the theme which are always pleasing in these cases. Skipping the features of the tutorial, I draw your attention to the last two modes for the single player: the first is a powerful editor to customize the features of a scenario to your liking. The other is the more peculiar Second World War Mode. In practice it is a contamination between the board game and the videogame structure: on a board depicting the world divided into 52 territories we will be able to fight for the supremacy of our nation by relying on the automatic calculations of the CPU to decree the winner of a battle , or face off against the enemy in a real-time field battle. As in the board game there will be various management elements to take into consideration to make the final victory ours. Moving on to multiplayer, get ready for contests of up to 4 players both via LAN and with Gamespy services. The teams take to the field... After almost 3,000 characters the time has come to tell you about the more strictly playful features of A&A: after the first simple missions with the allies, the initial annotations are for a rather canonical but still well-crafted control interface which presents some of those commands that sometimes, in other titles of the genre, are regretted. An example is the ~Run~ key to order our men to continue running without taking an interest in the enemy. The sign of TimeGate Studios can be seen at the exact moment in which during a battle our troops are so clearly outnumbered that instead of letting themselves be massacred by the opposing infantry, they will withdraw as quickly as possible to wait for reinforcements capable of bending the enemy . Another element in common with the Kohan series is the generation of multiple troops and not single soldiers, which will allow much more orderly control during battles. The control interface has some of those commands that sometimes, in other titles, are regretted The programmers, also in Axis & Allies then wanted to put the emphasis again on the war component and not on the acquisition of resources. For the latter it will be sufficient to check the civilian settlements on the map without having to take on the management of mines and so on. Instead, we will have to pay more attention to the care of the construction of our base camp. For example, the ammunition and fuel depots will be essential to make our vehicles move and make offensive (air, land and sea as the tradition of the board game wants) and in addition to the accurate analysis of the elements necessary to improve our technology and production in the typical tree diagram, the possibility of demobilizing the structures before they are destroyed, will require us a rather dynamic defense as well as the decisions regarding our offensives. As it was reasonable to expect then, the 5 superpowers protagonists of the game will have decidedly unique peculiar characteristics: here are, for example, the Japanese suicide bombers ready to launch suicide attacks on the enemy as well as the reminiscence of Age of Mythology for which the ~general~ - ~hero~ who will act as our alter ego will have ~particular~ and unique powers in dealing with war situations. The war aesthetic From a technical point of view, A&A has a good three-dimensional graphics engine on its side, a good general detail and the ability to manage many elements on the screen: on certain occasions the monitor seems to be really about to explode from all that is happening in the conflict between hundreds and hundreds of men, vehicles, strongholds, turrets and so on. But unfortunatelywe also have some frame rate problems (not too performing even in non-chaotic situations) as well as a certain delay when we move around the area by pointing on the map. Two not very serious problems but which we would have gladly done without. The sound accompaniment could only take as a model the military-war epic already heard in many films and video games dedicated to the great conflict and the final result is discreet. Of the same level is the localization in Italian which also has a small peculiarity: the voices of the English soldiers are the only ones left in the original language. Who knows why then Comment The return of Axis & Allies in our hard disk made by the programmers of Timegate Studios turns out to be a good RTS whose greatest strength is given by the many different modes available and with the uniqueness of the Second World War, a sort of transposition of the board game that is so popular with those looking for something more complex than Risiko!. The Texan team then grafts what are the characteristics of their way of understanding the strategic in real time which, however, we have already appreciated in a slavish way only a few weeks ago in the second chapter of Kohan. But if the literal reconstruction of the scenarios of the most important battles of the Second World War pique your interest, then you can also turn a blind eye to a graphics engine that is not overly optimized but which allows a simultaneous display of many moving elements. Pros: Lots of game modes, the unique Second World War mode Excellent command interface Timegate Studios' innovations in the RTS Cons: ... which we had already seen in Kohan 2 Excessively heavy graphics engine The sometimes repetitive campaigns Already transposed into videogame form by Hasbro way back in 1998 (but on that occasion videoplayers found themselves faced with a direct porting of the board game), Axis & Allies returns to besiege our hard drives, a well-known brand among fans of war board games that require something more complex than the legendary Risiko!. This time it was Atari who took care of its return to PC and after the more than decent Afrika Korps vs Desert Rats, and D-Day, it inserts another RTS set in the Second World War in its catalog. The transalpine software house has decided to entrust this production to Timegate Studios, of which I have already had the pleasure of speaking to you on these pages regarding their excellent Kohan 2. We will see that the points of conjunction between the two titles will not be lacking at all.", "date": "2004-12-14", "grade": null}
