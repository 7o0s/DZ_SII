{"name": "The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-legend-of-spyro-the-eternal-night.html", "text": "The mobile division of Vivendi is confirming itself as one of the most interesting realities in the wireless gaming market. History repeats itself in the case of The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night, the last episode of a series that has already amazed on mobile phones with the reduction of A New Beginning. The strength of this production lies entirely in an avant-garde technical realization, which places the emphasis on the quality of the sprites, an element often overlooked in mobile video games for a series of technical and practical reasons. Once again we will have to take control of Spyro and go through thirteen levels full of enemies and traps, not forgetting the fight with some dangerous bosses. The structure of The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night is that of classic platformers, with the character making jumps on the platforms and has different types of attack available to get the better of his opponents, in this case he can launch shots from a distance (initially only fire, then also ice, lightning and earth...) or launch powerful buttings. The control system refers to the numeric pad more than to the joystick, given that there is a lot of difference between the jump made while walking and the one when standing with a ~pure~ diagonal, obtainable only with the numeric keys 1 and 3. We will have also the possibility of gliding to reach otherwise inaccessible areas, and from time to time we will find power-ups that for a few seconds will give us the possibility of launching an ~all-round~ special attack, capable of destroying even the most resistant obstacles. The boss fight often focuses on the normal dynamics of dodging and attacking, tending to repeat itself especially in the early stages. More than anything else, the problem is that even these clashes, with a rather rapid outcome, are counted in the total levels. Which denounces a certain brevity of the game, unfortunately. The technical realization of The Eternal Night is the strong point of the game, as mentioned above. If the sound falls within the average of mobile titles, therefore it turns out to be rather poor and essential, the graphics show a qualitative level as regards the sprites that has rarely been seen in the field of wireless gaming. The beauty is that the speech does not concern only Spyro, but also his enemies, which numerically are not very varied but which are indeed well done. The levels certainly reveal a lower commitment: they are quite meager and banal. Unfortunately, sprites of a certain type require a certain power to be ~moved~ and not to slow down (or worse) the response to the controls, therefore to make the game work at its best, you need a medium-high-end mobile phone, otherwise it is the case to lower its resolution. PRO Great sprites Solid gameplay There are also boss fights AGAINST It does not last long Very classic and banal levels Requires a powerful phone", "date": "2007-10-10", "grade": "S.V."}
