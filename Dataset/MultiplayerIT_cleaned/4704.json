It is a not too frequent phenomenon, but capable of making a title unmissable in a short time, above all thanks to word of mouth from users. Life Is Strange, by the time its fifth and final installment was released, already had a strong following that wouldn't have missed the conclusion to Max and Chloe's story for the world. Characters that no one had ever heard of until a few months before, interesting because they were adolescents, with strengths, weaknesses and above all problems of everyday life. With the addition of some super powers and the bad guy on duty. If we have to wait a little longer for a real second season, Square Enix has decided to make the wait less difficult with a three-episode package that serves as a prequel to what has been seen so far. Life Is Strange: Before The Storm debuts with the first episode Wake up, and takes a step back two years, setting aside our favorite photographer capable of rewinding time. The shot shifts to Chloe Price, her best friend. And about another person we'll tell you about shortly. Back to Arcadia Bay Welcome back to Arcadia Bay, the small town where no one wants to stay, a place linked to the saddest events of one's life. And where, at the same time, no one can leave: because it still remains home. Not even Chloe Price can leave, a rebellious and introverted sixteen-year-old who would rather end up under a moving train than relate to things, places and people in her city for another day. Anyone who played the first Life Is Strange already knows the nature of the character well, as well as the events in his life that led him to take certain attitudes against the family and the school environment. The choice of the three prequel episodes has its justification in this because: the new audience will discover for the first time environments and personalities that in the original episodes will thus already be familiar and will evolve in a coherent way; the ~old fans~ instead find in Before The Storm not only details that acquire a new meaning, but two characters too interesting not to receive a separate study, with an adventure of their own. In fact, for the first time we have the opportunity to see Rachel Amber on stage. That's right, that Rachel Amber (who needs to know, knows). The first episode of the mini-season, Wake up, tells the story of Rachel and Chloe's first meeting, during a clandestine rock concert in a barn, an event based on alcohol, drugs and ~slimy~, as Chloe calls them. Rachel comes from a wealthy family in Arcadia Bay, is the high school diva, outgoing to the point of cheek. In short, the opposite pole of a broke, taciturn and surly Chloe. But it is precisely the different that attracts, and the two will soon find themselves united by a deeper bond than expected, the only one that (perhaps) will be able to save them from the shadows that devour them from within, a product of the loneliness that unites both. Svegliati is the story of the birth of this friendship, between lights and shadows, misunderstandings and fear of being alone. Playstation 4 trophies Life Is Strange Before The Storm will enrich your showcase with 35 trophies, including the coveted platinum. Unfortunately to get it we will have to wait for the next two episodes to be released. It also seems, but the issue has yet to be clarified, that you will also need to play the bonus episode contained in the Deluxe Edition in order to unlock it. Some timid innovations We won't tell you more about the situations we found ourselves facing in the two and a half hours needed to finish the first chapter of Before The Storm. Being a third-person narrative adventure, with real cinematic sequences in which we will not have to do anything but watch (and fortunately read subtitles in Italian), the story that is told is the soul of the production. Rather than tell you what happens, which would be a crime, we will tell you how: with themes treated in a way that is never banal, avoiding easy simplifications, giving space not only to the protagonists but also to a lively and credible game world, without neglecting secondary personalities such as Chloe's mother's classmate or school friends. To enrich the player's desire for information, the possibility of reading the diary of the protagonist returns, with all her annotations, thoughts, reflections. We will also be able to take a peek at the SMS that he will exchange with family and friends, also made linguistically in an exceptional way. The first half of the episode focuses on Chloe alone, a real introductionof the main character, and then move on after the first hour of the game to the story of his friendship with Rachel. This will most likely be the central theme of the next two episodes as well. Without continuity solutions or abrupt scene jumps, wake up proceeds by alternating game phases focused on the dialogues between the characters with others based on the exploration (albeit minimal) of the surrounding environment. The most successful moments are naturally those in which the two components find a perfect balance, and which also show new gameplay solutions, exclusive to the new season. For example: We want to get into the barn to see the Firewalks underground concert, but the bouncer isn't too keen on letting a young girl through. What can we invent? Before The Storm immediately shows a greater variety of solutions to achieve the goal. First we explore the surrounding environment, we look at the objects placed here and there, we talk to all the characters. This way we also unlock new lines of dialogue to use later, once inside. Once the operation is complete, we can choose between two options: go back to the bouncer and convince him with kindness (or almost), or break into that back door and enter secretly. The actions will always have precise consequences: in the first episode it is impossible to assess their extent, but it is difficult to imagine that they end up very far from the plot established by the screenwriters. Look at me taking your word for it Among the new mechanics able to favor the variety of gameplay, the ~taunt race~ stands out. Unlike Max, Before The Storm's Chloe can't rewind time or have any superpowers of any kind at the moment. Its trump card is intimidation of opponents, in the way it does best: verbal aggression. By starting an insulting competition, a bar will appear on the screen to fill, based on how good we are in choosing the next two to three sentences that will be proposed, all before time runs out. The effectiveness of each sentence is easily understood by the aggressiveness of the words it contains, but it must also be based on the last line pronounced by the interlocutor. In our case, we convinced the bouncer we mentioned earlier to let us in by telling him that we can look after ourselves and that something unpleasant could happen to his motorbike, parked right nearby. The new mechanics, as well as the ways to continue the adventure, are all quite simple and intuitive. There are no really ~wrong~ dialogues and the environmental puzzles (if you can call them that way) are immediately solvable: just pick up that object nearby, talk to that person sitting over there, and you're done. In this perhaps Before The Storm is also more guided and simplified than the original Life Is Strange, to the benefit of the use of the story. And if you really manage to get lost, by pressing the L2 button on the controller you will discover that Chloe has written with a marker on her arm what she has to do. That is your next goal.", "date": "2017-09-01", "grade": "8.0"}
