{"name": "Front Mission 4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/front-mission-4.html", "text": "So far, so close As per tradition, the story that forms the backdrop to the events of Front Mission 4 takes place in a not too distant future, within a well-conceived international fictional political scenario. The plot unfolds through the narration of the parallel adventures of the two main protagonists, Elsa and Darril, initially engaged on the European and South American fronts, but destined to share a common mission. The plot is decidedly complex and full of characters (to the point that we reserve the right to deal with it here) and performs its job of ~gluing~ between one game scenario and another more than admirably. Note how the story manages to become absolutely engaging despite being illustrated almost exclusively through fixed screens and text boxes, an unspectacular method but still typical of the work made in Squaresoft. The main dish of Front Mission 4, needless to say, however, is mainly made up of two factors, namely the setup of wanzers and pilots and the actual battle scenario. The first of these two elements, in particular, seems to have been the major beneficiary of novelty with regard to this fourth episode of the saga. First of all, the importance of the pilots in the game economy has been expanded: the experience accumulated by the latter during the clashes can in fact be spent to acquire various skills and abilities useful for carrying out unprecedented actions on the battlefield or for increasing one's own capabilities, such as range of motion or affinity for a certain type of weapon. The large amount of choices available in this sense leaves the user with the pleasant freedom of being able to shape his own party by creating pilots with characteristics congenial to his style of play or to his needs. Even more extensive are the customization possibilities of the wanzers: beyond the accessory aspects such as name and coloring, the mechs of Front Mission 4 must be modified by the player especially in relation to the mechanical parts that compose them and the weapons to be used then in the field of battle. These various elements, which can be purchased in the appropriate shops, significantly modify the performance of the wanzers and require careful juxtaposition by the user: the physical components of the mechs (arms, torso and legs), the different types of weapons available (machine guns, rifles , missile launchers, sniper rifles, bazookas, grenade launchers and melee) plus extra parts (backpacks of different types and shields) offer different characteristics that must be carefully weighed, all with an eye to the total weight of the wanzer, which cannot exceed the power that it is capable of delivering. In short, preparing your troop for battle in the best possible way requires time and care, which strategy enthusiasts will certainly appreciate. Only people who have been on the battlefield know what I mean Once the setup work is complete, it's time to actually go down to the real game scenario and start the clashes. Front Mission 4 does not present upheavals in terms of the basic play structure, which, moreover, it would not even feel the need given its granite solidity. The scheme is therefore the classic one of strategic titles: each unit under the player's control has a certain number of AP (Action Points) which must be spent to carry out movement, attack or exploitation of special abilities actions. Instead, there are several innovations relating to the battle phase between two units: in addition to the presence of new types of weapons (each of which is characterized by different values of power, precision and range of action) and special backpacks, Front Mission 4 is enriched from the so-called Link System which allows to establish links between two or more pilots in the setup phase, which then materialize on the battlefield under the guise of mutual aid between these same units during an attack or defense action. For example, if one of your wanzer is about to hit an opponent, the presence in the vicinity of the clash of one or more units connected to this allows the execution of a collective attack that is much more harmful to the enemy. This element adds depth to an already complex title, bringing it closer to the tastes of tacticians with the finest palates but at the same time distancing it from the more common user. The various missions that make up Front Mission 4 all prove to be very engaging, even if they suffer from some defects that undermine the overall judgment, albeit not by much. In particular, the AI of the opponents is not always up to par, making enemy actions predictable and often unintelligent and greatly facilitating progress during the game for glthe smartest users. Then some ingenuities can be identified, rather than real shortcomings, such as for example the scarce use of certain weapons and special backpacks and the mechanism for choosing one of the three different types of armor of one's wanzers, which can only be selected before the battle when he is totally unaware of the offensive characteristics of his opponents. In principle, however, Front Mission 4 is able to entertain and excite anyone who is attracted by its game mechanics, while it could hardly be able to capture the attention of newbies, both because of its underlying complexity and above all because lacks a particularly flashy graphic realization. The musical accompaniment, on the other hand, is absolutely noteworthy, characterized by captivating orchestral motifs and perfectly in line with the atmosphere of the game's battles. Comment While not presenting major innovations from the point of view of gameplay nor being able to boast of a properly exciting cosmetics, Front Mission 4 does not struggle to establish itself as an excellent tactic-rpg, faithfully and precisely proposing the excellent game mechanics that have always characterized the series. Penalized exclusively by a not very brilliant AI and some conceptual ingenuity, the Squaresoft title flows away smoothly, divided between intense setup phases of the wanzers and exciting battles, all supported by an inspired and evocative soundtrack. In short, it will not be the maximum freshness, but Front Mission 4 is still a highly recommended purchase for fans of the genre. Pros: Very accurate strategic phase Exciting storyline Excellent soundtrack Cons: Not exciting AI Some defects here and there Graphics only sufficient Although it saw the light on SNES several years ago, the original Front Mission can still be considered as one of the biggest acts of meanness of a Japanese software house towards Western users. A title of exceptional quality and in some ways a forerunner of the times, Squaresoft's tactical-rpg never crossed the Japanese borders, evidently considered as unattractive to the US and European public. And this went on until the third episode, when the Front Mission series magically landed on American soil. It is easy to think that such a decision was dictated by Squaresoft's economic interest (concerning the huge installed base of PlayStation) rather than a belated ~mea culpa~ addressed to Yankee gamers, nevertheless the important thing was to be able to enjoy of the excellent Front Mission 3 in an understandable language. And history, fortunately, also repeated itself for the present Front Mission 4.", "date": "2004-12-01", "grade": null}
