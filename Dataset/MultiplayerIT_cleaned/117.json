{"name": "Gunstar Heroes", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gunstar-heroes.html", "text": "Roots The story is that of Red and Blue, two brothers ready to do anything to defend their planet Gunstar 9, beating the bosses of the game one after the other, in a succession of breathless levels, where it is often impossible to see the backdrop due to the amount of enemy fire. At the time, while not inventing any genre (indeed, freely inspired by Contra, a game they had ~lived~ in the Konami period), Treasure succeeded in just one year of development in the enterprise up to that moment which had not always been achieved by very most illustrious, to mix a horizontal scrolling shooter with a completely innovative combat system based on the conjugation of the elements, all grafted onto a good narrative plot and an absolutely convincing and fun multiplayer mode. The game structure itself was very simple: the player continued horizontally along the level hitting the enemies that incessantly appeared from all over the screen with blaster shots. The elements applicable to your weapon were of four different types, with the possibility of equipping them in two slots to be used separately (each element had its own particular fire pattern), or in pairs giving life to a completely different weapon, much more powerful and with a fusion of the characteristics of the two. The bosses represented, like the level itself, one of the best parts of the game itself, with fights based on the use of a good deal of strategy, skill and timing. The style used in the fights, the methods of using the weapons and the incessant rhythm that were born on Gunstar would have made the fortune of the Treasure of the future (becoming its true trademark), with shots in the barrel of the caliber of Silhouette Mirage, Ikaruga and above all Radiant Silvergun, to date considered by many shooter lovers to be the best ever produced. Inheritance Brought to the present day, Gunstar Heroes also seems to be equipped with that particular Treasure magic capable of making games immortal both in terms of playability and in terms of graphics. The action is always frenetic, the remote controls respond perfectly to the gaming needs and once again playing in multiplayer represents one of the funniest videogame experiences ever. Gunstar Heroes suffers a bit from the ~curse~ of the games of yesteryear, longevity: in fact, a single hour will be enough to complete the game completely. If on the one hand that of longevity could be considered a negative element, what we must forget - speaking of products of the genre - is the replayability factor, an aspect of absolute importance especially if inserted in a context such as that of posthumous console emulation. The question that needs to be asked then is: does Gunstar Heroes have the appeal necessary to be downloaded, played and replayed? The answer is yes, and if you are a shooter lover (perhaps two-dimensional) then the real answer is: absolutely yes, and 800 Wii Points are the paltry price to participate in the operation. The magic of Treasure does not fade, in a few years and we can easily talk about immortality and affix the well-deserved title of milestone. In the gaming industry it is difficult to succeed immediately, most of the time years pass before the name of a software house steps into the limelight and into the lights of success. However, there is a small group of ~phenomena~ that arrive like lightning on the market offering what for years will be considered the undisputed best. Nintendo itself is an example of this, and another fitting example could be that of Treasure: a software house founded in 1992 by a group of 20 Konami exiles and able to develop a certain ~Gunstar Heroes~ in less than a year, a game destined to mark the foundations of a genre for many years to come.", "date": "2007-02-02", "grade": null}
