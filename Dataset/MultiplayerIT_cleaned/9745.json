{"name": "Pokmon Diamante Lucente e Pokmon Perla Splendente", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pokemon-diamante-lucente-perla-splendente-recensione.html", "text": "Remakes have always been part of the DNA of Pokmon and video games in general, as evidenced by dozens of operations (successful or not) in recent years. When done right, these repropositions for many are a real godsend, capable of making the most beloved games of youth current again. Because, let's face it, if for movies or TV series this is often a purely commercial operation, as well as risky (the actors are never as good as the originals, the plot has been distorted and so on), video games have had such a sudden evolution over the years that an adaptation is often necessary to have an experience in step with the times both from a technical point of view and from that of game mechanics. Just think of the Pokmon series, moreover one of those that is always accused of immobility: despite this, cooperative online features have been introduced over the years, improvements to the game interface, new mechanics and - obviously - hundreds of new pocket monsters. The previous remakes of the Game Freak series (there are many: starting from 2004's FireRed and LeafGreen, up to the recent Pokmon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!) did just that and, also for this reason, they were highly appreciated by the public. In other words, not only had they brought the classics of the past to the platforms at that time of new generation, but in doing so they had introduced all those achievements obtained over time, from the wireless adapter to the connection with Pokmon Go and motion sensors. All things that, as we will see in the review of Pokmon Shining Diamond and Pokmon Pearl Shining, are lost in this latest remake for Nintendo Switch. Between past and future However, some scenes from Pokmon Shining Diamond and Pokmon Pearl Shining are able to amaze Let's start with a very simple concept: Pokmon Shining Diamond and Shining Pearl are two good games. Diamond and Pearl and the Sinnoh region are among the most beloved chapters, so it is not surprising that such a faithful recreation of those masterpieces is still an enjoyable experience today. The level design of the game map, with its many shortcuts and secrets, is one of the most complex in the series and the classic progression from zero to hero always works. The battle system is classic type-based, and there are nearly 500 Pokmon to catch. So what's wrong? First of all, that the games taken into consideration, faithfully to the titles, are Diamond and Pearl and not Platinum, the ~evolved~ version of these two chapters. So no Battle Park and no plot parts related to Giratina, able to give greater depth to the plot and robustness to the endgame. The second disappointment comes from the lack of strong connections with Pokmon Legends: Arceus, the ~real~ new chapter developed directly by Game Freak, arriving in the first months of 2022. Set in a Sinnoh of the past, Pokmon Legends: Arceus will tell of the legends narrated in Pokmon Shining Diamond and Pokmon Shining Pearl. For this reason it would have been nice to have a strong connection between the two (three) games arriving so soon after, in order to better introduce what seems to be the evolution of Pokmon. The news Pokmon Shining Diamond and Pokmon Pearl Shining can be found in the Great Dungeons of Pokmon not available elsewhere Without the pedigree and strength to get hands on with the original game, ILCA worked in parallel on the remake and new features. This is because Pokmon Shining Diamond and Pokmon Pearl Shining are not stingy with novelties, only that these do not seem perfectly blended with the rest of the experience. The things we liked the most are those that improve the ~quality of life~, such as the notice on the effectiveness of the moves once we have entered a Pokmon in the Pokedex, the share of experience among all Pokmon in the party (mandatory, one thing which, however, not everyone likes) or the possibility of recalling certain skills without the need to constantly have a forklift Pokmon (who said Bidoof?) always in a group. Considerably more weight is the expansion of the Great Dungeons. It is an area that can always be reached if you are outside, to be faced both alone and with other players, even online, which has become the real endgame activity (but not only) of the game. Inside these underground labyrinths it is possible to meet Pokmon that would not normally be available on the surface, such as a greater variety of fire Pokmon, exchange the stones found with powerful moves and customizations and build your own shelter, to be enriched with statues and textsgold of various kinds. All in the company of your friends or complete strangers who will be able to contribute to making the dungeons richer by completing activities and collecting special precious stones left by kind Diglett. The balancing in single is not the best, but we point out that among the treasures that can be found there are also the artifacts that allow you to summon the Legendaries of previous generations, to be used inside the Rosa Rugosa Park. These activities are accompanied by the Pokmon Competitions, the mini-game for preparing Poffins and endgame structures already available in Diamond and Pearl, such as the Battle Tower and the Hostile Mountain. One of the protagonists of Pokmon Shining Diamond and Pokmon Shining Pearl: Bidoof Very pleasant innovations, able above all to prolong the longevity of games that were already quite long in origin, but which, as mentioned, seem to have been put there in a somewhat forced and poorly amalgamated way with the rest. Going to the Great Dungeons, for example, allows you to accumulate a lot of experience and capture stronger Pokmon than necessary. The share experience facilitates the growth of the team. Always having the Moves available facilitates exploration and does not force you to sacrifice slots in the team in order to take advantage of shortcuts. In this way the progression in the game becomes much faster and in some ways less complex, allowing you to reach the end credits faster. This net of some fights, such as those with the Gym Leaders, redesigned and made even more challenging. In Pokmon Shining Diamond and Pokmon Pearl Shining, therefore, two souls seem to coexist: one strictly linked to the past and a more modern one, which however tends to break some balances of the main game. Technically speaking A snowy area in Pokmon Shining Diamond and Pokmon Shining Pearl Another topic that has made players of Pokmon Shining Diamond and Pokmon Pearl Shining discuss is the graphics sector. If you technically settle on a 1080p resolution in docked and 720p in portable mode, fixed at 30 FPS, many have not appreciated the chibi style with which the original graphics of the Nintendo DS games have been reproduced in 3D. This is perhaps the only way in which ILCA has been able to keep the secrets of level design unchanged, made up of games of perspectives and small labyrinths. What displaces a bit is the choice to make the chibi characters in the game world and then ~realistic~ in the portraits, but other than that it is the usual clean and colorful graphics, embellished by some effects, such as light, reflections and the water, truly remarkable. Excellent as always the soundtrack and the adaptation in Italian. Obviously a small change was also expected from this point of view, with the addition of some more animation or special effects, perhaps a redesign of the interface or of the Pokmon models in order to show the inflicted status effects or the possibility to skip some dialogs that slow down navigation between game menus.", "date": "2021-11-22", "grade": "7.5"}
