{"name": "Il volto del cacciatore", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/121620-bloodmasque-il-volto-del-cacciatore.html", "text": "In an alternate historical reality, where vampires control society both behind the scenes and overtly, there is only one force capable of changing all that: the Hunters Guild. On the streets of a Paris made really well thanks to the use of the powerful Unreal Engine, these brave warriors, in turn half human and half bloodsucker, roam to identify the opponents of the moment and put an end to their centenary existence once and for all . Planting a stake in his heart, of course, but not before a long fight based on combos, special moves and increasingly powerful edged weapons. Bloodmasque represents an ambitious attempt by Square Enix, which has put its best talents to work to bring a visually impactful experience to iOS devices, featuring an immersive orchestral soundtrack and a full-bodied structure, which includes dozens and dozens of items to unlock and buy, whether it's weapons, armor, upgrades or more. Published on the App Store at a certainly acceptable price, 5.99 euros, the game does not shine for the clarity of the interface, which is presented to us hastily and which therefore requires further experiments to be well assimilated, but always leaving the impression that the same things could be done with far fewer steps. Clearly the first thing you will do, once you have purchased Bloodmasque, is to try your hand at one of its most publicized features, namely the possibility of taking three photos of yourself (one for the ~normal~ expression, one for the angry one and one for the happy one) from ~paste~ on your character's face, trying to adapt the skin color to the shades available for the rest of the face, so as not to create an annoying ~I'm Hannibal Lecter, I detached the face of a guard and now I'm wearing it~ effect. We tell you right away: due to the poor quality of the front camera and, above all, the lack of a ~blurred~ area between your features and the polygonal model, obtaining a decent result will not be easy at all. The example you see on the side is quite clear, after all. However, if you want you can give up this feature and take advantage of the preset models, which also seem to be equipped with a minimum of animation. Technically splendid, Bloodmasque appears severely limited by a series of annoying stakes Bloodsucker or moneysucker? Ok, we can put our faces on the hunter, but what's the game like? The incipit is undoubtedly promising, with a series of missions that you can access and that will see you explore certain areas of Paris by day or by night (you can choose and the landscape changes substantially), looking for a character who can give you the address of a vampire to deal with. So it doesn't work like in jRPGs, the exploratory phase and the action phase are distinct and separate, there are no random fights (thank goodness, go) but at the same time the disappointment is great for a control system that on paper seems immediate but it is damn cumbersome, since it asks us to manage view and movement with a single finger, holding it down in the direction in which we want to move. If you think that in the end the only use of walking around is collecting a few bags of coins and saying hello to the other hunters, well, it goes without saying that the developers have wasted a great opportunity to add something good to their title. Not bad: after completing a mission, it becomes freely accessible from the main menu, skipping the search for the candy man entirely. So we come to the heart of the Bloodmasque gameplay, or the fights. Square Enix's idea was to take a cue from gestural fighting games like Infinity Blade, increasing the thickness on the one hand thanks to the presence of many different weapons in terms of effectiveness and special abilities, decreasing it on the other due to controls that see the attack simply deputy to the touch of the screen and the dodging independent of the type of blow received. In short, you can dodge with your left thumb and attack with your right. This type of mechanics, very basic but above all very repetitive, is broken by two things: the special move, which can be performed once the appropriate bar has been filled and results in a predetermined sequence that culminates in a quick time event; and the coup de grace, or when the stake is planted in the heart of the vampire, also determined by a quick time event. The problem, however, remains the lack of variety, of shots that are different from those usually used, of special moves that are not always the same stuff, which at a certain point obviously gets tired. But there is also a problemnow greater that afflicts this product, and concerns the stakes that the developers wanted to insert and which severely limit the experience. Firstly, to play you must necessarily be connected to the internet; secondly, starting from the second chapter the difficulty has such a boost that the newly purchased (and sweaty!) weapons prove to be more or less effective as throwing a booger (of the soft ones) against enemies, which leads us repeating quest after quest to grind or - ta dah! - to buy comfortable IAPs that make us recover vital energy or that give us extra time to finish the fight (which by default must end within three minutes, under penalty of defeat). In short, the final picture is very complex but does not bode well for Bloodmasque, which is very nice to see (everything: the scenarios, the characters, the enemies), indeed it is among the most beautiful games on the App Store in terms of graphics, but it also suffers a bit from a really too slow direction, which has to do with mobile gaming like Pierpaolo Greco with a hairstyling contest.", "date": "2013-07-30", "grade": "5.0"}
