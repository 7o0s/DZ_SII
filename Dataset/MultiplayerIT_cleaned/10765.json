{"name": "Rockstar col Wii", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ultimate-band-recensione.html", "text": "There is no doubt that rhythm games are experiencing a second youth, thanks to the trend inaugurated first by Guitar Hero and then by Rock Band: therefore it is useless to be surprised if the success of the aforementioned franchises has also been accompanied by a wave of clones and wannabe which have hardly managed to even touch the completeness of the Activision and EA productions. In light of these facts, Disney Interactive Studios has preferred to opt for a more casual approach and above all unrelated to the need to use dedicated peripherals: now let's see if Ultimate Band manages to ~rock~ even without microphones, guitars and plastic batteries. Blessed are the ultimates because they will be the primates Evidently aimed at a teenage audience, Ultimante Band follows the exploits of a group of budding musicians, who from the garage of their home aspire to become the new rock 'n' roll sensation. Little more than a gimmick to justify the performance of various songs within increasingly prestigious settings, in a manner not unlike what we saw in Guitar Hero. Instead, the setting is clearly different, starting from the design: characters that seem to have come out of an episode of Hannah Montana and songs deliberately sweetened by possible bad words or strong terms therefore make a good impression, bearers of the family-friendly philosophy typical of Disney and Nintendo worlds. De gustibus non disputandum est, but the fact is that the comparison between Ultimate Band and more ~mature~ works is absolutely against the title subject of this review: the look of the band members is inspired by the worst of the current youth trends, while the scenarios offer hackneyed situations. Leaving aside the considerations of a stylistic nature, it must however be said that Ultimate Band appears technically quite valid: the polygonal models of the musicians are convincing and well animated, while ~live~ settings and dynamic shot changes help to make their performances even more spectacular. The customization rate applicable to the four members of the group is also appreciable: through a simple editor it is possible to modify their gender, physical characteristics, clothing and equipment, not to mention that new elements can be purchased by spending the money earned with the performances in the appropriate shop. The Disney work, on the other hand (it is appropriate to say it) sticks to the musical selection: the approximately 40 tracks available are all covers sung by a male or female voice depending on the gender selected for one's frontman, which would not necessarily be a bad. Too bad that a good part of the songs are really badly interpreted, if not downright chilling as in the case of Complicated by Avril Lavigne in the male version... Remote Quartet As announced, Ultimate Band does not rely on any type of dedicated peripheral, and is therefore played simply with the conventional Remote + Nunchuck combo. For each song, the user has the option of impersonating one of four band members: guitarist, bassist, drummer and frontman. One of the most annoying defects of the Disney product starts from this approach, namely the obligation imposed on the player to repeat the same song several times by playing a different instrument in order to move on to the next stage. A hitch that can be avoided by playing with three friends at the same time, an option that not many will still have the luxury of being able to exploit frequently. In terms of pure and simple control, however, Ultimate Band alternates convincing solutions with other much less exciting ones: the battery is certainly the funniest and at the same time probable part, since it is necessary to use the Nunchuck and Remote as if they were two sticks. The guitar also gives some satisfaction, especially at more advanced difficulty levels, in which you find yourself also using the C and Z keys to select different chords, all while shaking Remote to produce a sound. The bass recycles some of these mechanics, but requires the user to tilt the Nunchuck left or right to play the various notes, a setting that does not allow great precision, proving to be much less satisfying. However, the lowest point is touched by the frontman, considering how one shouldn't sing, but only perform ridiculous moves in order to ~exalt~ one's audience. Beyond the specific movements of each instrument, there are also some common moves (such as rotating the Remote or joining the two controllers as if they were clapping) which seem really out of place, and which often have nothing to do with the rhythm of the background track. Two types of mo also make their appearanceScore multipliers, both linked to a special indicator that fills up according to the quality of one's performance: the first, executable at any time by pressing the D-pad and moving the Remote or Nunchuck, allows the character to perform acrobatics or gestures typical of rock stars. The second, which can only be performed if the bar is at its maximum, requires the user to mimic some peculiar movements with the controllers in order to accumulate points: a pity that the imperfect detection of the sensor nullifies a good part of these opportunities. In short, on paper the effort of the developers to propose an alternative to the peripheral-instrument of Rock Band and Guitar Hero is evident, but on balance the fun factor is drastically reduced. Comment Ultimate Band must be applauded for having tried to propose a casual alternative to the two giants of the genre, but little more: the control system, theoretically valid, lacks some ingenuity and a detection of movements far from perfect, the mode Career is decidedly boring and repetitive and the tracklist is made up of covers of questionable quality. Surely the Disney product is suitable for a very young audience, but it is not excluded that even this target could turn up their noses in the face of the lack of depth of the gameplay.
