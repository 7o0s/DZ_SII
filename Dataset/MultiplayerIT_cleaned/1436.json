Fez has all the trappings of the slightly cursed indie masterpiece: an extravagant idea at the base, a long and painful gestation and a work carried out almost in solitary by a somewhat over the top author, who finally also decided to abandon the world of development for the whole disgust towards the videogame environment. But above all, it's a fantastic game, and this is what ultimately remains and retains its value intact, beyond the chatter and fashions of the moment. Announced way back in 2007, since its first screens it seemed destined for great things, it practically became the very symbol of Xbox Live Arcade for the long years that marked its development and then, when it came out, it simply confirmed everything that seemed be and even more, probably going beyond the great expectations that the players had reserved for it. Now it is right that Nintendo Switch users can also enjoy all this, with a version that works perfectly and is also enhanced by the use on the go. Matter of perspective Fez's genius is all contained in his apparently simple initial idea, but terribly complex to implement in the best way. Imagine the wonder of suddenly discovering the third dimension in a world that was always believed to be in 2D: this is the triggering event for the adventure of Gomez, the protagonist of the game, who suddenly finds himself equipped with a hat ( the fez, in fact) with which to be able to see the world in three dimensions. Everything that seemed simply square therefore becomes cubic, with all the additional possibilities that the four faces of the solid can allow, while remaining essentially a 2D platformer. The design complexity of Fez is evident precisely in the simplicity with which it lets itself be played, which hides a sensational level design work: we can rotate each screen of the game horizontally, revealing new elements of the scenario and above all new perspectives, trying to exploit them in order to achieve the objectives of the various levels between the suspended structures. Fez is set in a strange world composed of suspended environments, puzzles and platforms However, the mechanics remain purely 2D, therefore the transformation of the scenario becomes an integral part of the gameplay, to open new paths, discover hidden objects and change the position of the platforms according to the different shots. On an even broader level, this intersection of planes and perspectives is also found in the connections between the settings themselves, with different ~islands~ or suspended sections that combine to create a wider and more stratified path and a real 3D map to study to figure out how to reach new passages and settings. Seeing the complexity that distinguishes everything, it is not surprising to think that Fish has run out and has decided to close with videogame development, but what he has left is truly an important creation even today after 10 years, and which will probably remain so for a long time. Art and reasoning In Fez, each level hides different perspectives but remains a 2D platformer Fez has remained the same game originally released on Xbox 360 and to follow on the other consoles, therefore we refer you to the original review for a more detailed analysis, limiting ourselves here to reviewing some elements and explaining above all why it is still an absolutely must-play game also on Nintendo Switches. The mixture between platform action and puzzle is particularly marked here, because the skill with jumps is only one of the elements of the gameplay, which for the rest is mainly based on the analysis of the scenario, the choice of the paths to follow and some contextual interactions . The aim is to collect gold cubes capable of opening new doors and levels, but after an initial phase of acclimatization with the screen rotation system, the game becomes progressively more complicated, inserting various puzzles such as time bombs, switches that act on platforms and scenery elements, keys to open doors and other solutions all perfectly intersected with the structure of the levels and their variable perspectives. Fez levels are layered, with additional locations visible in the background In several respects, such as the careful study of the map for the research and opening of new roads, it can be said that Fez also anticipated various features that later became common in today's metroidvansia, just to point out how this game has a considerable importance in the history of video games, even beyond the indie production field. All of this is then staged with impeccable style, demonstrating great mastery in handling graphics and audio to create a vivid, abstract world that is truly memorable. Today its expressive power is probably mitigated by the extensive use of pixel art and also by the mixture of 2D and 3D, as well as by the definitive customs clearance of an artistic vision of the video game which has led to increasingly refined productions from an aesthetic point of view , also (and especially) for indie titles. However, it must be considered that Fez has contributed to the affirmation of these new trends, but even beyond the historical merits it is still a truly splendid experience also from an audio-visual point of view, in support of a gameplay that in any case represents the most substance of the game.", "date": "2021-04-21", "grade": "9.0"}
