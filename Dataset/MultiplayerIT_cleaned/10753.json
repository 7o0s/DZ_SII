Well, we can tell you right now that none of this is unfortunately true. But everything in its time, let's start from the beginning. Sylvie lives in Paris, where she works as a kept girl as an ~action archaeologist~. One fine day, he learns from his uncle that a discovery he made on the island of Gozo, near Malta, could give decisive support to his niece's revolutionary theories, and not to delay even a minute to reach him. Soon said, Sylvie leaves and reaches Valletta, the capital of the island, where she discovers that her uncle has mysteriously disappeared. From here begins a search that will see her move between Istanbul and Rome, and discover an intrigue that concerns nothing less than the Knights Hospitaller, and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. All is well, one might say, and instead the game, as far as the plot and the characters are concerned, doesn't even hit one goal: the locations are too few, and they slip away in a flash, towards a premature and dry ending, so much so that one is left jaw dropping as the credits roll. Sylvie lacks charisma; not at all unpleasant, but quite anonymous, and with her many secondary actors, who should instead play a crucial role: in part, even their presence and the interventions they make during the story are not very credible. Here, then we come to the narrative: it's okay that the exploring archaeologist is not a gimmick, but it all depends on how the ideas are treated, and in this case City Interactive had the long tradition of the Knights Hospitaller in its hands to explore. Instead nothing, the events follow one another in a straight line, without pathos and devoid of any emotional tension. If only life were that simple It's hard at this point to hope that well-crafted puzzles can save everything, since a graphic adventure transfers the passion instilled in puzzle solving to the characters and the circumstances that led them to face such a puzzle. Here we are instead faced with a simplicity such as to seem an educational product, where interaction should not present any difficulties whatsoever; it gets to the point that it is not even possible to go to the wrong location, so the game does everything to ensure that you find the right object in the right place. The practice becomes this: you enter a new screen, whereby you press the button to locate the hot-spots, which you don't want to get bored any further, and then you move on to the combination of the objects in the inventory. Immediately one finds the one that must be used with extreme logic in such a point, and from there one continues towards the next puzzle, without ever being faced with several puzzles at the same time. We wouldn't be so harsh and categorical if Chronicles of Mystery didn't grant it to us widely: in some moments we were almost sorry that it had to lend itself so easily to criticism, because for a single, single element, the game can boast of itself. Art or graphics, the choice is yours Let's talk about the graphic aspect: the showpiece of a crumpled dress. In fact, the locations are splendid, both in the colors and in the attention to detail, with various animated elements to give them a breath of life. An image above all, the dashboard of the Vespa on which Sylvie will shuttle between Gozo and Valletta. The dubbing of the characters is also splendid, entirely in Italian, and the translation of the subtitles, of excellent workmanship. Too bad that so much ability has been undermined by having underestimated the key elements of the genre. The developers of City Interactive thus arrived at their second test with shortness of breath, and we hope that the rejection will help them do better the following year. We still hope so. Comment We fondly remember the game screens, which parade before our eyes like small paintings. But what happens inside them? In truth very little, and even what happens will leave no trace of itself in the emotions of the player, who would like to experience an adventure, and instead will get bored. The puzzles are also scarce, too simple and linear even for the neophyte. At least one could say the usual meaningless consolation phrase, of the type that whoever is at his first experience could also try this Chronicles of Mystery, and instead we deny it: that perhaps the inexperienced shouldn't have fun? There are even more worthy graphic adventures for him in the shops.Pro Pictorial realization of the locationsProfessional level Italian dubbing Against Lean and flat history Dull characters Enigmas of a soporific banality PC - System Requirements Minimum requirements Operating System: Windows XP / Vista Processor: 1.5GHz RAM: 512MB Video Card: NVIDIA or ATI with 64 MB of RAM DirectX: Version 9.0c or higher Disk Space: 1 GB of free disk space Test configuration Processor: Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 RAM: 2GB Video Card: GeForce 8800 GT Operating system: Windows Vista", "date": "2009-04-18", "grade": null}
