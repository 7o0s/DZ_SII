{"name": "Neo Contra", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/neo-contra.html", "text": "In this story, Neo Contra settles in as a relative anomaly. The (pernicious?) desire to experiment with respect to the classic formula has returned, we switch to a top view, modeled on the bird's eye view sections of the old Contra for SuperNES. Interestingly, when you reflect on the fact that the GBA remake of the classic Contra has preferred to wipe out these sections, replacing them with levels from another Megadrive episode. As a consequence of the new perspective, in Neo Contra the interaction, while based as always on aggressive advancement with a firearm, is very different from the traditional scrolling on the horizontal axis. If the change is an appreciable practice, the way in which the shooting mechanics have been implemented suffers in some ways from a certain lack of precision and refinement compared to traditional episodes. What surprises and indeed baffles in Neo Contra, however, is above all the sensation of being faced with a project which, as if it were programmatically convinced that it cannot reach the same level of quality as Shattered Soldiers, immediately takes refuge in self-irony , with abundant turns in a grotesque humor folded in on itself. If on a strictly playful level Neo Contra is not entirely convincing and remains clearly inferior to the other more traditional episode, on an aesthetic level the line that separates the terrible from the grotesque has been abundantly and consciously overcome. Konami's latest effort feels closer to a tongue-in-cheek z-movie than Giger's biomechanic, but also closer to the ninja turtles than Alien Storm. Yet, all this is carried out consciously, generating a doubt: what is ~Neo~ of this Contra, and why? The vertical axis of destruction Neo Contra, in the policy on weapons, continues in the wake launched by Shattered Soldiers: instead of accessing a series of weapons and power-ups within the levels, as happened in the sixteen-bit episodes, the equipment of weapons must be decided from the outset from a range of possibilities. The attack modules, progressively unlockable by obtaining percentage accuracy scores in completing the levels, are very similar to each other: they involve switching between a speed and a power weapon, as well as a different type of weapon introduced for this episode, the vertical lock-on. Lock-on and other novelties in the interaction compared to the more traditional episodes almost all derive from the decision to adopt a view from above. Traditionally, control over Bill Rizer and associates occurred on a horizontal axis, with projectiles adjustable in eight directions and the ability to block both the shot and the player in a given direction: in the first case, allowing you to maintain a stable position by varying the direction firing without moving the character; in the second case, allowing you to maintain a shooting direction by continuing to move the character at will. These elements - simple but crucial - have determined, in the evolutionary history of Contra, the so-called leap in quality. Neo Contra respects them and implements them fully. Here too, the side buttons are divided between the change of weapons and the so-called precision maneuvers. Yet, their efficiency is partially affected by the view from above. This is by no means an innovative solution, being modeled not only on the sections with a similar view of the SuperNES episode but, going further back in time, also on games such as Alien Syndrome. The real novelty, however, is the introduction of depth of field. Enemies, in addition to ~swarming~, are also found on a higher vertical plane, in the form of ships or enemies located on bridges, elevations, etc. To destroy enemies on the player's floor, the player acts as in any other Contra: targeting and destroying, selecting which weapon to use from the set chosen at the beginning of the game. To attack on the second level of depth, the one ideally closest to the player's gaze, it is instead necessary to use the new aiming service. Holding down the button will activate a lock-on on enemies. Releasing it, the projectiles will automatically aim at the target to be incinerated. As interesting as it is, and certainly courageous, this type of interaction just isn't convincing in the long run. The fact is that aiming breaks the action, forcing the player to alternate between frontal aggressions, circles to hit other enemies in the vertical plane and maneuvers to dodge the projectiles left free to be produced by enemies in the aiming phase. The introduction of a dodge, which can be activated from a standstill or in a lateral direction, is the clear symptom of this small interaction problem at the root, an obvious correctionof the inconveniences generated by a not very brilliant design. The result is that Neo Contra does not have enough courage to veer sharply in directions other than the traditional one, but at the same time fails to produce a perfection of control comparable to that of the horizontal scrolling episodes. Less precise and more chaotic, Neo Contra is more reminiscent of an enjoyable arcade than the surgical hardcore shooter of the series, but if the distance from the excellence of Shattered Soldier is clear, even the step in the second direction is too timid and results in a ambiguous and unconvincing position from any perspective. If Konami had renounced all continuity with the series, on the contrary, fleshing out the game with various and spectacular power-ups, rethinking the vertical axis and perhaps inspired by the uncompromising and adrenaline-pumping action of Smash TV, Contra could have avoided remaining entangled in this questionable middle ground. In any case, this translates into a greater importance of the collaborative element in two players for the purpose of entertainment. Even the level of difficulty, more moderate than in previous episodes, favors the game in two rather than the solitary challenge of exhausting half-perfection. The level of difficulty, however, at certain levels is always difficult. Overcoming the basic game levels at Easy level is a half-hour mission, while unlocking and finishing all the levels in Normal mode in succession, activating special endings and other bonuses conquered with ever higher percentages of success in blasting enemies, requires considerable doses of tenacity and repeated practice on the levels. Inexplicable, by the way, the fact that to close a game it is always necessary to reset: there is no way to exit the menus of started games. Aesthetic apocalypse If on a playful level Neo Contra is half a misstep compared to Shattered Soldiers, the relationship with its predecessor on an aesthetic level is enigmatic. An episode can clarify the kind of artistic expression the team is looking for for Neo Contra. It is a level that opens with an intro that fans of the series will immediately recognize as the beginning of the Shattered Soldiers level on motorcycles, and which in fact is soon revealed to be projected onto a screen. Immediately afterwards, the zoom off the screen moves to the real game, with the characters also arriving aboard vehicles: in this case, it is an unspecified species of bipedal dinosaurs (sic), aboard which they will fight a toy car that looks like a mix between Fred Flintstones car and a toy from the He-Man series. In another case, the self-irony is more explicit: an end-of-level boss is a firearm controlled by a very normal dog in uniform, with sunglasses and who even speaks by alternating threats and assorted growls. Some characters have names like Pheromone Contra or are freaks worthy of the villains of the Power Rangers, while the most disturbing and at the same time funny enemy is a kind of double sausage with arms and legs that when killed falls on its back and also shows the grill marks. Aesthetic apocalypse So, is Parodius to Gradius what Neo Contra is to Shattered Soldiers? No, since in Neo Contra there is no shortage of less hilarious and more traditionally inspired moments in terms of horror. Especially in the last levels, the biomechanical environments lend themselves to monstrosities of various kinds, sometimes implemented in a masterly way: for example, when it is easy to get distracted from the floor with ocular and buccal orifices ready to attack us unexpectedly. Too bad for the poor realization of the aliens that come out of it. In some cases, the end-level bosses are worthy of Alien Storm: for example, the boss in the middle of the first stage is a huge clawed beast with a toothed mouth in the shape of flower petals, which houses a large central newborn head. Even the rest of the audiovisual offering is pushed to the extreme, sometimes kitsch. Most of the musical proposal has abandoned the granitic industrial metal to appear at club house ~tunzetteria~ sounds or, as in the intro, at rock marches that recall at best the Dickies of ~Killer Klowns from Outer Space~. The rendered presentation is as spectacular on a technical level as it is deliberately specious and ridiculous, with the Contra-samurai (sic) on whose sword entire airplanes are destroyed or the beefsteak Bill Rizer flying unharmed amid clouds of bullets. And a similar level of ridiculous absurdity is consumed in the animations that intersperse the levels, with a plot so obvious and recitations so tragicomic as to be hopelessly ironic: it is presumed, even for the less aware or younger audience. The graphic presentation of these moments is not at all at the levels of the intro: taking advantage of the game engine, the characters move awkwardly and in a rather laughable way. From the credits we read that motion capture was done, but it almost seems that the team has skidded on the production. And even during the games, the graphic level alternates satisfactory moments with low-resolution areas or with a very meager polygonal design. This swing is not only a technical phenomenon, but also affects the aesthetic inspiration: some enemies are really silly, others are successful, still others get lost in the making. Even on an artistic level, therefore, Neo Contra is a world that is not very ~decided~: it fails to make the complete leap towards irony, remaining in a middle path that risks falling rather than taking off. Neo Contra is a fun and challenging shooter, even in two players. But ~it's not Contra~. Within the series it is a sort of anomaly, with something ~new~ but certainly not at the levels of the greatest exponent of the genre - Shattered Soldiers - on this hardware generation. What distinguishes Neo Contra is the bizarre aesthetic proposal, at the crossroads between z-movies, good horror inspirations and low-level cartoon style. The level of self-irony is evident, but certainly not explicit enough or taken to the extreme to prevent ridicule. At Komani they do this. On the one hand they go back to doing Contra as it was, for the use and consumption of hardcore gamers. On the other hand they take Neo Contra and make it more similar to Smash TV, more arcade, full of weapons and effects, with a more impactful graphics engine and many multiplayer options, full of inspirations and quotes from Alien Storm and Alien Syndrome, with a postmodern presentation in the style of z-movies or horror/sci-fi comics collection. In short, let them make a self-reflexive project worthy of the name. So, yes, we can talk about something new. As it is, Neo Contra is fun. But it risks appearing too pathetic. Pros: A strange Contra with the top view Solid in gameplay, especially in two players Moments of pure narrative madness Cons: Absolutely inferior to Shattered Soldiers Unconvincing implementation of the vertical axis Fun aesthetic project but too underdeveloped Contra series lovers know what to expect from each new episode. From the beginnings on 8-bit hardware to the recent Shattered Soldiers for Plasystation2, Konami's is a lineage of shooters that has built a reputation in the history of electronic games for key elements such as the precision of control, the huge physical effort player, the mixture of biomechanical, horrific and industrial aesthetic elements; and a game concept which, taking a pinch of inspiration from platformers, has been able to successfully establish itself in unique monument-shooters, related to the ~ship~ ones and capable of sharing their extreme spirit, but in a game form as different and radical. The only stretch marks of this saga were the unspeakable episodes produced for Playstation in the era of transition to polygonal graphics: poorly interactive and aesthetically laughable, these episodes have cast a stain on the saga, betraying the original conception. Konami subsequently saw fit to make up for it with Shattered Soldiers for Playstation 2, a grandiose and in some ways original return to the sixteen-bit glories of the series with the added value of the technology available in 2002.", "date": "2005-04-12", "grade": null}
