And the Pitt, the latest expansion of Fallout 76, certainly goes off the rails traced to date by this MMO. We are certainly talking about the most important expansion of the year for Fallout 76, especially for the type of content offered. For the first time in fact, players leave the confines of Appalachia to visit the Pitt (literally the Pit), located in Pittsburgh. The Pennsylvania city, as many fans of the series will know, is an already known setting of the contaminated area, the protagonist of the Fallout 3 expansion of the same name. The first and new shipment therefore has the flavor of a nostalgic novelty, capable of wringing the longtime players beware, but perfectly understandable and integrated into the Fallout 76 experience. After spending some time in the Pittsburgh Pit, we bring you Fallout 76 - Expeditions: The Pitt in our review. Start an expedition Vertiboard will take us to Pitt The Pitt is the first expedition included in Fallout 76, or missions outside the classic map. This type of adventures, the developers have already declared during Quakecon 2022, will become an important contribution of content for Fallout 76, but will always be accompanied by more linear expansions, such as those that featured the Brotherhood of Steel. What absolutely does not change between the more traditional expansions and the new expedition series is the speed with which the quest is launched and takes shape. We warn you: those who are in a hurry to leave for Pennsylvania, put their souls in peace because the procedure is not the most immediate. Once the post-update game has started (which for PC Microsoft Store, Xbox and PlayStation is around 75GB), the game will suggest that we head to Whitesprings, the luxurious resort south of the map. This setting has changed slightly after the arrival of the Rescuers, a faction that helps the survivors in the wasteland. The group that settled in the resort, now known as the Refuge, is very well organized and even has a Vertibird, a means of air transport. The aircraft uses an ultracite battery, which must always be recharged before a mission; Rescuers are very sparingly rationing their resources so don't expect the group to drive you around at will. The fuel, or rather, the ultracells to charge the battery, you will have to earn by satisfying specific requests: these are configured as three daily missions, where the first two will provide you with 25% of the recharge and the third with the remaining 50%. To find out who will assign the daily quests we will have to contact Orlando, the mysterious figure who manages the Refuge, who will welcome us and direct us to the Rescuers who need help most. Once we've done favors right and left we'll be ready to reload the Vertibird and leave for shipping. Expedition structure and reward The missions can be played by up to 4 players online The structure of the expeditions of The Pitt follows the MMO tradition of the classic dungeons: you enter the instance, complete three missions and collect the loot, a part distributed by default plus a series of extra rewards if the players have end of additional assignments. There are two missions, entitled ~For the Union~ and ~From ashes to fire~, which respectively give access to two distinct areas of Pitt, the industrial district and the trench. Despite the substantial differences in terms of map and lore, ~For the Union~ and ~From ashes to fire~ share the same breakdown: each mission is made up of three different phases, each of which requires you to fulfill a different objective. This is randomly chosen at the start of each expedition, resulting in players having ever-slightly different adventures. We will not deliberately go into detail about the history and lore of Il Pitt because, despite the not very large size of the maps, the exploratory experience is still relevant. We will therefore only give you a general smattering of where Pittsburgh is. In addition to the Rescuers, two other factions are added in The Pitt: on one side the Union, a group of survivors who want to restore the city by exploiting its industrial hub, on the other the Fanatics, a band of marauders who are trying to expand the boundaries of its territory. Of the two missions currently available in the Pittsburgh Expedition, From Ashes to Fire is the one that most resembles the heavy atmosphere that reigned in Fallout 3, thanks to the presence of some NPCs that leave no doubts whatsoever; although the third chapter is projected many years into the future, already in this expansion of Fallout 76 we see the prodromes of what happens in 2277. Expeditions add of course new Pitt-themed exclusive armor, weapons, and items At the end of each mission, as it should be, it's time to open the loot bag and collect the well-deserved loot. This consists of Experience Points, generic loot and a legendary item; Completing optional objectives will give you access to rare blueprints on a weekly basis. In addition, a series of stamps will also be delivered, a new currency introduced precisely by the expeditions, which can also be multiplied if some extra quests are satisfied. Additional stamps are then up to the head of mission, an aspect that allows us to introduce a very important piece of information about The Pitt: all expeditions can be tackled by one player, the head of mission, who can be joined by up to a maximum of three other players in multiplayer. To exchange the stamps in exchange for rare goods, however, there is a new NPC, Giuseppe, who is permanently at the refuge and who can't wait to do business with us. In the depths of the Pitt The atmosphere of the Fallout 3 DLC is felt throughout the Pitt As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the dimensions of the two maps of The Pitt are not very large, but they are more than generous for the structure of the missions offered. While Fallout 76 may not be the most technically spectacular online MMO, the Pitt has a twist that will astound 76 players: the bucolic vistas of the Appalachia mountains are replaced by a rusty, warm, dirty light. The urban context, then, offers developers to experiment with level design solutions never seen before in Fallout 76, characterized by natural expanses among which places of interest are dotted which, however, with very rare exceptions, seem more clusters of houses than actual urban centres. The Pitt, on the other hand, gives a very different sensation, that of a wounded land (the trench through a vast portion of the city like a scar) and teeming with danger. The urban-industrial solution therefore makes the spaces more interesting both during the exploratory and combat phases, a pleasantness that cannot be attributed to the entire Fallout 76 map. Exploration that can be conducted in absolute tranquility because the expeditions are not timed; after a while of diving in the Pitt you may feel the need to break a personal best in speedrun, but it will be entirely up to you because there is no timer to rush you. Indeed, you are not even forced to finish an expedition in a single game session: between one mission and another the game will save your progress and, if you are the mission leader, you can exit and resume from the beginning of the mission. A luxury that many MMOs don't allow and that Fallout 76 has decided to provide instead, a concession that in our opinion suggests and encourages the exploratory approach to expeditions. On the other hand, in our opinion, a reflection should be made on the difficulty of the Pitt expeditions. The level of experience suggested by the developers is at least level 50, a considerable value and not low at all. The pro, if you find yourself in difficulty, is to team up with stronger and more experienced players, a ploy that applies to any difficult experience faced in Fallout 76. However, if the strong and experienced player is you, then it is not said The Pitt is so hard to deal with. There are several users who in the week following the release complained of a not so challenging level of difficulty, especially from those who have worked on builds designed for direct and no-holds-barred combat. To limit the ease a little there is the availability of ammunition, but here too it can be easily circumvented.", "date": "2022-10-01", "grade": "8.0"}
