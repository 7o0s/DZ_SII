Capcom's first original game for Xbox 360, at the time the first next-gen platform and therefore a doubly treacherous territory for the publisher, who was working on a new technology and for an even more ~alien~ audience, the first Dead Rising has stuck in the minds of many players, generally making an impression in some way on anyone who has played it. It is a game that looks to the West in many aspects, starting from the setting to get to the obvious references to the classic film production of the horror genre, zombie sub-genre, yet also a title with a purely Japanese heart, resulting in a mixture of suggestions , inspirations and intentions that has helped to build its own identity, easily distinguishable from the rest of videogame production. As mentioned elsewhere, Dead Rising is a true cult, a rough gem with its unrefined gameplay yet consistent with its premises, over the top but not incapable of capturing the player in the meshes of its plot, in the intertwining of the crazy characters and in the empathy that binds inextricably to the always ironic Frank West, the protagonist not surprisingly pushed recently by Capcom to appear on various occasions as one of the most famous characters of the rich roster of protagonists of its historical productions. The premises of Dead Rising 2 could easily make fans of the first chapter turn up their noses, therefore, starting from the choice of a ~gaijin~ development team such as the Canadians Blue Castle and, largely, also for the choice of the new protagonist , son of a declared intention of opening to the West by Capcom. And so from the awkward and resigned Frank West we passed to the blond and undoubtedly yankee Chuck Greene, from an overly curious photographer we now find ourselves playing a tough-looking motorcyclist with a mission to accomplish, an undoubtedly more orthodox hero. In truth, as we will see, even without West's Japanese-style enthusiasm, the new protagonist will also be able to be appreciated by the public, just as the adventure that will unfold in front of his feet will probably be able to convince all those who loved the first chapter , and not only. A man with a mission The story is now known: after the disturbing events of Willamette, the strange zombifying infection has spread to other areas of North America, affecting various cities including the vital and bubbly Fortune City, a sort of Las Vegas now stormed by the horde of living dead. With the irreverent and satirical spirit towards society that unites this game to certain cinematographic productions of the genre, we witness the opposite and drastic reactions of the people towards the apocalypse, between ruthless initiatives such as the show ~Terror is Reality~, or a reality shows where hundreds of zombies are slaughtered by competitors aboard armored motorcycles, and attempts to rehabilitate the living dead through protest groups in defense of their rights. Both elements, however, will be touched closely in the story of Chuck Greene, which is somewhat more structured than that which characterized the first chapter, at least as regards the main character. Through the clever but appreciable system of the downloadable episode Case Zero it was explained before the launch of Dead Rising 2 how Chuck Greene found himself on the streets of the city in question and why he is firmly looking for money and Zombrex, the drug that delays the transformation into zombies that his daughter constantly needs. As in the first chapter of the series, indeed in an even more marked way, the impact with the living dead is direct and drastic. There isn't so much the tension of waiting for the manifestation of horror, here the threat is always imminent and overwhelming in numerical terms, terror comes from the mass, it's a feeling that arises from quantity rather than quality, so to speak. Within a few minutes we witness the prologue and we immediately find ourselves in the middle of the action, with not yet infected citizens to save, others infected to help and crazy survivors who, according to Romerian tradition, probably represent the most disturbing aspect of the evil present in Fortune City. The narration of the events proceeds rather tightly between one mission and another, with the story divided into main ~cases~ to be carried forward but, as characteristic of the series, a completely free approach to the objectives to be completed based on the player's priorities and basicallyand to his conscience. On the other hand, in addition to the zombies, time is the main threat to deal with, Chuck having 72 hours to save his daughter, solve a few problems for himself and his misfortune companions and leave the city before of the arrival of the military. Once again, therefore, zombies do not present themselves as the most formidable enemy. Lots of cases for Chuck Greene As if the horde of ravenous zombies and a sick daughter to save weren't enough, Chuck will have to deal with a vast series of problems that will rain down on him already in the first hours of the game, forcing him to do a lot of extra work to be able to get out of at least one part of the trouble. Those who have played the first Dead Rising will know well the feeling of overwhelming helplessness in the face of too many human cases to follow, here exponentially increased, with the exploration of Fortune City as free as in a sandbox, except for the main guidelines that carry forward the narrative system, it's up to the player to decide how many secondary cases to follow in order to rescue as many civilians as possible or simply to discover some more background on the events that took place in the city. The problems, as mentioned, are mainly two: the scarce time linked to the need to complete the missions within a given limit and obviously the huge amount of zombies who, even without a personal fury towards Chuck, will do everything to get in the way between the protagonist and his goal, often leading us to hit desperately in an attempt to make our way through the flood of undead. Occasionally, as a stylistic code of the series, the action veers towards the clash with the bosses, who generally are men who have escaped the infection but decidedly tried from a psychological point of view, or the aforementioned madmen far more dangerous than the ~simple~ living dead. It's not just the good heart of the players that pushes towards the hard work of rescuing other wretches besieged by zombies, but rather the greed in collecting extra points. The ~prestige points~ are used to increase Chuck's experience as in a real RPG, complete with level-up and expansion of skills, in this case represented by special ~cards~ capable of providing instructions on how to carry out attacks special or create new and surprising weapons through the fusion of multiple objects, essential elements to be able to continue in the game, consequently making it highly advisable to save as many missing people as possible. The combat system is extremely basic, making Dead Rising 2 closer to scrolling beat 'em up in this aspect than survival horror. It is simply a matter of throwing blows left and right, with different combos that can be carried out and two different types of attack for each weapon, usually one fast and one ~loaded~. The choice of the weapon itself therefore becomes fundamental, as its offensive capacity significantly transforms the effects of the attacks, with the obvious consequence that combined weapons are much more effective than normal ones. Also note the fact that the objects deteriorate over time, making it necessary to replace them quite frequently within the inventory. There are not many traditional weapons in Chuck's arsenal, even the second chapter remains faithful to the line traced by the progenitor and gives us the possibility of using practically any object as a potential weapon that can be stolen from the numerous shops, offices and casinos of Fortune City , with often very hilarious effects, especially if used in conjunction with the extravagant items of clothing also available on the shelves of shopping centres. Xbox 360 goals Also from the point of view of the unlockable achievements Dead Rising 2 remained faithful to the original, presenting all achievements of equal value, from 20 points. This means that in total there are 50 objectives to be achieved, and since many of these are unrelated to the main plot and obtainable through particular performances, the company of the complete collection of 1000 Gamerpoints is rather difficult. A little tired, but better Proof of the facts, in the midst of the horde of zombies, Dead Rising 2 faithfully repeats the formula created by its predecessor without adding anything significant, but its work is above all about refinement and evolution at different levels. Those who feared a distortion of the original spirit can rest assured, this second chapter is more conducive to the player, but the anguish of not being able to rescue all the survivors or solve the case within the time limit has remained unchanged, for non par of the deliberately archaic rescue system that forces you to make long and dangerous crossings to reach the coveted public bathroom. If anything, the problem may be the excessive fidelity to the original model, which in any case does not stand out that much for a complex and deep game action, especially if carried on for the 7-8 hours (without considering the failed attempts) necessary to conclude the story. To vary a little, Capcom has decided to enrich the playful offer by inserting a multiplayer mode that can be entertaining for a few hours but which is struggling to take off, simply offering the possibility of playing cooperatively with a companion (in which case you it simply witnesses the appearance of another player without any justification from a narrative point of view) or some mini-game for up to 4 players at the same time. Not exactly fundamental options but undoubtedly appreciable to increase the longevity and variety of the action. The other point of view according to which Dead Rising 2 adopts the best meaning of the ~more of the same~ formula is the graphic system that forms the background to the game, based on the new version of the proprietary MT Framework engine which also this case manages to stand out very well. One of the most effective slogans during the game's promotional campaign was the presence of ~7000 zombies on the screen at the same time~. It is obviously difficult to verify the actual quantity of bodies dangling in the streets, but they are certainly very many and the effect is impressive, especially considering the relative stability of the framerate (except in some cases where the crowding is really excessive). Beyond the quantity, also qualitatively there is a substantial evolution compared to the first, still immature chapter, with more advanced polygonal models and more defined textures, whose vision is also enhanced by the choice of a colorful and varied city like Fortune City. Although it is not one of the most impressive titles on the technical side, it certainly holds the record in terms of shock from the amount of enemies on the screen at the same time. The audio accompaniment continues in the game of opposites by contrasting the terrifying situation with the typical shopping center or casino-style music, only to then turn to the more extreme Japanese-rock when the action undergoes wheelies, especially in correspondence with the boss fights.", "date": "2010-09-24", "grade": "8.0"}
