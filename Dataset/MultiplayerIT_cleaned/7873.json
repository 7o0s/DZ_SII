When we first chatted with Andy Schatz three years ago, his Munich: What's Yours is Mine had just won two awards at the Independent Games Festival: one was for best design, the other was the Grand Prize. Although considered a bit like the Oscar of the indie scene, the visibility of the IGF is effective (and useful) above all for those who have not yet finished or published the game, acting as a real springboard towards almost insured. And in fact this mix of cops and robbers and spy-games didn't exactly come out of nowhere, instead representing one of the most wanted for those who look with interest at independent productions and games ~from below~. But what is so special about it? At first glance, Monaco looks like a soup that brings to mind a whole series of other games, from GTA to Pac-Man, from Hotline Miami to any stealth title, but it is clear that Schatz's inspiration came mainly from films such as Heat Challenge and Ocean's Eleven. The band! The result of four years of work by a microscopic team, Monaco: What's Yours is Mine tells the story of a prison breakout gang intent on pulling off one last big heist before they bail out and leave the city for good. Thus begins a campaign that leads from the detention center to meet with other fugitives, to sabotage a cruise ship, to burglarize a casino or to line your pockets with snatched wallets in a noisy nightclub. Most of the time, therefore, you have to sneak in, reach the floor where the objective is and run away, with the view from above that at each chase seems to wink at the dear old Pac-Man. At the beginning of each level you have to choose one of the characters unlocked up to that moment, knowing that each one has particular abilities: the Locksmith is faster at picking locks, the Gentleman is able to disguise himself for a while, the Hacker can use power outlets to sabotage security systems, while Cleaner can sneak behind guards and civilians to momentarily knock them out. Each scenario is designed to be solved regardless of the character, but the player's choice will often be influenced by the type of security, the layout of the building or simply the goal you want to achieve. With its ability to tunnel through walls, the Mole is ideal if you want to finish the level in the shortest time possible (but watch out for the noise!); likewise, those who want to clean up the entire building can take advantage of the Pickpocket, an ex-tramp with a monkey capable of stealing all the nearby treasures without being noticed. But unlike what one might think, Monaco is not a stealth; not the traditional ones, at least. True, one begins by trying to hide as much as possible, not to make any noise, to get past a room full of alarms by patiently examining the paths of the guards. Yet the author didn't want to create a top-down version of Thief, so one misstep, a meddling civilian or a phone ringing in the wrong place at the wrong time is enough, and the game turns into a frantic chase between cats and mouse: so much so that the air ducts and the bushes represent real dens in which to hide if things go badly. Between narrow corridors and rooms guarded from top to bottom, each floor is transformed into a more or less claustrophobic labyrinth, and the fact that the guards are deliberately silly and much less lethal than the protagonist only makes it even more comical and unpredictable, but never overly simple, every manhunt. The fluidity of the action and the always high pace is due both to an excellent balancing act and to the deliberately simple and intuitive controls: the collected gadgets are activated with a button, but any interaction with the scenario or with the characters takes place simply by walking in their direction. This means that the player can break open doors, sabotage computer systems, hide in a bush or break into a safe without having to press another key, making everything even more smooth and simple. Ocean's 4 The storyline of Monaco: What's Yours is Mine is divided into two different campaigns. The first serves as a full-bodied tutorial, introducing level after level characters, security systems and strategies. The second is nothing more than the same and identical story told in a more dramatic way by another member of the gang: the ploy allowed Schatz to lengthen the broth by recycling the same levels but reworking them with more complex enemies, alarms and rooms to resolve. The fact of facing the same floor plan twice weighs little or nothing on the enjoyment of the game but each level of the second campaign requires a minimum number of completely robbed scenarios, thus forcing the previous challenges to be repeated several times. Thanks to the variety of characters or the different ways of dealing with the excellent level design, trying and retrying a scenario is not necessarily a frustrating experience, but in the end the single player represents only a full-bodied introduction to what is the true soul of the game: the cooperative, possibly in four. If playing alone allows you to manage times and actions in total autonomy, as well as always knowing what is happening on the screen, in the company of other online players the rules change completely. Voice chat becomes a necessity and everyone must collaborate in teamwork, avoiding selfish actions from compromising the entire mission. For example, novice players could trigger an alarm and, in an attempt to flee far and wide, also get those in other rooms into trouble. You can split up to rob a level in the shortest possible time, or you could continue in groups by combining the skills of each player: an obvious example is with a Lookout in the team, given that he is the only character capable of seeing the position of all enemies in the map, thus becoming the director of the group. The sense of collaboration is also accentuated by the different gadgets found in the levels, from silent crossbows to smoke bombs, through disguises, medical kits or wrenches. To move from floor to floor requires all players to reach the stairs, thus forcing you to take care of KO'd allies even when they are in 'hot' rooms. Played in four, Monaco could turn into a real chaos of colors, neon and lights, also because you have to get used to the graphic style and the type of field of view of the characters. Austin Wintory's (Journey) score may not earn him another Grammy nomination, but when the slow, catchy piano theme transforms into a more dynamic, fast, and frantic jazz, it means maybe it's time to beat it.", "date": "2013-04-26", "grade": "9.0"}
