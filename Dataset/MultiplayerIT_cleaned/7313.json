Wasn't it better to direct Retro Studios' efforts towards an unreleased title, or rather choose to recover the beloved Metroid Prime series? Questions like these have tormented the nights of Nintendo fans since the reveal of Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze during the last Electronic Entertainment Expo, which is why the release of the new adventure of the ape has certainly not been experienced with feverish and spasmodic anticipation. But to understand the reasons for this decision by the Kyoto leaders, it is necessary to make some considerations. The first, and most bitter, lies in the raw sales data: Metroid has never been a franchise of huge numbers, and despite the exceptional work of Retro Studios, the brand's appeal in recent years has not really exploded. On Wii Metroid Prime 3: Corruption did not exceed two million copies, while on the contrary Donkey Kong Country Returns flew over six million. Remarkable differences which, for those who have to reckon and choose company strategies, undoubtedly have a weight. Secondly then, one wonders if Tropical Freeze has really concentrated all the efforts of the Texan team during the three years and more that have passed since the previous commitment, which was precisely Returns; hypotheses, speculations, hopes about which at the moment there is absolutely nothing concrete. But perhaps this review can give us some clues... Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze is quality fuel for the Wii U engine, and yet... Tropical cold Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze is, without a doubt, a sequel in the name of continuity. An intelligent choice, considering the good things done with Returns: for this very reason, the game is destined to appear immediately familiar to those with a certain familiarity with the predecessor. The plot, little more than a pretext to justify the adventure, revolves around the invasion by the Snow Kings of the peaceful island of Donkey Kong, which at the same time is also dramatically covered in snow and ice. Obviously, the big primate consequently wants to reclaim his home and put things right, but the undertaking soon turns out to be much easier said than done. A large part of the controls and actions available to the furry protagonist follow those of the previous chapter, yet there are some new features and changes: the most incisive is the disappearance of the ~breath~ of Returns in favor of the possibility of pulling some sort of handles scattered land in levels. The consequences can be both the simple discovery of objects, and rather the more spectacular interaction with the entire setting, perhaps making entire areas of the scenario appear or allowing a sunken ship to resurface, just to name a couple of examples. In the same way you can also pick up stunned enemies, to use them as weapons to throw at will. These mechanics appear as a clear homage to Super Mario Bros. 2, a title directed by the same Kensuke Tanabe who plays the role of Producer in Tropical Freeze. Closed the parenthesis, the other consistent novelty lies in the presence not only of Diddy Kong as Donkey's partner, but also of Dixie Kong and Kranky Kong; a real pack of monkeys, each able to provide the protagonist, in addition to doubling the energy available - from two to four hearts - also with a different support. If Diddy allows you to stay in the air longer during jumps, Dixie by twirling her hair gives you the ability to reach greater heights, while Kranky finally bouncing on his stick allows you to jump on enemies, brambles and spikes without suffering any damage. Similarly, even underwater - exactly, in Tropical Freeze you can swim - Donkey Kong's companions guarantee different types of help. The way to (literally) put one of your friends on your shoulders goes through the classic barrel strategically positioned within the levels; this can be either rigidly tied to a single character, or instead free to provide the player with the preferred helper. A choice that guarantees a certain strategic component, which is often linked to the possibility of reaching or not reaching the collectibles placed in otherwise inaccessible places. These, once again in the sign of continuity, are made up of the letters of the word K O N G and a certain variable number of puzzle pieces; needless to say that recovering them all is a fundamental step in being able to fully complete the game and consequently see the entire contents present. The only fruit of love Donkey Kong Country Returns was so well receivednally for two reasons: the excellent level design and the particularly challenging difficulty, much closer to the ~old school~ platformers rather than the more recent exponents of the category. Finding the perfect balance between challenge and frustration, between complexity and sadism, is a far from simple task. Tropical Freeze succeeds most of the time in intent, but after completing it and having replayed Returns in order to have the most sincere comparison possible, we are unable to consider it a better product than its predecessor. The main reason for our criticism lies basically in a certainly valid level design, often excellent, but almost never brilliant. Let's put things in the right perspective, before unleashing uproar: it is still a Nintendo quality platformer, and this automatically puts it far above the vast majority of its ~similar~. But the progression seemed to us to be frequently accompanied by simple pleasure, rather than by the enthusiasm and exaltation typical of the great masterpieces of the genre. And it is precisely in the direct comparison with Returns that we notice a lesser dynamism, a less bubbly and engaging sequence of situations; the chapter for Wii (and Nintendo 3DS) was a party, a continuous over the top, while in Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze it is difficult to experience the same sensations. Partly also because the effort of Retro Studios is undoubtedly not very courageous, and consequently very rarely surprising: we spoke of continuity as a positive element, and it is something that we absolutely want to confirm, but the lack of original aspects gives the The impression that the designers have worked with the handbrake on, moving their steps only on familiar ground. There is the return of Rambi, the rhino to ride in some specific sections; there's the minecart and barrel rocket again, this time capable of taking two shots instead of just one. There are levels with silhouettes. Things already well known by fans of the series, perhaps too much. And where Tropical Freeze could find new life, as in the already illustrated mechanic of tearing the handles off the ground, the result proves to be remarkable and interesting only on a handful of occasions throughout the game, in most cases being reduced only to revealing the presence of bananas, hearts or tokens. Similar speech for the Kong POW, a sort of smart bomb available after collecting 100 bananas, provided you are accompanied by one of the friendly monkeys; it is a skill that allows you to eliminate all the enemies on the screen, transforming them into different objects depending on who the partner is at that moment. The problem is that its amalgam within the classic mechanics seems rather forced, simply because the need is rarely felt: the enemies in Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze are almost always rather slow, with predictable movements, and never appear on screen in large numbers at once. The maximum effort of the player leans much more towards the platform element than to that of combat, which is why the Kong POW in extreme analysis seems almost a forcing out of place. On the other hand, the battles with the bosses are interesting, much more articulated, long and complex than the predecessor. A last note on the difficulty: Returns was a challenging game, even frustrating in some passages, but always ~right~. Tropical Freeze, on the other hand, is usually balanced satisfactorily, but some passages face peaks that seem to go beyond the player's ability and reaction possibilities, placing themselves under a perspective closer to ~trial and error~. Lovers of the proverbial seven shirts to sweat will certainly appreciate, but the Retro Studios product actually has much more to offer for the more adventurous: in fact, each completed level unlocks the possibility of facing it again in the timed challenge, which in practice allows you to obtain medals based precisely on the time taken to cross it from start to finish. It is a brutal undertaking, which requires a completely different approach aimed only at maximum savings in seconds, accompanied by absolute precision in the movements bordering on the maniacal. This mode also includes the de facto only social option of the entire package, which translates into the presence of online leaderboards; those who wish can also share the replay of their feat, so as to make their skills even more evident and allow the less experienced to learn the tricks of the trade. Beached Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze takes place across six islands, which represent distinct settingsthe presents. The more observant will have immediately noticed that it is a lower number than the eight of Returns, and this actually slightly reduces the aesthetic variety during the adventure, despite the fact that even totally different situations may arise within the same island (above all thanks to bonus internships). However, it must be said that in principle each macro area hosts a greater number of internships, and that these are on average longer than in the predecessor. The sum of the factors leads to the result of a longevity roughly comparable to that of the chapter for the Wii. Eventually we can discuss the contents of the islands: two of them are in fact in practice entirely composed respectively of underwater and ice levels, historically among the scenarios least appreciated by players in platformers. Since it is a highly subjective element and linked to personal tastes, we did not weigh this choice on the final grade; however, it seems to us an important indication to provide, because it could constitute an element of reflection for potential buyers. Moving on to something else, the reuse of the ~shop~ should also be noted, once managed by Cranky and now for obvious reasons passed from hand to the not exactly very nice Funky Kong. Most of the bonuses that can be purchased by spending the coins collected are the same as in Returns, but with a couple of new features: the first is the addition of a ~toy capsule~ dispenser, in which to collect statuettes of characters and enemies to then admire in the special gallery, rotating and zooming at will. Just like in reality, the risk of finding duplicates is always lurking, which is why those who want to complete the entire collection will have to resign themselves to spending a lot of money to reach their goal. The second novelty is the absence of the golden key, which in Returns allowed you to unlock the extra levels available in the different areas. However, this does not mean at all that the latter have disappeared from the game: on the contrary, the developers in this case have chosen to change the way of accessing them, which is now subject to the discovery of special connection portals present within the normal levels. A far from simple undertaking given that usually these portals are extremely well hidden, requiring a meticulous and very patient exploration work that did not necessarily always seem to us to be fun. Finally, the local co-op deserves mention, which allows you to be accompanied on the adventure by a friend, destined to take on the role of Cranky, Dixie or Diddy. Given the very challenging nature of Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, the final result is totally dependent on the skill of your partner. From a technical point of view, the Nintendo production is definitely appreciated: it is not a distortion compared to Returns, but the exploitation of the greater capabilities of Wii U is evident from every point of view. The native 720p resolution shouldn't disappoint too much, because it proves to be far more than sufficient to give prominence and full justice to the level of detail that distinguishes characters and settings. The latter, especially on certain occasions, offer such pleasant glimpses as to invite you to divert your attention from the game itself to admire the work done by the graphics. The reproduction of monkey fur is also remarkable, while the granite 60 frames per second ensure a perfect fluidity of the action. On the other hand, the sound accompaniment is of a high level, which was able to enjoy the contribution of the veteran David Wise; the result is composed of often excellent orchestrated pieces, perfectly themed, which contribute in a concrete way to enrich the experience. Once upon a time there was the GamePad Overall, therefore, Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze is undoubtedly a very good game. The production values are all there, the quality is indisputable, the progression is always pleasant. However, there is a ~but~. The feeling that it is a secondary project for the Texan team, created by assigning only a percentage of the available resources, is destined to strengthen in the face of some rather questionable elements: it starts from the little things, such as the revisable organization of the menus that each time you start of the game redundantly prompt you to choose where to view the action (TV or GamePad), to confirm the number of players and the layout of the controller. Nothing dramatic obviously, but still an unnecessary complication of the interface that we are not used to seeing in titles produced by Nintendo. Even the non-existence of a very simple level restart option is perplexing: for example, whoever, trying to collect all", "date": "2014-02-17", "grade": "8.5"}
