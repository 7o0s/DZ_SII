The multiplayer first person shooter developed by 2 Dawn Studios is in fact part of the group of projects landed on Kickstarter, the famous fund raising platform, and financed well beyond what was the original goal. In this specific case, the game was supported by over 1200 people for a total of almost 39,000 dollars, where the minimum request was 15,000. It might seem negligible figures, yet in the end the work was completed and the title, powered by the powerful Unreal Engine 3, arrived on Steam on October 17th. The idea of the developers was to create a fun and no-nonsense multiplayer experience, with extremely large maps that imply the use of various vehicles to get the better of the opposing team, all within matches open to a maximum of thirty-two players . Goal achieved? In part yes, but let's proceed in order. As mentioned, the action of Ravaged takes place in a post-apocalyptic scenario, in which society has been reset, the cities devastated by who knows what calamity and the survivors compete within two factions for control of the remaining resources. On the one hand there is the Resistance, made up of flashes of civilians and law enforcement; on the other are the Jackals, ruthless criminals who will stop at nothing. Both groups have access to weapons and vehicles in abundance, and once we enter a match we can choose not only the team we belong to but also select our character from five different classes: Recon / Bandit, equipped with a light machine gun, shotgun and mace; Soldier/Warrior, with an assault rifle, magnum and grenade; WeaponsSpecialist / Bodyguard, armed with a traditional bazooka or homing missile launcher; Sniper / Assassin, capable of killing from afar thanks to the sniper rifle but also defending himself from short distance with the magnum; Support / Grunt, equipped with a heavy machine gun and revolver. Here a first limitation of the 2 Dawn Studios production comes into play, or the complete lack of unlockable elements and customizations: the characters are the ones, take it or leave it, and it is not possible to get something different during the game. Snowy expanses or desolate deserts? The eight maps made available by Ravaged show us truly fascinating and suggestive scenarios, in their ruinous destruction. In fact, we have a map that stands on the remains of the Statue of Liberty, now in pieces and surrounded by sand, contrasted with scenarios in which instead we move between the buildings of a metropolis buried by snow and ice, or we still fight in the mountains , trying to exploit what remains of bridges and gas stations. There's good variety and good design, with some really interesting solutions, such as the roof of the buildings under the snow connected by some piers but which you have to climb using what remains of the fire escapes. The constant of great distances remains, which inevitably turns into a death trap if we find ourselves in the center of the map without having a vehicle available, easy prey for anyone who happens to pass by those parts or, at best, forced to run for quite a while before finding a means of locomotion. As for the latter, there is something for all tastes: from quads to cars, from jeeps to tanks, passing through helicopters, certainly the most complicated to control. The use of vehicles in offensive mode goes hand in hand with teamwork: if we drive a car equipped with a turret machine gun, for example, we will not be able to operate it directly, but we will have to count on the support of a second player who lend yourself to this approach. More than anything else, the presence of only two modes is surprising: ~Thrust~, in which you have to take control of a certain number of stations and keep it for a minute or eliminate all the members of the opposing team; and ~Resource Control~, a variation of the classic ~capture the flag~ in which the object to be recovered is a petrol can. Minor core issues A few sessions are enough to understand that Ravaged's offer moves between ups and downs, with great potential in certain areas but equally great limits when it comes to pure and simple gunplay, number of modes and, above all, the presence of online players. In fact, the dynamics that regulate the firefights did not seem very solid to us, with an evident imbalance towards the same actions implemented while on board a vehicle. However, it is the aforementioned inaction of users that represents the biggest problem of the production of 2 Dawn Studios. In the image on the side it appears more than evident, but we can assure you that there are moments of the day when things go even worse. In short, where are the more than a thousand donors who contributed to the realization of the project born on Kickstarter? It will be the sale price perhaps slightly higher than the offer (19.99 euros), it will be the period decidedly full of weight releases, the fact is that the game servers are always empty and it is not even possible to fill a single game. Playing the maps one-on-one is a thing of immense sadness, because you get the distinct feeling of so much wasted potential. We hope that the developers quickly consider the transition to free-to-play, perhaps making some changes to the initial structure to add unlockables. Finally, on the technical front, there is little to say: we know the performance of the Unreal Engine 3 well and Ravaged stands out for an excellent level of detail in the settings, as well as for a good scalability. To make it run at its best, you need a medium-high-end PC, however, and in such a situation the graphics are able to give their best.
