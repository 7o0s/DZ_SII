We throw it there, like this, although perhaps this is not the best place to say it since yes, The Adventures of Bowser Jr. is an exceptional novelty, perfect for the portable experience and son of the same operation as Bowser's Henchmen, but is nothing more than a beautiful addition to what on balance is a full-fledged remake, a spiritual sequel to the remake of Superstar Saga. The Japanese based in Tokyo have always developed for laptops and almost always above average titles; it is no coincidence that the team incorporates employees of the old Squaresoft - released before the 2003 merger with Enix - nor that the saga that made them famous is called Mario & Luigi RPG in Japan. Mario & Luigi is an almost twenty-year franchise, the classic extremely enjoyable product that manages to incorporate ideas, inventiveness, that positive lightness that makes fruition a joy for all those looking for light-hearted adventures but capable of eliciting a smile, everything in motion. Bowser's Inside Story was actually a sensational title at the time, we loved it. What we can assure you today, almost ten years later, is the strength of its playful proposal: the title has kept its evergreen qualities unaltered, enriched by a classy remake and a new, already known strategic addition of which there is always need. Trio of allies For plot and details, we refer you to the review of the time of Bowser's Journey to the Center. That aspect of the story has remained unaffected; today we are interested in validating the restoration work carried out by AlphaDream on 3DS, similar to that carried out for the previous remake. Not only does the adoption of the 3DS-exclusive Mario&Luigi engine make these remakes enormously more enjoyable and richer than the original counterparts (in this case the DS version), but the team's stubbornness has made the aesthetics a universally appreciable element. Sprites, animations, backdrops, plays of light and water physics take advantage of the greater power of the 3DS to offer an exponentially richer picture than the DS release, with the exception of the polygonal sections where instead the limits of the console come out with great ease. Net of this last aspect, Bowser's Journey to the Center seems in all respects an exclusive 3DS title with integrated stylus use mechanics very common to the DS era. From this point of view, AlphaDream had built an engine at the time capable of withstanding the weight of the years and, after Superstar Saga, this remake is the second real proof of this. The rampant sympathy of the narration projects the entire cast of the Mushroom Kingdom into that fairytale dimension that one expects from an episode of the franchise, this time seasoned with the possibility of playing and controlling Bowser, as well as the rest of his henchmen in what is an adventure memorable. This time the key idea is the distortion of the standard mechanics: for most of the journey Bowser will be the protagonist immersed in a three-dimensional gameplay, while Mario and Luigi will be left with the scepter of two-dimensional supporting actors, precisely inside the Bowser's body. As often happens, a simple mechanic is enough to give new life to something established and AlphaDream's inventiveness still remains fresh, fun, satisfying and stimulating today. What you don't do for Papo We were saying, the stylus element: this is undoubtedly the DS legacy that made us smile the most. After having to put the console vertically during some fights, it's the stylus that made us think for a few moments about how much time has passed since those years in which that stylus was the emblem of casual gaming. Today finding yourself scratching the touch seems like an action from ages ago and it's easy to perceive all its playful limits; fortunately the situations are rarefied in the flow, they are moments of a handful of seconds of a rather phoned gameplay. After this, the rest is a marvel: a full-bodied story, playful variations of the parties involved, depth of the role-playing component, over-the-top soundtrack. Ah, for those who were wondering yes, once again we have the possibility of speeding up the interlude scenes, a certainly welcome addition given the franchise's trademark trend towards storytelling. Bowser's Journey to the Inside embodies the quintessence of the Mario & Luigi saga, or the ability to tell stories suitable for everyone, at any time, which never fade and which by adding a pinch of many different elements every hour are constantly refreshed. Of course Nintendo knew it couldn't be limited to this and againThe parallel strategic addition returns to you, this time focused on the adventures of Bowser Jr. and the Bowserotti, able to shed new light on the peperino character of Bowser's son and on the personalities of his allies. Net of a certain simplicity of concept, the addition of these spin-offs (the same happened with the remake of Superstar Saga) continues to seem like an excellent integration that allows us to break the rhythm of the main campaign to try our hand at a substantially gameplay different. AlphaDream perfects the strategic model and enriches it with many new units and joints, making it a game in its own right where the user, having completed the changing team assembly, is a spectator with a little playful engagement in some decision-making situations . A sort of much more brawling chess battle that colors the remake with diversity, also completing it in terms of history and longevity, even reaching about ten hours if completed well.", "date": "2019-02-12", "grade": "8.5"}
