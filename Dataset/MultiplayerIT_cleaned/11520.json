For some, the Ubisoft product is a masterpiece: technically frightening, strong in free roaming that is so ~next gen~, with one of the most interesting plots ever seen in a video game and a long series of innovative ideas. For others it is just a discrete game, plagued by a rather repetitive structure. Net of all considerations, it is still a great commercial success, destined to generate sure sequels and, as in the case of the Nintendo DS, prequels. Assassin's Creed: Altair's Chronicles, in fact, is not a conversion of the title already released for Xbox360 and PS3, but a completely new episode, which shows us an adventure of the same character, Altair the assassin, before the events ~remembered~ in Assassin's Creed. From three to two dimensions? Since the publication of the first images, Altair's Chronicles has aroused a lot of curiosity, as is normal when one goes from exceptional high definition graphics to the possibilities offered by the double screen of the DS. It is clear that everything had to be reinvented, as it would have been impossible to reproduce the same dynamics seen in Assassin's Creed, and many have thought of a transition to two dimensions. In reality, the developers have not simplified things up to this point, so we will have the possibility to move Altair in three dimensions, thanks to a rather detailed polygonal graphics. What has actually lost a ~dimension~ is the game structure, which from the original multiple and free objectives is transformed into the simple movement of the character from point A to point B, perhaps made more complicated by the presence of enemies and/or traps .The latter testify to a clear inspiration to the dynamics of Prince of Persia, and just like a new prince our Altair will have to avoid spikes, chasms and so on to carry out the orders of his spiritual leader and find an object capable of changing the course of history. Follow the Creed As usual, we will find ourselves facing a series of missions in sequence, each one introduced by textual dialogues (translated into Italian). Altair is capable of climbing buildings and jumping from one roof to another, and in this sense Gameloft has done everything possible to remain faithful to the original game, which boasts some fantastic stunt racing sessions. If in Assassin's Creed you had to press one of the back keys of the pad to switch from ~socially acceptable~ actions to more dynamic ones (running, jumping, fighting, etc.), on Nintendo DS the exact opposite occurs: by pressing the R backbone, our character will begin to move slowly, with the possibility of overcoming any guards standing in the street without suspicion. The stealth element is also present in this case, albeit in a rather limited way, and it is therefore possible not only to avoid alarming the enemies, but also to assassinate them silently, by pressing A once close. There are situations in which it is really not possible to do things without causing an uproar, and in that situation we will have to resort to combat, in fact one of the weak points of this production. We will be able to carry out a good number of both offensive and evasive maneuvers, it is true , but the very little artificial intelligence of the opponents will lead us to eliminate them always using the same key, resorting to something different only every now and then, to break the monotony. The art of persuasion Also in this episode of AC for Nintendo DS we will have the opportunity to try our hand at pickpocketing and persuasion, through rather simple minigames involving the touch screen and the stylus. Stealing a key, in this case, translates into moving it inside a bag, trying to avoid other objects within a time limit. Forcing an enemy to speak, on the other hand, involves the use of rhythm game mechanics, with the pressure of certain points at the right time and the drawing of lines as indicated on the screen. In both cases, we are faced with gimmicks of dubious taste, which fail to involve or even less entertain the player. Technical realization The graphics of the game are completely made in 3D, as already mentioned, and boast a good level of detail, with quite defined textures. Altair has excellent animations, apart from a few cases, and moves convincingly as well as its opponents, with the only problem of counting on a really simple and angular polygonal model (something that is hardly noticeable in normal shots, however ). The bulk of the work is done by the scenarios, beautiful to look at even if often simple in structure, while unfortunatelythe frame rate suffers from continuous uncertainties and does not reach 30 fps in any case: whether it is a lack of optimization of the graphics engine or just the technical limits of the console, it would have been preferable to sacrifice some textures to obtain greater fluidity. the sound, both the music and the effects prove to be functional to the action, but never go beyond the minimum wage. The control system is classic (minigame aside), with the d-pad responsible for moving the character and the main keys used to fight (with two types of attack), jump or interact with the setting.", "date": "2008-04-01", "grade": "6.3"}
