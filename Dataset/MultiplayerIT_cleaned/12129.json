{"name": "Vampire Rain - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/vampire-rain-recensione.html", "text": "Imitating Sam We begin this third-person stealth adventure with an extensive tutorial, which provides us with all the necessary information to move silently around the cruel beings of the night. Not only will we learn to move like Sam Fisher (the references to Splinter Cell are many and continuous throughout the game), but also to use all the weapons and support tools suitable for identifying the Walkers in order to recognize them from ordinary people. Several cut scenes orchestrated with the game engine show us the cruelty of these terrible beings, and it will soon become clear that the best thing throughout the levels is always to avoid clashes. Technology comes to our aid thanks to the two viewers at our disposal: a simple night viewer which will be very useful given that the whole game is set in the hours preferred by vampires, and a more effective walker detector which will identify the ~beasts~ by coloring the their figure in red, while all other human characters will stand out in green. As mentioned, the tutorial for this third-person action is long enough, certainly explanatory, but it risks annoying more than a few lovers of immediate action, also because we are forced to carry it out in its entirety without any possibility of skipping it. Lloyd, our character, who finds himself cooperating in a team made up of three other elements, is a tough guy, who almost miraculously survived a previous Walker raid, his ability will only stand out in the second part of the game, once we can use all his fighting skills and not just those of a new Sam Fisher. Vampire Rain is set, as mentioned, exclusively at night in a rainy city, the levels take place on numerous floors, from the roofs to the most treacherous alleys and allow us to move freely, certainly not boundless but quite good. To achieve our goals we can always choose between two or three ways. In reality, in our test we noticed that the alternative routes are not very feasible, we happened to be blocked by an invisible wall that suddenly appeared, or by a Walker who will not think twice about getting killed. In reality, therefore, it is exclusively a question of finding the right path, trying and trying again, having to restart the level each time, until correctly learning which corner to turn or which gutter to climb to reach the destination without running into enemies. Dead man walking The Walkers immediately give us a lot of trouble, if they notice our presence they start the assault, often ~charging~ us with the help of a companion and at that point death is certain. We have not told you that our opponents as good vampires are equipped with a physique of steel, can make incredible leaps and move with inhuman speed. If you haven't figured it out, every time we come into contact with one of these creatures we end up really bad, game over is almost certain excluding miraculous rescues. Obviously the frustration rises to the highest levels also because it has happened to us several times to believe that we have escaped the guard patrols, only to then fall into an involuntary ambush by the CPU instead. Basically our entire arsenal, ranging from simple pistols to sniper rifles, passing through machine guns and shotguns, is useless, it is almost never used. Vampire Rain unlike famous stealth games such as Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell does not allow you to remedy your mistakes in the infiltration or outflanking phase of the enemy, once discovered we cannot recover in any way, the omelette is done and the game over is guaranteed . In addition to the Walkers, however, in the course of the game, fortunately, more affordable enemies are encountered, on which we will be able to test our arsenal in one way or another. Here emerges a clear error by the developers who should have included these opponents in the first levels and not only in the last ones, thus giving players the opportunity to use the available weapons immediately. Xbox or 360? Technically the title developed by Artoon turned out to be very little. The rain that lasts continuously for all levels has been done discreetly, a pity that there is no effect that emphasizes the encounter with the playing surfaces, including the characters. The polygonal models of the protagonists are quite good, a little stiff in certain animations, but at least it seems to revisit some stealth moves from the first episodes of Splinter Cell, a simple homage to the Ubisoft saga or a small attempt at plagiarism? We obviously lean towards a kind homage to the series that redefined the genre on the Microsoft console. The presence of pronounced aliasing is only attenuated by good textures on almost any surface. One of the major flaws of Vampire Rain from a technical point of view is the one concerning the collisions both with the scenario and with the other characters, often inaccurate and many times with a delayed effect. Hitting someone and seeing them collapse to the ground after several seconds is certainly not the best. The scenarios are made sufficiently, with few details both as regards the explorable buildings and those merely surrounding them. The audio sector is of the worst, with repetitive and trivial music, sometimes annoying, which does not fit the events told by the plot. Vampire Rain is not satisfied with offering the player a single player campaign, but relaunches by offering online options that can be managed through Xbox Live. You can play up to 8 at the same time through modes that, although with another name, closely resemble the classic deathmatch, with a team variant, capture the flag, also in this case also in teams, and a sort of Domination challenge, i.e. control in time for certain goals. We will be able to play both as humans and as Walkers, or rather we will be able to transform into Walkers after having suffered a certain number of wounds. Online, Artoon's game doesn't actually perform badly, in the challenges we faced we didn't experience any kind of lag, just a lot of problems (again!) in collision management. The real trouble is that it will be difficult to find someone who plays it online, we have had a lot of difficulty. However, there would be a reason to try it on Xbox Live  find out in the paragraph dedicated to the objectives. Goals 360 Do you want 650 points in an hour of play? All you need to do is insert Vampire Rain into the Xbox 360 tray and throw yourself on Xbox Live. If you manage to find an available opponent, it will be almost elementary to meet the requirements set by the developers. Killing our enemy several times in both human and walker mode is just one example, but consider that such a trivial goal will immediately earn you 50 points. In short, out of the 1000 available divided into 20 objectives, 650 are exclusively dedicated to online, the rest will be given to you if you finish the game with a certain evaluation, and by killing a certain number of vampires. Comment At night, in four, against a horde of vampires under a heavy rain, it seems like the beginning of an excellent cinematic thriller, the impact of the setting could be devastating. Again though, he could. In reality Vampire Rain proves to be a great disappointment, with evident defects in every aspect, from the frustrating level design to a game play too focused on trial and error, not to mention a technical sector that seems destined for Xbox, the 128-bit one , not our beloved 360. Advisable only to fanatics of accumulating points for the Gamerscore. A missed opportunity. Pros Intriguing setting Cons Frustrating Technically poor Vampire Rain tries to revive the glories of the stealth genre by mixing it with a good dose of splatter horror. In the title developed by the Japanese Artoon we play the role of Jhon Lloyd, an agent of a special team charged with carrying out some missions to defeat a new breed of monsters, a sort of ~zombesque~-looking vampires, called Walkers, who try in all the ways of putting all of humanity under their yoke.
