As we have already seen, the Building Game series by Impression Game has been probing ancient history for some time to find valid foundations on which to base its titles, for this reason an analysis of the period in which our Emperor is set is necessary. Ancient China undoubtedly represents the cradle of every oriental civilization. In this place that for over a millennium has contained almost a fifth of the world's population, a civilization developed so powerful that it remained alive (unique of its kind) up to the present day without interruption. If the West's past was marked by a succession of different peoples and cultures, for four millennia the Chinese civilization has dominated all over Asia. A fundamental element of Chinese culture is undoubtedly Feng Shui (trad. ~wind-water~), or the idea that there is a strong energy capable of flowing along the earth and marking the destiny of human lives. If people's conduct is in harmony with this mystical energy then everything will go well, otherwise bad things will happen in one way or another. Those who follow this philosophy know perfectly well that to build houses and palaces this philosophy must be followed in order to take advantage of the natural harmony given by the natural energies described by Feng Shui. Precisely for this reason it will be essential, from the very first moments of the game, to follow a precise project based on careful construction, made in the light of the predictions of the master geomancers (the Feng Shui experts). Harmony is the basis of victory... Carefully following the indications of Feng Shui it will be quite simple to draw up a first project on the basic structure of our city which first of all will have to include some small houses, to attract at least a certain number of inhabitants, and an intelligent network of roads to avoid to see citizens wandering about without finding their way back home. But that's not all because the first urban nucleus needs two other fundamental elements which are the watchtower and of course the well for water extraction. The tower acts as a road reclamation consortium, as a primitive defense against possible enemies and as a starting point for the hygiene inspectors who check from time to time the state of degradation of the surroundings and reclaim the cases of degenerates from dirty and unkempt houses . In the event of a fire (unfortunately not too rare at the time) the rescue and repression operations of the flames will also start from these towers, which will save human lives and buildings. We have thus described the fundamental nucleus without which a city worthy of the name cannot exist in Emperor. Above it can now flourish the most luxuriant metropolis in the region. But it won't be a walk at all! The story narrated by Emperor spans a rather vast period of time; for this we will happen to have to jump, during the various missions entrusted to us, from one historical period to a subsequent one of a few centuries. We will thus see the architecture of our buildings evolve and the needs of our people will grow little by little. There are many things we will have to take care of so that our city can live without problems. The harmony of the buildings in the natural context and of the entire urban layout is one of the cornerstones on which the game revolves and this is why you will have to pay close attention to the indications of Feng Shui if you want to reach prestigious levels and be respected as lord of a city powerful and magnificent. When we have to establish where to build a building, it will appear green if the chosen place respects the rules of Feng Shui, yellow if the place is not ideal but it is still acceptable and red if we are just off the road. Trying to build a big city with these criteria is not easy, but an excellent result is guaranteed. One last note regarding the criteria with which to build in your city: new houses obviously generate the influx of large quantities of new inhabitants into the city, who will soon pour onto the streets to carry out their tasks. Avoid that the noble districts are invaded by the shouting and pawing of the common people, trying to erect the typical walls that separate the ~poor~ districts from those of the rich lords, otherwise the latter will prefer another city (more respectful of their noble needs) to the yours. Always try to embellish the neighborhoods with gardens, monuments and entertainment areas and make sure that the care of the streets is always at acceptable levels, all this will certainly make your buildings more attractive and worthy of admiration....trade is the key to success! One of the differences that distinguishes Emperor from previous titles in the Building Game line lies in the requests that our citizens will make to us, which will be far more detailed and meticulous than what happened in the past. In order to build the most luxurious (and most prestigious) palaces, many resources will be needed, and of different types. Hemp, tea, bronze are just some of the precious goods with which we will have to trade in order to allow our village of huts to transform into a rich city of the empire. Of course, our city very often will not be able to support the wide and varied requests of the citizens and for this reason we will have to trade excess goods with the allied cities, supplying our warehouses with all kinds of wealth. The goods distribution system is based on a triad of elements thanks to which we will be able to work, accumulate and distribute our resources. The products from the fields and mines are destined for the mill, in order to be cataloged and controlled, in order to be able to decide on which products to base the next commercial operations. The market performs a dual function of meeting place and recreation for the inhabitants (if you wish!) and of important hub for city affairs, only here will we be able to build the last element of the triad, i.e. the shops, through which the population is supplied with the necessary goods by paying the price established by our administration (be skilled in commercial choices and avoid making your citizens angry). You can even choose the quality of the food distributed in the shops to entice or not the people to buy (but remember that here we are not in the Theme Park, so no cheap salt in chips to then sell drinks at stellar prices, that strategy here don't attack, smartass! ;-) Ancestral Spirits, Confucius, Buddah, Yin & Yang. You might not have thought that religion didn't at least have a starring role in a game set in China? You did well because religion makes its appearance in this game from the very first missions. If at first our citizens will demonstrate that they have an interest only in the spirits of their ancestors, which simply offer the possibility of raising the morale of the people, the advent of new philosophies will over time bring new beliefs in which to pour their attention. Daoism, a philosophy that wants the key to a long and peaceful life of balance between Yin and Yang, will bring new harmony to the houses of our village. The cult of the great Buddha will offer a valid alternative to Daoism for the way forward in the construction of houses (remember what was said about the harmony of buildings in the city?). Finally we find the Confucian Academy, which is mainly dedicated to regulating political morality. The wise Confucians will be the only walkers to be able to enter the luxury areas, being the representatives of the culture of the upper classes. Thanks to the Confucian Academy we will be able to create heroes, real protectors for our homes. Nothing to do with comic book superheroes, in Emperor the heroes are real gods who have come down to earth. If our offerings to the temple exceed a certain level (moreover quite high) and a large number of people will have access to the sanctuaries, the heroes will materialize in our streets bringing benefits to the population, but be careful not to make them angry as misconduct could be the cause of incalculable disasters; when the offerings at the temple drop below the established level, the heroes will quickly disappear, depriving you of their mystical assistance. To arms. Obviously the defense of the walls will also have its important role in this game. So don't dedicate yourselves to the sole care of fields, roads and buildings as the enemy is always lurking. The army ministry will handle everything related to military action. Remember to garnish the city perimeter with strongholds and towers and to always have some master blacksmith at work for the construction of weapons, so you don't have to find yourself having to fight bloodthirsty opponents without the due precautions. Remember that Chinese history is marked by terrible wars intestines and horrible campaigns of repression of the barbarian invasions. Over time you will get closer and closer to the advent of the terrible Mongols, who were for years and years a big headache for the Chinese empire and because of which the great wall was erected, a very respectable fortification. So that gardens and worldly amusements are not your interest! Of course you willalso considered the possibility of bribing too strong an enemy. It is obvious that certain details did not escape the great and unscrupulous emperors: it will also be possible to resort to this form of exchange, it is a bit like saying ~either the stock market or the life~ isn't it? The corner of the crowd. Well, it is now a duty to dedicate a mirror to the Multiplayer mode (which we are fond of for obvious reasons :-). In this sense, Emperor offers a very direct and rather fun multiplayer mode. However, some of the most experienced super-shoots-flessha-in-multiplayer may not agree with this judgment, in fact we are not dealing with a title that can offer quick multiplayer games. This is for obvious reasons related to the nature of the game in which the evolution of the city takes some time (which can even touch the couple of hours of the game if things get complicated). For this reason, it is advisable to first finish the fifty missions offered in signle player and then devote yourself to multiplayer calmly and serenely, bearing in mind that for many it will be a problem to explain that hour and three quarters of the phone being busy. Cell phone possession recommended to keep in touch with the rest of the universe :-) Particular signs: guaranteed fun. Based on isometric graphics that certainly don't weigh down any machine, Emperor is aimed at a very wide range of users looking for a few hours of busy but ultimately rather satisfying gameplay. The formula already tested by Sierra with titles such as Pharaon and Caesar seems to interest a large slice of the market, which is why we believe that Emperor is not the last of the series, and it is certainly worth joining that dense group of players who decide to give confidence in the new product of Impressions Games. If you want to experience the thrill of feeling for a few moments one of the emperors who ruled the largest empire in the East (and perhaps in the whole world) do not hesitate to invest in this stock. For those who love the ~building~ genre a must, for all the others probably a pleasant discovery. Emperor's dad and mom. For years now, Sierra has been entertaining us with titles that touch all the colors available in the rainbow of the videogame universe. Just to mention some of the most recent titles belonging to the same category of Emperor (strategic to be clear) we could bear the names of Empire Earth and Home World. The title in question is developed by Impressions Games, a software house founded in 1991 and which for years has aspired to create some of the best titles available in the strategy category. In particular, he has been dealing for some time with that videogame category renamed by the same house as Building Game to which titles such as Caesar (1,2 and 3), Pharaon and Cleopatra belong. This kind of game puts us to grips with the construction and management of a city belonging to one of the most prosperous civilizations of the past. The ultimate goal is to stabilize our government over the city while maintaining an economic and social balance and preventing our city from suffering damages related to infrastructure degradation and poor management of resources and the internal economy. What we'll see in Emperor is not far from what we found some time ago in Pharaon, at least in terms of game conception. Some of you may notice similarities with Stronghold (recently reviewed by yours truly), and indeed the type of approach to the game is similar. So let's get to know this new Sierra star in detail.", "date": "2002-10-18", "grade": null}
