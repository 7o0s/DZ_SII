Although the thickness of these sources of inspiration is undoubtedly different, the game developed in the Czech Republic by Hyperbolic Magnetism actually recovers ideas expressed in the past, but reworking them within a single product. The most surprising thing, however, is to discover, right from the start, how this unlikely mix actually works perfectly, giving life to what is in fact one of the most interesting titles in the entire mobile landscape in recent months. Chameleon Run is a fast-paced and challenging platformer, enhanced by great level design Run and jump Chameleon Run is therefore an auto runner divided into levels. We highlight the fact that it is not an endless runner, as one might perhaps be led to believe by looking at the images or the trailer. An underlining that might seem superfluous, but which instead proves to be fundamental for understanding the importance of one of the fundamental and essential components of the game, or the level design. If in an endless, by its very nature, this element is in fact inevitably mortified by the randomness of the situations presented, on the contrary in Chameleon Run each stage is studied in every small detail to be able to express and enhance the characteristics of the gameplay to the maximum and to maintain their delicate balance. Basically, the anonymous protagonist of the game finds himself having to run, in a 2D progression, within a level that almost always develops from left to right. The platforms to pass on can be distinguished by three different colors: yellow, purple or black. The latter must always be avoided, since contact with them causes immediate death. The other two, on the other hand, can only be touched if the protagonist is of the same colour: the management of this last component, which translates into an instantaneous change of colour, takes place simply by touching the screen on the left side, while the right side allows you to jump . The aim is therefore to be able to reach the end of the level by managing this mechanic, without making any mistakes: Chameleon Run is in fact a game that forgives nothing, and every mistake results in the need to repeat the challenge from the beginning. A very simple formula, which however is enriched by other components during the adventure: the double jump, the ability to make a leap even by touching a surface with the head and finally the portals of the automatic color change guarantee depth to an experience calibrated to the millimeter, honest, in which the error is always and only the player's cause. Each of the levels then, to be completed 100%, must be repeated several times on the basis of the four objectives present: collection of all spheres, collection of smoky crystals, completion of the stage without ever changing color and finally (the most difficult) completion within a very minimal time limit, which requires perfect coordination and an ability to make the most of all the advantages made available in the level. Chameleon Run is therefore an intelligent game, which pushes you to always improve yourself by managing to balance on the thin line that separates frustration from fun. The technical component is instead functional, with a minimal and stylized graphic style that actually fails to leave its mark. The only real flaw, in the current state of things, of the title of Hyperbolic Magnetism is the relative scarcity of content, which translates into the presence of only sixteen total levels which among other things also include five dedicated to tutorials. A future update could undoubtedly bring new challenges with it, but even so Chameleon Run remains a recommended product. Last necessary appendix regarding the total absence of in-app purchases, a factor that deserves to be emphasized these days.", "date": "2016-04-15", "grade": "8.4"}
