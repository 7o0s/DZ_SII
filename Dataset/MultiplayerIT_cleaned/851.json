{"name": "Nintendogs", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nintendogs.html", "text": "100% sweetness Nintendogs should be taken first of all for what it is, that is a game dedicated mainly to girls and casual gamers, as repeatedly emphasized by the producers themselves. This means that the approach and contents of the title in question were created keeping in mind a certain type of end user, not very accustomed to video games and certainly just as unwilling to face a complex and demanding product. Although this may appear as a didactic and superfluous clarification, on the contrary it is essential for understanding the spirit of Nintendo production. The first moments of the game are dedicated to the fundamental step, or rather the choice of your own puppy among the breeds and specimens available in the canine breeding. It is immediately clear that the most valuable aspect of Nintendogs is represented by the reproduction of the puppies, both in their appearance and in their behavior. The work done by the programmers is in fact exceptional, denouncing a maniacal attention in an attempt to give life to creatures capable of actually detaching themselves from the definition of digital artifacts, to reach that of living beings. This is a fundamental objective in order to be able to establish an emotional bond between owner-player and puppy, which represents the keystone for any type of production of the genre. The end result is really very good, and although it is decidedly a gamble to define the Nintendogs puppies as perfect copies of the ~originals~ in the flesh, it is undoubtedly the most successful and evolved example among those intended for videogame entertainment . Each breed is also characterized by its own personalities and characteristics, which differ further according to the character of each individual animal. Once you have brought your favorite puppy home, at a cost of just over half of the budget initially made available, it is necessary to get the frightened pet used to the new environment and the new master, through a good series of cuddles to be offered via stylus . At the same time, the name with which to call it must be chosen, repeating it accordingly until it is clear to the animal that it has been baptized in this way. From this moment on, it will be possible to teach your canine playmate a whole series of ~tricks~, or more or less simple evolutions and poses. The mechanism requires first of all to interact with the puppy through the stylus; by touching it in certain ways or by performing some established movements, it will be possible to put it in a position to learn precisely one of the aforementioned tricks, signaled by the presence of a small yellow light bulb in the upper left corner. By pressing it, a few seconds will be granted to issue a voice command associated with the trick just performed: once the operation has been repeated a few times, from that moment on the movement will then be performed simply through the order given by your voice. And if the first, simple steps are linked to simple tricks such as sitting down, lying on the ground or giving a paw, the more complex ones allow the poor (?) animal to somersault, rotate and even dance. In principle, the speech recognition system does its job well, even if it requires repeating the words in the same tone of voice with which they were recorded. Which, combined with the poor ability to recognize two words united by similar sounds as distinct, makes the experience more frustrating than fun on some occasions. Little meat in the fire? One of the obvious and most basic practices to do when you own a dog is to take him for a classic walk outside. Nintendogs does not exempt the player from this commitment, which indeed represents one of the fundamental aspects of the experience offered by Nintendo production. In fact, going for a walk around the neighborhood is essential for a good number of reasons, above all the need to increase the puppy's endurance and train him for competitions. But that's not all: along the streets of the neighborhood it is not uncommon to meet other dogs with their owners, the latter capable of offering advice on every occasion - for the most part obvious and banal - on how to raise one's pet. Nonetheless, during the walk your four-legged friend is able to identify and collect a whole series of objects, ranging from toys to accessories to useless rubbish. Some examples? Plastic bones, tennis balls, soap bubbles, but also glasses, colorful collars, hats and crowns, bows and so on to ~decorate~ the puppy. There are a couple of shops in the neighborhood where you can buy food, water, milk, shampoo and so on at discounted prices. UnfortunatelyThe management of these walks is almost completely automated, requiring the player only to trace the path to follow and then almost completely passively assisting in the out-of-town trip. Greater interactivity would not have been unwelcome, even in the face of the repetitiveness that these sections soon demonstrate. Alternatively, Nintendogs allows you to take part in 3 different types of competition, with attractive amounts of cash available as prizes for finishing in the top three. The competitions available are the throwing of the frisbee, in which obviously the dog must be able to pick up the disc on the fly before it hits the ground, and again the agility competition on the obstacle course, and lastly the obedience competition which puts test the affinity between owner and puppy in performing tricks using voice commands. Apart from the ability to buy new styles of furniture for your home from a handful of pre-built sets, sadly Nintendogs is all there is. Probably aware of the poor content of their product, the programmers have therefore decided to impose heavy limitations on its use. In fact, the little dog cannot learn more than 3 or 4 tricks a day (the number varies according to the breed), cannot take part in more than 3 competitions a day and cannot take more than a walk every half hour. Realistic? No, cloying. This imposition therefore allows you to do everything that is possible in half an hour a day, offering for the rest of the time only the possibility of playing with your puppy, feeding and drinking it or cleaning it up with shampoo and brush. A little too little, from our point of view. And a little too little even for casual gamers and girls. And the freedom to buy other dogs doesn't help much in this sense, with the possibility of keeping up to 3 of them at home at the same time and leaving any others in a sort of hotel for animals. Dog that barks doesn't bite One last aspect of Nintendogs to consider, rather advertised during product presentations, is the Bark Mode. In summary, once activated via a simple menu, you can close your DS and go around your (real) city, to work, or wherever you want. In the event that another person, with another DS, with another copy of Nintendogs, also with the Bark function activated, came within range of the wireless coverage of the console (about ten meters without obstacles), it would start to ~bark~, allowing the two puppies to meet, interact with each other and exchange objects and dog breeds. Already the simple description of the modality should have clarified the decidedly rare - to put it mildly - possibility that a random encounter of this type really occurs. In fact, unless two users agree to bring their pets together, the real possibility of meeting another virtual dog would probably never arise. Turning instead to the technical point of view, Nintendogs is made in an excellent way as regards the protagonists, the dogs. Much less for the rest, with settings that are not particularly detailed and of limited variety and quantity. The sound is also not without criticism, rather flat and which could have been characterized by a greater number of tones and intensity for the dog's cries, really too silent. Comment and vote Nintendogs is a fantastic product during the first few sessions of play, but it runs out of its contents far too soon. Even considering the target of casual gamers and girls to which it is mainly addressed, and also accepting an approach to the game made up of multiple and short sessions during the day, the activities made available by the Nintendo production are unfortunately really a handful, thus becoming well soon repetitive and not very stimulating once the main objectives are achieved. Nintendogs certainly deserves a positive evaluation thanks to the splendid reproduction of the puppies and the realism with which they have been recreated on the DS, but unfortunately the irons in the fire are too few to make it an unreservedly recommended purchase. Pros: Exceptional puppy reproduction Invaluable in the first few days of the game Able to establish a real emotional bond Cons: Too, too limited Speech recognition not perfect Very repetitive Don't miss the special Nintendogs! The Review The Hideki Konno Interview The Complete Guide During a frankly subdued E3 both as regards the non-presence of Revolution and the scarce support of the moribund Gamecube (Zelda permitting, of course), for Nintendo the 2005 edition of the Los Angeles fair waswas mainly dedicated to portables, thanks to the announcement of the Game Boy Micro and the excellent number of titles present for DS. Among these, undoubtedly one of the most popular and appreciated by visitors was Nintendogs, adorable dog simulation immediately renamed as ~the Tamagotchi with puppies~. A few months after E3 and driven by a bombastic 40/40 on the appreciated - but not always reliable - Japanese magazine ~Famitsu~, the title in question has finally reached the West, thus allowing us to touch the very first would-be Killer-app for Nintendo DS.", "date": "2005-09-02", "grade": null}
