Bad Seed's Milanese had already succeeded a couple of years ago with Sheep Up!, a small mobile game which, through a top-down camera and a few other spot-on ideas, managed to distinguish itself from Doodle Jump and the flood of clones and variants released in the following years. With Sleep Attack, the development team's goal was even more ambitious, given that the tower defense genre seems to have nothing more to say, stuck with design ideas that are now a few years old. And yet, the small group founded by Jacopo Musso, Clara Parona and Roberto Mangiafico has hit the mark again, placing a game on the App Store that finally manages to offer an unprecedented experience even to those who are fed up with tower defense. Thanks to an innovative idea, Sleep Attack wakes up the tower defense genre. Sleep Ubaldo, sleep... As in Sheep Up!, once again Bad Seed tries to set up a game with a very recognizable character. In fact, the protagonist is Ubaldo, a fat and lazy alien who, having fallen into a deep sleep, is attacked by annoying little monsters in various dream scenarios. Apparently there are no big differences with the classic tower defense: by placing turrets in specific points of the level you have to stop the waves of enemies who try to get closer to the center of the screen to annoy sleepyhead Ubaldo. However, what makes Sleep Attack such an original game is the possibility of changing the structure of the level in real time. Each scenario is in fact composed of two concentric discs that the player can freely rotate clockwise or counterclockwise, thus altering the position of the towers or the length of the path that leads to Ubaldo. For example, you can drive away a group of nearby enemies simply by rotating the disc they are on; or you can build and upgrade a particular type of tower at one point in the level and then move them as necessary based on the enemies that arrive. To some it may not seem like a particularly innovative mechanic, yet the idea of Bad Seed gives a powerful jolt to the foundations of tower defense, introducing a dynamic and active element into a genre that has traditionally always remained static. With titles such as Desktop Tower Defense, Fieldrunners and Defense Grid we have seen the emergence of a type of game in which the main concern is to place the right towers in the right place and at the right time: placing and upgrading defenses requires strategic planning, but after having made one's moves one remains to passively watch the resolution of the battle. In Sleep Attack this does not happen. The structure of the courses, the positioning of the towers and the waves of enemies are specially designed to push the player to always stay alert, to continuously rotate the scenario and to change strategy several times during a level. When you try to rotate one of the two discs, the game pauses momentarily and gives you time to think and analyze the situation, but even so the level of challenge is higher than the average of traditional tower defense games. Perhaps it is the sense of urgency and involvement that we liked best in Sleep Attack. We must constantly look for the best strategy, neutralize the advance of the enemies by remembering their weaknesses and taking advantage of the most suitable towers, and when the situation goes badly it is essential not to panic, because turning the scenario at random can only make things worse . To add a little spice there is also an old acquaintance: the Pecoramica is a small cameo taken from Sheep Up!, which if it manages to reach Ubaldo gives him an additional life point, but if it is eliminated from its own towers it makes him lose it automatically one. In short, imagine the chaos that is created when a Pecoramica appears in the middle of an already confusing situation. If desired, it is possible to simplify life by purchasing and using three particular power-ups, but the developers have done an excellent job of balancing to allow anyone to finish each level even without resorting to easy shortcuts.", "date": "2014-11-04", "grade": "8.8"}
