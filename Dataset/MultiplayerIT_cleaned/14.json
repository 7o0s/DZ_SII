{"name": "Titan Quest: Immortal Throne - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/titan-quest-immortal-throne-recensione.html", "text": "Fortunately his search will be helped by some illustrious characters such as Agamemnon, Achilles and Medea, but at the same time fearsome monsters such as Cerberus who stands out on the cover of the DVD will not be slow to put a spanner in his works. The gameplay has not been revolutionized - a fairly obvious observation - and is essentially resolved in exploring and cleaning up the vast areas of the map from endless hordes of enemies. There are of course new adversaries to face, including witches, ratmen and dancing troupe, as well as new weapons and artifacts to collect to make your character a true war machine. Among the most appreciated innovations we find the inventory management, where there is now a button that automatically rearranges the objects present to optimize their space; still on the subject of collecting objects in the various cities, caravan leaders have been added, NPCs to whom it is possible to entrust the most precious artifacts that are not currently needed. Enchanters have also been added, to whom you entrust the runestones that are collected during the journey and whose ~assembly~ can give life to truly remarkable weapons. The skill of the designers in recreating the locations described in the ancient classics is phenomenal, as it was for the missions in Greece. The underworld presented in Immortal Throne is exactly what one can imagine when reading the works of Homer; but the same can be said of the Elysium and of the other detailed locations. Thanks to an engine that has not only not lost the polish that had decreed the success of Titan Quest, but which has been further perfected with the addition of goodies such as triple buffering, motion blur and other environmental effects that make the experience extremely appealing visual. News also for the audio system, which now supports five and six speaker systems. Too bad, however, that the fake three-dimensionality of the title combined with the usual poor dubbing does not do it adequately justice. The balance of the clashes has also been revised: now the enemies are not so simple to kill and in some cases it is necessary to study a preventive strategy especially before facing the most powerful monsters. On the other hand, a mastery has been added to the hero, that of dreams, characterized by truly inspired graphic effects. The increase in experience takes place in a more gradual and ~reasoned~ way: in other words, you don't level up especially following the elimination of a boss, and the increase in the hero's characteristics corresponds to a level of difficulty that is always adequate even using the Normal option, which we ourselves criticized in the original version due to its excessive kindness towards the player. As initially written, the fundamental aspect of Immortal Throne is that all the improvements listed so far are not limited to the new campaign but on the contrary they can (indeed must) be appreciated to the fullest by starting the game again from the beginning: the longevity to which the multiplayer aspect still doesn't help, too trivial and uninspired for such an arcade game. System requirements Minimum Requirements Intel Pentium IV at 1800 MHz 512 MB of ram 64 MB 3D accelerator card (at least one Nvidia GeForce 3 or Ati Radeon 8500) Windows 98/ME/2000/XP operating system 5000 MB of free space on Hard-Disk DVD Player- 8X ROM DirectX 9.0b Modem required for Internet gaming Test configuration AMD Athlon FX-55 2GB RAM nVidia GeForce 7800GTX video card Conclusions An expansion that fully achieves the objectives set by the programmers, improving every single aspect of a good title (beyond multiplayer), contextually rejuvenating its graphics and playability without forgetting a good dose of new weapons and monsters that will satisfy even those who had played ~ad nauseam Titan Quest. Pros Top-notch graphics Well-balanced combat Longevity Cons Repetitiveness High system requirements Uninspired and repetitive audio Coming about a year after the release of the original title, the heralded expansion to Titan Quest. Immortal Throne, this is the name of the second effort of Iron Lore, the developer team led by the famous Brian Sullivan, completely revisits the previous playful experience making it more complete and balanced. This expansion pack occupies over 2 GB and overwrites a large part of the original title, whose prior installation is naturally required: therefore it is not a simple series of additional maps, although the highlight is represented by the fourth chapter, set in the Hades. The story takes place exactly where the previous one ended, that is after the killing of Typhon. Upon returning from'Olimpo the character discovers that the riots have not ended as it would have been legitimate to expect and will begin to look for the reason for so much confusion, in an adventure that will keep the most savvy players busy for about ten hours.", "date": "2007-03-22", "grade": null}
