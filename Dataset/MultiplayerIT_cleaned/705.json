With WWE Raw vs Smackdown 2006, the pairing Yuke's - THQ reaches this important milestone for Wrestling on Playstation 2, a relationship that began in the late 90s with the first episodes of Smackdown on the first Sony home console and then continued by episode in episodes with ever greater sales results (especially in Italy where Wrestlingmania has literally re-exploded in recent years). Anticipating the conclusions for a moment, we must immediately give credit to the developers who, after the last two episodes criticized by many for their lack of innovative vein, have really revolutionized the series by giving RvsS 2006 a much deeper and more simulative approach, as well as an incredible game customization. But now let's take a small step back... Visualizing the game possibilities provided, we immediately realize that the Yuke's programmers really wanted to make things big How many ways to do wrestling After the quick intro (which will alternately display the initials of Raw or Smackdown), we make our triumphant entry into the main menu of the game and giving a quick display of the game possibilities provided, we immediately realize that the Yuke's programmers really have wanted to do things big. In addition to the presence of all the possibilities present in the past editions (and therefore single matches, tag matches, three way matches, fatal fours, royal rumbles, elimination chambers and many others for a maximum total of 6 human players to challenge each other at the same time) ~new~ we see the legendary ~Buried Alive Match~ (to understand each other, that particular stipulation in which you have to lock your opponent in a grave ... a match clearly born with the arrival of Undertaker in the federation ...) and other variations on the theme such as the Bar Brawl or Fullfill your fantasy (a more elaborate version of the classic bra & panties match where the splendid WWE divas have to undress their opponent) and clear improvements as regards cages and ladder matches: in the latter it is expected that of the scale much more free and versatile to really hurt your opponent. In general, all the modes have been positively revised (probably even after receiving feedback from fans): for example, in the Rumble it will be much easier to get out than last year, making the gaming experience more similar to the real counterpart. How many ways to do wrestling However, the novelties do not end here given that in addition to the possibility of organizing titled matches, the new RvsS provides a ~General Manager~ mode which can be considered as a reduced version of a classic management game such as Football Manager and the like, only that here we will clearly find ourselves manage one of the federation's shows and our ultimate goal will be to have a greater audience than our antagonist. We are not dealing with a product capable of countering the masterpieces of the genre but it is undoubtedly a ~plus~ that could excite many wrestling maniacs also because the interface and game mechanics are clear and simple to learn. The new RvsS provides a ~General Manager~ mode that can be considered as a reduced version of a classic managerial How many ways to do wrestling Good news also comes from online and from the editor: after last year's rather limited implementation in which only two players could compete exclusively in single matches or bra & panties matches, this year there are 4 players who will be able confront each other remotely in practically all the modalities that involve the participation of a set of wrestlers. The editor, on the other hand, has essentially remained unchanged compared to last year and given its potential there was no reason to modify it, but in RvsS 2006 there will be the possibility to customize even the entrances of the wrestlers in a truly total way, almost to a level of a short film! How many ways to do wrestling After this avalanche of new features (including connectivity with the PSP version of the game with extras and secrets that can only be unlocked by connecting the two versions) and good news, unfortunately there is also a mole in Raw vs Smackdown 2006 or the career . Unfortunately, in fact, this will only last one year with the usual crossroads in the unfolding of the story caused both by some choices that we will have to make from time to time and by the outcome of our matches. On the other hand, it should be noted that this time even if we will use an alter ego created with the editor, he will be able to speak like all the other wrestlers and we will be able to choose from various samples the one we like most. THE OFFICIAL GUIDE TO WWE RAW VS SMACKDown 2006 Multiplayer.it Edizioni is launching in these days in the best online stores and in all the cities of Italy, the official guide of the game entirely localized in Italian at the recommended price of only 14.90. The guide is fully printed in color with approximately 270 pages full of photos and details on all the wrestlers on the game's roster. The considerable depth, as reported in this review, of WWE Raw vs Smackdown 2006 and the many ~secrets~ to be discovered in the game lead us to strongly recommend the guide to really get the best out of the title of the Yuke's - THQ pairing and don't miss it none of the many features of the best Wrestling in Playstation 2 format! The Roster The time has almost come to get into the ring, but first let's analyze another very important element in a Wrestling game: the characters available. WWE Raw vs Smackdown 2006 is updated to spring of this year with the presence of some wrestlers who are no longer in the federation (Jericho, Christian, Hassan, Charlie Hass, Spike Dudley and others) while the latest WWE stars do not appear such as the MNMs, Lashley, Misteeeer Ken Kennedy. In addition to signaling the presence of Eddie Guerrero ~forever in our hearts~ among the wrestlers, a massive increase in legends present (British Bulldog, Andr The Giant, The Di Biase, Rock, Mankind, Steve Austin, Jack The Snake and others) with Hulk Hogan even revived in the 80s version as a real American, and in the villain version (yours truly favorite) as leader of the New World Order. Of positive note is a massive increase in legends present Revolution The programmers at Yuke's have not made minor changes or minor adjustments but have completely revolutionized the gameplay of their hit series. Here therefore, in addition to having inserted a more congruous number of minigames very suitable for particular situations typically from Wrestling, they have completely modified the game times by slowing them down significantly to give a greater simulation depth to the title. Then forget the ~invented~ collisions and the incomprehensibility of some holds and counterholds (this time on the screen it will be possible to see which key to press to counter the opponent ... clearly you will need excellent reflexes): this time the gameplay is of an absolute precision. But the game has also been completely rethought in other important aspects: here is the absolute novelty of the resistance bar which, shot after shot, will drop to zero, no longer allowing any movement to our wrestler until after pressing the Select key to a good amount of time. If the importance of this element is difficult to explain in words, when tested in the ring you will easily realize how this aspect will completely change the game strategy, giving RvsS 2006 an absolutely new tactical component for the series. The Smackdown loading bar has also been completely revised: the latter will load in direct proportion to the spectacularity of our moves. Above all, once available, the special move can be used instantly to cause more damage to the opponent but with the possibility of losing it completely in the event that it is not possible to execute it in a short time. The other choice is to keep it by pressing the L2 and L1 keys together and use it when we want, preferably with the indicator full for greater ~efficiency~ of the move which in any case will never have the results of the ~immediate~ Smack. Revolution If you thought that the revolution had ended here, you are wrong since the Yuke's have done even more since, in addition to an artificial intelligence finally worthy of the name compared to past editions, within the options we will be able to modify a series of parameters both in the capabilities of the AI, and for the characteristics of the game itself (the loading speed of the Smackdown, the intensity of the damage of the latter and much more) thus allowing the user to customize in all respects the own gaming experience. Finally, it should be noted that the programmers have decided to continue on the path of realism as regards the relationships between the wrestlers: therefore forget about being able to do a body slam at Big Show with Rey Misterio just to be clear Within the options we will be able to modify a series of parameters both in the capabilities of the AI and for the characteristics of the game itself Wrestling more real than real but silent! We can only continue to praise Raw vs Smackdown 2006 in terms of graphics. We are undoubtedly facing a decisive step forward compared to the scyear bear both for the general quality of the textures with which the characters and game arenas were made, and for many important details such as the three-dimensional audience or the quality of some details such as the bathrobe that Ric Flair wears during his entrance or Hulk The Immortal Hogan's boa feathers. The animations and characterization of the characters in each of their postures are also sublime. Unfortunately there are still some graphic bugs: fortunately they have decreased in number but those seen are quite serious such as the disappearance of the wrestlers from one corner of the ring and their reappearance in the diametrically opposite corner. Fortunately, in the more than 40 hours spent in the company of RvsS such situations have manifested themselves in very sporadic cases. On the other hand, without hesitation to blame the bad choice of eliminating any musical accompaniment during the matches that so loaded the players during the previous editions, leaving in the audio part only the commentary (in English), the roars of the public and the sound effects (of which some quite ridiculous) that spring from the action in the ring. Probably the decision was made in this case too to make the experience on PS2 as similar as possible to TV shows but it was necessary to give the player himself the opportunity to choose whether or not to continue to have a songtrack during the matches. Final comment With WWE Raw vs Smackdown 2006, the Yuke's programmers for what will probably be the last (or penultimate) episode on Playstation 2, really wanted to revolutionize their series by giving the title an absolutely new strategic-tactical component for the series. The new stamina bar and the Smackdown indicator are just the most evident elements of a series of very important innovations which make RvsS 2006 not only the best of the series but a product which, in terms of gameplay, presents extremely high quality universal. As if that weren't enough, the title has been enriched with significantly improved graphics, many new game modes, a finally adequate online component, greater personalization of our alter ego and a rather large roster with a good number of legends. We are therefore faced with an absolute masterpiece, a title that all Wrestling fans absolutely cannot miss, however tainted by some defects that we would have gladly done without. Two stains too many, but that don't take away from RvsS 2006 the status of best Wrestling ever. Pros Gameplay revolutionized, deeper and more tactical Game modes further increased even in online Graphics notably improved Cons but not free from some bugs Excessively restricted season Absence of accompanying music during matches Wrestlingmania It would be really petty to reduce the whole wrestling phenomenon into a paragraph of a few lines. Better to give you some interesting links of the many articles with which Multiplayer has explored the subject. If you are interested in the Wrestling - Video Games report at this link, you will find a special insight into the subject, which goes from the coin-ops of the 80s up to today. Another fertile ground for fans of Wrestling on PS2 is undoubtedly that of the CAW (acronym which stands for ~Create a Wrestler~) with which we will be able to include wrestlers not originally featured in the title in our games.

To conclude the study, a visit to the report that Multiplayer.it made in Rome for the first stage of the very recent WWE Tour with exclusive interviews with wrestlers Nunzio, Big Vito, Ken Kennedy and the general manager of Smackdown Theodore cannot be missed.
