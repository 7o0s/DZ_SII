An episode of the Dynasty Warriors series in these situations is always good for us, and Samurai Warriors: Chronicles plays its role in the best way, offering lovers of the historic Tecmo Koei franchise an experience that is very rich in terms of numbers, lacking in terms of online possibilities (DLC aside, since they are already starting to arrive) but the bearer of a series of significant innovations regarding the gameplay. Whether or not these novelties manage to smooth out the edges of the series, this is clearly another matter. Once we have given our character a name, we will be able to try our hand at four distinct parts of the story for a total of about thirty levels. In each of them our task is to free the map from enemy troops, and in particular to defeat the lieutenants and commanders of the opposing army. As in any episode of Dynasty Warriors, therefore, we must identify our objectives on the radar, reach them and eliminate them, preferably according to the priorities indicated by the mission and perhaps trying to unlock the numerous achievements present to finally obtain more money, weapons and objects. The four samurai The most relevant novelty introduced by Samurai Warriors: Chronicles compared to the classic gameplay of Dynasty Warriors is represented by the management of four characters instead of just one. In fact, our warrior will go to the battlefield together with up to three companions, who are indicated on the map by as many colored arrows and carry out their action to contrast the enemy army in a different area of the scenario. What does all this imply? Simple: when the game warns us of a ~hot~ situation that we need to deal with quickly, and perhaps this is at a great distance from our character, instead of running along the whole scenario we can simply touch a companion icon on the touch screen of the 3DS and immediately take control of it, thus reaching the affected area in much less time. As far as the combat system is concerned, we have not noticed any substantial changes: it is possible to perform different types of combos, draw on one's spiritual energy and possibly release a powerful special attack, but the dynamics remain those that fans of the Tecmo Koei series have known since too well, and which unfortunately can be very repetitive, as well as lacking the physicality present in the ~competing~ franchise Sengoku Basara (but in that case the credit is clearly to be attributed to Capcom's experience with fighting games). The parry (operated by pressing the back L key, the same one that ~centers~ the view) also proves to be an almost always useless maneuver: in the first levels due to the lack of challenge, with the opponents who suffer our blows almost without reacting; in the more advanced stages due to the enemies' habit of slashing to the bitter end, annoyingly interrupting our combos and forcing us to make ~laps~ to surprise them with their guard down. The 3D effect The third-person action game genre doesn't lend itself much to three-dimensional viewing: the effect is there and it shows, with our character standing out from the scenario, but for practical purposes it can be largely deactivated. The speech changes during the cutscenes between one level and another, moments in which the 3D at least makes waiting more pleasant (the sequences, in fact, cannot be skipped). Technical compartment The graphics of Samurai Warriors: Chronicles appear to be of a decent level, even if it certainly would have been possible to do more. The good news is that the Nintendo 3DS doesn't suffer from textures like the PSP, and in this specific case it features standard resolution textures, as well as efficient and fluid handling of polygons, even when there are many characters on the screen. Unfortunately the models are very simple, especially those of the ~standard~ enemies, but above all the scenarios are extremely bare, lacking the necessary characterization and afflicted by a drawing distance that leaves much to be desired, with objects at medium distance that are invisible for later appear only when we get close. The management of the view is problematic in many cases and the lack of a second analog stick is felt, even if the button to center it partially solves the problem. Nothing to say, however, about the po modelsthe gonals of the characters that appear during the interlude sequences, really well done and full of details, while adding nothing to the experience. The musical accompaniment is well done and the dialogues in Japanese abound, which is appreciated up to a certain point as the game has no Italian localization: the texts are in English, which does not help to appreciate the lengthy narratives of the Tecmo Koei product.", "date": "2011-04-14", "grade": "6.9"}
