Indeed, to say the whole franchise still remains, in the eyes of fans of the genre, a synonym of quality, considering what has always been expressed in this sense by the saga, and the passion for cars that distinguish its game designer, Kazunori Yamahuchi. It is to him and his desire to always get the most out of the series that gamers owe the continuous support to the fifth chapter for over two years, with a very substantial 2.0 patch and the addition of cars, circuits and new features over time. This is exactly where Gran Turismo 6 started, a new project in the saga that represents one of the most anticipated and important titles of this generational transition period between consoles. The sixth chapter is, we say it immediately, almost the sum of what we have seen so far both from a technological and content point of view, considering the amount of material present in the product, and what has already been announced will be integrated in the future, from mode B- spec to elements related to the careers of Andretti and Senna. The numbers speak for themselves: 1200 cars available, all premium on the outside, including new cars branded Red Bull, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Honda and GM, thirty-seven locations, seven new circuits including Silverstone and Willows Spring, seventy-one layouts of which nineteen unpublished, city routes and international Grand Prix, the ability to customize your team and much more. But let's take it one step at a time and proceed step by step. Gran Turismo 6 is the summa of the entire saga, undermined by the usual defects but enriched by many advantages Professional pilots The first thing you notice once you start the game are the menus, which have been completely redesigned to be more friendly, dynamic and easy to consult. Access to the various sessions is quick and ~painless~, and the gamer can move without worries of any kind between the various game modes, which range as always from Arcade, Career and Online to the areas dedicated to car management or of items to buy. In Arcade mode it is possible to measure yourself in races against cars controlled by the computer or by a friend with a shared screen, or face a single-player time trial or drift, while the situation is quite different as regards the Career. Career as always the fulcrum of the main experience of the Polyphony Digital production: the user starts as a simple novice following an initially linear path from the Debutante Cup, but immediately afterwards finds himself able to choose the race that suits him best in each class, compatibly with the license obtained and cars available. Thanks to a new system that allows you to progress by accumulating a certain number of stars, assigned on the basis of the results obtained during each race, the impersonated driver advances in the game based on his actual ability. If the player has obtained enough stars (their request is quite easy), then he can participate in the final race and license test, then also access the higher class with more challenging cars and tracks. The loved/hated licenses are therefore not present separately and as an end in themselves, but are made available when you want to move up in class and are actually much faster to deal with, not to mention that they give away a car when you get it, two when you get it. gold in all trials. The same events increase in duration and complexity as you progress in your career, up to ~iconic~ circuits such as the Nurburgring and Silverstone, perhaps accompanied by rain / sun and the day / night cycle. At a certain point, under the Special Events section, speed races also appear with many different cars in the Goodwill Hill Climb circuit and even bizarre laps on the Moon, following the route of the Apollo 15 expedition. Yes, you read right, those crazy Polyphony have decided to let you compete in space, complete with a trophy as a prize for your lunar excursion. To support the variety there is no shortage of Kart, Rally, Nascar, Endurance competitions and mini-games enclosed in the Coffee Break section, which offers competitions in which, for example, you have to knock down cones in a stadium or cover the greatest possible distance with a single liter of petrol. In any case, credits are obtained with which to buy cars and components, among the most disparate. The customization options are quite extensive,with particular attention to the management of the suspension, brakes and gears, which benefit from numerous adjustments and upgrades. There are also upgrades for the transmission, intake, nitro, weight reduction and all the classic elements of the series; a great deal of work has also been done for the tires and wheel rims, which have over 82 types with 188 variations. From a purely aesthetic point of view - and also in relation to the photographic modality (we will come back to this later) - it is also possible to buy dozens of helmets and racing suits, including famous brands and versions that have been used for the GT Academy. In Gran Turismo 6 there are an incredible 1200 cars, all ~premium~ on the outside (the results vary for the interior) and always beautiful to look at. Browsing the dealership is quite easy thanks to the filters and the use of the back keys; the variety of makes is exceptional and while there are so many Japanese versions of the same car, the quantity/variety is simply unmatched. Impossible to make a list of those present and missing: limiting ourselves to the Bel Paese we have Ferrari and Lamborghini with over ten models each, a Lancia with historical gems such as the Stratos and the integral Delta HF, and Alfa Romeo with prototypes and old and new cars (the only notable absence is that of the Giulietta). There is something for all tastes, therefore, both in terms of aesthetics and power or type of traction; to unravel the enormous amount of races and choices, there is a further section that indicates the recommended cars for each license or type of race, including historic cars, Nascar ones, etc. The news of the presence of a system of micro-transactions to buy in-game credits, designed for those with little time available, made a considerable noise. Although we are rather allergic to this type of operation, in our dozens of hours of play we have never felt the need to resort to buying with real money: the game is quite generous in giving out credits and machines, just think that after a few hours it is It is already possible to participate in races that offer between 30,000 and 50,000 credits, when a 2008 Lamborghini Diablo SP-2 requires 243,000. The steering wheels Although using the Dual Shock 3 for many enthusiasts is not a problem, to fully enjoy Gran Turismo 6 and perceive the qualitative leap made you need to get behind the wheel: the ideal is to play it using a peripheral suitable for the purpose. But which? Within the game there are specific voices for Guillemot Thrustmaster T500 RS, the various models of Logitech G25 Racing Wheel and G27 Racing Wheel, the Driving Force EX, Driving Force GT, Driving Force Pro and Logitech Driving Force. And again, always from the same brand, also GT Force, GT Force Pro and GT Force RX, in addition to the Porsche 911 Turbo S Wheel Pure Edition by Fanatec. We tested the G25 and the positive change in driving pleasure is drastic, as well as desirable if you plan to spend many hours with Polyphony's latest effort. Playstation 3 trophies Gran Turismo 6 offers 51 trophies, of which 3 are silver, 2 gold and 2 secret. To get them all you need to complete the licenses, all the events, including the special ones and win the career in the national and international configurations. Other trophies in no particular order are related to the spending of credits in Processing and maintenance, in collecting a certain amount of racing suits and helmets, in obtaining a time faster than at least half a second compared to the target time of any driving license test, in winning a race in a car built before 1959 and so on. A more complete guide Once you get on the track for the race, you immediately find the usual feeling with the series, given that the game confirms an extremely enjoyable driving model and not dissimilar from that of Gran Turismo 5 after the various patches. In addition, you benefit from the new dynamics resulting from the changes introduced by the developers. Mind you, we're not talking about changes that distort gameplay or that all of a sudden eliminate the decennial problems of the previous chapters, but about tweaks that certainly help to refine certain aspects. First of all, physics and kinematics have been improved, enhanced thanks to a new engine created in collaboration with technical partners such as Yokohama Rubber and KW Automotive. The new engine particularly affects the management of the suspension, the behavior of the car on bends and ups and downs, and on the tyres, which take into account the structure and the transient characteristics of the vehicle, helping to make the driving model more realistic. Gran Turismo 6. Provided of course not to ~exceed~ by enabling allaids such as traction and stability control, ABS and anti-skid system. In the same way, the diversification of the weight of one car compared to another, like its technical specifications, has a greater impact on the reaction of the car on the track, perhaps following a change of direction: in this sense, one perceives better the different grip on the track in case of rain, or on dirt and snow. Driving you can clearly understand when you exceed a limit; you feel every slightest load transfer and you try to react properly, countersteering when necessary to the right degree, or letting go of the gas and realigning the steering for an instant to avoid insidious understeer and therefore stay on the desired trajectory. And then there's the exhilarating sensation of negotiating a tight corner with a controlled drift, executing a sharp swerve as you enter to turn the car slightly sideways to the direction of travel, thus pointing the nose inwards. of the curve and then, while the wheels skid, regain control by bringing the wheels aligned with the curve line with a slight counter-steer, and operate the accelerator. Although the game includes 1200 cars, with a wide range of possible modifications and settings, each of them manages to express its own personality. As for the artificial intelligence of the opponents, one of the weak points of Gran Turismo 5, we have verified a review especially in the more advanced levels, where the pilots are more aggressive than usual and unwilling to remain lined up in single file. The problem remains ~philosophical~: with the amount of races and cars that the game offers, it is impossible to have an appreciable balance always and in any case, and even if several events have very specific limitations, with a little skill it is possible to develop the machine to easily get the better of it. In other races the management of the opponents by Polyphony is ~guided~ and unrealistic, usually in the race you start from the rear and you get to have a disadvantage compared to the leader even of several seconds, recover them in a short time and once you reach the first position to see others magically attached to their car seat and ready to overtake us at the slightest mistake. This thing is mitigated in the more advanced races, for example in the Daytona oval with the Nascar, in which the cars all have the same power, the slipstream is used to get to the top positions, but it is impossible to always maintain it when he's in the lead, and the result is an extremely realistic and close race. Curiosity To properly celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Gran Turismo series, Polyphony Digital has decided to involve some of the most important car manufacturers from all over the world. These were called upon to create special Grand Touring cars for the video game. Real dream prototypes conceived by well-known designers, enclosed in the area called Vision Gran Turismo and available to users to be guided in the game. After the day one patch, for example, you can find the Mercedes-Benz AMG as a gift, worth one million credits, with the sketches and the related video to see; we also spotted dozens of other prototypes from major automakers. Accidents on the asphalt The maximum in terms of gaming experience is therefore obtained when you get hold of the most powerful racing cars, given that the sense of speed and physics become absolutely satisfying. The slopes, especially the more technical and famous ones, do the rest, such as Suzuka or the Circuit de la Sarthe which hosts the 24 Hours of Le Mans, or the unprecedented Ascari Race Resort in Spain, with its tortuous turns capable of engaging even the most expert drivers to the max. And again, the Willow Springs circuit in California, known for its challenging fast corners, as well as the gradient changes that retrace the hilly terrain, and Mount Panorama. And what about the Nurburgring? Present in all its versions, day or night, rain or shine: an orgasm for all racing enthusiasts. Getting back down to earth, in the new Gran Turismo the bumps are represented with slightly more accurate and credible physics, but without real upheavals from the point of view of both aesthetics and gameplay, where they are still quite irrelevant. In fact, it is not possible to completely destroy a car even if it continues to suffer damage, and beyond a certain level, in relation to the brand of the car, it cannot go. And this honestly does not satisfy us: it is true that a simulator focuses the s", "date": "2013-12-06", "grade": "9.0"}
