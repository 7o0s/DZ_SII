{"name": "Moons of Madness", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/moons-of-madness-recensione-console.html", "text": "When Lovecraft meets the red planet, our review of Moons of Madness on PlayStation 4 was born. You know the story of the game, and if you don't know it, we will remember it: last year the developers of Rock Pocket Games and Dreamloop Games released shortly before Halloween is a first-person horror video game with a highly exploratory component. A mix of the themes addressed by the writer of Providence and the game environments and atmospheres of the Dead Space franchise. If these brief hints tease you a lot, you'll be happy to know that the console version is finally ready. Moons of Madness arrives on PlayStation 4, albeit slightly late, but with the tension and claustrophobia that have been perfectly preserved in the port, as you are about to read. Plot At the center of the plot of Moons of Madness is the cosmic horror of H. P. Lovecraft, the author of the famous short stories and short novels based on a perverse and particular cosmogony: take the opportunity to retrieve our review of Call of Cthulhu on PlayStation 4 and you will soon know more. Moon of Madness insists on this aspect of Lovecraft's stories: fear. The fear linked to monstrous beings who live beyond the cosmos and reality, in territories unknowable to the human mind (except through the aid of madness). The narration itself is conducted from the point of view of Shane Newehart, a simple technician at work at a Martian station. Man has arrived on Mars, and one company among many is carrying out studies on the red planet to make the most of its resources and, if possible, find water - or at least this is the official version of the matter. At some point, however, Shane begins to see things that shouldn't be there. Strange figures that roam the uninhabited and arid planet, fleeting apparitions in the base, and gradually a crescendo between paranoia and real danger. The psychological dimension and claustrophobia are the masters, in Moons of Madness, but it is not an excessively scary title: also thanks to the presence of excellent subtitles in Italian, the video game is perfectly usable even with the lights off, passing over a few easily predictable scare jumps. Indeed, from the point of view of the actual gameplay it also presents partially original ideas, in the face of practically absent replayability. Gameplay Moons of Madness is a first-person horror adventure: a cosmic horror, as defined by the developers, the meeting between Lovecraft and Mars. The exploratory component is at the very basis of the gameplay, and in some situations the walking simulator soul of the production is undeniable (but at least an interesting walking simulator). Shane moves along predictable corridors, and in closed or open areas, however extremely small. Difficult to get lost, difficult not to understand where to go or what to do, also thanks to the help of the wrist navigator. The navigator allows the protagonist to interact with the surrounding environment. Its functions are basically two: it prevents you from getting lost, always indicating the way forward (well, almost always, as you will understand by playing); allows you to connect to the Martian base network, so as to interact with the various mechanisms, vehicles, computers and instruments present. The navigator also plays a key role in solving the small environmental puzzles scattered almost everywhere: usually these are ingenious, inspired and well-executed gimmicks, whose level of difficulty obviously does not reach unattainable peaks, but neither does it settle on trivial simplicity of many hasty productions. They therefore require the right amount of time to be completed, and the right analysis of the objects and game world present. Playstation 4 trophies Moons of Madness comes to PlayStation 4 with particularly valuable trophies, including the Platinum Trophy. Getting it will be extremely simple and linear: just complete the narrative and discover the dark secrets of space. The conversion to PlayStation 4 At the time, the editorial staff reviewed Moons of Madness on PC, where technically speaking it performed quite well. Now we have had the opportunity to test it on a PlayStation 4 Pro and we can confirm that the porting was perfectly successful: no drop in frame rate, graphics that are most of the time remarkable and clean, in short, everything is perfectly in order, beautiful to look at, and distressing to hear. Wanting to do the tax at all costs, in just two moments we found ourselves in difficulty with the conversion of Moons of Madness on PlayStation 4. In one sequence, during an escape from something we don't want to tell you about, we got stuck in a wall: there was nothing we could do ifdon't reload your most recent save (thankfully the levels are short, and Moons of Madness autosaves often). In another case, it took more or less half an eternity to load before we got back to playing. But that's all: just two episodes in an adventure that will still take you at least five hours of your time. Maybe something more if you want to look for each document to understand everything; maybe something less if you already know it and are in a hurry.", "date": "2020-03-24", "grade": "7.5"}
