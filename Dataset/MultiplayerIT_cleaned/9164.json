Titles such as Machinarium, Gemini Rue, Emerald City Confidential but also Amesia: The Dark Descent - wanting to blur the boundaries that define the characteristics of the genre a little - have in recent years given great satisfaction at budget prices, enjoying a small but made up of enthusiasts desperate for something new. Alpha Polaris fits into this groove, representing the five-men-show of a small Finnish team, Turmoil Games, which has dedicated time and resources to the creation of a product that does not shine in terms of originality, construction and value for money, but despite everything does not fail to have positive elements that could convince someone to shell out the 19 euros required for the purchase. Fear in Greenland The protagonist of Alpha Polaris is Rune Knudsen, a young Norwegian scholar who is a guest of a station to search for oil fields in Greenland, an isolated place among the eternal ice used by the multinational of the moment to try to get rich on the soil that was the home of the Inuit. However, the ecological theme is only the background. It represents one of the facets of a first half of the game that is not afraid to take the right time before introducing the second, the more markedly horrific one between spirits of ancient tribes of which knowledge has been lost, murders and strange electromagnetic phenomena. The cast of characters is small and partly stereotyped - there are the researcher at the end of his career, the young woman of Inuit origins in conflict with her roots, the arrogant son of the CEO of the oil company and so on - just as there is no it's a massive amount of environments to explore. On the other hand, the polar setting and some famous sources of inspiration, such as Carpenter's Thing and the X-Files episode Death among the Ice, manage to properly support the presence of an invisible, unknown enemy and master of an isolated place. Too bad therefore for the narrow duration, around 5 hours, and for a very unsatisfactory epilogue that does not reward the efforts made to get there. The alternation of good and less exciting elements, of characters and game phases that are sometimes successful and sometimes not, consequently also influences the dialogues which, dubbed in good English and accompanied by subtitles in the same language, are sometimes interesting and well written, others discounted to the point of being boring. Old-fashioned puzzles Perhaps the most interesting of the peculiar aspects of Alpha Polaris, the way in which Turmoil Games has integrated elements related to the story with the resolution of certain puzzles, manages to increase the degree of identification and at the same time re-propose mechanics that are little used today. It happens that you have to read documents about ancient hieroglyphic-like writing systems and use the notions learned, typing the solution in the appropriate text boxes, to translate those found on a wall or on mysterious artifacts. Or to use a satellite triangulation system to activate GPS connected to a polar bear's collar. Not always all requests make perfect sense at first and large peaks of difficulty are followed by much simpler moments, but the four or five times Alpha Polaris decides to engage the user's neurons, it really does. Except for the more imaginative puzzles and conveyed by less conventional interactions, the rest of the adventure is the classic point and click with a series of objects to use, an inventory to collect the useful ones and the need to unlock new locations and dialogues. All achieved through a third-party middleware, the Wintermute Engine, which combines 3D and 2D elements: the impact is overall good and the environments evocative, but problems such as bad CG sequences, approximate animations and a maximum resolution of 1280x800 which is certainly not in step with the configurations adopted by the most demanding gamers.", "date": "2011-07-20", "grade": "6.8"}
