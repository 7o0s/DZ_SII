Dogs and cats, on the other hand, are extremely similar to their real counterparts under a myriad of aspects and those who have a minimum of knowledge of them cannot fail to be impressed by the very high quality of the simulation, from the point of view of behavior, the way of learning, the reactions and the needs of our furry friends. But let's start at the beginning: the family creation screen. In a completely analogous way to that relating to the creation of our Sims, in this case it is a question of modeling our pets, starting the choice with the species: cat or dog, as we have already said. As a good dog lover as I am, it came natural for me to direct the first choice towards a wagging being belonging to the canine universe and the first surprise was the enormous choice of predefined breeds available. In addition to the more well-known and common breeds (as well as fashionable) we find in fact those less known to most, such as the Borzoi or the Australian Cattle Dog, the Keeshond or the Saluki, well known by those working in the sector, but certainly difficult to meet in the salons of average families. An excellent incentive to get to know rare and exceptional breeds, without losing the possibility of representing your own Fido at home, be it a Labrador, a German Shepherd, a Dalmatian or even a less noble of pedigree, but no less noble of soul, ~simple  mestizo. Of course, in fact, in addition to taking advantage of one of the pre-packaged models, we will be able to create our dog or cat at will and in both cases modify its connotations through the series of options that allow us to work on the color and length of the fur, its texture, the arrangement of any spots or markings on the coat and the physiognomy of the muzzle and body. Once we have created our ideal dog, we will have to decide on its zodiac sign and character inclinations, also following the same principle as for the creation of human characters. And at this point, having created our family, the time has come for us to move to a residential lot. Fluke, the dog man In the famous science fiction story by James Herbert, later filmed with dubious success, Fluke was a dog resulting from the reincarnation of a man who died in an accident, forced to learn the rules of the canine world while looking for his family. In our case, leaving aside the tragic notes and the reincarnations, we find ourselves witnessing a singular phenomenon, but less unusual than one might think: our pets, while not being able to avail themselves of real independence, are able to contribute to the he performance of the domestic economy, thanks to the introduction of trades that we can make them carry out and the related salary, which will add up to the budget of our family nucleus. And it is precisely thanks to this aspect that coexistence with our animals becomes more interesting than it would have been if they had been intended as a simple complement to the domestic environment, and for this we have to thank a dog culture from across the Channel and overseas that has allowed us to see our hairy-faced friends in a much less superficial way than we are used to. Our sim-dogs, as well as our sim-cats, in fact have complex characters, and associative intelligence which, as in reality, are exploited here to allow us to teach behaviors and commands. These training principles are in fact divided into two different categories of approach: the teachings aimed at making the animal learn which are the rules to follow for a happy coexistence and the training commands which, although superfluous in daily life, will be able to the relationship with their Sims and to advance in the job category chosen for them. Fluke, the dog man The first category, the one relating to education, was able to make us smile more than once thinking of the tragicomic difficulties that every lucky dog or cat owner has inevitably experienced. In fact, what is the puppy that doesn't destroy some furniture by biting its teeth, the kitten that hasn't done the same by sharpening its nails, the puddles to roll around in, the beds to sleep on, the needs to manage? Even their virtual counterparts need to learn how to feel at home, even if in the case of the Simminis we can take a little more liberties and prefer an aggressive animal rather than a friendly one, destructive rather than capable of letting off steam on its own toys and carpet-smearers,rather than a happy user of walks or a sandbox. Naturally, if we let them do it themselves, it is very probable that their natural inclinations are the ones we least like, so it will be better to roll up their sleeves and not miss an opportunity to praise or correct them according to what they decide to do. A dog that destroys furniture, for example, if scolded when caught in the act will learn not to do it anymore, just as a cat can be taught to do its business in the litter box rather than around the house, with the same system. Provided that we have remembered to buy the box, of course, and in this regard it is good to remember that animals, even if virtual, are a commitment as well as an educational one, also an economic one, and we must not neglect their needs in terms of food, walks, play and affection, as well as education. The part dedicated to work is also similar, albeit simpler, than that of human sims. We will have to look in the newspaper, accept one and then increase the capabilities of our animals according to the request, training them to play dead, for example, or to stand on their paws in the case of an actor dog, to obey in the case of an animal that we will direct towards the therapeutic animal career (for Pet Therapy) and so on. In fact, we can decide to raise a good number of animals which, once well trained, will bring home more than decent salaries, allowing us not to work and devote ourselves to social relationships such as raising a family, depending on the aspirations we have chosen. . Lady and the Tramp Our Sim-Pets, alas, like their real-life counterparts, are too short-lived than we would like. Despite the help, possibly, of a life-extending bowl won as an aspiration prize, they are destined to leave us. To ease the (virtual?) pain of losing our friends, however, Maxis has made possible the mating and relative birth of worthy offspring of our animals. Even if in real life this job should be left to the breeders, in the virtual one we can indulge ourselves in creating crossings of all kinds, and even register the newly created ~breeds~ with a special body, reachable with a simple phone call, which will not other than inserting them into the game database, making them available for future use. Pets naturally arrives with its baggage of dedicated objects, even if we have to admit that the choice is really not very vast, being reduced to cushions, toys, bowls and accessories. However, there are a series of unlockable bonus items, which however do not compensate for the absence of real pet shops, where it is perhaps possible to participate in small beauty and education competitions. As far as the graphics are concerned, specifically the rendering of the Pets' appearance and animations, we must admit that we are faced with an excellent job: the animals move and behave in a truly realistic way and even if we are faced with a market which is no stranger to animal simulations, one for all the famous Nintendogs, it seems clear that a non-superficial study has been made on the basis of canine and feline behavior. Conclusions In conclusion, we are faced with one of the most successful expansions in the universe of life simulators, capable of filling our Simmini's houses in a truly full-bodied way, making them resonate with barks and meows and engaging the players who had found themselves in no longer knowing how to oil the game dynamics with really nice elements. Not negligible is the possibility of launching real educational messages towards the more (and less) young people who wish to bring a real animal into their homes, admonishing them to realize the enormous commitment that follows, if the virtual one is able already have a lot to do. The well-designed animations and interactions are certainly capable of making us spend several hours glued to the screen, between amused and frustrated, hardly bored. A must for Sims fans; a great buy for newcomers to the series. Pros Pets are extremely configurable, thanks to the same creation menu as the ~human~ Sims Excellent rendering of animal behavior and animations Possibility of career and reproduction Cons Scarcity of implemented objects Only cats and dogs can be managed The second chapter of the life simulation saga that everyone knows has followed in the footsteps of the first, bringing to the public a large and interesting series of expansions that have added luster and vitality to the universe in which our Simmers move. Could not miss, even in this generation of Sims, the introduction of an add on that permhe wanted to support our virtual creatures with pets, which cheer them up and fill their lives.", "date": "2006-11-15", "grade": null}
