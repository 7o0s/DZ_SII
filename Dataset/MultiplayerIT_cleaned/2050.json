{"name": "Gun Metal", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gun-metal_b.html", "text": "Technically speaking From the countless photos I've included at the end of this review and from the videos I've shot, you can easily see the graphic quality that sets this title apart. Everything moves very well without heavy slowdowns or nasty bad clipping effects. Everything looks very nice, from the Briefing screen, which updates you on the plans of the mission that awaits you, to the simple but nice loading screen. The textures used are generally on excellent levels, even if the ~aquatic~ effects are certainly not the best (forget the realistic waters of Transword or the sinuous waves of the waters of Morrowind). Even the devastating effects of our shots will be seen (as well as heard), with smoke, bullet holes, exploded shell casings and anything else necessary to make us feel we are driving a machine with unstoppable destructive power. It's a pity that the programmers decided to make our destructive effects disappear about ten seconds after their appearance, preventing us from ~repainting~ the environment with colors of fire and death!!! At least the destroyed enemy vehicles will remain on the battlefield to make a fine show of themselves, like monumental war trophies. The developers have also tried to give a certain degree of ~destructive~ freedom, which initially increases the player's interest, but which quickly exhausts its contents, limiting the ~gradual~ damage that static elements do a little too much (or side dish, if you prefer) around us suffer. A clear example are the trees, we can cut them down simply by hitting them, we can ~prun~ them by shooting at them (actually it's as if we halved them in height), but we can't see them catch fire or crumble under our repeated blows. Do you know Soldier Of Fortune's revolutionary damage capture system? When we shoot an enemy and he falls to the ground we can ~want~, hit him repeatedly and depending on the weapon used it is even possible to literally dismember him. Here most of the surrounding elements can only be ~scratched~ and destroyed directly, without gradual changes of state (the animals show no signs of pain or suffering, until they suddenly explode in a shower of bloody limbs) , sometimes without even being able to change the morphology (anthropomorphic) of the surrounding environment (inexplicably indestructible elements such as the farms of the first level)... a sketch of what we will see in Mech Assault for example. The audio department looks good, with deep and full-bodied sound effects, adrenaline-pumping and pressing music; the latter can be replaced by our personal compilations present on the HD. And here I have to congratulate the developers, because although this is a very simple option, not everyone adopts it. After all, if the Xbox allows us to choose the music that we think is most suitable for the game, why not enable this option? Why deprive ourselves of the pleasure of facing exciting clashes to the rhythm of Metallica or perhaps the soundtrack of Braveheart? Playability As I previously wrote, the limitations on the destruction of the surrounding elements is the only real negative note to the excellent playability of this title. The controls are well studied (and in any case reconfigurable via a specific option), the vehicle responds promptly to the commands given and the possibility of activating (and deactivating) the automatic aim can be of help to those who are beginners or are not very comfortable with aim with an analog stick. The idea of making the vehicle transformable enriches the gameplay, already substantial in itself, thanks to the presence of many weapons and various gadgets, which can be used according to your configuration. Therefore, your arsenal will be different depending on whether you are transformed into a Mech or a Jet. In both cases, you will have great firepower at your disposal, ranging from assault rifles to Napalm bombs, from self-guided missiles to generators of ionic rays. A very nice assortment, which can also be selected before each mission. The number of weapons available, in conjunction with the transformability of the vehicle and the distinct characteristics that the two forms of trim offer, leave us ample room for play. We can therefore decide in different ways how to ~cook~ our enemies, whether to burn them with rapid flying raids, whether to flush them out one by one on the ground, or mix both as we want. In short, the playability of this title is really excellent, a little from all points of view, adaptable even to those who are beginners, customizable in the fighting style and in the choice of our structure before stake the field, excellent controls and overall full of good ideas. Longevity Unfortunately the longevity of the title is ~far~ from being excellent (excuse the pun). The missions available to us, however diversified in objectives and environmental themes (snow, mountains, cities, etc.), will be only 15; but the TOTAL (ARGH!!! Rage and outrage!) lack of multiplayer mode limits this title to a childish longevity. Even those (like me) who are passionate about all mech games, even those who have played the excellent series of Armored Core (published by From Software ... I hope a lot in Murakumo) and most of the crap that Bandai churned out time ago with the poor Gundam, will be disappointed by the brevity of this title, which I repeat at most you will replay once or twice. Why am I so sure that at least once you will replay it? But because if you are really passionate about this genre, you will not be able to resist the possibility of replaying the title with all the weapons collected since the first mission! An immense ridicule of power and destruction from the first poor and ~defenseless~ (compared to you, of course) enemies! The multiplayer modes could be the real lifeline for this title, and together with the excellent playability and the good graphics sector, decree Gun Metal in the Olympus of Xbox video games. If desired, there would be an embarrassment of choice on the possible multiplayer modes: the cooperative, for example, with at least 2 friends to face the various missions pumped with twice as many enemies, or the classic deathmatch with the possibility of using all the means present in Gun Metal, both allies and enemies, perhaps unlocking them only after completing the game 3 times or completing special requests, and so on. The Rage programmers made a big mistake, which I can't and won't let go unnoticed. But how do you have the multiplayer console par excellence in your hands and not even one, and I stress one, multiplayer mode is programmed? In conclusion Considering all its aspects, Gun Metal remains a good title; which seems to take its cue from the forthcoming ~Mechnian~ titles, without however mixing all their ideas (such as the transformation into a Robotech-style jet and the great interaction with the environment seen in Mech Assault) with the right depth (in this case I'm only referring to Mech Assault). Graphics and audio behave very well, without ever giving us the opportunity to turn up our noses, the complete localization and excellent playability partially save this title from the very low longevity and the disarming absence of multiplayer modes. Gun Metal is an intense and very enjoyable mix of action and adrenaline, with good ideas and discreet technical realization. I would recommend it above all to fans of the genre, who will enjoy the great fun lavished by the 15 missions without worrying about its brevity. Like a cold drink in a very hot summer, you will drink as long as there is it was nice while it lasted. Pros: EVERYTHING completely in ITALIAN! Solid graphics engine, with no noticeable slowdowns; Excellent playability, both for the controls and for the arcade style of play; Variety of weapons, well studied and characterized (there is also a weapon that reminds me of the Tribes disc launcher!!!). Well-characterized music and sound effects, with the possibility of using our own personal compilations. Cons: NO multiplayer mode!!! Only 15 missions. Richia to last too little. Some gameplay elements, such as the ability to destroy surrounding elements, are poorly implemented. Not all graphic effects are at excellent levels (water above all) and some of the ~graphic~ damage we cause (such as bullet holes on the ground) disappear after about ten seconds. I want to repeat it one last time: NO multiplayer mode!!! Materials: Special Screenshots Preview Screenshots Exclusive Videos (about 50mb of divx), specially shot for the Review. Packaging and Localization Finally guys I can recover from the full English session of Azurik, with this adrenaline-pumping Rage title, translated in every part, from the paper support (manual and box) to the digital support (both AUDIO and texts). Naturally not everyone will like the voices chosen, the degree of ~participation~ (or identification) of the poor dubber on duty, but in my opinion, what we are faced with is ~always~ better than nothing. Moreover, the effort made begins to be important when you don't stop at the translation of the texts and/or the insubtitles are mentioned, but voice actors are also called into question; all to make the title more engaging and attractive. For this I personally thank the Leader who has decided to entirely localize this very interesting title.", "date": "2002-07-24", "grade": null}
