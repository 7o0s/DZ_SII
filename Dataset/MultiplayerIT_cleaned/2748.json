A lively community, with developers who have been able to keep the game up to date and always fresh while never going to destroy that impressive house of cards made up of statistics and strategy of its kind. In addition to all this, Riot has built a majestic universe of events, merchandise, tournaments and PoP culture phenomena around its flagship title, such as to enter history by right. However, Riot did not feel satisfied and wanted to do more in the last period of time, adding many other valuable titles to its only and immense son, invading other markets. The house has ventured into shooters with Valorant, has tried to counter the success of Hearthstone with Legends of Runeterra and in the near future there will also be fighting games and RPGs ready to further expand the catchment area, not more than just League of Legends but of imagery that revolves around it. The League of Legends: Wild Rift review talks about what is only the last of the titles involved and after spending several hours on it we are finally ready to sum it up before the official launch here. Designed to last a long time Wild Rift is the mobile version of League of Legends, in short, but it would be limiting to fit it into these confines. Riot's new MOBA is in fact something much deeper, a product designed to be usable by casual players, more than League of Legends already is, and even has the audacity and the goal not to leave behind even the most competitive part of that fringe of players. After a long beta in Asia, Wild Rift has therefore also arrived here in Europe, with the opening of the servers scheduled for December 10, 2020 officially and we were incredibly curious to try it in preview, to find out how Riot could transform League of Legends in such a way as to make it usable on Tablets and Mobile devices, but above all to understand how playability could be affected in this way. Arena of Valor and Vain Glory had already shown how simple it was to bring MOBAs to consoles and mobile phones and it has always left us perplexed to see a motionless Riot get such a large slice of the market eaten up by two competitors who were exploiting it beautifully idea and even the mechanics of the heroes, almost as if it were repeating the mistake Blizzard made with DOTA. Today, however, we have another panorama and if it is true that the MOBA genre is no longer to be explored, League of Legends is now an extremely loved and recognizable brand and it will be the same Garen, Draven, Lux and company that will attract the players. Since the tutorial, in fact, it is clear how Riot has wanted to keep the same atmosphere of the PC version intact, taking advantage of the same dubbing, the same vibrant colors and even faithfully reproducing the animations of the various skills so as to offer that indispensable continuum not to leave bewildered all those players who wish to make a platform jump. Mind you though, Wildrift is not in the most absolute way a simple port, so much so that even the Riot account will manage the two products completely separately. Wildrift and LoL do not share progress, ranking and, unfortunately in our view, even already unlocked characters and skins, as well as currency. We are basically dealing with a completely new product, but we have to admit that having to buy back champions and skins that we have already spent money on has bothered us. Riot tries to help us in this sense by paying homage to League of Legends veterans with Champions and skin packs as a reward, but this is not enough to remove that bitter aftertaste that we would have gladly avoided. The biggest problem for users, therefore, will be that of not wanting to move to the new platforms given the time and money spent on PCs, a problem that competitors usually have to face to compete head-to-head with LoL, but which now Riot will have to deal with internally. Times halved for quick and adrenaline-pumping matches Once this obstacle has been overcome, which obviously concerns only veterans and not all new players, a game world opens up almost on a 1:1 scale with small changes to the gameplay designed to cut the duration of the games in half. Does not change the map to three lanes, with the intention of reaching the enemy nexus by destroying towers on the way to winthe game, as well as the strategies underlying the title, with a general feeling substantially identical to the older brother. Minions will appear immediately at the start of the match and even the biggest monsters in the jungle will have their spawn times significantly reduced, including Baron Nashor. Such a high speed of play is accompanied by expedients also for what concerns the gain of experience, but above all that of gold. The last hit mechanic is in fact still present, but now the champions get gold even if they are close to a minion that dies, with a penalty of course, but still giving a constant stream of income. This makes the need to lane as long as possible all the more important, a necessity furthered by the healing pods now placed directly behind the towers, so as to avoid having to use recall to base after any trade instead. The possibility of earning gold even without giving the final blow to enemy minions is also due to the fact that the precision of the controls, especially in such excited moments, is not exactly the best when we use the classic touch scheme. It will certainly take some getting used to and Riot to simplify the matter has also inserted special buttons with which to define the attack priorities between minions and towers, so as not to start too many accidental shots. We are convinced, however, that in the first few months of the game, champions that are easy to play and lacking skillshots like Garen or Master Yi will be the best performing ones, among the approximately 50 available at launch, and probably abused by those who want to quickly climb the rankings. Just ranked matches return in a specular way compared to what was seen on League of Legends, with a competitive sector in turmoil and already in the plans of the organizers. Beautiful to see We told you before that this title represented a real new product, almost as if it were a new and updated version of League of Legends and in fact there are many details even higher than the PC version. Meanwhile, the models of the heroes have been rebuilt and are as beautiful as ever, complete with exclusive animations and a presentation of the different skins head and shoulders above what was seen on PC. The game interface is comfortable even if we often found ourselves disoriented by the new position of the map, now in the upper left instead of the lower right, but it is the changes to the objects that will require the most study time ever. In fact, the new speed of acquisition of the items will significantly change the purchasing priorities and the presence of completely new objects will revolutionize the way we are used to playing on PC, with a goal that in all probability will differentiate itself enormously by creating its own ecosystem, following from dedicated patches and updates aimed exclusively at Wildrift. Similarly, not all old characters will be ported to Wildrift and it is possible that some of the old champions will be completely revised in terms of functionality to adapt to the new devices, with Riot already ready to look very far into the future of Wild Rift.", "date": "2020-12-07", "grade": "8.5"}
