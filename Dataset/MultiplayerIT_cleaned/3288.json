Since the seminal Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, the elements common to practically all members of the genre have always been the three-dimensional environments, the frenetic execution of increasingly complex tricks, the flamboyant look and a rock-style soundtrack. Well, none of this finds space in Skate City, which gives the Apple Arcade catalog a decidedly disengaged experience in gameplay and almost twilight in tone. On the skateboard in relaxation Developed by Agens and published by Snowman (the team responsible for Alto's Adventure and the recent Where Cards Fall), Skate City is a game to be enjoyed in small doses and without too much effort, unlike similar products that instead require patience and application in order to master the stunts better. The action develops on a two-dimensional plane, using a control system that aims for simplicity as much as possible. The only visible virtual key is used to push the skateboard forward with your foot, while to perform the basic tricks you need to swipe your finger on the right or left side of the display, obtaining different results depending on the direction chosen: the more complex evolutions require to add to this even touches to the corners of the screen, for a mechanism that is fluid and intuitive, but not without defects. The swipe detection is not flawless, and it often happens that the software does not understand the desired input from the user, an eventuality that proves to be particularly annoying in events that require you to perform specific tricks. Using a physical controller solves the problem but creates another one, as the greater precision is achieved by sacrificing much of the immediacy of touch controls. As we said at the beginning, however, Skate City is not one of those titles that requires particular dedication, indeed the contents offered are absolutely within the reach of even the less expert in the field. The game allows you to roam in three different cities (Los Angeles, Oslo and Barcelona, with only the first initially available and the others to be unlocked) by facing well-defined challenges or loitering in endless mode. In the first case we are talking about generally rather short events that require the completion of certain objectives with the classic three-star final evaluation: these are pleasant and also quite varied segments (ranging from the simple execution of tricks to more particular missions such as slalom between passers-by or fleeing the police), which however denote an all too compliant level of challenge and do not guarantee a very great longevity, running out rather quickly. The endless mode performs its obvious function without providing exceptional stimuli, with the only important element represented by some objectives that can be completed to obtain extra credits to spend in the appropriate shop. This sells a whole series of aesthetic frills (clothes and accessories for the character but also parts of the skateboard) and also allows you to improve the statistics of your digital alter ego, but nothing that constitutes an extraordinary incentive to accumulate virtual money. In general, it can be said that the ~relaxed~ attitude of Skate City represents at the same time its best value and its greatest limitation: the Agens title can be enjoyed by literally anyone for a few games in their spare time, but it struggles to involve 100% precisely because of its lack of bite. On the other hand, this vocation for soft tones is also effectively conveyed by the excellent audiovisual sector of the game: pastel colours, soft lights and blurring effects form the background for slightly stylized 3D models but characterized by fluid and well-crafted animations, which are combined with perfectly a soundtrack with a clear chill matrix.", "date": "2020-01-24", "grade": "7.7"}
