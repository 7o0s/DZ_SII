We gamers are very close to us, because that's what it's about: video games. And it does it in a direct way, full of nerdy quotes and terms, that hits the mark. There are also galore fanservices and endless Japanese stereotypes but, considering the success on a global scale, the chances that a real video game would be made from it were very high, and those that it was worthless as many tie-ins ... even more. The odds of it coming to the West? Extremely risky. But instead... surprise! Localized in English, Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment also arrives on the virtual shelves of PlayStation Network to the delight of PlayStation Vita owners, fans of the franchise and those looking for an adventure that, despite all prejudices, amazed us positively. Based on the successful anime of the same name, here is an RPG not without flaws but chock full of content Between Aincrad and Alfheim The story of Sword Art Online isn't particularly intricate, but the way this tie-in unfolds is quite peculiar. To begin with, let's lay a foundation for those who have never seen an episode of the TV series: in a few years MMORPGs will be played with the help of virtual reality viewers and one of these - Sword Art Online, in fact - will be played by a number of people that would put World of Warcraft to shame. The problem is that none of them will be able to disconnect after the first connection: the creator of the software has in fact manipulated the game and trapped the ~minds~ of the players inside it. If one of them dies in the virtual world of Sword Art Online, they also die in reality. Big problem, huh? The solution would apparently be to reach the hundredth floor of the world of Aincrad, and Kirito, the protagonist, intends to do so at all costs. Sword Art Online thus begins but develops by immediately introducing a large cast of supporting characters, among which the beautiful Asuna stands out, a young swordswoman who will fall in love with our hero in return. Well, Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment actually starts from the thirteenth episode of the animated series, when the first narrative arc ends: at which point the story takes a completely different turn from the anime and follows its own path. Without anticipating some twists to those who have not yet seen it and intend to do so, let's just say that our heroes will not break free, as happened in the original story, and will therefore decide to continue exploring the approximately thirty remaining floors of the dungeons. So far, in reality, Hollow Fragment is a kind of ~remake~ of Infinity Moment, a title released for PSP a few years ago. The interesting thing, in fact, is that this PlayStation Vita edition includes the PSP game, skilfully integrated into the new package which also includes an unprecedented parallel storyline, namely that of the Hollow Area that Kirito will discover at the beginning of the game and which he will decide to explore parallel to Aincrad. In other words, the player can decide which storyline to pursue at any time: they intertwine without overlapping and it is possible to go from exploring one area to another and follow the two plots at the same time. Furthermore, that of Hollow Fragment is even more accurate because it introduces a brand new character and a series of interesting twists and turns, while Infinity Moment essentially relies above all on the relationships between the characters and their (very long) chats. Fans of the franchise will discover that Bandai Namco also wanted to pay homage to the two future narrative arcs by adding Leafa and Sinon to the cast with a trick that is actually a bit ridiculous. On the other hand, the ~social/date sim~ aspect of Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment is rather insistent right from the start: the player, in the role of Kirito, can increase his affinity with the many supporting characters who will join the his group, developing loves and friendships that will give life to comic interludes and endless dialogue sequences, sometimes completely dubbed in Japanese, which will please the hardcore fans of the anime but will say very little to those who are not interested in the fanservice. There is a small problem, in fact: the English translation is terrible! do +dps plz xD lol Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment made us smile on more than one occasion, and not because the dialogues at that moment were particularly funny: as we said earlier, the English translation is truly chilling, full of typos and bizarre constructionsgrammatical notes. We'd like to be able to say that, all in all, those who know the anime won't need to understand one hundred percent every dialogue to continue the adventure, or that most of the conversations, being pure fan service, aren't exactly essential to the game. gameplay, but the reality is that the translation problems also extend to the description of missions, skills and objectives which, in some cases, appear practically incomprehensible at first glance. It takes a few hours of practice to become familiar with each abbreviation or term in the game so you can work around inaccurate translations with an ounce of intuition, also because Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment is a damned complex game. And we're saying it in a good way: to be a ~simple~ tie-in it was developed with a truly astounding attention to detail towards its sources and languages and ~MMO~ mechanics. The first impression it will make on the more ~old~ ones is that of a new .hack//, a multimedia series with a few years behind it now that attempted various original solutions in terms of gameplay, starting with the fact that it also simulated an MMORPG, even though it was played disconnected from the Internet. Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment does, too, and damn well. The ~world~ of Aincrad is populated by NPCs that simulate real players, always wandering around the maps or the main hub, balloons on their heads reciting bits of their speech caught as we pass. We will find our adventure companions in a handy friend list that constantly updates us on their position: you don't want them to always be in the same place, right? In the maps it is not uncommon to come across small groups engaged in fighting enemies, players who we can help or ignore beautifully and who, in the first case, will often thank us with an e-mail. In short, the Bandai Namco title does its best to mimic the spirit and atmosphere of an MMO, and it also succeeds from a gameplay point of view since it basically shares a considerable complexity with online RPGs that could even be alienating for those who have never seen a single episode of the anime or five minutes of World of Warcraft on YouTube. The interface is, in fact, quite chaotic, full of icons, hotkeys and different menus that are called up by pressing various combinations of keys. It takes more than a few minutes to get familiar with the control system (in this sense, the need to constantly adjust the camera dancer doesn't help) and stop opening windows at random; better to sift through the various menus and play for a few hours without changing the interface, timidly starting to change things only after you are soon familiar with the importance and priority of objects, skills and spells. In short, it is fortunate that the combat system is not as complicated as it initially appears. PSVita trophies Unlocking the fifty-four Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment trophies is far from easy. Apart from the fact that some risk jumping by mistake, forcing us to start the adventure over again, others require a commitment, both in single player and in multiplayer, which should not be underestimated. Kirito's harem Kirito doesn't have to face the dangers of Aincrad and the Hollow Area alone: he can ask his friends from Sword Art Online to join his group and explore the dungeons together. In fact, party play is a core feature of Sword Art Online, for a variety of reasons. To begin with, by improving the affinity with the various protagonists - all infatuated with Kirito, by the way ... - it is possible to unlock alternative costumes and additional skits, and the fanservice is fixed. From a purely gameplay point of view, however, the fights are based almost entirely on what, in MMO jargon, is commonly defined as ~threat~ or ~aggro~: in Hollow Fragment it is called Risk and it is an indicator that fills up every time Kirito hits an enemy or uses an ability. The more it increases, the less damage Kirito deals to the target; moreover, when the indicator reaches its peak, the enemy will concentrate all his attacks on our hero and to prevent him from having a bad end it will be necessary to ask our partner to intervene, attracting the attention of the monster on duty. This way, Kirito's Risk gauge will drain and we'll be able to deal standard damage again... but we'll also have to make sure to fill it up again to prevent our party mate from taking too much damage: it doesn't matter who dies first, it's Game Over anyway, and you start over at the start of the current map losing all progress. The fights, in Sword Art Online, in short, they are a mix of action and strategy: the skills and attacks are linked in real time, but we must always analyze the situation and the status of our ally. There's another element to take into consideration, and that's the fact that Kirito is a super player while the others well, no. Here, then, we will have to scold or encourage them when they use certain skills or tactics: their artificial intelligence will remember our ~suggestions~ and will tend to behave accordingly. This allows us to ~design~ the behavior of each character, perhaps specializing one in healing and another in support or weakening skills. Everything is intertwined with a sort of ~dating sim~ just sketched and the exploration of dungeons after dungeons, looking for enemies to kill to progress in the story and complete the various side missions or simply chests to open to get your hands on new pieces of equipment and materials that will allow us to upgrade the old ones. Unfortunately, however, very little changes from floor to floor and the level design of the dungeons, almost all in corridors, does not help much in terms of variety: if the Hollow Area appears decidedly pleasing to the eye, precisely because it was conceived for PlayStation Vita, Aincrad has all the look of a PSP game, washed out textures and old generation tight polygonal modeling. The character models are, on the other hand, excellently made and animated: a pity for the slowness of the clashes, which initially makes your nose turn up a bit, at least until you get used to it and become familiar with the battle system, focusing more on its strategic aspect.", "date": "2014-09-24", "grade": "8.0"}
