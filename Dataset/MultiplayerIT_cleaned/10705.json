Despite the well-founded doubts, the facts have shown a good user interest in this genre, so much so that even Square has decided to take the field on the Microsoft console. Return now with this Star Ocean, developed by tri-Ace and exclusive to XBox 360, which, willy-nilly, prepares the market for the upcoming Final Fantasy XIII. The tri-Ace guys have put a saga back on track that began 13 years ago and have transferred it to XBox 360 with the foresight to keep the game universe intact, including the final, without tying the use of this chapter to the rest of the saga. The only formula capable of performing this miracle is that of the prequel, an increasingly popular option in an attempt to broaden or shift the interest relating to a brand. Humanity fleeing from itself The calendar returns to the year zero, a good 772 years before the grand finale, when the third world war has just broken out on earth. The atomic threat becomes a reality and our beloved planet is turned into a wasteland. The few survivors, including the rejuvenated versions of Bush and Saddam, can only see the folly of mankind, shake hands and roll their eyes. Paradoxically, despite being a separate episode, developed on a Western machine, The Last Hope ends up investigating the roots of the main theme of the series. We are talking about the destructive nature of intelligent beings, an element of great interest for modern science fiction and a real obsession for Japanese authors. And this is how man, torn apart by the self-destruction of his own race, seeks answers and salvation in space but ends up colliding with different forms of destruction that threaten the existence of other races. In this case, various situations refer to the lust for technology and power which, even if used for beneficial purposes, can only lead to harmful consequences. Contextualizing Star Ocean in Western culture, we could define it as a halfway point between The Lord of the Rings and Star Trek, obviously characterized by profoundly different tones and colors. Functional paradoxes Star Ocean is simply the union between extreme science fiction and pure fantasy that doesn't bother to fully explain the coexistence of iron swords and experimental spaceships. On the other hand, the setting, just like in the classic Star Trek, is made up of planets who are at different stages of development and the all-Japanese pleasure of building timeless characters places them in a limbo where everything is believable precisely because nothing wants to be. The result allows Star Ocean to populate itself with a series of functional stereotypes for the unfolding of the plot without these having to be pertinent to the fantastic setting. One of the most striking examples is represented by the stunt doubles of Bush and Saddam who appear in the introductory film. There is no shortage of the swaggering oriental-style capitalist, despicable but necessary for progress, closely followed by enchantresses, scarred war heroes and the ever-present mascot who is responsible for representing simplicity and lightening the hearts of comrades in times of crisis. The result is a set of not too original elements, but which has the advantage of immersing us in a veritable ocean of stars. Real Time JRPG Without a shadow of a doubt, the strength of Star Ocean is the combat system that takes place in real time while maintaining the infinity of spells, actions, special moves and objects typical of any self-respecting jrpg. The Last Hope is no exception and maintains the possibility, introduced in the third installment of the series, to link combinations by increasing the damage for each linked sequence. Furthermore, by attacking, parrying blows or taking damage, the assault bar is loaded which, once filled, allows you to perform dynamic special moves whose effectiveness depends on a quick quick time event based on the rapid pressure of a specific key. A second use of the assault gauge activates a sort of fury mode during which the character attacks faster and cannot be knocked down. Unfortunately for us, even the opponents can rely on the assault mode and it is therefore impossible to knock them down or keep them away once activated. The fight therefore takes place according to an agitated logic of blow and response and, even if the parry is automatic and depends on a characteristic of the character, we are given the possibility of going around our target by holding down the B key and discarding to the side at the moment exactly where the advrsario carries an offensive move. To be sure of keeping the right target it is necessary to lock it by pressing the left stick of the pad, an action that is not too easy in the most agitated situations since it is impossible to select a target with precision. The only method, a bit complicated, is to keep moving in the direction of the objective until the much coveted indicator appears. A real shame given that the title includes an aggro system, or a system that manages the aggression of the opponents towards our characters, and introduces the related system of distracting the enemy from a target, in full World of Warcraft style. The result is strategies that allow you to direct an enemy towards the character who can defend himself better, but whose effectiveness is weakened by the difficult management of aiming. Ultimately this Star Ocean offers a combat system very rich in possibilities which is based both on the usual resistances to certain elements and on the timing of the attack and which finds its full dimension only when it comes to facing the infamous bosses, many of which they must be hit in vulnerable points that are not always accessible. Standing, fleeing, and avoiding special attacks is often imperative. Tactical JRPG During combat, accessing the menu pauses the game and allows the player to select specific actions or change the tactics of unused characters directly. In fact, it is possible to directly use only one of the four characters that can be used simultaneously on the battlefield. At the beginning of the fight we automatically find ourselves in the role of the leader, but it is enough to press a button to take control of the companions. Then there are a series of enhancement spells, in buff jargon, a series of passive skills and a grid with 14 tiles that are filled by performing specific actions such as eliminating two enemies with a single blow. There are four types of tiles and they produce cumulative effects ranging from the increase in experience gained in combat to the recovery of life points and magic points, money or points to be allocated to skills. This is an extremely interesting introduction that allows you to specialize your group to get what you need at any given time faster. Unfortunately when the character controlled by the player suffers a critical hit the bonuses are eliminated but it is possible to limit the losses by chaining more bonuses of the same color. The strategic component includes the ability to select specific spells or moves to assign to characters not directly controlled or to set a generic tactic that tells the character whether to use magic, beat hands or stay out of trouble. Finally, as icing on the cake, the BEAT system appears, a further characterization of the characters in battle that allows you to place a fighter in offensive, neutral or defensive mode with the consequent increase in attack, attack and defense or defense only characteristics . The offensive and defensive modes, among other things, increase in level, and therefore in effectiveness, with use. Walking above the stars The exploratory part of The Last Hope is largely based on the collection of materials and treasures, it is not particularly demanding and there are few crossroads that can put us in difficulty. In a nutshell, every road, or almost, takes us to a useful area, excluding the final stage focused precisely on the loss of orientation. The map is full of enemies eager to attack us, but easy to evade thanks to the possibility of taking a shot. The usefulness of the shot is twofold as it allows you to avoid surprise attacks and to carry them out in turn, bypassing the enemies and charging them from behind with a consequent bonus in the combat phase. Alongside the exploration phase, the dungeons certainly cannot be missing, represented from time to time by secret bases, spaceships and ancient temples, within which we are called to solve a series of simple but intriguing puzzles. Finally we come to the cities, quite small to tell the truth, but full of missions that are more reminiscent of a classic adventure than a jrpg. Many quests are in fact integrated with the crafting system that allows you to build, repair and combine objects to obtain what is required of us from time to time. However, it is not necessary to obsessively practice any activity offered by the game, the level of the characters grows rapidly and skill points accumulate just as quickly, which are used to unlock special moves and passive abilities, a factor that allows the battle system to reach its maximum potential very soon. The saves, often too numerous, are almost absent in the two larger dungeons, forcing you to face long game sessions or to retrace your steps to save without losing all progress. Luckily, rest stops exist here and there that restore characters to full energy. As for crafting we are faced with an excellent characterization. The tutor, the nagging Welch, from time to time involves the entire group in sequences that sometimes underline aspects of a character's character or in other cases provide information on the Star Ocean universe. The number of objects that can be made is extremely high and offers a series of foods, magic cards and bonuses of all kinds alongside the classic potions, based on percentages that avert the danger of having dozens of useless vials in the inventory. The synthesis skill that is obtained during the game is very useful and allows you to upgrade objects and transfer bonuses. There are two ways that lead to increasing the number of craftable objects and both are integral parts of the game. Through the exploration and elimination of specific enemies we can find a large part of the recipes available but we can also make use of the knowledge and work skills acquired by the characters through a sort of laboratory of ideas. In fact, it is possible to create working groups of 4 characters who can combine their respective knowledge to invent and discover new objects to build at the cost of one skill point for each second of research. Ultimately we find the private actions, short flashes of authentic role-playing represented by private dialogues between the protagonist and his companions. During these dialogues it is possible to make a choice between different answers that will unlock the possibility of accessing extra cutscenes. Xbox 360 goals There are 310 points that are obtained by completing the game in normal mode, another 100 by completing it on the highest difficulties and a further 80 by defeating two optional bosses. To unlock the rest of the objectives it is necessary to deal with the surrounding elements of the game, collecting all the data, recipes and treasures, performing a series of specific actions during combat and trying your hand at crafting, the arena and the not very easy race some rabbits. Conquering the entire loot, made up of the canonical 1000 points, requires a good deal of patience and time. Technical compartment The closer view than in the past, especially in enclosed spaces, increases the sensation of exploring unknown worlds and increases identification with the character. Unfortunately, the covered areas such as bases, caves and spaceships do not enjoy a particularly inspired design, they have a lighting system that is not always at the top, some unpleasant collisions and you often find yourself surrounded by fluctuating textures that are unable to shake off the spectrum of repetitiveness even when they enjoy translucent or other effects. Outdoors, however, the lighting is of a very different nature, much more valid and supported by various graphic effects, so much so as to sometimes leave you fascinated. Grasslands covered by the shadow of the clouds open the way to evocative castles overlooking water courses. Unfortunately once you enter the villages and cities you realize that they are quite small, characterized by simple architecture. The speech is different for the character models, cared for and animated with great detail. Endless motion capture sessions have enriched the title with a series of animations that make each character unique. A not negligible defect is represented by the pop up of the monsters that suddenly appear on our path. On the other hand, the quality of the dialogues is not as articulated. Excluding some key moments that are more cared for, we are often faced with somewhat childish jokes and in more than one case we are offered uninvolving dialogues. There are good moments, able to involve the player, but in general the general quality is fluctuating, not helped by the lack of a background sound outline in some situations. Fortunately, the interlude sequences are many and often beautifully done, but even in this case the specter of discontinuity extracts some footage from the hat that could easily be deleted without any consequences. Providentially tri-Ace gives us the opportunity to skip those movies that we are not interested in, we do not like or we have already seen, however, providing us with an exhaustive summary of what is shown.", "date": "2009-06-10", "grade": "8.0"}
