{"name": "L'onore del disonore", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/109423-dishonored-lonore-del-disonore.html", "text": "Set in the fictional city of Dunwall, Dishonored is a completely single-player FPS that leaves no room for side-game modes or multiplayer and has a strong story focus. Precisely for this reason, the work carried out by the developer to create a credible and above all coherent universe was enormous. The artistic inspiration is that of a Victorian London in disarray where a strange form of highly aggressive plague is decimating the poorest population while the aristocracy remains well away from the plebs, locked up in rich palaces to pass the time between festivities and banquets. Leading scientists are investing their time to find a cure, and the empress of this rapidly decaying state is desperate to help deal with the plague. You, Corvo Attano, his bodyguard, have been sent on a long mission to find a solution to the problem but, at the start of the game, you return to Dunwall empty-handed, ready to break the bad news to the queen to whom you are bound by boundless respect and equally affection. In this piece of gameplay, moving your gaze around you can see the decadence of a dying nation. The ruined neighborhoods, the feeble sun on the horizon that tries to pierce the gray that suffocates the capital fueled by the huge chimneys that burn whale oil, the main source of energy used to power the technologies of that world. Once we arrive at the palace, Emily, the daughter of the empress, welcomes us and the affection that binds the two is immediately evident and serves as a clever ploy to get us familiar with the stealth system and more generally with the controls of the game. And in an instant we enter the heart of the action: it takes a second to understand that everything is about to fall apart and the only hope for a rosy future of the nation is dying in our arms and while we caress the face of the regent with our hands stained with blood, we realize that Emily has been kidnapped, two guards are pointing their weapons at us and the right arm of the empress is labeling us as traitors to the homeland. We don't want to mention further crucial steps in the plot, to avoid the risk of spoilers, but it is enough to know that our journey of rebirth to discover all the implications of the ruthless court move that allowed the new Lord Regent to take power with weapons and to extend his violent dictatorship over the country, starts from our captivity and will very soon lead us to meet the Outsider, a supernatural entity who will grant us special powers, transforming us into ruthless and practically unstoppable assassins. Dishonored lives and thrives in numerous dualisms: a highly industrialized civilization but constantly crossed by the almost religious adoration for the Outsider, a protagonist who carries out his activities as a ruthless murderer without ever neglecting his great humanity which leads him to know and attend civilian victims, often defenseless, of the dictatorship, but above all a gameplay completely unbalanced towards the most extreme stealth but which constantly leaves the possibility of performing in the most total action in the hands of the player. Assassin's Creed in first person? It is not easy to define the peculiar gameplay of Dishonored: the title is indeed a first-person shooter but immediately abandons the extreme linearity that distinguishes the genre especially in the current generation of consoles and PCs. Almost as if it were free roaming, but it would be more correct to call it a sandbox, the title puts us in front of a target to be assassinated in each mission but leaves us total freedom of action in reaching it and putting an end to its ruthless life by sometimes crossing levels endless connected to each other by a central hub where you can relax, upgrade your equipment and receive instructions on the next mission. The freedom in choosing the path is truly extreme and in some cases it has literally blown us away by showcasing the enormous depth of Arkane Studios' design work. There is a lot of Thief in this Dishonored especially in the spatial and vertical construction of the settings and if even the nine levels that make up the single player campaign will always happen one after the other, the enormous freedom granted to the player to complete them has often repercussions on the development of the events of the following ones and it is a factor that one is not easily used to in an FPS but, at best, only in an RPG. Earlier we told you about nine total levels but, don't worry, because the writer took almost eighteen hoursto complete the entire adventure dedicating himself a lot to the exploration of the maps and pushing strongly on the stealth component. Two factors that certainly push up the counter of the hours necessary to see the epilogue even if probably the fastest and least attentive to detail players will not struggle to archive the story in a scant dozen hours. In fact, Dishonored gives its best when played in an extremely careful, silent and reflective way, when in short everything is bet on the surprise factor, in an attempt to never get caught by the opponents, studying every single room before acting unseen and above all wandering around the as possible through the streets of the city by exploring hard-to-reach areas and talking to all the non-player characters that populate Dunwall. This nature of the game is clearly evident not only by the two ~achievements~ that can be earned for each level by never being seen by the guards and by avoiding killing any opponent, including the final target, but also by Corvo's weapons and powers that seem to push towards their more moderate and silent use. With a management of the paraphernalia that smacks a lot of BioShock (but also of the previous Dark Messiah of Might & Magic), the protagonist can equip two offensive tools at the same time with an important limitation. The right hand is in fact always dedicated to Corvo's sword, while weapons and powers alternate from time to time in the left. The former include a pistol, a crossbow, a type of grenade and a mine that can be positioned on the elements of the scenario and ready to explode when touched. By spending the money collected by interacting with the scenario, it is possible to enhance them all by acting on the capacity of the magazines (but you can never go beyond thirty ammunition), on the type of projectiles, such as for example the explosive ones for the pistol, or the tranquilizing dart of the crossbow which we are granted practically from the beginning, and on the reload speed since all the weapons are single shot. The powers granted to Corvo by the Stranger are decidedly more varied: we have seen them in numerous trailers and they are for the most part activated on command, such as the ability to teleport a short distance, to take possession of animals and humans, to slow down time or launch gusts of wind capable of stunning opponents. Then there is the fundamental one for those who want to play in stealth: the dark vision that allows you to see humans and animals even through the walls and observe the visual cone of their gaze, so as to be able to avoid it. But there is also no shortage of passive powers such as greater resistance which transforms into a larger health bar, or the ability to transform killed enemies into dust, effectively making the need to move corpses useless so as not to be found by patrols in reconnaissance. All these ~spells~ can be unlocked first and then upgraded to a further level by collecting runes scattered throughout the game world and, as if this were not enough, to give further depth to the whole system with a great role-playing flavor, there are the amulets bone, additional collectibles that can be found and equipped for a maximum of three at a time, a number that can go up to six through some upgrades, so as to guarantee further passive bonuses. While on the one hand the system allows the player to strongly meet his style of play, properly managing the various upgrades and therefore the evolution of the protagonist, on the other hand it highlights with great force how for the developer Dishonored it should be played with stealth well in mind. The limited capacity of the magazines, but above all the very low variety of weapons, the disproportionate consumption of mana for the most devastating powers in combat, which effectively limits their use during longer-lasting battles and even the impossibility of simultaneously equipping a spell and a firearm, make life very difficult for the player who doesn't want to use his head and who simply wants to carry on with guns blazing. It is often difficult to find satisfaction playing this way and sometimes even enjoy it because there are too many overlapping elements to limit the otherwise disruptive force of the overskilled player and going up with the difficulty level (there are four in all, with only the first , the simplest, which allows you to have automatic regeneration of energy) it is no longer enough to juggle sword parries and pistol shots since the guards become very tough and extremely lethal in returning fire. A chat lengthens life Exploring Dunwall while staying comfortable atif you try to collect all the various paper clues left by the NPCs, reading the books that also serve as insights into the lore of the world created by the developer and remaining in the shadows to eavesdrop on the conversations between the guards, perhaps spying on them from the peephole of a door, you will very often to discover real additional elements to their mission in progress. Elements that sometimes turn into side missions that not only allow you to perhaps get your hands on an additional rune, or to discover a secondary way of accessing a target's house or still essential to get around a certain fortification undisturbed, but allow you to solve in completely alternative and often surprising ways of assassination. For example, we will be able to learn of a terrible penalty inflicted on priests to disavow them and that we could perhaps apply it to our main target instead of savagely murdering him or we could still convince the head of a famous gang of criminals to do all the dirty work on our behalf and there are sporadic cases in which a more in-depth chat with a particularly compliant lady to our advances allowed us to discover our victim's disguise in an instant. All the care Arkane has applied to his greatest work is poured into this incredible and often surprising attention to detail and complex and also in this case satisfaction can only come to those who throw themselves headlong into a highly reflective and stealth style of play. Often then this sort of secondary quests tend to have small repercussions on subsequent missions as well. For example, on one occasion we discovered that a target was also the lover of one of our future victims and rummaging through his personal effects allowed us to get our hands on a passe-partout key to the military quarters which a couple of missions we would have had to violate with consequent facilitation in exploration. But there are also much more subtle consequences that go alongside the chaos system that manages the reaction of the game world to our passage. The more heinous we tend to be in crimes, to kill guards and civilians, the more Dunwall plunges into darkness, increasing the hostility of the population towards us, increasing the number of mourners (terminal plague patients) who roam for the alleys of the city and the amount of rats ready to strip us alive if we are not quick enough to take shelter in an elevated position. On the contrary, the fewer killings we will carry out, perhaps only by putting our opponents to sleep and finding less lethal ways to knock out our targets, the more the capital will appear ~clean~ and very often we will be able to venture into neutral areas without the risk of being attacked by gangs of criminals or pursued by humans nearly zombified by the plague. In short, the consequences of our actions are very tangible and the whole system adequately stimulates replayability also in light of the two different endings that we will be able to meet depending on the amount of chaos generated and on the basis of the various characters silenced with our work. And since we have talked in abundance about the stealth component of Dishonored, how can we not spend a few lines on the mechanics that manage the guards? The system is quite simple and linear and allows you to become familiar with your physicality in an instant. In practice, the enemies only take into account what is happening before their eyes and are also very attentive to the noises caused by our steps. Unlike what happened in Thief, light is no longer an important element, so it is not necessary to remain constantly hidden in the shadows and an obstacle between us and a guard is often enough, even at a very short distance, to keep us safe. Very often then the enemies tend not to be aware of what is happening above and below them, even if we are just a few meters away from their position. All this translates into truly immediate and immediately satisfying gameplay but where it takes a moment to get caught. Once you enter the opponent's line of sight, it will ~activate~ according to a scale that grows over time consisting of three levels. Once we reach the maximum, the guard will have seen us and will come towards us to attack us. It will always be possible to escape and try to hide again but based on the type of enemy this will tend to look for us with more or less aggressiveness, to sound any alarms or to verbally call other guards to give him a hand. In all cases, however, even if we have managed to escape his hunt, he and", "date": "2012-10-08", "grade": "9.1"}
