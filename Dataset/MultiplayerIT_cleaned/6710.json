On this machine of dreams, already at the time, we enjoyed like crazy with the first ~simulators~ of traditional bar pinball machines. The epic of video game pinball goes through almost thirty years of titles, some of which have become historic. Names such as Pinball Dreams, Pinball Fantasy (with its clones), the countless variants of Sierra and the legacy of this heritage of ideas, then collected by Zen Studios, bear witness that this genre passes from one generation to the next, among ups and downs, without ever drying up completely. Every developer who wanted to tread the media scene with a new product has always racked his brains, with various attempts at innovation, sometimes managing to transcend the original concept, introducing, drawing on and sometimes forcing other genres of video games into it. One of the most successful and innovative experiments was that of Adventure Pinball: Forgotten Island, released in 2001 under the aegis of Electronic Arts. In fact, that was the first time in which a developer grabbed the Unreal Engine by weight, the beating heart of shooters from the turn of the century, and exploited its graphic and effects features to graft them into a pinball that would have made the player experience a real adventure. In each location you had to face a series of challenges, with due precision, and then move from one area to another on the basis of the objective that the mission required. The newborn palm of the genre (?) described in the subtitle, would therefore belong to Adventure Pinball, were it not that the addition of RPG elements to this hybrid should be recognized by right to Rollers of the Realm, developed by the Phantom Compass team . In fact, the game will try in every way to take us by the hand and ferry us through a fairy tale, in perfect fantasy style, in which the heroes have life, soul and powers... despite their spherical shape. Rollers of the Realm manages to say something new in the pinball genre Once upon a time... The incipit reveals how an evil witch, envious of three invincible and immortal heroes, destined to dominate all kingdoms, has imprisoned them in a sort of stasis or limbo, with the help of her wicked magic. We play a thief, rebel, annoyed by how the rulers have manipulated the above legend to unleash devastating wars in her childhood places. Her aim is to survive, wandering from village to village, trying to earn what little she needs to survive... and this is where the player comes into the picture. A simple introduction, which however wants to draw the player's attention towards a plot which, while never proving to be invasive, on the contrary manages to weave a common thread that pushes the user to switch from one scheme to another. The first game table is set at the gates of a city; our task is to overcome some guards that prevent us from accessing them, dribbling them and finding an alternative route. Once we have launched our sphere, which symbolizes our thief, we will have to try to destroy barrels or other elements on the field, to accumulate mana and gold. The first allows us to load a bar; upon reaching a specific indicator we will be able to activate the character's ability. In this case, by pressing a button, our dog will appear, represented by another sphere, with the task of distracting the guards and allowing us to escape, or aiming at a manhole cover that makes us slip secretly into the sewers. This is where the game begins to change its style, becoming a kind of platformer. In this situation we will have to combine the movements due to the launch of the sphere through the flaps, with that of swinging to the right or to the left to allow our counterpart to overcome the obstacles. This is just the beginning: through the more than thirty levels, we will have to move and combine ten heroes, like our thief, alternating them when we need them to tackle specific businesses. In many cases we will find ourselves in real fights, with super deformed-looking enemies that we will have to hit with the right timing, precision and specific hero. As the thief can take advantage of the addition of a second sphere, once the adequate mana level is reached, we will also have to deal with the other adventure companions. Among these, for example, the knight stands out: decidedly lethal against enemies, very useful as a ~tank~ capable of breaking through barriers; his special ability is to provide an extra shield. The healer, in addition to being faster in collecting mana, allows you to bring back to life heroes who die (i.e. who fall between the two wings or above theskull symbol). Each scheme requires some reflection in order to be overcome in the best way. In all cases, the objective to be achieved is never too complex, even if perhaps the request for a greater commitment would certainly have accentuated the interest, which never descends or falls into the banal. A small imperfection, which is more of a trick, should be noted in the menu, with keys placed in random positions in the various corners of the screen, sometimes grouped, sometimes all to the right or left... not exactly the best of coherence and comfort. A fly in the ointment, partially corrected with a first patch, is that the physics of the sphere sometimes makes fluctuations, without a logical sense, towards a direction or that it mysteriously deviates its journey attracted by a non-existent force. For those who are not satisfied with the classic experience of the story, a section called ~Arena~ is also available, in which to face challenges of increasing difficulty. In the same style as the ~Horde~ mode - that is until death arrives - we will have to survive a crescendo of situations, enemies and puzzles, all just to tickle the lovers of the highest score.", "date": "2014-12-02", "grade": "8.0"}
