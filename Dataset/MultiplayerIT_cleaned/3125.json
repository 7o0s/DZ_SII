{"name": "The Flower Collectors", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-flower-collectors-recensione.html", "text": "If you want to have a general idea of The Flower Collectors, the second title developed by the Austrian team Mi'pu'mi Games, already author of The Lion's Song, just think of ~Rear Window~: Alfred Hitchcock's film is in fact at the basis of this little thriller, which from New York in the 1950s takes us instead to Barcelona in 1977, a few years after the death of Francisco Franco and the end of a regime that lasted forty years. The developers therefore touch on an even more delicate issue than the one tackled with their debut title, recounting years of a nation in which the features of a decadent regime persist and refuse to give in to the pressures of the aperturists - intent on promoting the transition to democracy . The story staged is quite simple and probably its narrative intertwining will not catch those who live on crime and crime novels off guard, nevertheless The Flower Collectors seems more intent on showing what it meant to live in years where the dictatorship, despite being close to disappearing, he tried to tighten his grip on the citizens by oppressing them perhaps with even more ferocity than was done before Franco's death. The window to the courtyard The protagonist of this story is the former policeman Jorge, who retired from service due to an accident that forced him into a wheelchair: he lives on the top floor of a building, his days pass under the banner of boredom and painkillers, and his only window on the world is the balcony from which, equipped with binoculars, he scans the square below and immortalizes the scenes of daily life in his sketchbook. Right from the start we discover a man (or perhaps it is better to say a bear, since The Flowers Collectors is set in an anthropomorphic reality) disillusioned, embittered and also rather refractory to that social change Spain is undergoing, although in his words there is the same violence that permeates other characters presented throughout the game. Until, during one of the many sleepless nights, Jorge finds himself involved in a murder case: someone was blatantly killed in the square and a terrified girl knocks on his door, asking him for asylum for one night. Thus begins a bizarre collaboration between the two, where a recalcitrant Jorge slowly finds himself involved in a case that will lead him to question both the present and the past and himself, leading the story to veer towards redemption, rather than revelation of a crime and the shady machinations behind it, a pardon that accompanies the desire to define what is right and what is wrong in a Spain that tends towards democracy but is still held back by the chains of a regime that has lasted too long for its roots to be erased so easily. Through a gradual realization of the world around him, food for thought and moments of genuine inner conflict, The Flowers Collectors exploits the clich of corruption and political intrigue to tell a dark, but still very much alive, cross-section of history; he does it with a rhythm that remains stable for most of the time, except for slowdowns in the central part which, however, given the brevity of the game, are not felt much. There is a sincere desire to follow in the footsteps of a master of cinema like Hitchcock but, also thanks to a rather crude technical sector, the developers are unable to fully implement it, giving life to a discreet and yet immature thriller in some respects. (Almost) passive spectator From the gameplay point of view, the developers have set themselves a challenge by choosing to let us play only Jorge and not his improvised assistant: just like in Hitchcock's film, the player has limited actions and is often a passive observer of the events , filtered through the lenses of binoculars or the lens of a camera thanks to which he can offer support and advice to his young partner: the sense of impotence due to Jorge's condition is transmitted very well above all by the expectations, when the characters take his time to move from one place to another in the square, leaving the player on tenterhooks about what will happen, or from the fact of not being able to take any liberties and having to give precise indications to Melinda (his ~colleague~) on what to do . In a normal situation, probably any player would have tried to eavesdrop on what is possible, in this case, however, you are limited and you have to submit to some narrative binaries that do not allow you to do as you wish. Likewise, a helplessness perhaps even more overwhelming is felt when one is forced to witness the offhanded methods of the police, the sameshe knows Jorge was a part of and yet refuses to acknowledge as such. Mi'pu'mi Games wanted to greatly emphasize the condition of the player, generally succeeding through a mix of limited actions and situations beyond his reach: in addition to spying from the balcony and guiding Melinda in her actions, you can sometimes interact with some elements in Jorge's room but, above all, to take stock of the situation as the case develops. It is simply a question of making sense of the clues collected during the various chapters, nothing complex for a game that in fact does not want to be: The Flower Collectors is a very guided story, where game over is not contemplated, which however has its little secrets: there are in fact several secondary stories that shed a different light on the characters and can only be completed by proving to be excellent observers, or even by making small moral decisions that will determine the future of some of them, and reaching the end of the game having unraveled the whole skein will not be as immediate as you think. In its small way, therefore, the game emphasizes observation and the search for detail by offering stories in history, which will only find their conclusion if you have proved yourself skilled enough. There will also be brief moments in which the player's morality will be tested, inviting him to both an honest and conspiratorial approach and although we had preferred that some answers were not immediately revealed as lies, leaving even more doubts, overall it works. Technical compartment As far as the technical sector is concerned, the dubbing compensates for the lack of animations, a very weak point of Mi'pu'mi Games: most of the animations are reduced to the bone and the situations that you will spy on are reduced to a maximum of three different expressions along the lines of the Sims. Characters emphatically clap their hands on their knees to show their mirth, stamp their feet if they're furious, and eventually freeze completely before turning and going on their way. Sometimes it is possible to see them waving their arms during a speech to give the impression of being ~alive~ but beyond this, there is nothing else: some dialogues are carried out so quickly that one wonders if they really had time to say what is then reported by Melinda. Then when it comes to being face to face with one of these characters (it will be above all Melinda but not only) the uncertainty of the animations emerges even more strongly, but The Flowers Collectors is still able to maintain part of its charm when studying the people from above, seeing them carry out their daily tasks like a small ritual inside an equally small diorama. Lastly, the music is not very memorable and often imposes itself too forcefully on the scene, overwhelming the speech.", "date": "2020-04-26", "grade": "6.8"}
