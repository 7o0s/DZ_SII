Broadcast in the now distant eighties, when anime and manga were still absolutely niche products and well-known schedules replicated episode after episode of Denver or the Smurfs instead of Dragon Ball or Detective Conan, the animated series Saint Seiya inspired by the homonymous comic written and designed by Masami Kurumada, it became a true cult in our peninsula with the title The Knights of the Zodiac, thanks also to a decidedly not very faithful but one of the most epic and exciting Italian adaptations ever. The success of the ~saints of Athena~ has never ended, here as in Japan. Constantly driven by reprints, animated series, new comics and above all unbridled merchandising based particularly on modeling, Saint Seiya has gone through at least two generations with great class, generating new fans and rejuvenating the loving eyes of those a little older. On the videogame scene, in all these years the series has boasted few titles and now, after the two mediocre fighting games developed on PlayStation 2, it's up to Namco Bandai to try again: what better occasion to churn out yet another musou? Dynasty Saints We really hope that the musou fashion ends as soon as possible, because honestly we are starting to get a little tired of all these clones of Dynasty Warriors based on different franchises, when the result is always the same: boredom and repetitiveness. The recent game of Ken the Warrior proved it to us, Bleach: Soul Resurrecin also did it and Knights of the Zodiac: Battle of the Sanctuary proves it again. For those unfamiliar with what a musou is, it is worth explaining that it is a game system made known by Koei's Dynasty Warriors (or Sangokumusou, to be precise) series, very popular in Japan and quite famous in the West. For some time now, the ~musou~ gameplay has characterized the video games of the most famous animated series with worrying frequency, just as in the case of The Battle of the Sanctuary. In fact, the player controls one of the Knights of Athena and must make his way through dozens and dozens of enemies at the same time, relying mainly on two attacks, one light but fast and the other slower but more powerful, which can be chained into long combos. A third key allows you to jump and a fourth, however, is used to execute the famous special shots of the characters. The enemy hordes sweep away by throwing punches and kicks in the direction of the targets, without being able to hook a specific one and rather hitting everything that is within the range of our attacks. All in all, this type of gameplay reflects the spirit of the animated series quite well, in which a single shot from a Knight was enough to knock down dozens of anonymous soldiers, but in addition Namco Bandai has thought of integrating the Cosmos factor into the combat system, the inner energy that fuels the powers of the Knights. The bar that indicates our character's Cosmo will charge both by hitting enemies and by suffering their attacks and can be consumed to launch special blows or activate the notorious Seventh Sense, thanks to which it will be possible to slow down time for a few seconds, allowing us a clear advantage over the enemy. The Seventh Sense is also activated by making perfect dodges, thus encouraging a slightly less ignorant fighting style. The problem is that the artificial intelligence of the enemies leaves a lot to be desired and even on the highest difficulty levels your opponents will just blindly charge you from all sides. In these cases, the real challenge lies in avoiding their very harmful attacks, easier said than done given that for some strange reason Namco Bandai has decided to opt for a fixed camera that constantly frames our character, preventing us from observing what it happens behind his back. However, the clash with the Grand Priest's henchmen is only a part of the game, since we will only face them in the short missions that separate the clashes with the real bosses on duty, the Golden Knights who preside over each of the twelve houses of the zodiac . Unfortunately, the battles with these mighty warriors are much less epic than they appeared on television or on the pages of the comic, as they mostly consist of dodging their special shots while waiting for the interval between one animation and another pmore suitable to hit them, perhaps by exploiting the slow-motion effect offered by the Seventh Sense. The blows of the Gold Saints are extremely damaging at any level of difficulty and attacking them is more complicated than it seems since many of them tend to ~teleport~ often from one point to another of the battlefield, making the battles an exhausting exercise of waiting, running and dodging, however prolonged by the excessive duration of the missions themselves, which on several occasions require you to defeat the Golden Knight on duty several times, depleting its corresponding reserve of vital energy. Fortunately, during these battles we will be able to take advantage of some special cinematic shots that are much more spectacular than those that can normally be used in combos, faithfully inspired by the choreographed attacks of the animated series, capable of inflicting considerable damage on our opponent. At the end of each mission, our performance will be severely evaluated with a vote, a variable amount of experience points and a reward that we can spend to improve the characteristics of our Knights and buy special upgrades which, for example, will allow us to increase defense or the attack during the activation of the Seventh Sense, gain more experience, alter some parameters of the game and other bonuses adequately balanced by appropriate disadvantages. Playstation 3 trophies Numerous Trophies to unlock: 40 Bronze, 6 Silver, 3 Gold and the precious Platinum. To get them you will have to complete the missions of the main and secondary modes, defeat certain enemies and use the various special shots; for some Trophies you will instead have to perform specific actions, for example facing clashes in a particular way or using some skills in specific sequences. A man called horse The main single-player mode of Knights of the Zodiac: Battle for the Sanctuary fairly faithfully retraces the first narrative arc of the comic and animated series, omitting the entire introduction of the Galactic War and the Black Knights (present however in the form of henchmen and mini-boss) to immediately tell the attempted murder of Lady Isabel, the current reincarnation of the goddess Athena. To save her from the cursed arrow that almost pierced her heart, the Bronze Knights will have to walk the long climb that leads to the Great Temple, desecrated by the evil Arles, but they will be hindered by enemy troops and by the very powerful Golden Knights led by blind faith , mind controls or simple dullness. The game does a good job of reproducing the main events of the story through cutscenes that take advantage of the graphics engine, completely dubbed in Japanese reproducing the original lines of the animated series. The subtitles are instead completely in Italian, with an important detail though. The adaptation chosen for names, places and special shots is the ~historical~ Italian one from the eighties. So the prophetic mothers who called their children Pegasus, Phoenix or Andromeda are back and all that ambaradan of terminological choices that are perhaps questionable nowadays but which have however remained in the hearts of all longtime fans. It is therefore a pity not to hear the voices of Ivo de Palma or Marco Balzarotti, fortunately the sound sector is still of excellent quality with a ream of Japanese voice actors more enthusiastic than usual and a series of music remixed or imported directly from the anime that will make fans of the series happy, who will also be able to indulge themselves by controlling any of their favorites in the various alternative game modes in which it is possible to face missions unrelated to the history of the game, some of these even together with a friend in the only multiplayer feature available, or an endless sequence of battles to overcome without ever dying. The reward for our efforts consists of further points to spend to improve our favorite Knights and a substantial amount of videos and illustrations to review in the usual photo gallery. From a graphic point of view, Knights of the Zodiac: The Battle of the Sanctuary reveals a stark contrast between fidelity to the sources and their true polygonal rendering. If the most common enemies all appear very similar and roughly animated, the models of the main characters instead, especially of the various Knights, are cared for and detailed, especially in the reproduction of the armor characteristics that distinguish the various signs, but leave a lot to be desired dazed and not very expressive faces that actually recall more the collector's models than the cartoon characters. Spectacular visual effects of special shots and satisfieshundreds of the unprecedented fighting styles created for some Knights that we have never seen in hand-to-hand combat before, a little less instead the animations that generally appeared not very fluid and too neurotic. Equally faithful to the animated series is also the realization of the various locations, unfortunately penalized as a result by an inevitable thematic monotony. Temples, colonnades, rocks and stairs intermittently. Most of the elements of the environment can be destroyed by our shots, but in no way affects a gameplay that soon turns out to be as repetitive as the battlefields themselves.", "date": "2012-03-14", "grade": "6.8"}
