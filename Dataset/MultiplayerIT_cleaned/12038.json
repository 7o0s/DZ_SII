{"name": "Brickbreaker Revolution", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/brickbreaker-revolution_a.html", "text": "Breakout is at the same time one of the most exploited formats of the entire gaming industry and one of the products (including countless clones and variants) easier to find on any mobile phone. The remake of Digital Chocolate therefore lands on a not exactly friendly terrain, where it is necessary to soar in order not to immediately fall into oblivion: and after several games with Brickbreaker Revolution, we can certainly avoid this eventuality. Although the title offers the opportunity to try your hand at a classic mode, the real attraction is the Revolution Mode, in which all the innovative elements are concentrated. The real new entry is represented by the presence, among all the blocks on the screen, of a specimen marked by a key, which once hit literally ~opens~ the upper and lower sides of the stage: in this way, it is possible to proceed to the next scheme by throwing the ball upwards and at the same time the danger of game over is averted, given that if you miss the shot, you only regress to the previous step. The Brickbreaker Revolution schemes are therefore stacked on top of each other, an undoubtedly winning feature enriched by the presence of real end-of-level bosses (for example snakes made up of blocks or aliens in pure Space Invaders style) to be rigorously knocked down sound of balls. But the innovative charge of the Digital Chocolate title certainly does not end here, and indeed continues by investing the various power-ups that can be found throughout the game. Brickbreaker Revolution includes real weapons (such as grenades, lasers and missiles) capable of making a clean sweep of blocks, as well as paddle and ball upgrades that increase their size, speed or power; there are also a couple of malus designed to make life less easy for the user, including the odious mirror that reverses the controls. In terms of gameplay, Digital Chocolate is therefore a fully successful experiment, which adds depth, complexity and variety to one of the most intriguing pastimes ever. But the developers have certainly not forgotten the technical implementation, which has also been modernized ad hoc for the situation: Brickbreaker Revolution boasts bright colors, powerful visual effects and extremely cool stylistic choices, which bring it closer to products such as Lumines or Rez. A real feast for the eyes, also accompanied by well-chosen and almost never annoying music. PRO Breakout to the nth degree Well implemented innovations Extremely cool look AGAINST A few more internships wouldn't have hurt", "date": "2007-08-31", "grade": "S.V."}
