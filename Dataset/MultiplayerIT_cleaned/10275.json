In common the desire to entertain a group of four players and Magician Forrest as a testimonial. What we are about to describe to you is a collection made up of 24 mini-games to be played both alone and in company, although the fun is directly proportional to the number of participants. The structure is set up as if it were a television schedule. Games can be tackled in more or less lasting matches, which in a nutshell means more or less challenges to play. They range from the ~flash~ game to the ~TV Marathon~, but all options will only be available after unlocking them by playing the active ones. Un...deux...trois... Regardless of the number of human players there will always be 4 characters on screen, this means that absent players will be controlled by the computer. Once you get to the heart of the game, as a game is proposed, the rules will be explained with very synthetic screens. The action is broken only for a few seconds, but it's not always immediate to understand what to do if you don't know how the game unfolds, and that's why the first few games will be problematic. A matter of a few minutes, but essential to open the doors to the fun that Vinca il Migliore can bring about. The races take place in sequence, alternating between a quick game which will give a bonus to the winner, and a more complex game where the four competitors will rotate in their roles. Let's go deeper: in the fast game, everyone competes with each other. It is generally a strange race, and the winner will have an advantage in the next game, perhaps with more points, or with the bonus of doubling future ones. In the following challenge three players will compete and hinder the fourth. This task will be repeated four times, and the participants will change their roles so that in the end everyone will have played in every position. For example, a race involves a player carrying a bucket full of water from one end of the screen to the other. The other three competitors will have to hinder him: one aims with the remote control, one throws an object to the last teammate, who hits it on the fly with the club, sending it in the direction chosen by the first player. Even games where there isn't such a marked difference between the antagonist roles will still be rotated. Phil Rouge The games proposed by Vinca il meglio are quite simple, and all made with enough care to make them work without too many problems of collision and confusion. It certainly lacks that refinement and cleanliness typical of higher budget games but the package itself is sold for 30 instead of the usual 50/60. As often happens in similar collections, not all games are equally fun, but at least they are accessible to everyone. In total, the program offers 24 challenges, divided into four shows, the last of which is ~TV Marathon~ which allows you to face all the individual games in a row, for a real marathon in front of the TV. The game also supports the Wii Balance Board for games that are compatible with it. Anyone who gets on the Balance Board leaves the remote control with the competitor who just got off. We also point out a dubbing entirely in Italian that will please the little ones, and a graphic characterization that is more likeable than captivating, but always easy to read. Win the best is a good choice for those looking for games to play in company, especially for younger players who may not stop in front of a barely sufficient realization and have not had the opportunity to try better alternatives. The only contraindication is that the players must have tried the proposed games at least once, and therefore it is not suitable as a debut for an evening of fun.", "date": "2010-01-04", "grade": null}
