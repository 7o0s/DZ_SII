{"name": "Superbike World Championship", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/superbike-world-championship.html", "text": "The line that divides games from ~games~ is also in the details. And licensed games usually aspire to be part of the first category, especially in a particular market such as that of mobile video games. Superbike World Championship is a licensed title, this means that we will be able to race using real bikes and riders, on real circuits. In addition, we will have the opportunity to try our hand at different modes: ~Quick Tour~, ~Arcade Mode~ and ~Career Mode~. The first simply allows us to try our hand at a fast race, on a track of our choice, and represents the ideal starting point for understanding how the game works. The second is an evolution of the first, in the sense that all the races are tackled in sequence until the end of the championship. Finally, the third is obviously the most important: once the team and rider have been selected, we will have to try our hand at an entire Superbike championship. The biggest difference with the other modes, however, is the presence of some variables of a certain importance: the team will tend to reward results, therefore winning races or in any case reaching good positions will tend to give you an advantage over the second driver. Retiring or finishing last, on the other hand, will put you in a bad light and could also result in an abrupt stop to tuning possibilities. The latter can be done between races, spending the points earned to improve acceleration, braking, speed and control of the bike. In the tuning screen it is also possible to change the compound of the tires used, based on the weather conditions on the track. Trying your hand at Superbike World Championship races at the beginning can leave a bad taste in your mouth. In fact, collisions with other cars are handled severely and systematically involve the fall of your driver, so at the start it is absolutely necessary to move to the outside and overtake your opponents almost on the curb, if you don't want to face an infinite series and frustrating with falls. Once this obstacle has been overcome, which in any case requires special attention even when overtaking, the game proves to be pleasant and enjoyable, with a good approach in the corners. On a technical level, the grafting of bitmap elements opposed to the polygons is not very aesthetically pleasing, but it is functional to the action. In this case, the bikes, the ~map~ of the track and the control elements are bitmaps, while the flowing track and the elements present on it are polygonal. The scrolling of the track is quite fast, but fails to maintain an acceptable fluidity in most cases. The sound sector is more or less at the same level, with good quality but not particularly brilliant music. Finally, the control system is simple but must be adapted to your needs by using the alternative buttons. It is in fact very inconvenient to accelerate and brake with the joystick of the phone where it is with the same device that you steer, so we tend to use the joystick to steer and the number buttons to accelerate and brake. SWC also gives the possibility to set the manual gearbox instead of the automatic, but you will hardly resort to it... PRO Championship, bikes and real tracks Different game modes Fairly funny AGAINST Collisions too severe Not top notch graphics Swinging difficulty", "date": "2007-04-29", "grade": "S.V."}
