{"name": "NBA All-World", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nba-all-world-recensione.html", "text": "Over the years Niantic has become one of the leading companies in the augmented reality sector. The success of Ingress, but above all that of Pokmon GO, a game that has not only managed to survive the pandemic, but has even thrived, are exceptional references that place the study created by John Hanke, the former Google responsible for Google Earth, among the best in the sector. It is a pity that, despite the references and the strong licenses available, not all the products placed on the market by Niantic have managed to break through on the market. Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, Catan: World Explorers and Transformers: Heavy Metal were closed a few months after their launch or never saw the light of day, while Pikmin Bloom, despite the support of Nintendo and Miyamoto himself, certainly did not get the same success as Pokmon GO. With NBA All-World the San Francisco studio tries again, trying to captivate not the fans of pocket monsters, but those of the NBA, one of the most famous, followed, loved and glamorous sports leagues on the entire planet. It's true that few things in the world have the charm of Pokmon, but the ability to capture LeBron James, Luka Doncic or Ja Morant and put them in your team has a certain appeal. But, as we'll see in the NBA All-World review, not everything went as planned. Lay the foundation The structure of NBA All-World is that of Pokmon GO The premise that must be made before approaching this genre of games is always the same: these are constantly evolving products which, if the public supports them, will gradually add new features, methods and activities. Just look at the evolution of Pokmon GO (whose comparison will be a constant in this review) to get an idea of what could await us. Hundreds of pocket monsters have been added over the years, online games, daily activities and so on: we can imagine that something like this will also happen with NBA All-World. What is surprising, however, is arriving on the market without many of the features seen in the Niantic blockbuster, something that makes these first few weeks less exciting than expected. It's still a free game, with optional purchases, but a little more verve and options wouldn't have minded. But let's go in order. The NBA All-World shooting contest asks you to stop the cursor at the center of the indicator NBA All-World is an augmented reality game for mobile devices in which you have to go around the streets (or the woods, the countryside...) in order to accumulate steps, but above all in order to meet the NBA players who have invaded the planet. Challenging them will serve both to recruit them within your team, and to gain experience and make the stars you already have stronger. Scattered around the city there will be rather special virtual places, usually located near real monuments or particular points of the city (they are the same ones used for Pokmon GO gyms) which, if visited, will allow you to obtain new accessories with which to dress up their athletes, items to upgrade them, and so on. Furthermore, some of these places will host a sort of weekly tournament thanks to which it will be possible to win additional content depending on the time spent at the top of the leaderboard. Your team level will determine which basketball players you can recruit and which events you can participate in: in other words, it will not be possible to get Stephen Curry or participate in the richest tournaments from day one, but you will first need to ~build~ a team worthy of the name. To do this, certain requirements must be met, such as having a certain number of high-level players or having recruited enough. He takes to the field a 1-on-1 NBA All-World challenge The defining feature of NBA All-World is the way different NBA players are challenged and recruited. In fact, it is not enough to find them, but the different basketball players must first be beaten. There are mainly two mini-games available: a shooting challenge and a one-on-one challenge. The first is easy to understand: although there are four different variants, in the end it is enough to stop the cursor near the indicator to score a basket. Whoever makes the most baskets wins. The 1v1 challenges are a little more complex to manage, since you have to do everything with just one finger. A single touch for a feint or a swipe for a movement: with these simple moves you have to try to unbalance your opponents and find the opening to go to the basket or shoot. Defensively, all you have to do is wait for the right moment to either attempt a steal or a block. The whole thing, especially after the February 21, 2023 update, works pretty bene, despite some slightly woody animation and little evident differences between the various players. Problems In NBA All-World there are courts where weekly tournaments are held with big prizes If the basic structure looks like a variation of what was seen in Pokmon GO, declined to attract fans of basketball with stars and stripes, the way in which NBA All-World was made does not seem, at the moment, up to both Niantic, both of the NBA license. In fact, the feeling is that the game has arrived on the market in a still preliminary version, with many features not yet activated (trades, multiplayer) and others not fully exploited. For example, why not make each player's unique characteristics more apparent? Using a big, hulking center like Drummond shouldn't be the same as controlling a lightning fast shooter like Jordan Poole. Why is it all one-on-one based and there's no fantasy basketball or Ultimate Team style team building mode? Does it make sense to challenge a center with insensitive hands in a 3 match? And why do some players, certainly not famous for their athletic skills, dunk NBA Jam style? Furthermore, all basketball players have the same animations and moves, something that greatly dampens the joy of owning a Curry or a Jokic, since they are practically identical. Furthermore, after a few hours of play, the different challenges could get a bit boring, because throwing 200 pokballs is a quick gesture that takes a few seconds, while challenging an NBA player takes several minutes and requires precision, two things that don't go very well with walking with your nose into your phone. NBA All-World players can be styled as much as they like. Furthermore, the style chosen for the game, made of blacks, geometries and electric colors, seems more suitable for a Tron than for an NBA game, not to mention the fact that at the moment NBA All-World is quite heavy and consumes a lot of battery . In a nutshell, the work that Ninantic has ahead of it is still a lot and the coming weeks will be decisive to see the pace with which the news will arrive. For example, there is a lack of a daily activity routine that prompts the player to return, also due to a currently limited number of players, but in the first few weeks also due to the possibility of being able to recruit only a few athletes.", "date": "2023-02-21", "grade": "6.0"}
