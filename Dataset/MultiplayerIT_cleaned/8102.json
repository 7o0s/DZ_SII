Reinforcing Danger Close's desire to immerse itself in true history is the partnership with Kathryn Bigelow's film, Zero Dark Thirty precisely, which narrates precisely the ten years of the long search for the sheikh of terror. Danger Close therefore takes us to two real locations of this long manhunt, two really well-designed levels tailored to put all the peculiarities of this FPS to the test with strong cooperative ambitions. Manhunt The package includes two generously sized maps (for all game modes) that immerse us in those very areas. Chitral Compound sees teams fighting in what presumably was one of Bin Laden's strongholds, a map that closely resembles the last mission of the single player campaign, the one in which we finally put an end to the Priest's threats. While Darra Market is one of those places where it is better that Westerners do not set foot, or a mountain village where weapons are sold and manufactured locally which will then be used against us. Both Chitral Compound and Darra Market surprised us with their excellent level design, capable of not focusing on a single style of play. The Pakistani compound is divided into three areas, a mountainous area, we would say at the start, the actual village and the fortress house placed in a dominant position. It goes without saying that the map offers open and long firing lines and at the same time large portions in which almost close quarter fights are the masters. All then illuminated by the light of the full moon, at night, in the Zero Dark Thirty, or half past night, time of the real raid against Bin Laden. Darra Market is instead the exact opposite. Meanwhile, battle is taking place in broad daylight and above all compared to Chitral the development is significantly more vertical, even if even here there is plenty of room for snipers, with areas at the extremes of the map particularly effective for continuous sniping. The best part of the level created by Danger Close is undoubtedly the central part, or an intricate maze of narrow streets that rise between the buildings, or rather, between the hovels of the town, often connected to each other by improvised walkways. A climb that takes us directly to a rather large area, home to the furnaces from which the molds for home-made Kalashnikovs are obtained, an area from which you have a good view of some transit areas. Frenzy is the stylistic code of this map, the control of the areas in the lower parts of the market becomes a real hell made up of ambushes, but despite everything, defilades and lateral passages present in a good number allow you to converge in the crucial areas without throwing yourself head over heels low in the maze of narrow streets. This map seems almost made for the demolisher equipped with an armored suit, but also to make the importance of the Fire Team even more clear, making teamwork the real trump card of this Medal of Honor: Warfighter. At a purely content level, the DLC offer, in addition to the two maps, contains 14 new liveries for the weapons, plus a substantial list of attachments, or rather accessories to be applied to the guns, optics, pointers, lightened barrels, handles and so on , all without any class being left without. We therefore have for example a new optics for the Ak 103, the 3x viewfinder for the G36, the night laser for the MK16PDW and much more. In short, the game offer seems to be interesting, and above all Electronic Arts will donate a dollar for each package sold to charity, to meet the needs of veterans' families. In closing, it should be noted that the numerous bugs present at launch have been practically resolved. Only once did the respawn occur off the map. To buy or not? We would have expected a couple more maps, it is undeniable, but at the same time the quality of the two present redeems a not too abundant offer. Beyond the colors for the weapons, the new attachments represent an intriguing incentive for the development of one's alter ego, but from the next DLC Danger Close must make the package as full-bodied as possible.", "date": "2012-12-20", "grade": null}
