This story is called Happy Wars and it is being told by a small studio in Tokyo, ToyLogic. Many of you are already familiar with this production, having been included in preview with the Xbox 360 autumn beta dashboard. Now the title is available to everyone in a totally free form, or almost, since an account is required to use it Gold and advancement is greatly facilitated by microtransactions. In fact, Happy Wars is played entirely online and can involve up to thirty players in epic battles, find out in our review if the first experiment of the genre on consoles managed to satisfy expectations. free Happy Wars is structured as a strategic medieval-fantasy action, which pits two opposing factions of warriors with the aim of conquering the opponent's castle. The player has the choice of embodying three distinct classes with specific characteristics, therefore teamwork proves to be crucial to bring home victory. We start with the classic warrior, who prefers only close attacks and makes extensive use of white weapons, the magician, exactly the opposite thanks to the possibility of striking at long distances, and the cleric, probably the most interesting class by virtue of characteristic not only of healing companions, but also of building functional materials for the creation of devastating war equipment such as cannons. A stimulating category that can make a real difference on the pitch, provided it is used by players who prefer support. The game is introduced by an exhaustive tutorial, among the most complete ever seen, which will take you up to an hour but which is essential for understanding the mechanics. Once this is finished, the possibilities move on to online matches or the campaign with bots managed by artificial intelligence. However, this latest mode quickly shows its side, proving to be little more than a gym to hone one's skills. Few stimuli for the solitary player therefore, a feature that completely removes Happy Wars from any potential interest. The ToyLogic title makes sense once faced with flesh-and-blood users. In the same way, the peculiarities of the microtransactions are revealed, which translate into the virtual currency of the title, capable of quickly paving the way for bonus items and therefore facilitating the games. Particularly noteworthy is the possibility of being reborn instantly, without the obligation to build special totems with the companions that take on the role of check points. Regardless of this, if we exclude the clothes of the characters, nothing in the product linked directly to the gameplay is precluded to those who decide to earn progression with the honest sweat of their brow, a peculiarity that makes Happy Wars a title worthy of attention even for those who do not is willing to invest money. Xbox 360 goals Happy Wars aligns with Microsoft's new scoring policy, which brings Live Arcade titles to 400 player points overall. A loot that can be conquered by winning each of the twenty objectives prepared for this title. The richest and most expensive is probably the one that requires you to play 100 games, after which you will earn 60 precious player points. Good war! Stronger, guys Technically Happy Wars proves to be a well-finished game both in terms of technique and style. ToyLogic has opted for a humorous characterization that is very reminiscent of a cartoon. The realization through the well-tested technique of cel shading projects us into a colorful world that does not take itself seriously, but which manages to involve. The characters have funny proportions and are shown with armor that always manage to elicit a smile. Of note is the exhilarating sequence that sees the entire army throw themselves against the opposing totems, to raze them to the ground with a devastating series of hammer blows. The way in which the sequence is orchestrated and the funny hysterical contour voices betray the Japanese derivation of the game, despite this, however, we must say that the accelerator is never pressed in this sense, almost always remaining within the confines of a product designed to find the response of western users. The music is without particular flashes but rather functional, with a series of tunes that never prove intrusive. The scenarios are excellent, ranging from plains, deserts and underwater landscapes, the possibility of freely adjusting the shot also allows you to enjoyyes to the best of the numerous details, even if at the expense of the legibility of the action. Happy Wars is a title that works very well in its mechanics, unfortunately, however, we have encountered various difficulties in online games, with waiting times in the lobby that are frankly unsustainable for this type of use. The developers have guaranteed constant support for the game, however the impression from its release is that of a product that suffers from the production values in terms of the netcode. The game is localized in the texts in Italian, in order to be understandable to all.", "date": "2012-12-19", "grade": "6.7"}
