{"name": "Star Wars: Squadrons", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-squadrons-recensione.html", "text": "Ever since its announcement, the first real video game made entirely by EA Motive had amazed us with its audacity: the hypothesis of launching a space simulator in 2020, entirely and exclusively dedicated to combat and based on the Star Wars license, immediately made a shiver of pleasure on our back. And it is precisely with this excitement that we launched into writing this review of Star Wars: Squadrons because we never imagined we'd find ourselves in front of a project so lucid and precise in its objectives: a title of medium size, sold at a budget price, made by sincere fans of the saga created by George Lucas, able to stir up the memories of longtime players who grew up on X-Wing vs Tie Fighter and X-Wing Alliance. With perhaps a wink in the direction of those who are still waiting for Star Citizen or who can no longer play exclusively Elite Dangerous. Here, you need to keep this concept in mind: Star Wars: Squadrons does not aim to become the greatest exponent of the genre by leaning at a production level of Triple A; its goal is to entertain the Star Wars fan player by offering a long-forgotten experience with a well-defined package of content and staying far from the ~game as a service~ idea that first killed and then resurrected Star Wars : Battlefront 2. History But let's go in order. Star Wars: Squadrons takes place immediately after the events of the sixth film, Return of the Jedi. The battle of Endor with the accompanying destruction of the second Death Star has just concluded and the Rebellion, now renamed the New Republic, clearly has to deal with a Galactic Empire that is still far from being annihilated and which vigorously maintains its iron fist tightened on the richest areas of the galaxy. The single player campaign of the game opens with the search and the attempt by the Empire to track down and destroy a series of transport ships that are trying to escape with the survivors of the conflict on the moon of Endor on board and it will be just the ruthlessness Imperial actions set the plot in motion starting with the defection of a high-ranking officer who will seek to join the New Republic. The story unfolds through a long 2-part prologue that serves as a basic tutorial and 14 missions that can be tackled by choosing 1 of 4 different difficulty levels, with the lowest one allowing you to enjoy the story with virtually no challenge rate. The peculiarity of the narrative is its constant passage between the points of view of the 2 factions within a plot arc that proceeds in a straight line. We will therefore find ourselves using from time to time first the Empire, then the rebels and so on from mission to mission and according to the story, without the player being left with the possibility of choosing which faction to use. Everything will depend on the story told and, through this stratagem, the entire campaign will allow us to become familiar with all the ships at our disposal and with the various game systems, with the idea of representing a sort of very long incremental tutorial in multiplayer function. However, allowing us to also witness a pleasantly narrated story but without particular creative or ingenious peaks. Without making any kind of spoiler, we can safely say that the story is well grafted onto the classic stylistic features of Star Wars with the inevitable reversals in the face and desires for revenge and revenge that have always distinguished the franchise. From a narrative point of view, al outside of a handful of cutscenes and the inevitable exchanges of jokes between the flight mates while we are in the game, the story is told through a whole series of optional dialogues that we will have to do inside the 2 hangars of the Empire and the New Republic that we will find ourselves visiting from mission to mission. Here we will be able to attend the briefing of the next level and, precisely, chat with the other members of our squadron. The result is decidedly anachronistic given that we will limit ourselves to pressing a button once the wingman is framed with the icon of a comic on his head. He or she will say his lines and we can look around again for another classmate who has something to say. You can't move, there's no multiple dialogue or anything more elaborate and layered. It almost feels like being in a game of The 11th Hour or some other graphic adventure from days gone by. In terms of longevity, we spent about 7 hours completing the campaign on the third difficulty level, dying a fair amount of volts.and in a couple of missions. The gameplay As already mentioned at the beginning of the review, Star Wars: Squadrons is a space simulator entirely focused on combat, playable exclusively with a first-person view, from inside the spaceship. The cockpits of the various ships are the real flagship of EA Motive's production having been made with a level of detail and attention that we can easily define maniacal. Screens, buttons, indicators, everything is credible and coherent, as well as faithful to what seen in the cinema, in the series and in the comics and, above all, the player will be asked to keep an eye on the dashboard to understand the status of his ship and the selected objective. That is, there are no HUDs or on-screen interfaces, but the information is distributed precisely through the elements of the cockpit. Each of the 2 factions has 4 different spaceships available, each configurable in the hull, engines, possibly in the shields and with two different secondary weapons assigned to the backbones. In addition, each spacecraft has lasers as a primary weapon, these too selectable from various types of energy, and an active countermeasure to dodge any missiles fired in our direction. Where in multiplayer the selection of faction and ship is completely available to the player, during the campaign we will move from aircraft to aircraft with a precise setup depending on the mission, even if in the more advanced stages of the plot, we will be left with the possibility of configuring the aircraft to our liking and to choose which ship to use among those available.Obviously we find all the great classics of that precise historical period: X-Wing, Y-Wing, A-Wing and the U-Wing support vehicle for the New Republic; Tie Fighter, Tie Bomber, Tie Interceptor and the prototype Tie Reaper for the Galactic Empire. As it is easy to understand, the ships of the 2 factions oppose each other and we will therefore have a multifunction fighter, a bomber, an aircraft for ~hit and run~ tactics and the spacecraft dedicated to players who prefer to dedicate themselves to a support role behind the lines enemies. And always remaining in the tradition of Star Wars, the ships of the former rebellion are all equipped with shields and very light hulls, whereas the Empire prefers to aim for very resistant and armored fighters but without any type of energy protection, thus forcing the player to adopt very different attack and escape strategies when switching from one faction to another. An integral part of managing the aircraft while on a mission is in assigning generator power to the various systems. Through the use of specific keys, or the d-pad if a joypad is used, we will be able to enhance engines, lasers or shields on the fly if the aircraft is equipped with them. By doing so, we will not only have greater reactivity and power of the selected system but we will unlock a sort of accessory function that further modifies the tactical management of the vehicle. By upgrading the engines we will therefore gain access to a turbo that we will be able to activate at will after a certain period of charge, the shields will overload generating a sort of second layer of protection, while the lasers will double their longevity allowing us to shoot much more at long. The constant passage of energy between systems is a fundamental element of the advanced game mechanics both in multiplayer and at the higher difficulty levels of the campaign, together with the possibility of concentrating the power of the shields frontally or behind to help us during the attack of the ships larger ones or in case of desperate escape. In short, there is a tactical and strategic element in Star Wars: Squadrons which should not be overlooked and which on the contrary represents a tasty return to the more hardcore mechanics of space simulators. The multiplayer And so we come to talk about the other soul of Star Wars: Squadrons, the multiplayer. The title offers two game modes. Although it would be more correct I would say that it offers one and a half. There are indeed space duels and fleet battles. In the first case we are talking about a simple 5 vs. 5 team deathmatch that sees the 2 factions facing each other within 6 different maps. The first team to 20 kills wins. Fleet battles, on the other hand, represent the heart of multiplayer and, in some way, inherit the concept of the battlefront and phased combat already seen in Star Wars Battlefront. In practice, it is a space duel where, however, the flagships and medium-sized computer-controlled ships also come into play, together with a whole series of fighters guided by artificial intelligence that serve to artificially inflate thenumerical of the battlefield. Our goal will be to break through the enemy defenses and then to assault and destroy the flagship by first insisting on its secondary systems and then irreparably damaging the hull. To manage advance and retreat there is a morale system that increases or decreases as we destroy the enemy fighters, or clearly as we suffer defeats, and when this morale reaches its maximum or minimum, an armored ship appears on the scene which, automatically, it attempts the assault. Clearly it will be up to us to support or destroy it by generating those further variations and game dynamics that fit perfectly into this mode. The fleet battle can also be played alone, with bots instead of friends and opponents, or in coop with 4 other friends to flesh out our faction and with the computer, which can be set on 2 difficulty levels, to act as an opponent. But clearly the real challenge is represented by the ranked mode where only the players enter the game and where it becomes really crucial to work as a team by communicating as much as possible with voice chat or, at least, through the ping and reporting system included in the gameplay. Despite having participated in a long multiplayer game session, we struggle to make a judgment on the actual longevity of this aspect of Star Wars: Squadrons. Honestly already knowing that the developer considers the whole offer ~closed~ and defined and does not include additional content or new additions to the title, apart from the inevitable balancing and cleaning work, has left us dumbfounded but also intrigued. in fact, we feel you should criticize this choice a priori given that from many points of view it is much better to have a defined and complete game right from the launch, rather than a title that sees its maturity only 1 or 2 years after its arrival on the market ( any references to Star Wars Battlefront 2 are purely coincidental). However, with this design assumption, we would have expected a more substantial offer: perhaps the possibility of configuring your match to create personalized games, or seeing modifiers implemented that can alter the challenge by disabling certain types of weapons or aircraft or modifying the type and number of medium and large ships present on the battlefield. Undoubtedly, more could have been done on this front. In terms of collectibles, Star Wars: Squadrons implements 2 currencies: the salary, which is used to unlock the upgrades and secondary equipment of each aircraft, and the glory, which is used instead to purchase all the aesthetic elements of the 2 avatar pilots that represent us in the game and of the ships that we are going to customize between decals and elements to be placed on the dashboards. There are no microtransactions of any kind and once we reach level 40 in multiplayer we will have enough pay to unlock all ship upgrades. However, the rarer items are related to operations. It is a cross between the season and the battle pass that we find now everywhere in multiplayer games: an 8-week event that can be completed by carrying out 20 daily missions and which gives access, precisely, to a cosmetic that it cannot be unlocked in any other way and will be lost forever once the operation is completed. The developer's choice to enable total cross-play of multiplayer is very interesting and also clever: this means that you can play with your friends regardless of the platform on which they bought the game, including those who will choose to play Squadrons in virtual reality on PC or PS4. HOTAS are also perfectly supported on all platforms. The graphics Before arriving at the final comment of the review, it is essential to say a few words about the technical aspect and the graphics of Star Wars: Squadrons. On this front, the work of EA Motive is absolutely commendable. Not only are the game scenarios exceptional and full of on-screen elements, but also and above all the ships represent a wonderful example of attention to detail. The dashboards, the models, some small aspects such as the luminescence of the flagships' shields or the debris that remain in space after a big explosion, make the title really nice to look at and play. A beauty that turns into a real aesthetic exaltation during the dialogue scenes of the single player campaign: the cunning of making these sections of the game practically non-interactive has allowed the development team to push very hard on the quality of the character models and, above all, on the rendering of clothes and objects with a result", "date": "2020-10-02", "grade": "8.0"}
