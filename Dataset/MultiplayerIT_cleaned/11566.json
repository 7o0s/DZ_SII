{"name": "Paparazzi Snapshot!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/paparazzi-snapshot.html", "text": "There are relatively new videogame genres, which for some years have conquered a large share of the market. These are the so-called ~brain trainers~, a compilation of more or less brilliant quizzes that allow us to analyze the reactivity of our mind, comparing data day by day. Within these products we have seen a bit of everything, from design to calculation, but the ~look for the details~ game was missing, which is what this Paparazzi Snapshot is based on!. The only game mode available sees us armed with a camera, in an attempt to capture certain objects against an increasingly complex background. In the upper part of the screen we can check the list of things to photograph, while in the lower left a timer is shown which forces us to do our things in the shortest possible time, to aspire to the highest awards. With the joystick we have to move the viewfinder, while the 5 key is used to shoot: that's all. Once all the items on the list have been immortalized, we'll move on to the next stage, which may involve a change in structure: instead of taking pictures, we'll have to mark the differences between two images with a pencil. Each ~mission~ is divided into a variable number of stages, after which you will move on to a new story. From the start screen you can view the high score rankings as well as the prizes collected so far. The technical realization of the game is functional to the action: we have a series of backgrounds on which objects are placed, in an absolutely random and often senseless way (see stuff suspended in the air...), and the viewfinder of our camera can move freely to frame the desired subject. Once the picture is taken, an image with the foreground object appears. The use of colors is good, but there are no animations: even in the presence of moving characters on the screen, they will always move in the same pose. The sound sector does not do better, unfortunately, with mediocre music and sounds, which can be largely deactivated. PRO Well colored backdrops Good number of missions Difficult to find a third positive aspect... AGAINST Boring and repetitive Technically mediocre Extremely limited", "date": "2008-03-14", "grade": "S.V."}
