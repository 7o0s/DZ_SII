In the case of WRC: FIA World Rally Championship 4, we are talking about a rally game that already from the first edition, thanks to Milestone's great experience with the genre, offered an accurate reproduction of all the circuits of the official WRC championship and the cars present. It is clear that the lack of novelty can kill a franchise and the developers over the years have tried to introduce new elements, however having to move along a rather narrow path since, as already mentioned, the bulk had already been done. The ~classic~ cars of the third episode were a great example of this, but have inexplicably been eliminated with this new edition. So what else could be attempted to make the experience fresher in the eyes of rally enthusiasts? The first step was to make the game's career mode even closer to reality, with events taking place over two days and consisting of milestones that are tackled at different times. This also translates into a change of scenery, which is shown to us at dawn, during the day or at dusk, with rather clear repercussions on grip and visibility depending on the location. The Junior WRC Championship category was also introduced, in which manageable Ford Fiesta R2s are used, as the first step in a career that will eventually lead us to distinguish ourselves and snatch new contracts, moving on to the more demanding competitions of the WRC 3, WRC 2 and WRC, with a consequent increase in the degree of challenge not only due to the greater ability of our opponents, but also and above all due to the management of ever more powerful cars. Scalability One of the hallmarks of Milestone driving games has always been the scalability of the experience, or the ability to adjust the driving parameters around our abilities or needs. In the case of WRC: FIA World Rally Championship 4, this aspect is only partially managed by the settings, which allow you to deactivate the assisted braking, the ABS system and the stability control, finally switching from the automatic gearbox to the manual one. The greatest differences are in fact obtained by comparing the various categories of cars, starting with the predictability of the cars of the Junior WRC Championship, which practically do not skid and allow you to tackle curves and straights in complete tranquility, finally arriving at the indomitable power of the car WRC, whose trajectory must be continuously corrected to compensate for the strong propulsion. Dealing with such different vehicles not only contributes to the sense of progression, but also to the general variety of the experience, capable of radically changing one's parameters. Furthermore, in terms of simulation value, the steps forward compared to the previous episodes can be seen: the feedback from the surfaces is different and therefore running on asphalt, dirt, snow produces a great variety of sensations. Some of the car's behavior is perhaps exaggerated, such as the pirouettes that sometimes occur following a high-speed collision, but overall the feeling is very good and driving is a pleasure. All the more so thanks to the four views available, in particular the one from inside the close-up cockpit, in which you can only see the upper portion of the steering wheel and therefore seem to be really sitting in a rally car. WRC: FIA World Rally Championship 4 is a solid and full-bodied product, with some interesting new features Xbox 360 goals Many of the achievements in WRC: FIA World Rally Championship 4 are unlocked simply by engaging in certain activities for the first time, such as adjusting the setup or repairing the car after a demanding session. Then there are the achievements linked to the victory of particular events and, of course, to the completion of the championships and career. In total there are fifty objectives, for the traditional 1000 Gamerpoints. Numbers The speech on the offer of WRC: FIA World Rally Championship 4 draws a picture of great substance, thanks to the thirteen different scenarios present for a total of seventy-eight events, sixteen cars, sixty-five drivers and fifty-five teams, all reproduced under official license. There is no other product of its kind dedicated to rallies, and enthusiasts know it well. We were also pleased to see a big graphic optimization work, which practically completely eliminated the obvious drops in frame rate that afflicted WRC 3, giving us a substantially more fluid experience, as well as adding many side elements to the iinside the tracks, which however for some situations (see the public) still suffer from the ~old gen~ syndrome and are unable to make that leap forward necessary to compete with the Codemasters productions, now a point of reference for the genre. The Milestone guys know how things are and once again they have tried to imitate the various DiRTs as regards the interface, the quality of which however fluctuates: the videos accompanying the menus are fine, but the static screens ( like that of the pits) are decidedly outdated. Finally, there is the multiplayer sector, which for the moment is not very popular but allows you to set up interesting challenges, clearly based on lap times, both from the point of view of single rallies and entire tournaments.", "date": "2013-10-31", "grade": "7.5"}
