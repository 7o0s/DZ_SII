{"name": "Jade Cocoon 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/jade-cocoon-3.html", "text": "Background The gamer's alter ego is a brave boy called Kahu, son of a carpenter, eager to become the best of the Beast Masters, a dream that could come true, in the immediate future, thanks to a call for tenders for Beast Hunter, term which indicates monster hunter, of those Divine Beasts that are found in the universe in which we live and that we will have to take care of and grow up correctly. Arrived in the palace of the wise Kemuel and instructed by him on all those rules that will make him a respectable Beast Hunter, if it weren't for a bitter twist of fate: Kahu hatches a fairy larva named Nico, being run over, unfortunately, from a terrible curse that could turn him into a demon. Background The young man, now equipped with a not at all sexy tail, has to wander around the 4 forests (distinguished by the 4 elements, Fire, Earth, Air and Water), each of them divided into 4 sub-zones, in search of a remedy that can return the unfortunate Kahu to normal. Will he succeed? To the buyers of this atypical RPG, the fateful answer. Gameplay Each of the 4 forests contains an orb, before possessing it (and even before moving from one forest to another), it will be necessary to sift through each area adequately, to look for a particular key that will open the final protection of each level and even before that, it will be your task is to send back to the sender, many, but many little monsters, eager to keep you company. The Divine Beasts that you will raise and which will then fight for your cause, are divided by elements of belonging, 4, the same ones that distinguish forests: a creature with the symbol of Fire, for example, will have a preference for hand-to-hand combat , unlike that of the Air, capable of carrying lethal special attacks (especially at long range) or that of the Earth and Water, the former with the sense of defense of their master, the latter capable of using healing magic. The fights take place with the classic turn-based system, the game interface is quite unusual, but fortunately very immediate and understandable. Each type has affinities but also weaknesses or particular resistances compared to the others, the player has the task of discovering which ones, through countless battles which, victory after victory, will level up the creatures who will also modify their physical structure, through some levels of growth common to all Divine Beasts. Gameplay Not only that, the over 200 creatures available in Jade Cocoon 2 can also join together, after reaching a high level of experience, to give life to other powerful and unusual beings, by assimilating a shell casing from another creature, feasible operation, like so many others in the halls of Kemuel's palace, the base of operations of your hero and his band of creatures. Graphics and sound Technically Jade Cocoon 2 does not present heart-pounding scenarios or street-finished characters, scrolling never drops below sixty frames per second (thanks to the fact, certainly, that the graphics engine does not move all this deluge of polygons or detailed special effects) but above all the repetitive textures are the most evident weak point of a visual sector which, all in all, would have let itself be looked at without particular criticism. Graphics and sound The sound sector is of the same level, made up of more or less catchy arrangements but all a little repetitive for those who have listened ad nauseam to the musical masterpieces of any Castlevania or Final Fantasy; the dubbing is also inconsistent, whose voice actors don't always try to act as they should and the sound effects are also of fair quality. Conclusions Jade Cocoon 2 is a decidedly unusual RPG, for those who haven't been able to play Pokemon, Monster Rancher and company. Those who already know and appreciate these titles will find themselves faced with a fairly fun but technically poorly cared for product, while a quick look is almost mandatory for those who have never played a game of this type or love, in any case, RPGs and he finds himself without exponents of the genre on his hands. A discreet title that with greater attention to graphics and sound and some tweaks here and there to a gameplay that could become monotonous over time, would certainly have been a must buy, something that did not occur in the second title of the Genki saga . Pro: Atypical for those who chew a few RPGs a lot of Divine Beasts to raise Cons: technically mediocre It's not an rpg that everyone can like Genki returns to the limelight Fans of Pokemon and Digimon, as well as Playstation 2 owners are you there? Well, isn't it that in your immediate past, have you owned a Playstation, maybe with Genki's Jade Cocoon? If this answer is also affirmative, you have come to the right place, you have just started reading the review of Jade Cocoon 2 by Genki, distributed in the West (as opposed to the prequel) by Ubisoft. If you have always envied the owners of Nintendo consoles who are passionate about Pikachu and company, in the present here Jade Cocoon 2 creatures to raise and enhance, gradually, through terrible fights and the use of particular items, there are galore.
