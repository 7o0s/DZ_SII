It is undoubtedly a happy event for the many fans of the manga created by Masashi Kishimoto, which ended a few years ago but is still very popular both at home and in the West; and in particular for those who had remained faithful to the consoles of the big N, without therefore having had the opportunity to try the guessed three-dimensional brawler-style formula developed by the guys from CyberConnect2. It is undoubtedly this audience that the present collection is aimed at, which can also be purchased on the eShop in the individual episodes at the price of 19.99 euros each. The Return of the Leaf Ninja It had actually been since Clash of Ninja Revolution that a Naruto tie-in hadn't been seen on Nintendo home consoles, and there's no doubt that the great success of the Switch rocked the boat, convincing Bandai Namco to make a sudden conversion of the original trilogy which may also be followed by the fourth chapter, the only one to have been designed for current generation systems and therefore the most complicated to bring on the hybrid platform of the Kyoto house. From a content point of view, there is little to complain about: Naruto Shippiden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Trilogy offers three titles that are still fairly enjoyable today, albeit with some unavoidable structural edges, featuring as many long-lasting single player campaigns, which are based on different phases of the story told in the anime and are characterized by very different formulas. In the first Ultimate Ninja Storm we find ourselves exploring a three-dimensional reproduction of the Leaf Village, with the task of interacting with certain NPCs in order to access main and secondary missions. Naturally, only the first ones will make us advance in the story, catapulting us into very spectacular but rather naive duels in terms of gameplay, thanks to the limited repertoire of the twenty-five characters available and an enemy artificial intelligence that too often plays the distance card to avoid our attacks, making the experience quite slippery and frustrating. However, the situation improves quite clearly with Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 and Ultimate Ninja Storm 3: Full Burst. In fact, in the second episode we are faced with a more multifaceted campaign, albeit set in a scenario viewed from various fixed angles and no longer ~livable~ in the third person, while in the third episode things get decidedly more lively and spectacular in the introduction, to then move on to a fairly rich free roaming with a certain margin of freedom of action. The formula remains more or less the same within the entire trilogy, but the evolution of the franchise is quite clear and it is therefore with Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst that the peak is reached in terms of narration, structure and even game mechanics. In fact, where the layout and gameplay in general use the same setting, the last of the three chapters boasts convincing character management, a large and varied roster, a more complete repertoire of moves and refined management of extra objects and assists. A lazy conversion? Naruto's debut on Nintendo Switch and the rich offer of the original trilogy are undoubtedly two very positive aspects of the Bandai Namco production, but there are elements that frankly suggest a half-hearted conversion work. Firstly, there is no possibility of using two Joy-Cons to try out local competitive multiplayer, an inexplicable choice if we think of the fact that the layout of the controls could be easily adapted to even small controllers, guaranteeing an extra feature and the possibility to give life to fun challenges with friends even outside the home. Secondly, on a technical level it is difficult to talk about remasters when the actual resolution of the games, in portable mode, is much lower than that of the original editions for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. From docked, things improve but only up to a certain point, given that you don't go beyond 1600 x 900 pixels and the frame rate, generally stable and characterized by consistent pacing, shows the side of some fairly significant drops in the more chaotic and spectacular sequences, in particular some bosses fight.", "date": "2018-04-30", "grade": "S.V."}
