{"name": "Nintendo DS Browser", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nintendo-ds-browser.html", "text": "The DS at the Opera As many already know, the Nintendo DS Browser is basically an adapted version of the Opera browser, a popular internet browsing software appreciated by many users. An excellent starting point therefore, since the experience and knowledge of the sector of the programmers in question leaves no room for discussion. First of all, a premise: two versions of the product have been distributed on the market, one for DS and one for Lite, absolutely identical in all respects except for the ~dimensions~ of the cartridge that is inserted in the GBA slot. Yes, because the DS Browser requires not only the classic DS cart to work, but also a RAM expansion which is inserted via the GBA slot. The connection to the network obviously takes place via Wi-Fi, via a modem or via the USB key that has already been available in shops for a few months. In case you have already played any of the DS online titles, and therefore if the access point was already set up, you can start browsing immediately. Otherwise creating a new one takes a matter of minutes via a pretty straightforward process. So let's move on to the actual software: the organization of the same on a graphic level is decidedly well studied, with all the commands enclosed within a small bar at the bottom of the touch screen. These are, from left to right: back and forth in visited pages, page reload, history, url entry, bookmark management, search engine (on the same page or on the web, with Yahoo! or others), browser, help, wide screen mode or SSR, turn off images, zoom and reverse the use of screens. Virtually all of the commands just described are standards that need no description, with the exception of a couple that have been designed around the very features of the console. We are referring mainly to the two different ways of displaying the pages, decidedly different from each other; in fact, the SSR method uses both screens, adapting the website so that it is not necessary to scroll horizontally, but only vertically. A not very practical solution, to which the panoramic one is decidedly preferable; in this case, in fact, a screen is used to display the entire page in width, allowing a rectangle to be moved via the touch screen which represents the portion of the site displayed on the other screen in normal size. This choice goes well with the characteristics of the Nintendo DS, and allows (or as we will see later, would allow) navigation without major compromises. Instead, as regards the insertion of url and text in general, this can be entrusted both to the on-screen keyboard and to writing with a stylus. But how does it work then? From what has been said so far, Nintendo DS Browser may seem like a practically perfect product, capable of marrying excellently with the unique qualities of the two-screen console. Unfortunately, however, the technical limitations manifest themselves very quickly, making the whole experience much less satisfying than it might seem on paper. Considering that we are talking about a browser on a portable console, and therefore certainly not comparable in terms of characteristics and potential to those we are used to using on PCs, we might be able to turn a blind eye to the limitations that prevent us from using Flash and Java, or any movies or audio, or any images that aren't in .gif or .jpg. These are undoubtedly key aspects of many modern websites, but even without them it is theoretically possible to use the ~internet tool~ in a way that is anything but superficial. Unfortunately, however, the great problem of the product in question must be found in the excessive slowness in displaying the pages, which require too much time to be loaded completely. We are not referring, mind you, to difficulties related to connections with reduced speeds; the limits are in fact completely linked to the reduced processing capacity of the console, which requires several seconds to reproduce the information obtained from the network on the screen. Just to give an example, it is enough to know that the uploaded images are not stored in the cache even for the duration of navigation on the same site; if, as happens in the vast majority of cases, a page is not contained within a single screen, ~scrolling~ down determines the need to load the new images present. By ~scrolling~ up again in the portion of the site that has just been abandoned, it will again be necessary to waste time to load the images present. Sure, it's possibleIt is possible to disable the display of images to make everything more streamlined, but this means further amputating an already limited browser. By carrying out timed tests, with an ADSL connection and panoramic view, the Multiplayer.it home page took 1 minute and 20 seconds to be fully loaded (50 seconds in SSR), one and a half minutes for courier.it (one minute in SSR). The use of the Nintendo DS Browser therefore becomes acceptable and smooth only by browsing very, very light sites and with very few images. A real pity, because the merits of the program are indisputable, starting with the flexibility that allowed us to view practically all the sites we visited during our test with good precision. Finally, it should be considered that a product of this type finds particular sense as an ~emergency~ navigation tool or in any case to take a look at the web away from home; but in countries like ours, where wi-fi hot spots are unfortunately few and almost always paid for, the situation certainly becomes less favourable. And the sum of all these factors, accompanied by the ~gaming~ price with which the product is marketed, makes the Nintendo DS Browser overall an only partially successful experiment. Does it still make sense to talk about the global success of Nintendo DS? Going far beyond the wildest expectations, the two-screen laptop from the big N managed to earn the status of undisputed leader in the handheld sector without too much effort, despite the fact that the Kyoto house was for the first time on this occasion undermined by a serious suitor to the throne as Sony PSP. In reality, the formula chosen by Nintendo, centered around the concepts of simplicity and immediacy, has undoubtedly proved to be more apt and suitable for the target interested in this kind of console. However, although the DS has therefore undoubtedly chosen a path more purely and mainly aimed at video games than the competitor, the will on the part of the ~parent company~ is clear to offer laptop owners a series of additional features to expand the range of action and skills. In this sense, the imminent Mp3 player, arriving in Europe within the year, should be seen, as well as the rumored and for the moment never confirmed PDA software (directory, diary, etc.). The Nintendo DS Browser is undoubtedly part of this series, now also arrived in the Old Continent and therefore ready for our road test.", "date": "2006-10-20", "grade": null}
