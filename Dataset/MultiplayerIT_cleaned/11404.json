The tested version is the one for Wii. Among the various possible uses of the particular Wii controller, the faculty of being able to exploit it as an adequate replacement for the mouse immediately became clear, thus filling the gap that separated the PC from the consoles in many videogame genres. We therefore thought about the possible applications in FPS (as we have widely seen), in strategic (a genre not yet exploited on the Nintendo console, however) and finally in graphic adventures, regarding which something is definitely moving. Bringing point and click adventures to a Nintendo console might seem strange, given the poor precedents, but if even Capcom has moved in this direction (or almost) with its Zack and Wiki, it is clear that the predisposition is destined to change. In fact, the news of the forthcoming arrival of the Sam & Max episodic series on Wii is recent, and this Secret Files Tunguska has also arrived to underline the console's adventurous vocation. The game in question, developed by Keen Games and published by Deep Silver, belongs to that new wave of graphic adventures for PC, often developed by small studios and in an almost amateur atmosphere, which are bringing the genre back to life after the abandonment of which was the subject of the big labels (LucasArts and Sierra, to name a couple of the golden era), when it became clear that graphic adventures could no longer count on the leading role they enjoyed in the 90s. In this case, it is a ~point and click~ in the most classic style, carried verbatim from PC to Wii, with the obvious adaptation of the commands that are now comfortably entrusted to the console's remote control. Deep Silver's experiment should not be underestimated: although it is not the first adventure converted to consoles, the demographic explosion recorded by the arrival of the Wii in videogame users could bring a genre so reflective and different from the normal structure of video games a large new audience. Too bad Secret Files Tunguska isn't, in fact, one of the best examples of a graphic adventure. An unsolved question The Tunguska accident represents one of the most fascinating mysteries in recent history, wrapped in an aura of mystery that has unleashed the most disparate scientific and more or less paranormal theories. On June 30, 1908, a huge explosion devastated an area of Siberia, the Stony Tunguska, with a power of almost 20 megatons, about 1000 times that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The roar, the seismic waves and the glare were perceived from many kilometers away (it is said that the following nights in most of Europe the sky was still so clear as to make it possible to read the newspaper), but fortunately the place affected by the The impact was essentially composed of a thick uninhabited taiga. The most accredited theory as an explanation of the accident is the crash of a large asteroid, but the fact of not having found fragments of this rock, or a well-defined crater has also fueled other hypotheses. A series of further mysteries then add other question marks to be discussed: the presence of mysterious materials in the area, abnormal growth of vegetation and various rather picturesque testimonies. The resulting theories range from the ~simple~ crash of an astral body (probably before touching the ground), to the impact of a UFO, up to strange explanations based on antimatter, black holes and in some cases also taking into consideration the particular genius of scientist Nikola Tesla. This fascinating preamble is necessary to create a certain expectation around the story of Secret Files Tunguska, which could have reserved an excellent experience, if it hadn't been mortified by unconvincing characters and flat dialogues. The events start with the disappearance of a scientist linked to research on Tunguska: his daughter Nina and the researcher Max set out to find him starting from Berlin and arriving in Siberia, amidst mysterious conspiracies and secret scientific installations A little mysterious mystery The graphic adventure is an alternative way of telling stories, there is little to go around it: it is interactivity applied to a strong narrative substrate. For this, fundamental elements are the plot and the identification that it manages to bring about. The mystery of Tunguska is an excellent starting point for building a compelling story, even if you decide to anchor it firmly in a realistic setting (notoriously less powerful in stimulating the imagination). The stages of the plot are also quite well thought out, but it's the whole narrative mechanism that doesn't hold up: the various oneshe phases of the story appear unrelated to each other, and the dialogues are often boring, generally insufficient to tell a story satisfactorily. In addition to this, the characters are rather flat and uninteresting and the general atmosphere, remaining far from the exotic charm of more imaginative scenarios, fails to involve at the right point. Given the reported defects, where Secret Files Tunguska succeeds, however, is in bringing an excellently packaged and balanced product to the screens, with a good graphic and convincing sector in terms of pace and difficulty. The rendered scenarios are well done and pleasant, and the cinematic cut chosen helps to explain the passages of the plot with cutscenes and moments of narration, although not in an exhaustive way, most of the time. The audio sector, on the other hand, is not very incisive, with good but very rare music, scarce effects, and dubbing (in English) bordering on annoying, given the banality of the dialogues and the unfortunate choices made in terms of voices and acting. Comment Those who expected Secret Files: Tunguska as a return to the ~adventurer~ glories of the 90s will probably be disappointed. The Deep Silver game represents an honest work of craftsmanship, capable of entertaining for a few hours but without being comparable to the major graphic adventures, in terms of plot, puzzles and involvement. The simple and functional interface, together with the convenience of the remote control, contributes to making the gaming experience pleasant, which, moreover, is never frustrating. However, the title in question does not evolve the ~graphic adventure~ genre in any direction, and does not stand out for any particular characteristic (although it does not even suffer from enormous defects). In fact, the game arouses interest above all for its simple belonging to a genre that nowadays, and particularly on consoles, is a rarity. Paradoxically, however, it could be of interest to all those who, not being part of the traditional user, have approached (or reconnected) to video games thanks to the eclectic nature of the Wii, representing an unusual pastime these days. Pros: Excellent interface via Remote Control Very well drawn some locations Interesting premise (the mystery of Tunguska) Cons: Inconsistent narrative Lackluster puzzles Flatness of characters and dialogues Point (the remote) and click The user interface is derived directly from the original PC interface, adapted to take full advantage of the Wii Remote. The result is a simple and intuitive control system, which allows you to command the game through small gestures, pointing the remote control at the television: a decidedly more relaxing approach to graphic adventures than a mouse can do. The Tunguska game system, in line with all the most recent graphic adventures, represents a major streamlining compared to the interfaces of the early days: the simple movement of the pointer highlights the sensitive elements of the scenario, on which essentially two orders of action are possible, i.e. the simple ~observing~ or a manipulation of the object (in this case, ~collecting~ or any other contingent action). Having simplified the interface in this way, all the difficulty in solving the puzzles lies in the ability to combine objects, and in the typical ~pixel hunt~, i.e. the search for all the elements (sometimes not very visible at first glance) with the which ones to interact. The Tunguska problem, at this juncture, is common to many of the recent adventures (with some exceptions, of course) and verifiable in the lack of inspiration and in some cases of logic in the construction of the puzzles. In most cases we will find ourselves having to combine objects to arrive at ~MacGyver~-style solutions, and this is what can be defined as a lack of flair: the absence of a particular cut given to the puzzles, justified by an alleged refined realism by the developers, which however often translates into flatness in the construction of the puzzles and a certain narrow-mindedness given by the scarcity of elements with which to interact. On the other hand, sometimes it is logic that gives way: it is often easier to solve problems through the random combination of objects in the inventory, than with deductive reasoning. Of course, the typical satisfaction in unblocking the various situations in which we find ourselves remains, but the impression is that we are far from the irreverent genius of Gilbert and Schafer's productions, and also from the pragmatic but clear logic of Broken Sword, to make some examples.", "date": "2008-05-23", "grade": null}
