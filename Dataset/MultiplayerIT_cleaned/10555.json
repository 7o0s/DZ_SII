{"name": "Leonesse all'attacco", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/70172-lion-pride-leonesse-allattacco.html", "text": "Among the numerous new video game sub-genres that have emerged thanks to the popularity of the iPhone, one in particular is carving out a well-defined space for itself, and that of line-based puzzles: these are titles in which the user has the task of drawing lines in order to achieve their goals, and which include successful products such as Flight Control. Now, this Lion Pride tries to ride the wave of this new trend, not without adding some original ideas. Edutainment As can be seen from the title, the protagonists of the game are the lions, and in this case the lionesses, responsible for the supply of food within the herd. The purpose of Lion Pride is precisely to tackle the various stages and hunt as many animals as possible, keeping the family's satiety level high. All this is resolved in a static screen in which groups of buffaloes, gazelles, zebras and so on appear from time to time: the user just has to draw a line to indicate to the lioness the direction to follow, by sliding the finger faster to make them take a shot. Once the prey has been reached, our feline protagonist automatically takes care of transforming it into food for her puppies, but this does not mean that the player's task is simple. Characteristic of Lion Pride is in fact a remarkable variety in the behavior of the different animals that appear on the screen, each of which requires a different approach to be captured. Therefore, if it is sufficient to run towards the weaker creatures to obtain a small quantity of meat, the situation is different for the larger and more agile beasts, which guarantee a higher score but also require more effort. Zebras, for example, must necessarily be attacked by two lionesses at the same time: the first must position itself in front of the victim to make it escape, while the second positions itself behind it, ready to attack it as soon as it changes direction. Again, larger animals cannot be taken down without a simultaneous assault, which requires planning and timing on the player's part. Another variant of Lion Pride concerns the sporadic entry into the scene of the idle male lions, who limit themselves to covering a small portion of the territory, helping the females only if they attack a prey in proximity to their location. Although it is undoubtedly stimulating and rather original, Lion Pride suffers from a certain lack of longevity, given that the only eight stages that make up the main mode end soon, and the user is left with nothing to do but try his hand at an anonymous Survival section or try to improve their performances and then make them public on the appropriate online scoreboards. A venial sin considering the very affordable price of the application (79 cents) and the overall quality of the Blue Fang product: from a technical point of view, Lion Pride defends itself well, offering a bird's eye view that highlights the excellent color palette used and the remarkable animal animations. Even the sound is decidedly positive, especially for the music, which is extremely spot on. Lastly, a note of color for the fun facts that can be consulted from the main menu of the game, i.e. curiosities regarding the behavior of real lions.
