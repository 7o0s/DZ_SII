The free peoples of the Earth celebrated together a turning point in the history of the multibillion-dollar Game Freak franchise which, from X and Y onwards, would arrive on the shelves of different languages in the same day. Everyone would leave together, no one would have a head start for days or weeks; no one, apart from the editors who were supposed to review Pokmon and who, from that moment, would have lived in a labyrinth of secrets, prohibitions and very strict embargoes. And so, while fans began to fight over the leaks that invariably followed one another close to the launch, the editors had to bite the bullet and find a way to talk about the game without actually talking about it. As if to say that we are in 2019 and nothing has changed in this review of Pokmon Sword and Shield. In short, here we are discussing Pokmon Sword and Shield without being able to reveal all those juicy details that interest you so much and that you have probably searched on Reddit or 4chan since copies began to circulate in the editorial offices of the sector. How many new pokmon are there? We can't tell you. What are the old pokmon you will meet again in Galar? We can't tell you that either. How many variations of Galar are there, then? Flesh. And the pokmon that have a Gigamax form, how many are there? Total zero. What we can tell you, however, is that Pokmon Sword and Shield, the first excursion of the little monsters on Nintendo Switch, represents an important step forward for the series, but at the same time lends itself more than in the past to a whole range of problems that, generation after generation, they have become more and more incisive. If you really love the Game Freak brand, Pokmon Sword and Shield will amuse you but it is undeniable, and you will understand by reading the next few lines of the review, that it could have - and should have! - give more. A simple story No pokmon trainer has ever played Pokmon for history. We know this as well as you know it. Pokmon is a JRPG game, yes, but it's one of those JRPGs that is played for its content, and if the story is intriguing, fine, but it's not that important. This does not mean, however, that Game Freak has not broken new ground in this sense in the past, attempting more sophisticated approaches that involved us in the plots of the usual villains who wanted to use pokmon to conquer the world or who wanted to take control of it for their own sake. of the monsters themselves. In Pokmon Sun and Moon it had even sunk into pure science fiction, between parallel universes, mad scientists and interdimensional Ultra Beasts. Progress, on the narrative front, that Pokmon Sword and Shield completely ignores in favor of a much less eccentric storyline, a return to origins that could split fan opinion in two. In the game, in fact, we take control of a coach or a coach who undertakes the so-called Galar Gyms Challenge. At the beginning of the game we will come across a mysterious pokmon together with our lifelong friend Hop, who is also the brother of the current Galar champion, Dandel. The latter is probably the most interesting character of a rather lackluster cast: Dandel is a champion full of energy but with no sense of direction, an excellent excuse for some amusing curtain call. His brother Hop, on the other hand, is a bit of a wasted opportunity, although there are some moments in the story that could have been used to characterize him much better: Hop is practically our ally but also our number one rival, who will challenge us regularly during the adventure. There are other contenders we'll be dealing with, but none of them stand out in terms of personality or role in the story. Beet is a hostile and quite exalted trainer, Mary a young trainer who, like us, is tackling the gyms: Team Yell follows her everywhere, a ridiculous band of fans who will occasionally block our way, but who have no charisma compared to the other Teams we've faced in previous Pokmon. The gym leaders are interesting, but in reality their characterization is entrusted to a handful of dialogues or to the profiles described on the back of the Cards that they will give us throughout the story, practically the only way to get to know these characters better and take stock of what what happened up to that point. Despite its simplicity, in fact, the story is told in an extremely superficial way. Every now and then we will come across Sonia, a researcher who is studying the legend of the Dark Night, a crisis that is said to have been averted by the founders of Galar and which, of course, is the ledouble thread cat with the two pokmon on the cover, Zacian and Zamazenta. Unfortunately this aspect of the plot emerges only in fits and starts, culminating in a concluding sequence that takes place without much preamble and ends in a weak stone's throw. We are light years away from the epic final fights of the previous episodes and this one, honestly, let us down a bit. The greater power of the Switch and the possibility of entrusting the narration to a much more dynamic direction should have given the story an edge, instead the Game Freak guys preferred to move in a much more cautious way. The challenge of the gyms Pokmon Sword and Shield is actually a simple game in almost every aspect, starting with the story devoid of bite, which is reflected in the linear progression that marks our journey through Galar. Lacking a reason to slip into power plants or explore ancient abandoned ruins, the structure of the game essentially follows the primary objective of obtaining the eight medals that will allow us to participate in the finals and challenge the Galar champion for his title. This progression therefore does not rely on learning moves such as Surf or Strength, which gave exploration a vague ~metroidvania~ flavor: there are no longer areas in which it is not possible to continue without having defeated a certain gym leader, nor does the possibility to choose the order in which to tackle some gyms, which would certainly have been welcome. The game takes us through the outdoor paths in a precise order, making us go from one gym to another while catching lots of pokmon from the first minutes of the game and setting up teams if necessary, a practice made even easier by the possibility of access the deposited pokmon Box at any place or time. We must admit that we have an ambivalent feeling towards this new linear solution that goes straight to the point without complicating our lives with long moments of backtracking, which is non-existent given that the possibility of moving instantly from one city to another is unlocked practically immediately thanks to the VoloTaxi service. On the one hand we lack the adventurous experience of the ~dungeons~ faced in the previous Pokmon between one gym and another; on the other hand, perhaps we grew up with a franchise that wanted to abandon those solutions to guarantee players a more immediate and intuitive experience that didn't bother us so much. Although they don't shine for level design, the various routes are structured in an intelligent way and become more and more complex as the hours accumulate in the rescue, multiplying the coaches who want to challenge us, the crossroads and the optional passages that lead to useful objects to collect . It is clear that Game Freak has tried to move even further away from the idea of offering players only fight after fight, as evidenced by the challenges we will face in real gyms: they are often logic puzzles that sometimes look like real mini-games and that will make us face a few coaches before the gym leader who keeps the medal on duty. It must be said that in Pokmon Sword and Shield this approach has had an impact even more than in the past on a generally rather low level of difficulty, and not so much for the actual intelligence of our opponents, but more because of a series concessions that can only be circumvented in rare cases. When the story forces us to fight to continue, there is almost always a character who heals our pokmon before a challenging fight, limiting the waste of potions and other consumables; at the same time, the PokCampeggio not only serves to improve our relationship with pokmon, but also to heal them at any time by cooking curry through a trivial minigame. If it is true that the players can decide whether to camp or not while exploring the paths, no choice is given to us regarding the experience sharing system, which assigns the points in question to all the pokmon in the team, and many more to those who actively participate in the struggle. This solution means that players often have an advantage in terms of levels every time they face a mandatory fight and often we find ourselves fighting in gyms with pokmon capable of defeating opponents within a couple of rounds. Of course, the player's experience does a lot, especially if he knows well the relationships between the types and weaknesses of the pokmon he has to face: potentially one could decide to play without relying on super effective moves, but in this respect the game would lose almost completelyof sense. In short, the difficulty curve is decidedly mild. We didn't find this choice so outrageous, which allowed us to grow many different pokmon in a short time without painstakingly grinding in the paths or in the Wilds, but we can understand if the die-hard veterans of the franchise will have to complain about it. The Wild Lands In fact, the much-hyped Wildlands seemed like the most controversial element of the package. It's content implemented in such a strange and forced way that it almost seems like it was only thought of and added after the rest of the game. The history of Pokmon Sword and Shield obliges us to go through the Wilds essentially twice and that's it, but in reality there is no need to linger in that area until the end of the game, and we have not even felt the need to exploit them for grind experience. Once the story is completed, the matter changes significantly: the Wild Lands become the primary resource of pokmon, experience points and consumables, and the bulk of the action essentially moves there. Wild pokmon level up dramatically, granting players the ability to catch and raise them more easily. In this sense, it is worth spending a few words on a great novelty: random fights no longer exist, neither in the Wild Lands nor in any other area. Now the wild pokmon are visible in the tall grass and sometimes even in open spaces, so it is possible to choose the little monster to fight against and which perhaps we would like to capture. Walking in the tall grass, however, it may happen that a hidden pokmon targets us and chases us briefly, forcing us to fight in case it reaches us: it must be said that some pokmon only appear in this way, so anyone who wants to complete the PokDex he will have to sift through literally every bush in Galar. It is a beautiful solution which, unfortunately, hits the concept of the Wilds hard, an open world area in which it is even possible to control the camera to look around. It would have been better to call them Wastelands, as wild pokmon appear only a few steps away from the player, while the field of vision remains deserted practically to the horizon. The Wild Lands were supposed to represent Pokmon's first real step towards that MMO future that many players have wanted for years. Although the experience is identical on the small screen in portable mode, it is on the TV that an area like the Wild Lands is expressed in all its potential, but we are very far from the atmosphere breathed in titles such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or Xenoblade Chronicles 2. The Wild Lands of Galar are essentially empty: to populate them there are a few NPCs here and there and monsters that only appear in our vicinity. The rays of light that rise towards the sky indicate the positions of the dens in which it is possible to face the Raid Dynamax, an idea that all in all has its why but that we really wanted to test in multiplayer mode before writing this review. In practice, these fights see us face off against a single giant pokmon with a team of up to four pokmon, one for each trainer participating in the fight. The Dynamax The giant pokmon are obviously stronger than normal and can attack even more times in the same turn. It is important to carefully choose the pokmon to deploy, playing on the relationships between types and deciding at the table which player will dynamax his monster: if the fight reaches the tenth round, or the deployed pokmon faint four times in total, you end up outside the den and you have to restart from the beginning. The idea is ingenious and the rewards tasty - not only the captured pokmon, but also Technical Disks, lots of candies to distribute experience points, consumables in profusion - but the most difficult raids are practically impossible to face alone: the game chooses three pokmon random to help us, which sometimes also include disadvantaged types compared to the boss we have to face, and the artificial intelligence really leaves a lot to be desired. In many cases, it would be better to have no help at all, too bad that's not possible. The Raid Dynamax could be a very valid content to play or replay in company, a pity that Nintendo has decided to keep the servers offline for the whole test. We have to admit we weren't overly impressed with the new dynamaxization mechanic. It adds a spectacular visual contribution to battles, especially when facing Gym Leaders who, on time", "date": "2019-11-13", "grade": "8.0"}
