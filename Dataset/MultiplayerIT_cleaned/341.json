{"name": "Yakuza", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/yakuza.html", "text": "Shenmue? Not exactly In Yakuza the gamer takes on the role of Kazuma Kiryu, a young man belonging to the Tojo family who, at the height of his ~career~ (he is about to form his own gang), in 1995, is arrested for a murder he never committed, by which he assumes the blame to protect his fiance, the beautiful Yumi, and his dear friend Nishiki, the real author of the crime. Released from prison ten years later, Kiryu finds himself at the center of a no-holds-barred struggle within the organization, for the discovery of 10 million yen disappeared into thin air and control of the families The gameplay of Yakuza mainly revolves around to two simple elements: a semi-exploratory phase, which takes place by moving on foot through the streets of the Tokyo district where the story is set, to reach a certain objective indicated on the appropriate map, and a ~fighting~ phase characterized from constant street brawls with criminals of all stripes or affiliated with the local mafia. In the first case, unfortunately, forget the freedom of action offered by games like the aforementioned Shenmue, given that, excluding the mini-games or your possible willingness to momentarily ignore the plot to wander aimlessly, Yakuza turns out to be quite linear, forcing you to done to move from point A to point B from time to time. Once you have obtained a clue, in fact, the mission to be carried out will start, and at that point there is nothing left to do but take the shortest route to reach the area marked in red on the map. As soon as you arrive on site, a cut-scene inherent in the story usually starts, almost always followed by a beating, or you get a tip to move further and reach the following objective. So, as you can see, compared to Yu Suzuki's masterpiece you will be guided almost by the hand in the adventure. Street brawls As for the purely ~fighting~ aspect, however, things look a little better. Even if in the most agitated phases it is difficult to ~lock~ an opponent due to the absence of a pad key used for this task, the clashes with enemies are excellently realized. Especially violent. In the streets of Kamura-cho it is easy to come across some drug dealer or simple thug, or even some mafia man or jealous boyfriends, all eager to piss you off. In these cases there is only one law that applies: that of the road. Kiryu Kazuma is certainly not the last to arrive and knows how to defend himself being able to boast a collection of remarkable moves. Kicks, punches, headbutts, with the three main keys assigned by SEGA to the shots achievable by the Pg, you can really do anything to the unfortunate person who dared to challenge us. This phase is probably the most successful of the entire game and offers the user a lot of fun. Especially when arming yourself with a vase, a tube or any blunt object to throw it in the face of an attacker, or again, by pressing the Triangle key at the right moment (appearance of a specific icon on the screen when the tension reaches its maximum) the head of the unfortunate person on duty is smashed against a wall or a table. As in an RPG, our character can gain experience at the end of each fight (and not only here as we will see later), the points of which can be used to increase his ~technical~ skills, such as the ability to inflict more damage on opponents or ~charge~ more quickly the spirit of the dragon, ~source~ of the most terrifying moves executable by Kazuma. Limited spaces The game environment is not very large, it is, as mentioned, a district, made up of a dozen streets and some buildings of fair proportions, from which it is not possible to exit or interact with every single element present on the screen, including the people, with whom, contrary to what was expected, it is not possible to talk to anyone except some of them (those ~available~ for dialogue are indicated by colored arrows on their heads). Fortunately, graphically everything is done quite well, even if it does not reach the qualitative level of Suzuki's masterpiece on the Dreamcast (where we could admire dozens of unique characters, characterized by unique voices and appearance, highly detailed textures, etc.), with the insignia at bright neon lights that stand out against the people crowding the streets, the clubs full of life and the rain that sometimes hits the asphalt. If we really want to find a flaw in the graphics sector, we must highlight the limited number of polygons that make up the ~human~ models used for the Npg, quite repetitive, and some animations to review. Obviously, longevity is affected by all this, which is not theoretically high. Theoretically, if you followue only the main plot. If you want to fully enjoy the adventure and make it longer and more interesting, the best thing to do is go in search of the various mini-games that fill the title, and dedicate some time to them. Which, by the way, is not at all boring or useless, on the contrary. Most of the secondary missions, for example, are fun and rewarding, and most of the time they offer excellent rewards for their completion, such as martial arts courses to learn new techniques or special tickets to be able to admire all the stripteases in the city for free ... An evening with friends In fact, among the funniest secondary activities of Yakuza, there is that of being able to attend the various clubs for adults that our good Kazuma can visit between one mission and another. Casinos, arcades and striptease clubs are suitable places to spend a few hours in joy, perhaps enjoying some striptease shows or trying to pick up a beautiful girl. The SEGA title, in fact, offers the user the opportunity to get to know girls as in the classic dating simulators. If, through pre-established phrases, he manages to seduce the young girl on duty, Kazuma will be entitled to a night of passion with her! But before the bib slips out of your eager mouths it is better to immediately dampen the enthusiasms: of the above sexual ~performances~ we will not be able to see anything. The practice is liquidated in a few moments, with a pink screen and the background of a moan, plus a handful of experience points. If you want to save your money instead, and invest it in something more useful than mere entertainment, you can do it in the shops of the Kamura-cho district, where in addition to food you can buy fashionable accessories or weapons that can be used for fighting. Kazuma is ~based~ in the bar of his friend, Reina (no relation to yours truly). In the room our ~kyodai~ has the possibility to recover the energy status or save the progress of the current game, as well as keep the objects recovered during the adventure. However, the first two actions can also be carried out externally, or in the various fast-food restaurants in the area (by eating certain foods you get new lifeblood or experience points to enhance your moves), or near public telephones (game save). Comment It's not poetic and captivating like Shenmue, it has the variety of a GTA, yet SEGA's Yakuza has charm to spare. Although in fact it is not technically equal to the best PS2 titles, the game manages to charm the gamer, to be played and appreciated thanks to its unique style, which takes a lot of advantage from its characteristic setting, from the cinematographic imprint and from those surrounding elements that flank the main plot, not to mention a decidedly charismatic protagonist. A greater calibration of the fights, perhaps present in an excessive and often easy way, would have allowed the title to be even more captivating, but already at this point Yakuza, with the second episode already in development, is preparing to become a saga of great charm and quality . Pros: Interesting story and ok setting, very charismatic protagonist. Several mini-games and things to do. Screen text in Italian. Cons: Excessively present fights. Lack of alternation between day and night. Too many uploads. With these words, which we wanted to summarize for obvious reasons of space, through an ancient Shinto ritual, a new adept is introduced as a member of the Japanese criminal organization better known as the Yakuza. Born around 1612 in full shogunate of the Tokugawa family, as a ~set of gangs~ (often made up of street vendors or farmers - Ed.) called ~machi-yakko~, with the intention of countering the excessive power of the samurai who in those years sowed fear and death in the villages, the Yakuza is originally a ~structure~ not exactly criminal and indeed, close to the people. Just from one of these gangs, the Bakuto, and from one of the activities very dear to it, the game of The name Yakuza owes its name to one of the games practiced at the time, hanafuga, and more precisely to the losing combination of three cards, those marked by the numbers 8-9-3 : Ya-Ku-Sa. The tradition of the severed finger as atonement for a mistake also dates back to this gang, and tattoos all over the body as a sign of belonging to the ikka or gumi, the mafia family.Many years after that masterpiece that was Shenmue, SEGA has decided to re-propose to his fans a style of play similar to that game, albeit on a smaller scale, and to set his new ~adventure~ title in this underworld universe, which in this veryt days it arrives in our country after the good success found in its land of origin.", "date": "2006-10-11", "grade": null}
