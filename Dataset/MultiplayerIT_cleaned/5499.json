INKS is one of these occasions, with the developers State of Play (the same ones from Lumino City) who, evidently in the throes of some lysergic influence, had the bizarre intuition of building a pinball machine by putting a ball dirty with paint inside it. What emerges is a sort of pictorial canvas in which the artistic creations derive from the colors struck by the ball and from the trajectories of this on the surface of the table, a solution capable of creating unexpected effects, thanks to the non-conformity of the paint splashes and the geometries of the linear trajectories of the sphere, projected at great speed in a straight line between the blades of the pinball machine and the various obstacles and buffers scattered on the surface. It seems strange but basically the main concept of INKS is all here: a pinball game with a ball that can change color and spread paint around the tables, obviously with the latter differing in various configurations and arrangement of the elements, in so as to propose slightly different experiences each time. We can speak of artistic indie in this case as well, but the peculiarity of the game is precisely its combination of the rarefied atmospheres of its ~artsy~ style, made up of simple lines, soft backgrounds and strong contrasts with splashes of paint, with a structure playful game that couldn't be more classic, since it is precisely a pinball machine. From this association of ideas an interesting and innovative sensory experiment was born which also manages to remain firmly anchored to an extremely classic and well-established playful substrate, albeit of extreme simplicity. INKS: Pinball machines and colours, an experience for videogamers and painters Canvas with gameplay Explaining the gameplay of INKS puts us in the strange position of having to talk about the basic functioning of the pinball machine, which might seem somewhat redundant considering that it is one of the most popular and popular games in the world. The rules are the same: two flaps placed at the base of each level are controlled directly by touching the two sides of the screen, and with these we find ourselves relaunching a sphere that rolls within planes characterized by different conformations. The basic elements are therefore the standard ones, with the introduction of various configurations of the elements positioned on the screen, of the buffers and of the obstacles on the table, including various assorted gimmicks such as holes to avoid and various other alternative solutions that force us to control the sphere with some precision. If we evaluate it solely as a pinball simulation, INKS hardly compares to other more complex and refined titles of the genre, but this game presents itself as something different. The aim of each level is to hit the colored areas placed on some points of the edges of the tables, which determines the particular splashes of color characteristic of this State of Play creation, modifying the representation of the levels and coloring the ball accordingly, which in in this way he draws lines of color around the tables and transforms them into Pollock-style abstract canvases. The game counts the number of times we throw the ball and challenges us to hit the colored elements and finish the levels within a minimum number of shots, obviously trying to lose as few balls as possible, pushing us to perfect our style of play perfectly calculating the launches of the ball, even returning several times to the various tables to improve performance and obtain better evaluations. This feature also determines a particular variation with respect to the standard pinball machine which helps to identify INKS as a sort of artistic puzzle game in the form of a pinball machine, rather than an actual simulation of the arcade classic. It's not so much about staying as long as possible on each table to increase the multipliers, but rather about trying to solve each level in the minimum amount of moves, controlling the ball with the greatest possible precision. The decidedly low access price (1.99 euros) now also includes the two packages initially sold separately, for a decidedly generous content offer at this point.", "date": "2016-05-19", "grade": "7.5"}
