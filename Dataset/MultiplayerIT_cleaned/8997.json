Of course there are several titles on the iPhone and iPad that use the virtual stick system in an excellent way, there are still situations in which this solution cannot be applied, perhaps because the engine that moves everything does not yet allow developers to do it in a way effective. This is the case of the spectacular Infinity Blade as well as Dark Meadow, which marks the debut of Phosphor Games on the App Store after the parenthesis Kinect Adventures, for which the team created the Space Pop minigame. For their first project on the iOS platform, these guys from Chicago have chosen the Unreal Engine 3 and tried to create an action adventure that undoubtedly reproduces the mechanics of the Epic Games production, but which manages to stand out due to some elements and offers, in any case, a strong and significant experience. It already starts from the introduction in real time, among the most beautiful ever seen on an Apple device, in which we observe the building in which the story takes place from the tall grass that surrounds it, and then look inside . The emblematic silence and the mysterious luminous figure that can be glimpsed for a moment, assisted by amazing graphics, which produce a review of special effects and high-resolution textures, reveal themselves in fact at the service of a direction that aims to create right from immediately a certain atmosphere. Then when you decide to start the game, from a narrative point of view, the game takes only a few seconds to conquer us. In fact, our character wakes up in one of the rooms of the abandoned hospital, accompanied by the sound of a voice speaking to him on the intercom and which belongs to another ~tenant~ who seems to know a lot about this gloomy place and mysterious. His suggestions are intended to warn us of the dangers that lurk behind every door and along every corridor, in the form of monstrous creatures, the result of who knows what wicked experiment. And then there's her, the abstract presence, which with each defeat will lead us back to our room, as if everything had to start afresh, in a search that becomes more aware each time and sees us more ready to face the necessary clashes. Gestures that kill We have said that Dark Meadow undoubtedly refers to the mechanics of Infinity Blade, but which at the same time offers some important differences. Navigation within the scenarios works in a very similar way, i.e. a point of the location towards which we can move is highlighted and it is enough to touch it for the movement to take place. However, the view is in first person, and by dragging the image on the screen we can actually manage the camera as we wish, wherever we are, as if it were a first person shooter. Observing every room and every detail proves to be important because we can find hidden objects of various types, such as gold (necessary to buy new equipment), weapons, medkits and documents that are used to enrich the plot, as is the tradition for survival horror. We talked about the voice that we can hear from time to time, recited with great intensity even if unfortunately only in English (but well subtitled in Italian). Well, this entry belongs to a mysterious man reduced to a wheelchair, who in turn will provide us with the pieces that make up the intricate puzzle of the story, undoubtedly one of the strengths of this production. Exploration of the scenarios is subordinated to random fights against a large variety of monsters, and in this case the similarities with Infinity Blade are more marked: two virtual keys at the ends of the screen allow us to dodge attacks, while drawing lines it translates into as many blows on our part. The parry, however, is managed differently (just press the relative key, even if this maneuver still involves the loss of a part of our vital energy), and furthermore the ~prelude~ to each physical fight consists of a ranged combat phase in which we can take advantage of our crossbow and inflict as much damage as possible on the enemy before having to switch to close combat. Buying new and more powerful weapons allows us to easily overcome the creatures, which in any case become tougher and more dangerous with each ~stint~, but in case of defeat our adventure will simply start over again: we will wake up in the same room, even if the progress is been registered (also in terms of experience points and character level) and we are given the opportunity to open previously closed doors. Forwardand, our mysterious friend will explain to us exactly how things went, all the way up to the next clash, perhaps with the white spirit that seems to control the building. In technical terms, the work done by Phosphor Games is excellent, even if the creature design doesn't always live up to expectations. In fact, the scenarios are rich in detail, with excellent lighting effects and an alternation of medium or high definition textures. The end result, however, is undoubtedly among the most interesting ever seen on iPhone and iPad. The tested version is 1.0.1 Price: 4.99 App Store links", "date": "2011-10-25", "grade": "8.4"}
