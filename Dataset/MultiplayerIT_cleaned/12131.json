{"name": "FIFA Street 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-street-2_a.html", "text": "Probably, it all started from a series of commercials in which the great soccer stars battled each other in ~matches~ very similar to those played by the classic neighborhood kids, perhaps with imaginary goals delimited by two backpacks and a pitch that lends itself to everything except physical contrasts. Of course, the strength of this ~spin-off~ of real football does not lie in the setting, but in the greater attention paid to the technical and acrobatic aspect of the clashes, in which the individual players play much more important roles than in a regular eleven. But how can all this work on a mobile phone? It just doesn't work. Or rather, the features of FIFA Street 2 in this pocket version have been greatly scaled down (pun intended?), turning everything into a rather simple and conventional football, with only half the players on the pitch and a pitch the size very small. On consoles it was possible to perform acrobatic maneuvers bordering on realism, get rid of opponents with tunnels and feints, all things impossible to reproduce on mobile in the same way and therefore yes present, but in a much less exciting guise. The developers of Electronic Arts have done everything possible to make the experience as immediate and fun as possible, creating a control system that works by pressing only the FIRE button and using the joystick to move the players, with the addition of keys for stunts , but the result is still too cumbersome to be engaging and the game modes, player growth and anything else that has been implemented to resolve the situation are not enough. The technical aspect of FIFA Street 2 certainly represents the strong point of the game, with rather diversified and detailed settings, players who move with convincing animations and a catchy soundtrack. As mentioned, the control system consists only of the joystick and the FIRE button, with the latter deputy for passes as well as shots, modifying its pressure (fast for passages, slow and loaded for shots). They are flanked by three extra buttons for performing stunts.
