The curator of the piece, Andrea Papaleo, has enormous experience in virtual skies and for this article he went through various stages of beta testing before playing the final version. Obviously our invitation remains to visit the Fighter Combat Sims official website, join the community and take advantage of the tools designed for the learning phase of the complex mechanics underlying the use of these products. DCS A-10C is the latest product released from Eagle Dynamics after the remarkable success of the DCS Ka-50 Black Shark. The latter, an attack helicopter, was faithfully reproduced, without omitting any detail. The A-10C is no less, developed down to the smallest detail with a fully clickable cockpit and advanced graphics. At the moment the A-10C is only available on the official website. The entire package of files is roughly 4 GB and you are entitled to ten activations and as many deactivations. The supplied CD-Key can be used by a single user and can be installed on multiple computers, but it is not allowed to fly online with the same CD-Key from multiple machines at the same time. After installing the simulator and launching the executable created on the desktop, we enter the main screen that allows us to select an Instant Action game, change the graphic settings, realism, controls or open the advanced mission editor. A link to multiplayer is also noticeable - this way it will be easier and faster to switch from one mode to another. Before leaving, it is good to know that having a joystick is something at least desirable. A Saitek X-52 is recommended which, thanks to its profile management program, can help the pilot even in the most agitated phases of the game. The most avid enthusiasts, on the other hand, can focus on a superior quality product such as the Hotas Warthog. Very interesting, the game sets the controls automatically, depending on the joystick connected to the PC, halving the setup times to allow the player to immediately jump headlong into the action. Arcade or Simulation? Eagle Dynamics has also thought of the less experienced, adding an ~Arcade~ mode which facilitates, for example, the launch of missiles, the release of bombs and so on. It is recommended for those who don't know about simulation or who are looking for pure fun with maximum simplicity. To launch a Maverick, for example, just select the missile with the ~D~ key, press ~M~ to change target, ~Alt+Space~ to launch the missile and wait for the bang! To launch a Maverick in ~Simulations~ mode, on the other hand, things get more complicated. And quite a lot. Not only are we forced to use the MFCDs (Multi Functions Color Displays) to select the missile, but we must also activate the Master Arm. Then you have to press MAV on the right MFCD, move the cursor and, even more difficult, find the target before it finds your aircraft. The offer A notable improvement of the DCS A-10C compared to the Ka-50 is that the simulator offers a section dedicated to training. This is composed of several sub-sections inserted in a gradual scale and by coefficient of difficulty. Each single mission offers, in addition to the Guide voice, interactive menus and bright icons, which highlight the command to press, guaranteeing a more relaxed learning curve. Sometimes we find ourselves in front of buttons and switches whose function we don't know: just leave the mouse cursor on the button, and a caption of the highlighted function immediately appears. Very useful for those who don't know or don't remember a specific function inside the cockpit. The simulator also has some very flexible options for single player play, which allow us to get right into the heart of the action. Thanks to Instant Action, the user can choose whether to play a mission on low, normal or hard difficulty, thus projecting the pilot into the skies in seconds. In addition to this, the Fast Create Mission allows you to create, ad hoc, a mission with parameters defined by the user: you can choose the difficulty, the number of targets on the ground, weather conditions, flight departure time, allied aircraft and etc. In short, a real generator never seen before for complexity and choice. There are also three pre-loaded campaigns to play through, all of which are story-driven and quite engaging. We will hear our flight attendants calling for help, pointing out targets or a group of F-15s launching missiles at hostile aircraft. Theall accompanied by a curated graphics. In short, the missions created by the developers prove to be useful. For example, one departing from the airport with the vehicle already in motion, other very realistic missions to complete, complete with briefings and images, or a peaceful air navigation over the Caucasus. The multiplayer sector plays a fundamental role, which is to bring the user to confront other virtual pilots, on missions created by them. Cooperation is the basic principle of multiplayer and several missions will be accomplished only by collaborating and managing team pilots. There are no multiplayer campaigns but, thanks to the editor, we can create real battlefields where, for example, we are called upon to defend a friendly airbase with other A-10s. Multiplayer therefore adds longevity to the simulator, making the missions virtually endless. Logbook and encyclopedia All our kills, flights made and scores are saved in the Logbook, which also takes into account the flight time. Depending on the time we spend on the simulator or the score achieved, we are awarded a medal. The encyclopedia, on the other hand, shows all types of vehicles used by the simulator, from aircraft to land vehicles, including the various bombs/missiles and naval vehicles. Quite complete and useful in the editing phase. Aesthetics and artificial intelligence Let's now move on to the graphics sector which, as written in the preview published some time ago, is very realistic, using the now highly exploited DirectX 9 with HDR effects, dynamic shadows and explosions, updated with respect to Beta 4. A patch will then be released which will add the dynamic shadows inside the aircraft cockpit, making the simulator even more immersive. In the graphic options, we can choose between Low - Medium - High and, especially in the final version, the game performs well even on not too powerful PCs. We can enable shadows on other planes or decide the visual range, significantly improving performance. A beautiful function introduced is that of the night vision device, improved compared to the Ka-50 and which now allows us to lower or increase the brightness. At night, fun is guaranteed! In the final version, ground graphical improvements have been added, including rocks and bushes, making low-flying even more realistic, especially when there are troops hidden in the trees. We can adjust the amount of grass, via the options panel, but also that of trees in a certain view radius. Artificial intelligence has improved a lot compared to the latest version of Beta 4. As written in the preview phase, our wingmen warn us that a threat is close and react to enemy fire, maneuvering and attacking, just like a real pilot would. Unfortunately, however, the simulator suffers from a bug that prevents multiple aircraft guided by artificial intelligence from taking to the runway one after the other. In fact, it can be seen that they stop on the taxi way, thus preventing the other vehicles from taking off. Eagle Dynamics should release a new patch to fix this and other minor bugs. We also remind you that a first patch has already been released just a few days after its release: version 1.1.0.6. The developer has decided to release more patches from time to time, giving attention to the consumer and his requests; in this way the product remains constantly updated. As mentioned, it is possible to interact with the ground units that will provide us with support and indications on the target to attack, and this makes the DCS A-10C an even more immersive simulator; here artificial intelligence plays a fundamental role. Which direction To wrap it up, we were able to speak with Matt Wagner, producer of the DCS A-10C. Some questions about the future of the game and the series, including some new indiscretions and a series of shots on the next scenario set in Nevada. Given the huge leap towards better realism made by DCS with the inclusion of the FAC component and the Precision Approach Path Indicators, for the next module the possibility of adding the ~Bliss Back~ emergency stop barriers and the base siren? There are many, many new additions we would like to make to the DCS series but it's all a matter of balancing resources and deciding what priorities to pursue. As the series evolves, new features will be added. Furthermore, we not only have our ~to do list~ as a reference, but we also follow the forums to get the best possible feedback from users. Will the next aircraft be fixed-wing? We are all curious about the model. You have already startedto the development? If so, did you stick to DirectX 9 or did you decide to exploit the potential of DX11? Yes, in all likelihood it will be a fixed wing vehicle but for the moment we don't want to say anything more than that. Which medium you choose is a decision that can still be subject to change and we don't want to make any announcements until we are 100% certain. And of course we want to keep users' attention on the A-10 C, which hasn't even hit the retail market yet! As for the question about DirectX, it's something we've already addressed in the development phase but we still can't state which ones and how they will be implemented. Nevada, next scenario for the DCS series, will be released within the year? What level of detail will there be? Will we see Las Vegas as we see it in reality? The Nevada-set map started out as a third-party project, but due to expediency, Eagle Dynamics stepped in and took over development. We hope to release it by 2011. It will be a step forward in terms of producing our environments and yes, there will be Vegas. For the occasion, we have given you some screenshots that show you how the map is at the moment, still incomplete. Will the DCS modules all be compatible? Yes, that is our intention. When the A-10 C is properly patched, we will focus on the compatibility of the module with the Black Shark. How realistic is the flight model of the A-10 C? What data were they based on and how faithfully was it reproduced in its more complex dynamics (stalls, screws...)? According to what the real pilots of the plane tell us, it's very realistic. Of course, some might dispute this statement but they don't take into account factors such as vehicle load, flight conditions and techniques for making the most of the vehicle. How much more do you intend to develop the A-10 module? Should we expect surprises, goodies or a simple fix for current bugs? Above all, we will add new models inside the cockpit that allow for dynamic shadows inside the cockpit. You have the merit of being the first to introduce management and development of simulators for integrated modules, opening scenarios up to that unthinkable moment. What should we expect for the future? Are you going to develop a combat scenario on different platforms (helicopters, planes, ships, land vehicles)? What is your idea on the simulation environment, what are you aiming for? DCS is an open simulation environment that is not limited to one vehicle, time period or location. That said, we expect more DCS modules to be produced as the series grows.", "date": "2011-04-15", "grade": "9.0"}
