While not too far off, the memory of the 128-bit versions is still vivid, especially in terms of framerate, which barely reached 30fps, leaving the player free to fantasize about a smoother incarnation. Xbox 360 and new PC graphics cards are the answer, it seems, but we still can't tick off the fluency item without delay. Everyone will remember the notable video asynchrony problems of version 06. Well, Climax has worked hard in this sense, and the results are pleasing to the eye without sacrificing details and a dignified look in the nextgen landscape. Therefore the v-sync problems have completely disappeared, the slowdowns have decreased significantly, but unfortunately not completely. Although on more infrequent occasions, the framerate drops are not lacking, often even quite important, but fortunately they do not affect the gameplay, which, we anticipate, is present in abundant quantities. But let's start from the beginning. Moto GP 07, exactly like last year, a paradise for MotoGP lovers. Not only for the presence of official circuits and riders of the season, but for the rather pertinent simulation of the competition, from the pre-race, to the qualifications, to the possibility of changing the set-up of the bike, without forgetting the legendary Valentino ~The Doctor~ Rossi. This wasn't enough, there is an exhaustive career mode which, following the typical canons of the genre, puts us in the role of the novice on duty, ready to climb the world rankings. And again, for those who want a more arcade approach, there are various fantasy tracks, enclosed in a special mode called Extreme, in the tradition of the previous episodes. In short, a lot of irons in the fire, which allows endless hours of digital entertainment, without however bringing real innovations. An editor capable of customizing the livery of the motorbikes and related riders could not be missing, indeed rather modest (it is not a Forza 2, to be clear), but certainly appreciable. Novices will be able to enjoy the training mode, which badly follows the GT license system, presenting a series of tests with mandatory objectives to be completed. The intentions are those of a tutorial, but the lack of information suitable for learning driving techniques, combined with the big framerate problems that afflict this section, make it rather useless and forced. Once on the track, we can enjoy the refinement work of Climax, which offers us an incredibly fast engine, even too fast, characterized by a lively palette, excellent quality textures, a well-made polygonal audience, colored smoke bombs, helicopters, and so on. Nothing is static in MGP 07, and the almost constant 60 frames give an intoxicating fluidity, deceptive for reasons that we will explain shortly. We were talking about fluidity, unfortunately there are situations in which we see engine drops, mainly during track exits in crowded situations, or in wet races. Nothing comparable to last year in any case, the improvement is evident, but still not optimal. Difficult to attribute these defects to the hardware, since the Extreme circuits, clearly more complex, are not affected in any way. It's easier to think of an absence of optimization, but the path is the right one, and could lead to a practically perfect 2008 edition in terms of fluidity. The strongly contradictory character of this production is more complex to analyze. The developers have not yet decided whether to offer a simulation or an arcade, and the understandable choice is that of a hybrid which, like the previous ones, rewards a niche user. As we said, the speed of the engine seduces the player, leading him to face the curve in completely wrong times, and this is resolved with disastrous falls to the ground. The frequency of this outcome forces a complete reevaluation of the driving approach. It is necessary to brake well in advance, brush the curve calmly and precisely, close it quickly using advanced techniques that unfortunately the tutorial fails to explain. All this requires dedication and time, a condition that the old aficionado of the racing Climax knows well, but which could be misunderstood by casual players. On the other hand, attempts to win the favor of the mainstream can be seen in other sectors: collisions between drivers that are anything but realistic, exaggerated steering sensitivity (on Extreme tracks you bounce which is a pleasure) and very marked adherence to the asphalt. As mentioned, falls are almost always attributableto the wrong management of the brake, or the impact with the opposing pilots, managed by a rather questionable AI. Unfortunately, this doesn't always consider our bike an obstacle to avoid, with consequences that are easy to imagine. It's no fun being mowed down by an opponent's motorcycle gone mad, especially if the accident irreparably affects the outcome of the race. But those who have played the previous episodes are well aware of these problems, which continue to accompany the saga. The online department deserves particular mention, since the Xbox editions the Climax product has always presented a remarkable cure for multiplayer. And Moto GP 07 is no exception. Up to 16 drivers can participate in the same session, in player or ranked match mode. Once the choice has been made, you are automatically transferred to the first accessible lobby, or we can create one ourselves from scratch, and invite our friends from the contact list. But that's not all, there are the new tournament and Pink Slip modes, both limited to Extreme circuits. The first imposes the use of motorcycles of the same nationality, the second is a head-to-head gambling competition, in which the winner wins the opponent's racing car. The matches we have played have always taken place in acceptable conditions. The framerate has fortunately not been halved, and this translates into matches that are absolutely indistinguishable from offline ones. In any case, it is advisable to practice properly before running into the big network, the community orbiting Moto GP is decidedly fierce ... And be careful not to play your beloved centaur! Goals 360 Moto GP 07 also presents the 50 canonical objectives, for a total of 1000 points. In keeping with the spirit of the game, getting them is no mean feat. As for the offline, we have those related to the challenges, winning the championship in the various levels or unlocking all the available bikes. Online it gets even tougher, from winning 10 Pink Slips, 50 or 100 victories in standard races. Good luck! Comment Moto GP 07 is a product not without contradictions. Behind the appearance and certain arcade solutions hides a very little permissive guide system, which requires great dedication on the part of the player. This does not mean that it is an exaggeratedly difficult title, but that it can be easily misunderstood by those who discover this saga only today. Once the controls have been assimilated, however, the satisfactions are certainly not lacking, and considering the contents both offline and online, long-distance entertainment is guaranteed. Too bad for the technical gaps, which once again reduce this production. However, Climax is running in the right direction, and next year could be an opportunity to become such a reference, even if a little more courage would be needed in proposing annual updates and related news. Pros: Very fast and galvanizing Lots to do Non-superficial driving system ... Cons: ... Even if a bit unsettling for newbies Opposing CPU to be improved Framerate still not optimal", "date": "2007-09-13", "grade": null}
