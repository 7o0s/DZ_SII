This porting does not offer particular novelties, the adventure is in fact faithfully reproduced in its strengths and weaknesses. From sidekick to secret agent The story is quite simple: at the beginning of the game we are in fact faced with an unprecedented criminal version of Ratchet, guilty of having stolen a precious jewel and consequently imprisoned. Clank for his part will have to find out who framed his friend, saving his reputation and bringing the real enemy to justice. The plot is clearly a pretext to connect the twenty stages that make up the game that we will have to face in the role of the funny robot, taking advantage of the canonical arsenal of imaginative weapons that distinguish the series and which prove to be fundamental for solving puzzles and proceeding in the game but also brand new melee attacks. In addition, Clank has various skills to be used by playing in ~stealth~, without being discovered by enemies, that is, which can be taken by surprise and easily defeated. In reality, Clank's stealth actions are totally optional, and the game can be ended by doing the bare minimum: Secret Agent Clank returns in a few minutes to being the usual cross between platformer and shooter, with the difference that the proposed levels tend to be too simple or repetitive quickly. To break the monotony there are some extra stages to play as Ratchet or the loudmouth Captain Quark: the latter are certainly the funniest in the game and honestly a spin-off dedicated to the nonsense told by Quark would have been even more welcome. From PSP to PS2 This port of Secret Agent Clank is rather perplexing since the code has practically deteriorated: the game maintains the same graphics seen on the PSP that on a television, however, proves to be bland and crude, in addition it is also plagued by frequent frame-rate drops that make the experience frustrating, especially in the more chaotic situations in which our heroes find themselves grappling with multiple opponents. In general, the visual rendering is discreet, remaining however on higher levels than L'Altezza Non Conta; on the other hand, the possibility of rotating the camera using the right stick is appreciated, an improvement which however has highlighted another problem and that is the shot too close to the back of our little robot which makes the vision of the environment rather limited. Even the audio sector has remained unchanged, the music is cheerful and pleasant, the Italian dubbing maintains the excellent standards of the home console episodes.", "date": "2009-07-20", "grade": "5.0"}
