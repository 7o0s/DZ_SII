{"name": "Xenoblade Chronicles 3: Un futuro riconquistato", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/xenoblade-chronicles-3-un-futuro-riconquistato-recensione.html", "text": "While the credits of Future Regained rolled, to the tune of the beautiful ~Future Awaits~ sung by Joanne Hogg - the same Joanne Hogg who sang ~Small Two of Pieces~ at the end of Xenogears twenty-five years ago, and rest assured that it is not one case - we felt old, tired and a little sad. The last DLC in the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Expansion Pass, A Future Regained is much more substantial content than the previous ones, just like Torna ~ The Golden Country was for Xenoblade Chronicles 2 a few years ago, and closes a story that began in 2010 with the first title of the successful Monolith Soft series, when perhaps director Tetsuya Takahashi had not yet thought of a success of this caliber. Our review of A Future Regained will contain some spoilers on the history of the previous games, because the new adventure strongly connects the whole trilogy and , in this sense, the decision to make it a paid content is also worth discussing: controversial but sensible. We will explain why in the following lines. The grand finale of the series? Matthew, A, Glimmer and Nikol are the new characters of A Future Regained A reclaimed future is a kind of big flashback: it tells the story of the Founders, the heroes who established the outpost called the City that the protagonists of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 discover during their adventure in the world of Aionios. If until recently we could only make educated guesses about their identities, based on the appearance of their statues and the clues offered in dialogues with the inhabitants of the City, A reconquered future uncovers the cards and explains who they were, how they met and how they paved the path that Noah and the others will follow many years later. It might seem that the story told in the DLC is indispensable for understanding Xenoblade Chronicles 3, but it is not quite so: although it clarifies quite explicitly some narrative junctions that had remained vague or open to free interpretation - including the ending itself - the DLC remains a parenthesis that last-minute players, not very interested in delving into the story, could easily skip. The speech becomes more complicated for those who, on the other hand, have tried to connect all the dots since it was discovered that the world of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 merged those of the two previous titles. In this sense, A Future Regained is a real love letter to all the players who have followed Tetsuya Takahashi's new saga over the years, starting from its first iteration on Wii or maybe even just from Xenoblade Chronicles 2 on Switch, then passing through the Definitive Edition of the first episode, of which we now finally understand some tiny changes. The DLC of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 represents more than anything else the epilogue of the trilogy, and it doesn't get lost in vagueness or insinuations but more often than not it answers in an almost didactic way to certain questions that we asked ourselves while walking around Aionios. And it almost always does so through the mouths of Shulk and Rex, the two protagonists of Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles 2, respectively, who accompany the new heroes in the adventure as playable members of the group. A future reclaimed begins with Shulk and Rex engaged in a decisive battle It goes without saying that for fans of the first two titles, replaying as Shulk and Rex - older, mature and bruised, but still formidable - will be wonderful, but Matthew and A also defend themselves well: the former, who in appearance and in the fighting style he recalls the Fei Fong Wong of Xenogears on several occasions, he is a captivating and less stereotyped protagonist than it might seem, for the canons of a Japanese RPG like this, while A is a charismatic swordswoman who acts as a perfect counterpart to the character aggressive and determined than Matthew. We must admit that we were a little less convinced by the other two characters who almost immediately join the gang, Nikol and Glimmer: they represent the factions of Keeves and Agnus respectively, thus establishing a contextual connection with the narrative of Xenoblade Chronicles 3, but if Glimmer sketches an initial characterization full of potential that remains unexpressed, Nikol is even more irrelevant. Some enemies in Future Regained are truly enormous The party, however, has a good alchemy and works well, thanks also to a good introspective work that Takahashi managed to carry on despite the limited duration of the campaign, which is around 15-20 hours, even if to see everything, unlocking every collectible and defeating every unique enemy could take at least 30 hours. The satisfactory duration of the DLC and theits quality would justify the purchase of the Expansion Pass, especially if we consider the other contents published in the months for the base game, including Heroes, additional missions and extra modes, but it must be admitted that offering the closure of such a beloved saga for a fee might seem a low blow against the players who have followed it passionately over the years, perhaps jumping from one platform to another. One might therefore think that A Future Regained is a notorious cut content, that is, a part of the base game which for reasons of time and budget Monolith Soft failed to complete and integrate into the main campaign of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and which it now sells separately, but the truth is that less demanding players, so to speak, will understand little or nothing of what happens in the DLC: the references to the two previous titles - and not only that, we would add - are so marked that they risk ruining the experience for those who have only approached the series with the second or third episode. In order not to alienate last-minute players, it made sense to offer this content separately. Reclaimed gameplay The combat system is similar to that of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 In terms of gameplay, A future reconquered works on the solid foundations laid by Xenoblade Chronicles 3 but, being a more contained RPG, it smooths out some aspects and thus ends up representing a smoother and more functional declination which, in the end, convinced us even more. The combat system works well or badly in the same way: we explained it to you in our review of Xenoblade Chronicles 3, but some considerations are worth making here. First, it's important to note that A Future Regained dispenses with the class system almost entirely, in the sense that each hero is defined by a characteristic role, but it is not possible to switch classes and learn the skills and Techniques of others. therefore it limits itself to the choice of accessories and gems, and also the Techniques are only six per hero: three learned from the beginning, and three to be unlocked which can be associated with the others through a variant of the fusion mechanic. Although more limited, the combat system is smooth and limited to the limited duration of the adventure. By filling the bestiary, you earn chemistry points For narrative needs, in fact, the transformations in Uroboros are missing - which manifest themselves for a moment when a fusion technique is used - with everything that revolved around it, but Monolith Soft has worked across the board on other aspects of the combat system to ensure a good variety and a minimum of customization. The Combo Merge, for example, involve two characters in a spectacular attack, but it is possible to choose the heroes involved to modify the final effect of the Combo Merge and the related bonuses, which is particularly useful at the end of the Enfeement > Knockdown > Throw sequence. In group assaults, on the other hand, the union orders replace the Uroboros Orders, closing the heroic chains with the union combos defined in the appropriate screen: considering that it is possible to enhance these attacks and customize the intervention of individual characters in group assaults by equipping specific accessories called Manuals, it is clear that the gameplay has not been properly depleted and it is indeed possible to play with these combinations to build truly unstoppable strategies, especially in the advanced stages of the game. Screenshot of Rex's Intense Growth in A Future Regained The progression of the characters then goes hand in hand with the exploration of this glimpse of Aionios: made up of five interconnected regions - there are no loads to separate them, unless you use the fast travel - the map of A Future Regained hides an exorbitant amount of more or less hidden collectibles and objectives. It's not the same map as the third game, but a portion of Aionios that we explored last year, characterized by locations and landscapes inspired by the other two Xenoblade Chronicles, and especially the first: in short, fans will find in exploration what which we could easily define as a concrete and sensible fanservice, considering the context. By visiting places, opening chests, defeating common and unique enemies, completing side missions and so on, we accumulate Agreement Points, which we can then spend on the screen of Understanding Growth to unlock new skills, Techniques and passives with which to improve the performance of the six heroes in battle. Unlike Torna ~ The Golden Country, we won't be forced to complete side missions to progresshistory, and the so-called Understanding Objectives - which include the Prestige with the inhabitants of Colony 9 - are schematized in a special screen that allows you to trace them and understand what we still have to discover in each individual region: Reader X, which can be improved by spending the materials collected in around, and field-buildable antennas help triangulate the location of nearby collectibles more easily, so you're never left on a frustrating and rambling search. This super boss only appears on rainy days It is a subtle interlocking game, a kind of level design matryoshka that works beautifully, also by virtue of the nature of the progression, close to that of the ~metroidvania~: the discovery of new movement systems, such as slides and elevators of 'ether, induces us to return to the areas already explored in search of those passages that seemed impassable until a few hours before, and which we can now travel to reach new collectibles and objectives. It's an intelligent system, which promotes not only exploration, but also combat - defeating enemies completes a bestiary that rewards chemistry points - and every other game dynamic, including the customization of the characters themselves: additional spaces for accessories , gems and Techniques are unlocked by finding special kits, well hidden in the scenario or kept inside chests or particularly powerful unique enemies. Each character has a different fighting style In retrospect, Future Regained makes the base game seem downright overloaded with content, and proves that in the end, balanced and cleverly interlaced gameplay with contained progression works better than a plethora of variables and features. Furthermore, lovers of demanding challenges will find new features and some really tough super bosses waiting for them once the campaign is completed and the final save is reloaded. Ultimately, A Future Regained is an impeccable DLC that we have gutted without even realizing it: we started it with the aim of closing only the main storyline without wasting time with the secondary ones, and we ended up completing almost all the objectives without even realizing it I count. Longtime fans of the series may be disappointed that they have to pay extra to get the full story, but Future Regained is truly worth every penny in the Expansion Pass, and it's safe to say that this era of Monolith Soft has come to an end on a high note. style.", "date": "2023-05-04", "grade": null}
