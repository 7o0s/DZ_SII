{"name": "Simon 3D", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/simon-3d.html", "text": "Simon's saga continues, for better or for worse... Only the more mature adventurers will remember the two previous episodes of the series, which at the time were quite successful, drawing inspiration from the fantasy world and the popular Lucas adventures: Simon is an ordinary teenager; one day, crossing a dimensional portal, he suddenly finds himself thrown into a magical and bizarre world, in which he must face the evil wizard Sordid, who aims at nothing less than the conquest of the universe. In the first episode, our improvised wizard miraculously manages to defeat and kill Sordid, who in revenge takes possession of the boy's body in the second chapter of the adventure. Simon the Sorcerer 3D starts right here and sees Simon committed to recovering his body and foiling Sordid's diabolical plans once again, with the help of his mentor Calypso and a very ramshackle group of ~heroes~. The strong point of the series has always been the sharp and often demented humor and this last episode is certainly no exception: right from the hilarious Star Wars-style introductory scene, one senses that irony and satire will be the masters for whole adventure, with fun dialogue options and a stable of absolutely hilarious and very well characterized characters, such as the bad guy and his toadies, the fussy and touchy fairy godmother who flutters around the protagonist and wears platform sneakers, the gay prince and the staunch feminist warrior. The sad notes... The game is divided into six chapters and is one of the longest adventures I've ever played; perhaps its structure is more reminiscent of an RPG than an adventure: each chapter has a main mission and various secondary objectives to be achieved in order to complete it. It takes place in four primary settings, quite vast and varied: a kind of Mayan temple, countryside and forests, a village, a swamp and finally the bad guy's fortress. Adventure Soft had promised a non-linear plot and alternative endings, as well as hidden settings and characters, but in reality all the puzzles must be solved in a certain sequence and the player's choices affect the course of events only in one case, completely irrelevant for the outcome of the game. If we exclude the more obvious puzzles and some original ideas, many of the puzzles are virtually impossible to solve and too laborious: sometimes the player is expected to interact with elements that are not even highlighted as active on the screen or analyzed by Simon; it also happens to perform the right operation to solve a puzzle, but to have to repeat it a dozen times before succeeding and often one does not even realize that one has been overcome until one understands the actual consequences for the next one. The sad notes... If we add to this the fact that half of the puzzles do not require the use of logic but rather quick reflexes and an infinity of nerve-racking attempts, the immoderate immensity of some settings, which are poor in interesting elements and in which for hours without having the slightest idea of where to go and what to do, and the movement difficulties created by the interface and visuals that are anything but practical, we easily come to the conclusion that even the most patient and methodical of players would get tired of this adventure in a frighteningly short time! This is a real shame, because the best comes in the latter stages of the game, but I fear that very few would have the consistency and the ability to get there. The interface is outrageous and only surpassed in ugliness by the graphics: this being a three-dimensional adventure, Simon enjoys virtually 360-degree freedom of movement but it is completely wasted, since the poor management of the polygons and the prohibitive shots make both the orientation and the identification of the useful elements on the screen are difficult. The developer had promised dizzying effects, thanks to the use of the NDL NetImmerse 3D graphics engine, and all in all the light and shadow effects are not bad, but such a technical realization could hardly meet the expectations of the average adventurer in 2002! This stylized and ~cubed~ graphic cannot even be attributed to a bold artistic choice or one oriented towards a childish audience, if one compares it to a title such as Grim Fandango, which truly boasts an original aesthetic cut, much less attributed to the times: just think of the level of detail and immersionand another three-dimensional adventure created at the end of 1999, Gabriel Knight 3. The commands are all given via keyboard and are somewhat imprecise, not to mention the fact that they do not correspond exactly to the default ones described in the manual and in the initial tutorial: the our character inevitably bumps into any obstacle in his path and each examination of the surrounding environment or combination of objects must be repeated at least twice before obtaining any results. The animations of the characters are also bad: the movements appear unnatural, the facial expressions and the lip are aberrant and nowhere near synchronized with the dialogues. However, the English speech, music and sound effects aren't bad. The dialogues are subtitled in Italian and the localization quality is quite good. How much wasted potential! It goes without saying that the balance of this review is negative overall: playing Simon the Sorcerer 3D, I experienced mixed sensations, discomfort, frustration and even boredom at times, even if I could not help but appreciate the hilarious dialogues and some ingenious gimmicks. such as the curtains between one chapter and another, which evoke the posters of famous films such as Indiana Jones or Forrest Gump, the telephone booths for teleportation or the maps of the intricate game areas with absurd entries such as ~Senseless bridge~ and ~Absolutely safe rope through deadly ravine.~ The final puzzle deserves a special mention (assuming that someone gets there), delusional and unimaginable, but undoubtedly original. In my opinion, the dialogue writers and authors have done a great job, but on a graphic and technical level I find this game absolutely unthinkable. As if that weren't enough, it's plagued by gross bugs, ranging from simple distortions of the program's blocky graphics that throw you right on your Windows desktop. A patch has already been provided, but it is unacceptable that two years after development, a title of this type is marketed without adequate testing! In short, to appreciate Simon 3D, an adventurer should be on the hunt for an unusual and extravagant gaming experience, even if not necessarily involving, and should be able to give absolute precedence to irony, without attributing too much weight to the graphics and game mechanics. twisted game. Simon's saga continues, for better or for worse... The first thing I thought of, seeing the old Simon the Sorcerer reappear after a long time (the second chapter of the series, if I'm not mistaken, was released in 1995), was: ~Here, yet another title that tries to ride the Harry Potter wave of success! For the occasion, they also went to exhume Simon!. However, I was wrong: I discovered to my surprise that this title was completed at the end of 1999 and that, for various reasons, developer Adventure Soft was unable to find a publisher for the game until this year. It is a premise that I considered necessary, before expressing my opinion on the adventure in question, since video games are not at all like good wine and it takes very little time for many of them to age, becoming unbearably obsolete. Ironically, innovation was one of the main objectives that the authors of this third chapter of the Simon saga had set themselves, deciding to introduce a radical change of formula and switch to 3D graphics, in the hope of making the title also attractive to lovers of action games like Mario64 or Tomb Raider. The idea of the developers was to make Simon 3D a revolutionary and one of a kind gaming experience and, in a certain sense, it must be admitted that they have succeeded! In fact, it's a difficult title to place, both in terms of genre and audience: it's an atypical adventure, which features action elements (Simon can walk and run at variable speeds, jump, crouch, crawl, die accidentally). and skill and cunning puzzles (often integrated into minigames), as well as traditional logic puzzles; at first glance, it would seem a title aimed at children, above all due to the graphics and the story, but some spicy jokes, the widespread self-irony and the characterization of the characters make it perhaps not very suitable for a very young audience.", "date": "2002-07-03", "grade": null}
