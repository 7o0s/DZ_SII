A devastating emotional impact has allowed this game to remain marked for life in the soul of anyone who has had the opportunity to fully enjoy it, provided they have a well-disposed mentality towards the important philosophical-existential issues it deals with. . The sequel Finding Paradise was no less four years ago, to all intents and purposes a confirmation of the narrative talent of Kan Gao, from this point of view one of the most interesting figures within the entire videogame panorama. In fact, there are few who can boast the same ability to address such profound topics, placing moving twists without however excessively sinking the blow, managing to emotionally overwhelm the fans of the series also through the ability to play down at the right time. Two touching works, capable of making tears flow even from the driest of hearts. With these premises, it was therefore legitimate to anxiously await the closure of the trilogy, which has finally arrived on our screens for a few days. The Impostor Factory review arrives, in fact, when the game is already available on Steam, promising its players new rivers of tears expertly alternating with moments of genuine comedy. Want to know if Impostor Factory can keep up with its two predecessors? Read on! The plot: laughter and tears Impostor Factory: the mansion where much of the story takes place. Those who have played To The Moon and Finding Paradise surely already know what to expect from Impostor Factory. The third adventure by Freebird Games does not deny expectations from this point of view, once again making the narrative component its dominant aspect. Indeed, compared to the previous two chapters, Impostor Factory completely abandons any dynamics that can be compared to a gameplay concept, focusing everything on the plot without losing pace. Elements such as the small puzzles encountered previously or the need to collect elements with which to continue the story are therefore definitively set aside. The player's interaction is in fact limited to moving the protagonist of the story through the various places where it takes place, using the mouse or the arrow keys for this purpose. Once again our dear little mouse turns out to be the best choice, thanks to a greater precision in the management of the movements of our character. Having made the due premise, intended above all for those who do not know the other titles developed by Freebird Games, at this point we come to the story . Naturally we will try to limit the elements provided to a minimum, so as not to spoil the pleasure of discovering the main component of the Impostor Factory firsthand. The game is divided into three acts, for a total duration of around three and a half hours. Those who expected the return of Neil Watts and Eva Rosalene of Sigmund Corp. will instead find Quincy waiting for him, a hitherto unknown protagonist whom we meet at the entrance of a villa, where a party to which he has been invited is scheduled. Going around the rooms of the luxurious residence, Quincy gets to know the other guests of the hosts, but it is above all the mysterious Lynri who strikes and attracts him. While trying to get to know the girl better, Quincy finds himself catapulted into a horror movie when he discovers that the hosts, doctors Haynes and Yu, have been murdered. Between time travel and the usual inevitable flow of memories, the story of the Impostor Factory begins from this moment, set up in a similar way to that of its two predecessors especially in its central phase. It is in fact in this part that topics of particular weight are dealt with, such as our presence in the lives of others and the possibility of leaving our mark in them even when we are aware that our time may be more limited than expected. Without pulling the punches in the stomach dropped by To The Moon and Finding Paradise, Impostor Factory brings with it moments where a few tears come out easily, alternating as in the past with others of pleasant comedy linked above all to a particular cat and a rice cooker robot, companions of Quincy Adventure for part of the story. However, compared to the previous two chapters, Impostor Factory is less convincing especially in the final part. In the latter, the plot ends up a bit tangled, while remaining understandable, making the player lose part of the empathic charge accumulated up to that point.caul. However, there is no lack of some interesting revelations on the leitmotif of the series, which also makes this passage unmissable for its fans orphaned by the Watts-Rosalene couple. The story so far The Impostor Factory Steam page says that this title can be played even without having first completed To The Moon and Finding Paradise, which we strongly advise against doing. In order to be fully enjoyed, this third chapter must in fact be played after the first two, to whose history we also dedicated an in-depth study some time ago. In case you want to refresh it, we offer it again, while if you are completely fasting from the adventures created by Kan Gao we also bring you the review of To The Moon and the review of Finding Paradise just a click away. Graphics and sound The fascinating atmosphere of Impostor Factory Having ascertained that the gameplay of Impostor Factory is practically zeroed, we just have to talk about the artistic aspects of this game: graphics and sound. As well as the other two episodes, Impostor Factory was made with the use of RPG Maker and the stylistic choice to represent all the scenes as those of the classic RPGs of the 16-bit era. Also from this point of view the ability of Kan Gao and Freebird Games is now known, so we are no longer really surprised in appreciating parts of the game that are real moving pictures, accompanied by well-crafted cutscenes. always made and placed at the right time. The same goes for the soundtrack, as usual extremely quoted and able to contribute significantly to the emotional impact of some scenes. Perhaps those who expected the usual song with Laura Shigihara's voice, strangely absent, will be a little disappointed. However, there is a way to console yourself with the translation of all the dialogues in Italian, available since launch.", "date": "2021-10-07", "grade": "8.0"}
