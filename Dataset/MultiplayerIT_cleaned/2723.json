Before then, however, it might be a good idea to (re)discover the very first chapter: Remnant: From the Ashes, now available in the Nintendo Switch version. Fans of the Kyoto house console had to wait a while before finally being able to play the soulslike-influenced third-person shooter, but the game has finally arrived. Was the end result worth the wait? Find out in our review of Remnant: From the Ashes. 2019 The starting area, which serves as a tutorial in Remnant: From the Ashes Let's first do a quick review for anyone who has never heard of Remnant: From the Ashes. As mentioned, this is a third-person shooter combat game, influenced by soulslikes. This means that we will have a series of labyrinths to face with lots of bosses, save/teleport points that recharge our life and our fundamental resources, however making enemies also reappear and we will have equipment and statistics to upgrade to stay level with the opponents. A feature of Remnant: From the Ashes is the (partially) procedural generation of the game world. Certain sections are fixed, while some areas and enemies will be randomly placed, also ensuring a little more variety in case you want to play multiple times with different classes. As we told you in the review for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, it's a challenging game, perhaps a little too much at times (there are still difficulty levels), but a lot of fun. The Switch conversion of Remnant: From the Ashes One of the enemies in the game: you will rarely see them up close in Remnant: From the Ashes The gameplay has obviously not changed from one version of the game to another. What has necessarily had to undergo a downsizing is the technical sector. The original Remnant: From the Ashes, in the console version, is certainly not the most technically advanced video game: it is an honest medium budget, which does what it can to be as visually pleasing as possible. On Switch, however, multiple sacrifices were necessary. Obviously the resolution on the screen is lower, but the textures are especially affected, which lose enormously in quality. In various situations many details have been lost and it is very easy to find elements that look like splashes of color rather than walls or floors. However, what really has an impact is the total elimination of shadows and many light effects: in some cases the latter have been replaced with an upload of an extra low-resolution texture that colors the environment to imitate lighting. However, some intermittent lights become fixed lights, others disappear completely, other textures of the fake light are loaded only if we are in a certain position and disappear in another. Overall, the game is much more ~flat~. Obviously many particle effects also disappear and the few necessary ones that remain are simpler. Even the models of characters and enemies are much less detailed, both in textures and in the polygonal count. The Switch version also suffers a hit in uploads: if with the PS4 version running on PS5 it takes about 16 seconds for a specific upload, on the Nintendo console it reaches 34 seconds. Loading moves are frequent in Remnant: From the Ashes, so these slowdowns will have an effect on the total time at the end of the game. Finally, in terms of frame rates, the game tries to maintain 30 FPS even if it doesn't make it in every single situation. However, the drops are rare and not too impactful, so from this point of view we are all in all satisfied. Play on the go Remnant: From the Ashes is chromatically diverse It's clear that Remnant: From the Ashes looks its best visually on PC and closely follows PlayStation and Xbox, with Switch obviously coming in last place. It is not a surprise and for a certain part of the public the Switch version is interesting for the possibility of playing on the go. While knowing that in part it depends on the taste and the actual ways of moving and the timing of the individual player, in general we believe that Remnant: From the Ashes is not a game particularly suited to mobility. Even if in an alternative way, it remains a sort of soulslike in which you must always pay close attention, you must not lose sight of the screen for a second and also take advantage of the sound to understand if a monster is coming behind us.Appeared out of nowhere (yes, it can happen). The pause is not contemplated, but you can return to the Switch Home to freeze your game even in the middle of the fight, fortunately. If it moves, shoot - that's the only rule in Remnant: From the Ashes That said, considering the loss of detail and the depletion of light / shadows, playing in portable mode is sometimes a bit difficult to distinguish enemies in the distance (the fact that the environment and opponents are often of similar colors doesn't help). Several times we found ourselves sticking our faces to the console to make sure we didn't miss a move. At least when playing on the Switch screen and not on the TV the lower resolution has less impact on the overall experience. We know we have been quite critical up to this point and we want to repeat the point. The Nintendo Switch version of Remannt: From the Ashes is certainly the worst of those available and if you have other platforms you should prefer those, but in any case the conversion work is adequate to the possibilities of the console and the overall gaming experience remains enjoyable today as in 2019, especially in multiplayer (available both online and locally with multiple consoles connected to each other).", "date": "2023-04-04", "grade": "7.0"}
