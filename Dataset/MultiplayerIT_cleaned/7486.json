We mean a guy capable, within the two minutes of initial presentation, of presenting himself with his enormous physique in the middle of an archaeological excavation in the company of his scientist girlfriend, defending the kind damsel from the rough manners of an unscrupulous tycoon like a true knight, taking an archaic scythe in full chest and awaken shortly after as the reincarnation of a pre-Columbian deity, endowed with special powers and herculean strength. All without too many explanations or attempts at moderation of tones, indeed with a linear, dry and hasty narration that amazes the player who is now addicted to the infinite preambles and Hollywood cutscenes, attempts by the videogame industry to run after other media. Since the triple A videogame has begun to take itself more and more seriously and the productions have become gigantic, we have found ourselves faced with increasingly set titles, careful not to fall into the hyperbole that was typical of action until a little long ago, in an attempt to follow the cinema and give a semblance of credibility and coherence to stories that often don't need it much. Seen from this point of view, it makes one want to love Marlow Briggs and his extraordinary power unleashed on the screen without too much attention to the developments of the plot, without taking itself too seriously but without even wanting to be parodic, a genuinely exaggerated action game and with little time to the explanations. Our hero is a large and beefy firefighter who therefore finds himself, in some way, tied to an ancient Mayan ~death mask~ which transforms him into a sort of warrior deity endowed with magical powers and a weapon transformable by force devastating, intent on saving his girlfriend and destroying a sort of unscrupulous mega-corporation that is threatening the forests of Central America in search of mysterious artifacts with enormous special powers. In all this, there is also room for a continuous exchange of jokes between the protagonist in the Death Mask, a rather talkative and light-hearted guy who, after two thousand years of silence, finally has someone to pour his sarcastic humor on. If you're looking for some well-rounded, no-nonsense classic action, Marlow Briggs is for you I know you mask The positive genuineness demonstrated by Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death in its simply being a no-frills action game is unfortunately not supported by an equally genuine design in terms of gameplay structure. Talking about derivative elements, for this Zootfly product, is almost an understatement: the game plunders the playful features of other titles of the genre like God of War or Devil May Cry and proposes them again with a general reskin given by a completely different and a decidedly more light-hearted spirit but without essentially proposing anything new. The configuration of the weapons, the organization of the combos, the system of points divided into energy, mana and experience useful for the evolution of the equipment and the general organization of the level design are all set on what was previously seen in the aforementioned titles, apart from some diversions inserted within the levels to vary the action with particular events. The dj vu is continuous and evident on the fast-paced roller coaster of experiences that represents Marlow Briggs' journey to justice (approximately 6-7 hours to complete), but it's also a ride that can't fail to be enjoyable. It is basically a matter of crossing various levels characterized by different environments ranging from industrial scenarios to lush jungles, up to caves and ancient pre-Columbian cities, eliminating all the enemies who attack us in waves, interspersed with platform-style sections or with elementary puzzles to solve (pull the lever, move the scenery element, activate the hidden switch and stuff like that). The combat is obviously the fulcrum of the action and the moment in which the gaming experience reaches its apex, but the general rhythm is well balanced thanks to the variation of the events, although the level design never reaches particularly complex solutions and less less innovative. The frantic pressing of the keys practically does not require any strategic approach (except, at the limit, the decision on which magic to use and at what moment) but the combos are ringed with naturalness and undoubted pleasure, while the interlude phases are able to avoid monotony. Xbox 360 goals The game contains 29 achievements for a total of 400 points to collect.Most of these are organized in the classic style of linear setting games, spread regularly throughout the journey and positioned in conjunction with some special moment, such as the killing of a boss and the progression between levels. Some still require some particular performance in terms of combat and exploration but in general it will not be difficult to obtain the complete collection. Pre-Columbian handicrafts The production of the game is set on a limited budget and the game can be downloaded for just over 14 euros, characteristics that must be kept in mind in the technical evaluation of the game, but also in an overall balance of what Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death has to offer offer. We cannot expect the maximum expression of graphics technology, nor the results obtainable with a full-fledged development of huge teams and financed with large amounts of money. In any case, as far as the aesthetic aspect is concerned, the title does not have much to be reproached for, beyond the already addressed lack of originality and an evident recycling of materials in the construction of scenarios and game situations. The levels flow away fast and functional, without denying the player even some very pleasant glimpses where the scenarios open up towards wider horizons. Some uncertainty, sometimes even decisive, instead comes from the framing system adopted by the developers who, instead of allowing direct control of the camera, or a recall system, have opted for a pre-established framing with variable angle and distance depending on the context. These settings, in some cases, tend not to adequately show what surrounds the protagonist and the impossibility of remedying the problem (the right stick is reserved for a - however convenient - dodging system) is decidedly annoying. In the platform phases this defect takes on more consistency, also due to a not very reactive jump control system, but these are scattered moments that hardly lead to frustration. The solution adopted by Zootfly for various interlude scenes within the levels is also rather bizarre: instead of opting for the classic cutscenes, some topical moments are simply illustrated with fixed scenes built with the stop motion-style game engine, whose scenic effect is not bad but which only increase the feeling of lack of narrative, partially compensated by the presence of audio recordings scattered throughout the levels containing the testimonies of Marlow's girlfriend, a somewhat clumsy solution to try to keep together the threads of the plot.", "date": "2013-11-14", "grade": "6.8"}
