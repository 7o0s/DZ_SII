Heck, it's not even a jRPG. Considering the much talked about loss of identity of the famous Square Enix franchise in recent years, the coldness with which we welcomed the announcement of a rhythm game with an unpronounceable title is understandable. I mean, here people are waiting for Final Fantasy XV or the elusive Versus XIII and they come up with a music game? However, those who know the most recent exploits of the series, starting with the fighting game Dissidia, know that they should not be taken lightly. So we began to follow the evolution of this slightly indie project with more interest, also because, mind you, a compilation of the best music from the saga is damned tempting. After all, there is little to discuss about the quality of the Final Fantasy soundtracks. And a rhythm game supported by good gameplay and excellent music could be a pleasant diversion under the umbrella in this crazy hot summer. Summing up, do we have a good product in front of us? Oh yes. Life is a musical Well understood, even if you live on bread and Phoenix Down and consider Final Fantasy VII the most beautiful game ever created, Theatrhythm Final Fantasy will not change your mind about the rhythm game genre. There isn't even a real plot to keep the whole shack up, or rather there is but it's bordering on the ridiculous: in the space between Chaos and Cosmos, the two deities already encountered in the Dissidia series, there is the musical harmony of an enchanted crystal or some nonsensical thing like that; the forces of evil are corrupting it and therefore it's up to a handful of heroes, borrowed from thirteen different Final Fantasy, to put things right, regenerating the crystal in question thanks to the ~rhythmia~, or the score obtained by completing the various musical challenges of the game. The story is limited to an initial cutscene and a final made up of practically four lines of text and that's it. But that's the aspect that will interest you the least because everything else is pure fun. The first thing to do is create a party of four characters: you can choose from the main protagonists of the thirteen Final Fantasy, from Firion to Lightning, passing through Cloud and Tidus. At that point you can try your hand at the real challenges, which are basically of three types: in the Field Music Stage the party will walk through a scenario inspired by the games in the series; in the Event Music Stage you will play with a composition of movies in the background that is very YouTube fanmade AMV: this type of challenge convinced us less and, fortunately, it is the least frequent; finally, in the Battle Music Stage your party will face one enemy at a time in pure Final Fantasy style, the heroes on the right and the enemies on the left. The basic mechanics are common to all three types of challenges: colored icons will move quickly from left to right and at the right moment you will have to act with the stylus on the lower screen based on the type of icon. The red ones are the simplest: just a tap when they cross the appropriate ~viewfinder~ and you're done. For the yellow ones you will have to slide the nib in the direction of the drawn arrow; while for the green ones connected by a line you will have to keep the stylus pressed on the screen, moving it to follow the inclination of the line. The game will evaluate the timing of your reactions and the corresponding jingles will follow the rhythm of the melody; needless to say for each piece of music there are multiple levels of difficulty that require more and more precision, speed and ear to be overcome. At the end of an internship you will receive a grade and ~rhythmia~ points based on your performance. Is everything clear so far? Good, because now things get a little complicated. The 3D effect In a word? Totally useless. It is clear that the stereoscopic effect exists only for a commercial reason since, on balance, it does not involve any improvement. Indeed, the botched depth can even be detrimental, especially during EMS challenges. Once more, with feeling Ten thousand rhythmia points are enough to complete the game but every five hundred points, up to a good forty-five thousand, you will receive a prize: new songs to play or listen to, videos to watch again at any time, additional options to customize your Street Pass card and so on. Therefore, once you have completed the first round of three songs on the standard difficulty level for each chapter of Final Fantasy, you will find yourself facing each stage again and again to accumulate more and more rhythmia points and unlock a little bit of everything. The point is, of course, the game gets harder and harder, the songs more twisted and frenetic. For this purpose, the specific abilities of the various pers come to your aidcharacters, which level up by accumulating experience points as in any jRPG. Each hero has numerous skills but you can never equip them all, so you will have to choose carefully among the unlocked ones: some increase the damage inflicted to enemies in BMS stages, others increase movement speed in FMS ones, still others improve the probability of finding items rare to equip in number of one at a time to receive an additional bonus during the game. In reality these pseudo jRPG solutions are not particularly influential and a fair amount of skill is enough to pass each stage, however they come in handy to get the better of some situations: for example, when facing a boss in a BMS stage you will want to be able to defeat him before he finish the song, so you can get a better reward. This occurs in the Chaos Shrine mode, in which you can play particularly difficult challenges in order, above all, to unlock yet more and earn colored crystals which, collected in eight numbers, add a new character to the cast of heroes. Basically there are two characters for Final Fantasy (except for Final Fantasy VII which instead offers three) and each of them can increase up to the ninety-ninth level through stages in Chaos Shrine or Challenge mode. The latter allows you to play all the songs unlocked in the game in any order and at any difficulty level, including some extras that must be discovered or purchased in the eShop for 1 euro each. From this point of view, Theatrhythm Final Fantasy is just a jRPG with lots of grinding; in fact, we find ourselves playing and replaying the various songs to unlock everything, from characters to mini trophies, from additional songs to collector cards. All framed, however, by an absolutely adorable graphic style as essential, colorful and inspired. As you may have noticed we have not mentioned the soundtrack, after all there is no need: the crystalline quality of the songs is truly indisputable and the choice made by the developer seemed more than satisfactory, albeit with some reservations.", "date": "2012-07-17", "grade": "8.5"}
