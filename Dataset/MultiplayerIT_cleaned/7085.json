{"name": "La mostruosit della vita", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/132615-always-sometimes-monsters-la-mostruosita-della-vita.html", "text": "Always Sometimes Monsters is an alien title compared to the canons we are used to. We can actually place it in a precise vein which is that of realistic video games, where realism is not to be found in the cosmetic elements, but in the quality of the interactions. For various reasons, first of all the difficulty of selling them, works of this kind rarely come to the attention of the general public. Yet the search for a video game model with which to tell everyday life in its paradoxicality and, often, in its monstrosity, is a more felt and widespread need than it seems. Just think of titles like The Stanley Parable, To The Moon, Actual Sunlight or Dinner Date to realize this. However, unlike other video games, Always Sometimes Monsters does not address the theme indicated by throwing it on the metaphorical or the surreal, but takes it head on, so to speak, trying to bring out the contradictions explicitly and at the same time reflecting on the nature of the choices, real or virtual as they are. What emerges is a crude and uncompromising representation, which disintegrates any form of epicity or attempt to escape. It almost seems that the development team wants to affirm that what we decide to do in videogame fiction arises from who we are and that justifying our actions precisely on the basis of having done them in a virtual world is only a self-absolving alibi, behind which we hide our nature and what is basically the human condition. The entire development of the game is a slow crescendo that leads up to the reconnection of the ending with the introduction, the moment in which everything we have done finds its outlet and its meaning in the story, as if the narrator had to fix the pieces of something that he struggles to understand and tries to reconstruct before carrying out an extreme act with no return. Always Sometimes Monsters is destined to become a cult product, remembered for its content The winning choices But what game is Always Sometimes Monsters? As you will have understood by looking at the images, this is not a large production. Indeed, let's say that it is a rather poor title, right from the development tool chosen for its creation, that RPG Maker so widespread in the independent scene. So we have a minimal pixel art graphic style that recalls the classic jRPGs, but from which it clearly stands out in terms of content. The tool also influences the game system, based on exploration and direct and unique interaction with the various objects in the scenario. What might appear to most to be limitations, instead represent an advantage for a similar title. Not having to worry too much about animations and various graphic assets has allowed Vagabond Dog, the developer, to focus on the storytelling, allowing him to put everything he wants into the game and create a great variety of situations, which shape a fluid and unique story . Furthermore, the graphic poverty is well linked with the underlying theme of Always Sometimes Monsters, which requires a different participation than those titles that aim to deceive the player to transport him to another world. In short, paradoxically thinking about textures and the like risked distracting from what is the playful essence of a title that is in any case ambitious, which does not hide its diversity but, on the contrary, makes it a strength. Diversity that also manifests itself in radical choices from the point of view of gameplay, supported by mini-games. Now, minigames are usually used by developers to create variety and to give the player something to do while stretching the stock a bit. In Always Sometimes Monsters, on the other hand, they are used differently and fit more naturally into the big picture. It will sound strange and incredible, maybe even inconceivable, but they are meant to bore you. The banality of evil To understand the conclusion of the previous paragraph you must try to fully understand what the objective of the game is. Imagine being a person on the verge of personal bankruptcy, for various reasons that we don't anticipate so as not to spoil the plot, and having to look for a way to recover. Imagine that at some point a traumatic event creates an inescapable urgency and an urgent need for money. What would you do? Would you remain anchored to your moral values, or would you compromise with yourself? What if the first way is the most difficult, seemingly dead-end despite the many sacrifices you are willing to make? What if the possibility of shortening the agony, quickly obtaining what would otherwise cost you much greater effort, presented itself all the time? In a framework of similar questions, the mini-games, usually linked to small jobs that can be performed to make ends meet and accemulate money legally, end up representing the protagonist's sense of fatigue and want to be anything but funny. On the contrary, the more boring they are, the more the player feels motivated to avoid them, the more the representation takes on strength in its perennial ambiguity and in the ease with which it allows you to get out of the way in search of quick and easy ways to reach the final goal. Some may complain that many choices have no tangible effect on the narrative, that is, have no visible consequences. But, after all, isn't that the case in reality too? How many times do the concepts of right and wrong get confused and are tested by events? Isn't life also having to live with one's mistakes without them having other tangible effects than continuing to exist and proliferate within ourselves, consciously or unconsciously? And aren't the actions we take often a way to combat the guilt for past mistakes, which we try to erase by drowning them in other mistakes, so as to give it a perverse frame of normality?", "date": "2014-06-02", "grade": "8.9"}
