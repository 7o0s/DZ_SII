The archaic directional arrows are sufficient as controls, even if a joypad with analog sticks could come in handy. The tracks are faithfully adapted to the philosophy of the game and are in turn unthinkable: loops of death, dizzying ramps and gravitational accelerators are the order of the day and will leave the novice user speechless. What distinguishes United from its predecessors? On a technical level, practically nothing: of course, a little variety and some special effects have been added to justify the euros necessary for the purchase, but little else. However, the French software house has ventured into the implementation of a robust net-code capable of managing the many enthusiasts (especially transalpines, to be honest) who have devoted themselves to the cause of TrackMania. The multiplayer vocation emerges from the first launch, when it is necessary to create an account which (if connected to the internet) is registered on the Nadeo servers. The solo mode is not very satisfactory: being able to challenge only a maximum of three opponents at a time (who are in reality more of the reference points than of the real antagonists), the only goal is to improve one's own lap records , to then upload it and appear in the official rankings. This operation, as well as others (such as the purchase of parts or even entire circuits created by other players) involves an expense of copper, the TrackMania currency. Arcade or management? The operating principle of the game economy is interesting and encourages users to put their hand to the game's internal editor: in fact, if their creation is downloaded by other people, coins will accumulate. Another method is to bet them in on-track challenges with your opponents. There is also a second driving mode, defined as a platform, by selecting which you are placed on tracks suspended in the void and above all non-adjacent: in order to reach the finish line, you must literally jump from one platform to another, avoiding the pitfalls that evil programmers have inserted at every meter. Undoubtedly original, this type of challenge may not particularly excite, especially due to the difficulty of interpreting the tracks. Conclusions The impression that one may have initially is that the guys from Nadeo, after squeezing every drop from the frenetic gameplay of the series, are left with few arrows to their bow and have therefore launched themselves into certainly more commercial and perhaps less inspired productions. At the same time, behind it, the Nations edition always remains vigilant, available on the net for free and which acts as a counterpart to the new United which must somehow justify the expense it requires... and it succeeds, not only because it is sold at a very attractive budget price but because, especially if you loved the previous TrackMania titles, once you start the game, you will no longer be able to help but form a full-time online community together with hundreds of other players ready to challenge you on tracks at the limit of 'incredible. And this crucial multiplayer aspect, even if it were alone, is worth buying United. Pros Interesting economic management Good frame rate and latency times Immediate Cons Repetitiveness Lack of collision management Online community still immature As usual, Nadeo preferred not to introduce any physical engine - and this means that even in United the opponents are ghosts - to devote all the power of the processor and video card to the graphics and in particular to the frame rate, which, in games of the kind, is the fundamental aspect. The goal was achieved with flying colors, so as to allow owners of mid-range systems to be able to travel at 500 km/h without worrying about it; among other things, in this way the annoyances caused by connection delays are also largely circumvented. The downside is obviously that it would have been much more fun, as in Micromachines, to try to bring home the result by eliminating the opponents by fury - playability is therefore partially limited. The players, at presentthey are not very numerous but constantly growing. Most of them declare themselves French (and no wonder), and tended to always count at least 200 people online. The latency times are acceptable, while it is necessary to pay attention to which lobby to join since some funny guys from Paris have created tracks whose primary purpose is to try to reach the finish line, regardless of the crazy blind streets placed everywhere - for those who end up in these Dantesque circles the fun runs out (together with the nerves) in a short time. The TrackMania family expands with the newcomer United, with which Nadeo's programmers try to revitalize a graphics engine still capable of giving highly spectacular moments with the liveliness that only flesh-and-blood antagonists can put on the plate. For those who don't know what we are talking about, it is enough to remember that the TrackMania saga (whose sequels were in order, Sunrise, Original, Sunrise eXtreme and Nations) is the quintessence of arcade driving games: veterans will immediately connect to the legendary Stunt Car Racer by Geoff Crammond or to Stunts by DSI (both released on the threshold of 1990), but also to the more recent POD and Rollcage.", "date": "2007-02-27", "grade": null}
