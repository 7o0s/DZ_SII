Or so say the inhabitants of Andergast, who consider it a blight on the city. But he denies everything. It's his power, he says. In fact, the great hunter Gwinnling's apprentice birdcatcher can break small objects of glass or clay with his mind. But now he's ready to prove that his powers are not a harbinger of doom. But to do so he must win the city competition organized by King Efferdan. Meanwhile Gwinnling has more serious problems: the old hunter has in fact glimpsed the arrival of a curse. It is the Seer, the old man burned at the stake years ago who is now ready to return to overwhelm the kingdom with his crows. Geron, as young people do, doesn't care about the master's fears, wins the competition and finds himself in the presence of the king, who offers him a task: to free the guest room from the crows before the queen of Nostria arrives. Here ends the first chapter of the game, short and boring. The beginning of The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav is in fact devoid of thrust. Geron brings bad luck, and would be a serious psychological damage to him, but the stubborn birdcatcher doesn't seem too upset. And we have never seen the Seer, why fear him? Luckily after the room of the crows the real triggering incident happens: the meeting between Geron and the fairy Nuri. This is the beginning of a memorable adventure as one man struggles against the shackles of fate to save a precious but fragile bond. And that it reaches its turning point when Geron lies to Nuri to lead her to Fanglari against her will. So the real question that The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav must answer is only one: will Geron be able to redeem himself and save Nuri? Guybrush, the case is yours The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav is a point-and-click adventure based on the universe of A Look in the Dark, the German RPG created by Ulrich Kiesow and Werner Fuchs. The action always takes place within a small number of screens, sometimes even just one, as if they were the chapters of a long novel. These rest stops are all different in color and problem and keep the player's interest alive even after many hours. Even the classic scene of the hero tied to a post trying to escape is thought out in an original way. The puzzles are all of an environmental type and always require interaction with the numerous objects that are scattered here and there, often camouflaged so well with the backgrounds that they require a meticulous search with the pointer. The aim is always to solve a problem that prevents Geron and Nuri from continuing their journey. There is usually a meet and greet at each of these stops. Magical creatures, wayfarers, scoundrels and knights enrich the experience and add depth to the story. Not to mention the enigmatic talking crow that accompanies Geron and Nuri everywhere. Even if the screens connected to each other are few each time, the puzzles require a good dose of creativity. The extravagance of certain situations recalls the golden age of Lucas adventures: it takes a mind trained in the impossible feats of The Secret of Monkey Island to avoid getting stuck in certain passages - the classic was the call to a friend shouting that he had looked everywhere and that there must have been a bug. No bugs - some steps are just very imaginative. The freshness of The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav, which underneath has a classic structure, is however due to the possibility of interacting with Nuri and to the fact that the two young men both have magical power. Geron as we have already said can destroy some objects, while Nuri is capable of repairing them. The dialogues are also important and add up to the activities necessary to advance in solving the puzzles that gradually grow in difficulty until they reach their peak in the world of fairies. The only drawback are the sections where Nuri is absent. Even if they are consistent with the narrative needs, without her the game loses momentum. There's room for two Geron and Nuri are a passionate couple. A strong alchemy is created between the two characters right away which pushes us to continue to find out what will become of them. It's easy to get into the part and feel the protective instinct that Geron has towards Nuri. The fairy is in fact naive and devoid of malice, while the stubborn birdcatcher has always lived with people's prejudices and has developed shrewdness and persuasive ability. Geron knows how to lie, Nuri doesn't. Luckily The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav doesn't stop at the tale of the hero who knows the world and saves the damsel who never left the tower. During the journey, the two young men reach a sentimental maturity that opens Nuri's eyes and roughs Geron's character. At the end of the adventure Geron is a mancapable of fully taking charge of their own choices. Their charisma and good characterization keeps them at the center of the scene to the detriment of the supporting actors, who unfortunately have a marginal role and come out weak from the comparison with the personalities of the two protagonists. The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav is a very dark game, with a murky history of ignorance and hatred. Against this background Geron and Nuri stand out vividly and leave a deep impression on the player's memory. The substance takes shape If The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav is a successful adventure it also owes it to the splendid pictorial style screens. The colors are intense and varied. It ranges from the Nordic Andergast to the inaccessible world of fairies. Alternating bright tones with a prevalence of gray. The excellent English dub is accompanied by a good translation in the Italian subtitles, even if sometimes the two do not coincide with each other. We also happened to see Geron flash on the screen, then come to his senses. Even the answers in the dialogues disappeared on a couple of occasions. The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav is a long adventure that can take you up to fifteen hours, so these flaws are not enough to detract from the pleasure of the game, but they could still have been avoided. Finally, as happens more and more often in this kind of game, before starting we can decide whether to face the adventure in simple or complex mode. Make your choice and forget about it: playing twice makes no sense, unless you want to relive the same story. Or unlock all Steam achievements.", "date": "2012-07-25", "grade": "8.0"}
