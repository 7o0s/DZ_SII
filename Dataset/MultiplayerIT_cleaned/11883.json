{"name": "Crazy Taxi: Fare Wars - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crazy-taxi-fare-wars-recensione.html", "text": "Sega enjoyed a golden age in the days of 16-bit consoles, and yet it has never abandoned the arcade industry, always striving to innovate and excite. With Virtua Racing first and then with Daytona USA, the Japanese company wrote the history of racing games, reaching unmatched levels of excellence for their respective periods. Crazy Taxi is the result of the same spirit: released in arcades in 1999, the game bases its charm on a frenetic race against time, in which driving a taxi you have to try to serve as many customers as possible within a limited time, which is increased by a few seconds each time a new passenger gets on board. The goal is to earn enough money to occupy the top spots in the ranking of the most efficient taxi drivers... and, to do this, the game must last as long as possible, in the true spirit of arcade games (in which it is only the ability to determine how much we will play). Making Wars After a myriad of conversions for all systems (but the Dreamcast version always remains in the heart...) and now quite a few years on the back, Crazy Taxi also arrives on PSP with a ~collection~ of the first two episodes, ai which some interesting modes are added, including wireless multiplayer (either with two copies of the game or with only one) and an option to replace the classic punk-rock soundtrack of this series with the MP3s of our choice, uploaded to Memory Sticks. For the few who do not know Crazy Taxi, it is necessary to briefly describe its mechanics: after selecting one of the four available taxi drivers (each one has different characteristics, which are reflected in the behavior of the taxi), we can choose whether to play with the original rules (see above) or try your hand at a session with a predetermined time limit. Then we leave, with our car whizzing through the virtual streets of San Francisco (Crazy Taxi) or New York (Crazy Taxi 2) in search of customers. To accept a call, you have to stop in the immediate vicinity of any passenger, who will quickly board and demand breakneck speed to reach his destination. When the customer gets into the car, depending on the length of the journey (identified by a color) we are charged a certain number of seconds, while we will only be paid once we reach our destination. All this happens while there is demon traffic on the streets, so we will have to be very careful not to collide with other motorists, which in any case will not damage us (after all, we will also end up running underwater, as if nothing had happened) but it will waste our precious time. Crazy Taxi 2 adds to this mechanic the possibility of taking off jumps as if we were new Michael Knights, which will come in handy on more than one occasion. Cross and delight This double conversion for PSP proves to be perfect right from the start: the two Crazy Taxi episodes are identical to the original versions, with the addition of the game modes that distinguish the home-made reductions. So both titles are not lacking in a substantial special mode in which you have to face a series of spectacular tests to unlock interesting extras. And there's no shortage of multiplayer, which on PSP can be played in different ways and is a nice but not fundamental element. In addition, there is the possibility of creating your own soundtrack, accompanying the frenetic races and deadly rear-end collisions with the songs we prefer. The playability, of course, is the same as always: pure arcade. On the Sony laptop we have an instant control system, which by default assigns the accelerator and brake to the shoulder keys and uses the X and Circle buttons to change between normal and reverse gear. A perfect conversion, therefore, which unfortunately also keeps the flaws of the original titles unchanged: graphics that are by now outdated, especially in the quality of the textures but also in the pop-up effects (now a relic of the past), which manages to be quite fast but poor in level of detail. And a gameplay that is immediate by definition, but which can get tiring after a few games, especially those who ask for a minimum depth from video games. Finally, making Wars does not skimp on some problems that have never been solved, which can lead to episodes of frustration where the taxi ends up ~getting stuck~ in an obstacle when game over is just a few seconds away. Comment Given its particular nature, Crazy Taxi: Fare Wars is a product that can be strenuously loved or viscerally hated. Pure arcade, a shining example of the glorious Sega tradition and equipped in this PSP version with some interesting features, this double game is certainly aimed at fans of the versionnor original, which despite the hundreds of games already made still want to drive at full speed with the aim of satisfying their customers and setting new endurance records (which, said like this, can easily be misunderstood...). Those who don't like arcade titles and Crazy Taxi in particular, however, won't fail to notice the limits of a product that feels the passage of time in its technical realization and that can offer everything except a varied action. Pros: Two games in one 100% Arcade Perfect conversions... Cons: ...defects included Fast but dated graphics Tends to repeat itself Crazy Taxi: Fare Wars is only available for PSP.", "date": "2007-10-29", "grade": null}
