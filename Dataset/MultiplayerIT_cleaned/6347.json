The Yacht Club Games game doesn't move a thousand thousand polygons, it doesn't show off high resolution graphics and, urcas, it's not a remaster: it's an old-fashioned platformer, both in appearance and in gameplay, but calibrated so well, designed so meticulously, that you just need to play with it for a few minutes to forget about it. Shovel Knight was a hit, and convinced Sony and Microsoft to grab a version of their own: and so, after hopping on PC, Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, the brave knight with the shovel has also landed on the shores of the competition. Today we're talking about the version for Sony platforms, with an exceptional guest star: Kratos! Shovel Knight is one of those retro games that gets better with time, just like fine wine My kingdom for a shovel For those who don't know Shovel Knight, and don't want to read our original review, it's right to briefly explain how the game works: it's an easy task, since you simply use two keys. One allows us to swing our shovel to hit enemies or dig up treasures hidden underground, the other allows us to jump. End. There are no other particular maneuvers, no complicated combos or who knows what. At most, it is possible to choose a relic - a kind of super power - by pressing the back buttons and activate it by holding down the directional cross upwards and pressing the attack button, just like in games of yesteryear (and every call to Castlevania is purely random). By holding down the d-pad down and attacking while Shovel Knight is in mid-air instead, we will be able to use the shovel as a sort of trampoline, hitting enemies and, perhaps, bouncing higher. Shovel Knight's capabilities are limited, yet it's a pleasure to play: the control system is very precise, responsive and intuitive. And the level design is all about that simplicity with commendable wit and inventiveness. The most advanced gamers will recognize in the Shovel Knight levels many homages to the masterpieces of the past, coming across the more traditional traps and pitfalls: mobile platforms, lethal chasms, secret passages in the walls, bouncing surfaces and so on. The sizable cast of enemies adds spice to the frenzy of the action; there are opponents for all tastes ranging from flying bats to knights armed with swords and shields, jellies that suddenly jump and skeletons that literally lose their minds. From time to time you come across mini-bosses such as dragons or gigantic fish, but the end-of-level bosses are the real icing on the cake. Shovel Knight's stages are scattered across a map reminiscent of Super Mario Bros. 3, and at the end of each level you have to fight against its ruler in small arenas that are so reminiscent of 8 and 16-bit Mega Man: the various bosses, such as Plague Knight or Mole Knight, are tough and you have to learn their patterns to avoid attacks and respond at the right time. The money earned by collecting gems in the levels and finding secret chests can be spent in the city to buy new armor or relics that can give Shovel Knight special powers, useful when the going gets tough. The title of Yacht Club Games is far from easy, but it is so well structured that the player can only blame himself for his departures, which is why a layered checkpoint system comes to his aid: there are several for every level, but true champions can also destroy them, giving them up in exchange for a cash bonus. Simple, but brilliant. PSVita trophies To earn the 28 bronze trophies, the 3 silver, the 6 gold and the coveted platinum you will have to sweat seven shirts: it will not only be enough to complete each level, but also to satisfy the strict requirements. For example, it will be necessary to finish the game without ever dying or without ever using a checkpoint, without using relics or avoiding consuming regenerative foods during the stages. God of War We played Shovel Knight mainly in the PlayStation Vita version, experiencing the same quality already savored last year on Nintendo platforms. The stick of the Sony handheld proved to be comfortable and precise, as usual, and was particularly rewarding in the more difficult and frenetic levels, where extra caution or responsiveness was required. The game, however, is fundamentally the same also from a technical point of view, which in any case does not offer much: very colorful and good-sized sprites, and a carefor the detail that transcends the limited retro-inspired color palette. The substantial difference is, of course, the rendering on the screen: OLED displays, as in our case, greatly improve the final result, especially from the point of view of bright and lively colours. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this conversion is the possibility to play on PlayStation Vita... but also on PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4. Shovel Knight is in fact cross-platform and also supports cross-save, which means that you can start playing on the TV in the living room and then move everything to the handheld, or vice versa, at any time. The Sony console version also features an additional secret boss, namely Kratos, the protagonist of the God of War: Shovel Knight series must first find him, and then defeat him in an epic battle divided into two stages. The fight is frantic and complex, with a pixelated but faithful to the original Kratos, armed with his trusty Blades of Chaos, which allow him to grab our hero from a distance, hurl him against walls or leap from one point to another, especially in the second phase of the clash, which develops vertically. The battle is then accompanied by an 8-bit rearrangement of the God of War main theme that made us smile satisfied. It's just a shame that Kratos' cameo starts and ends on the spot, whereas the Battletoads slotted in for him in the Xbox 360 and Xbox One versions even unlock a hub of their own on the game's map.", "date": "2015-05-11", "grade": "9.0"}
