Then you begin to put the pieces together, and you realize that there is something different, starting from that strange pseudo-technological setting, passing through the gunfights with John Woo-style shots, up to the real game is exactly. After a few minutes of gameplay, we seem to find ourselves faced with an absurd Japanese madness: among what seem to be the usual, harmless NPCs capable of always repeating the usual three words, there are characters who pour out a quantity of notions on the player difficult to sustain at first. At this point we wonder what happened to the classic interactive tutorial soft introduction that characterizes JRPGs, realizing that here, right away, we have to learn to master all the complex mechanics that make up the game. Then we realize the reality: Resonance of Fate is not a product designed to please everyone, it does not wink at the mainstream like a mammoth Final Fantasy XIII and precisely because of these peculiarities it still manages to get a fair amount of space in the same period in which the colossus Square Enix comes out on the market, since it basically aims at something else, configuring itself as an interesting experimentation in the Japanese role-playing field. The roughness with which it is placed on the player, requiring him to understand all the different aspects of the gameplay from the first minutes of the game, is an essential prerequisite for immediately making a selection among those who intend to enter into its mechanics up to mastering them and obtaining satisfactions and those who might instead find its stratified and deep structure frustrating and not very immediate (in a word: not funny). While lacking a few tweaks and some pacing and balancing issues, tri-Ace must be credited with successfully building its own rather convincing take on the JRPG theme again. A particular story The setting chosen for Resonance of Fate helps to characterize it with its particular exotic aura, being built on a style that closely resembles steampunk. An invasive and completely mechanical technology fits into city views that seem to be taken from the Victorian era, except for some obvious futuristic inconsistencies but still creating a fascinating stylistic pot pourri. In an unspecified future, the Earth has been devastated by a mysterious noxious gas that has invaded the atmosphere causing almost the complete elimination of humanity. The only way to fight extinction is a gigantic purifier built as a sort of tower called Basel, which stands out for hundreds of meters on the earth's surface and around which man has reorganized and tried to rebuild his civilization . Between the floors of the enormous mechanism, the social fabric is set up according to a rigid hierarchy that sees the Cardinals prevail, an order that dominates through the Riedel religion and took political power after the death of Popess Frida. In the lower strata of the cities, between streets and alleys where the sunlight filters only through the enormous mechanisms of Basel, the lower class humanity leads its existence in an almost normal way, if it weren't for the presence of monsters and assorted criminals who began to proliferate in different areas of the huge urban agglomeration. With such assumptions, the ~hunters~ like the three protagonists Zephyr, Vashyron and Leanne see their business prosper, being rewarded for completing the most varied missions which almost always involve the passage through areas infested with enemies of various types, against which only trained fighters are able to survive. As if the secrets hidden by each of the three characters weren't enough, the normal routine of the missions begins to crumble when the perfect mechanisms of Basel show signs of malfunctioning and the protagonists obviously find themselves entangled in an adventure much bigger than them. Despite being a strongly narrative setting, the story takes place in a fragmentary way in the midst of the various missions to be completed and above all through dialogues and cut-scenes built directly with the game's graphics engine, rather than relying on traditional computer graphics movies . Curiosity Firearms can be upgraded and expanded buyndo items, conquering them in battle or creating them from spare parts and applying various modifications to the basic equipment. Each weapon has a certain amount of slots in which to apply the upgrades, which can generally be summarized in additions to the barrel for firepower, the scope for accuracy, the magazine for the amount of ammunition and the butt for stability. There are also different types of interchangeable ammunition that involve damage of various entities as well as inducing altered states in enemies. tri-Attack-Battle System The combat system is perhaps the most characterizing element of the game, with its mix of real-time and turn-based action and its rigid mechanics that impose a continuous and flawless strategy, if you don't want to run into a rather frequent ~gamer over~. We find ourselves managing a party made up of three characters, with each fighter having a certain amount of actions available to perform within a turn. This is marked by a bar that drops quickly as we move freely on the battlefield or carry out any action between attack, defense and use of objects, at the end of which we move on to the next round. The weapons that can be used are all firearms and differ in the type of damage they inflict, divided into two categories: fast automatic weapons such as machine guns and the like cause superficial damage, usually of greater magnitude but with a non-lethal effect, while the others cause direct damage. In any case, before shooting it is necessary to wait the time required to aim, marked by a circle that is drawn around the target like a crosshair, which does not always happen before the enemy has time to react. Surface damage can be recovered after a turn, but if direct damage occurs, they are all charged together, which determines a particular order of attack, usually by preceding direct damage with a volley of surface blows to quickly eliminate the damage. enemy. In addition to normal movement and attack, a fundamental option is given by the ~heroic action~, an action that allows you to establish a pre-set movement trajectory for the fighter, who will follow this line until colliding with an obstacle and end of shift. Within this space, it is possible to carry out various attacks (even by jumping, which determines the typical ~John Woo-like~ fight scenes), the success of which corresponds to the conquest of a crystal, which in turn allows new heroic actions . The next step to this type of movement is given by the triple attack, which is obtained by accumulating ~Resonance~ points, which can be obtained simply by running along trajectories that pass between the other two fighters of the party. With at least one Resonance point each and a crystal, the triple attack can be triggered, during which the three fighters act simultaneously (if they manage to complete the charge) with highly spectacular effects. The downside of this system is represented by the extreme precision with which the crystals are dosed: in the event that we lose them all, due to blows suffered or actions not completed, we find ourselves in the critical state, during which the blows inflicted from enemies they become direct and our attacks are practically ineffective, a situation that usually precedes Game Over. A world of hexagons It is not only the combat system that characterizes this tri-Ace production in a particular way. A separate mention should be made for the organization of the map and the movements on it. Within each single location, the structure of the game assumes the typical characteristics of exploration in villages or bases typical of similar products, with 3D scenarios represented with fixed shots and tracking shots. When you move from one location to another within the Basel map, however, the approach becomes similar to that of a strategic one, with a sort of puzzle influence. The whole environment is divided into hexagons, which the player must cross to reach the various scenarios and within which it is possible to run into sporadic occasional clashes. Some of these hexes are inactive, meaning they cannot be traversed until activated by applying energy cells. These are essentially compositions of different hexagons hooked according to various configurations, to be applied over the inactive hexagons of the map with a system that recalls the Tetris principle, i.e. the geometric configuration of the cells must match in shape, but also in color, with the inactive ones underlying. In case all goes well, the exagons are reactivated and allow passage. This particular structure makes it necessary to conquer various energy cells through battles, and inserts the elements of shape and color as additional variables to be taken into account, also because they make the cells more or less rare and precious. It is also possible to place some special cells as desired on the map which allow, for example, to recharge the group's energy by making it rest or saving the game. The management of the map in this way becomes a sort of game within the game, a real puzzle game which, on the one hand is essential to open access to the locations that must be visited in order to advance in the plot, on the other it adds depth to the game as it leads us to spend time also to open new roads on the map and reach secret settings or discover hidden treasures. Xbox 360 goals The narrative scansion in chapters favors the logical distribution of the objectives in the course of the game, however several others can be conquered only by obtaining particular results or by carrying out specific actions. In any case, those who have the persistence to get to the end of the game will not find the complete collection of Gamerpoints too difficult. Gears, bullets and candles The steampunk setting adequately crowns the original fresco that the developers have put up with Resonance of Fate. Although graphically we have seen better uses of the Unreal Engine, the charm derived from the contrast between the bizarre mechanical technology, the Victorian-style architecture and futuristic elements grafted into the scenery creates a fascinating contrast, painting a world that is memorable, despite some obvious technical limits that intervene above all in the graphic realization of the scenarios in which the fights take place and in the representation of many of the enemies. In short, the stylistic-architectural choice for the setting partly manages to compensate for the defects of what remains perhaps the weakest point of the entire production, i.e. the technical realization, although the audio accompaniment is always on excellent levels, between overwhelming orchestral pieces alternating with rock rhythms depending on the context. One would think that the spectacularity of the visual apparatus was not taken into consideration by tri-Ace as a founding element of the game, something underlined by the choice to rely above all on cut-scenes built with the in-game graphics engine and rather static dialogues between the characters, instead of focusing on long and abundant computer graphics films as often happens in products belonging to the same genre. This aspect also seems to reaffirm the ~hardcore~ essence of this title, which confirms itself as a product suitable above all for those who intend to put strategy before everything else when they take the controller and enter the magical world of Basel, mastering the better the intricate mechanics of the gameplay, rather than being carried away by the narrative. A courageous choice, it must be admitted.", "date": "2010-03-19", "grade": "7.8"}
