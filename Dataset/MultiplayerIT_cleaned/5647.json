Between roguelikes, puzzle games and pinball machines we have now seen a bit of everything, but we were missing a fighting game. Yet it's an idea that makes perfect sense. Beyond the positive messages that the brand wants to convey, with a wink at the importance of respecting animals and nature in general, one cannot overlook the fact that in Pokmon one fights badly, also because the mother series rotates all around the battles between monster trainers, complete with a final tournament. In short, that sooner or later we would get to this point was also a bit obvious, but Nintendo had to frame the right context and find the right hardware and moment to develop the idea well. That's why Pokkn Tournament first arrived in the arcade to then be converted for Wii U and carve out a small space for the next EVO Tournament, at a time when the Nintendo console needed another small injection of energy and you could push the brand in at least two different directions at the same time, bringing it closer to those who love fighting games but know little Pokmon and vice versa. To succeed in the enterprise, one could certainly not entrust everything to the first one who passed by, which is why none other than Katsuhiro Harada, historical producer of the Tekken series since 1994, and Masaaki Hoshino, producer in turn of a another Bandai Namco series, Soulcalibur. Thanks to this kind of extraordinary astral alignment, Nintendo has won an important bet, even if it hasn't convinced us to the end. Pokkn Tournament doesn't redefine either the genre or Pokmon, but it's a good place to meet Mewtwo's shadow For the avoidance of doubt, it is worth clarifying right away that RPG Pokkn Tournament has very little, even if it is possible to improve the statistics of the monsters every time they level up between fights. Even the ~story mode~, which the game calls Lega Ferrum and represents the core of the single player experience, is incredibly small, while introducing a whole series of innovations that enrich the Pokmon universe and could probably appear in the next main episodes of the series, starting with Sun and Moon. Talking about ~history~ is very brave because it exists, but it flounders in a flood of random encounters which, if they wanted to imitate the player's progression in Pokmon RPGs, we must say that they succeeded very badly. Lega Ferrum is subdivided into five leagues in turn, each of which follows a very specific process. The first thing to do will be to place ourselves among the top eight coaches of the current league, and this means that we will have to fight various sequences of five matches at a time to climb a fake leaderboard. Once we reach the top ten, we will have to face an elimination tournament, essentially consisting of three clashes; after that, it will be the turn of what we could define as the ~gym leader~, and that is an opponent who, once beaten, will guarantee us access to the next league. At that point it starts all over again, but the clashes needed to reach the top ten increase in number. The experience is highly repetitive - also because it is not possible to change the difficulty level - but between one league and another we will have to face the mysterious Black Mewtwo, around which the whole story of Pokkn Tournament revolves: after completing the third league in fact, we will temporarily abandon the official rings to face a series of strongly narrative clashes that break a bit the terrifying repetitiveness of the single player mode, unfortunately necessary to unlock not only the two secret characters, but also the various support pokmon that we can recall during the clashes. In short, the Ferrum League is a very boring practically mandatory step if you want to unlock all the contents of Pokkn Tournament, but the problem is not linked so much to its monotonous structure, but to the discrete variety of opponents that we will have to face dozens and dozens of times. Without excluding pokmon The Pokkn Tournament roster has caused fans of the series to discuss a lot, especially in recent weeks when the leaks and the careful observation of photos and videos have confirmed the number of selectable ~fighters~, which at the time of the game's release will be fourteen, to which are added the two ~secret~ pokmon Mewtwo and Mewtwo Black. Sixteen pokmon in total, in short, and four decidedly obvious empty spaces, in the selection screen, that Nintendo could fill with future DLC as happened with the recent Super Smash Bros. The problem is not ris certainly in the number, because nobody wants to bother the dozens of fighters in the roster of Ultra Street Fighter IV and Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3, not to mention that in the next paragraph you will discover that Harada's team has guaranteed a truly commendable variety. No, it was precisely the selection of the monsters in question that triggered a lot of controversy, which was rather predictable when you have to choose less than twenty by drawing on a PokDex which today has more than seven hundred. However, the roster drawn up by Bandai Namco has some curious inconsistencies. Beyond the two Mewtwo, the limited presence of Fight-type pokmon immediately stands out, certainly the most suitable to appear in a fighting game, with illustrious absentees such as Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee, Hawlucha, Pangoro or Hariyama. On the other hand, Fire-type pokmon abound, but above all the presence of Pikachu leaves us more than perplexed: obviously the yellow electric mouse had to be there at all costs, being the mascot of the brand, but the inclusion of a female and masked version , Pikachu Wrestler, is really questionable. Fortunately we can reassure all those who feared in a simple ~clone~, practically an extra costume; the two Pikachu, in fact, are completely different characters, with unique moves, combos and animations. The fact remains that that slot appears a bit sacrificed, like those granted to Chandelure or Gardevoir. It is clear that Bandai Namco has made a choice based on the approval ratings, it is no coincidence that Chandelure is one of the most popular pokmon in Japan. The roster of support pokmon, on the other hand, immediately appears much more nourished. The little monsters in question are divided into fixed pairs and linked to an indicator that fills up over time or by satisfying certain conditions: once loaded, just press the left back button to call the little creature onto the field, which will attack the opponent or will grant a temporary bonus before disappearing. As you climb the ranks of the Ferrum League, you unlock more and more support combinations, which also include legendary pokmon such as Celebi, Shaymin, Yveltal or Reshiram. The Iron Fist Tournament The Pokkn Tournament control system and the peculiarity of the game dynamics can generate some concern regarding the depth and complexity of the gameplay, but there is a very simple game mode that sweeps away all fears in a few minutes, namely the Workout. Divided into various categories, Training offers newcomers to the genre a long and exhaustive tutorial that essentially explains every mechanic of Pokkn Tournament, as well as two game modes in which it is possible to learn the basic moves of each pokmon but also some of the most complicated that it is possible to loop. And everything relies on the simple combination of the three attack buttons with the directional cross, relegating a combination of buttons to the socket and one to the so-called counterattack. Keeping the default configuration, with a backbone the support pokmon are called; with the other backbone he parries; finally, with one of the front buttons you jump. The simultaneous pressure of the two back buttons allows you to power up the pokmon for a short period of time when the Resonance indicator is fully charged: in this situation, the attacks inflict more damage and are slightly different, in addition it is possible to launch a kind of extremely spectacular super attack. Each match then begins in what is called the panoramic phase, with the camera framing our pokmon from behind and the possibility of moving freely around the arena. By hitting the opponent with some particularly powerful attacks, the Duel Phase is triggered, basically two-dimensional, in which the combos and attacks change slightly. The player must therefore learn two lists of attacks and combos per character, and learn the best times to parry, jump, break through a defense, grab the opponent and exploit invisible barriers to inflict even more damage and chain more shots . In short, Pokkn Tournament is an extremely intuitive and immediate fighting game in the controls but decidedly deeper than the simplicity of the gameplay or the subject of the game itself might lead to believe. There are some dilutions in the fighting game dynamics that could disappoint fans of the genre, that's true. It is not possible to attack ~on the ground~, for example, and the animation of the support pokmon makes it really difficult to fit them into our combos, even if with great skill it is possible to do it, but it always depends on the pokmon and with some it is realistically infeasible. The Overview Phase on paper is a good idea, but we have to admitIt was believed that Pokkn Tournament would have worked perfectly, and maybe even a little better, if it had focused only on the Duel Phase, especially when fighting opponents like Chandelure, Braixen or Gengar who can abuse a wide variety of ranged strikes. Violent punches The last criticism, paradoxically, allows us to reward the inventiveness of the Harada team in the creation of these ~pokfighters~: inspired by the historical moves of the Pokmon series and the most famous attacks of the Tekken fighters, the developers have managed to give the roster a great personality. The result is an unsuspected variety of possibilities and fighting styles that wink at the same time as casual and die-hard fans of the genre. Despite our concerns, the roster felt very balanced to us, especially after the changes made to some characters - we're talking about you, Gengar! - following the criticisms of the arcade version a few months ago. Recognizing the animations and special moves of the Pokkn Tournament pokmon becomes almost a game within the game for both Tekken and parent series fans, but it's not the only detail that will catch the most attentive looks. The rings, for example, are a riot of details and quotes, with pokmon and coaches cheering on the background of arenas full of details. It's a real shame, from this point of view, that the Wii U hardware hasn't been squeezed more. The downgrade, compared to the arcade cabinet, is evident from the first moments, at least as regards the general definition of the image, which appears excessively dirty and ~muddy~, especially in the case of ~furry~ Pokmon such as Lucario or Suicune, since the strong aliasing betrays the fur shading technique which should have made them more realistic. Apparently it is the price to pay for over the top effects that make the fights much more spectacular and pyrotechnic - just look at the attacks of Blaziken or Braixen - but above all for the granite 60 frames per second which guarantee an almost perfect fluidity. In this sense it is clear that Pokkn Tournament, beyond the rather meager single player content, was designed to fight a lot against other players in order to earn the money necessary to buy any type of collectible: there are dozens and dozens of costumes and accessories with which to personalize the illustrations of our alter ego and his coach, the chatty Nia (whose enthusiasm we can thankfully curb a bit in the options). The multiplayer mode provides two simple possibilities: we can face our acquaintances via friend code or locally, in friendly matches, or fight other coaches online and climb the world leaderboard. Local matches, unfortunately, force one of the two players to concentrate on the GamePad screen precisely because of the visual dynamics imposed by the two Phases that alternate during the fight, at half the frame rate too. Alternatively, a pair of Wii U can be connected via LAN, but this is an unlikely compromise. As for online, unfortunately the small number of players in possession of a Pokkn Tournament review code prevented us from finding matches regularly - also because, when the waiting times get too long, the game takes care of making us face the CPU as a pastime - but when we faced other human opponents we were able to verify the good behavior of the netcode in games without lag or slowdowns of any kind. Furthermore, the most competitive players will be pleased to know that Bandai Namco has introduced penalties to punish the infamous ~rage quitters~.", "date": "2016-03-15", "grade": "7.0"}
