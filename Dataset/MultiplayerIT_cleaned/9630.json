{"name": "Centrale Kinect", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/82469-kinect-centrale-kinect.html", "text": "After months of chats and meetings, more or less happy, around the world, Kinect came out, he connected to Xbox 360 and, inevitably, he also began to look warily at the members of the Multiplayer.it editorial team. When Kinect is connected to Xbox 360, when you turn it on, lift the top and scan the room in front of you looking for a user, or its user. The one who bought it and put it in the living room where it is. After about a week of living together, and questioning looks from us and from the cameras that stare at us every day, it's time to take stock of the situation. To try to understand how it feels to not have a pad in your hands to navigate the dashboard and launch title menus. How do you relate to a peripheral that is able to recognize you and greet you, even listen to you, if only it spoke Italian, of course. Make room, here comes Kinect! Kinect connects to Xbox 360 thanks to a dedicated port with a special cable that goes to the back of the console, if it is the new S model, launched last summer, the glossy black one. In the case of the old XBs, on the other hand, in addition to the USB connector, necessary to make the cable compatible with a standard socket, the use of a socket for the additional power supply must be foreseen, given that the cameras and the electric motor that they move it need more energy than a normal peripheral (all the details in the unboxing video you can find on this same page). Once connected, you need to properly calibrate Kinect to adapt it to the room in which it was installed. For the first time, since these are camera-based peripherals, it doesn't matter that the background of the environment is free from objects or is uniformly colored, given that the software imprinted on the Kinect chip is able to distinguish the elements of a human body from those of the inanimate objects that are around. What is necessary, however, is that there is space (the minimum is 1 meter and 80, below which you can only move the cursor on the screen), especially if you are at least 1.90 tall, for example. In cases like this, only from 2 meters up, in fact, it is possible to be completely framed by the cameras, which are two like the eyes of a human being and which allow Kinect to understand when you are moving in depth and not only to side on a two-dimensional plane. In addition to these there is also an infrared sensor that allows the device to work even in cases of low light in the room and to recognize us. One of the first steps, in fact, is the one that requires the user to pose in front of Kinect, associating a Kinect ID with one of the gamertags present in memory. At that point we are asked to assume a whole series of poses, from different angles, which allow the machine to establish the space available to us and, above all, to scan the identifying features of our body and face. Once done (and the first time it happens you are necessarily surprised), Kinect recognizes the user as soon as he passes in front of the sensors, automatically logging in and greeting with a ~Welcome USERNAME!~. This connection never dies, even if a friend of ours is playing one of the Kinect titles as a guest, the moment we get in front of the screen, even during a loading screen, the identification process starts and the log in is made automatically. Always. To activate the camera, just make an arc with one of the hands as for a virtual greeting and at that point you can proceed with the actual calibration which passes through three phases. The first is the one used to adjust the angle of the Kinect, depending on the distance between us and the cameras. A screen shows our silhouette and the cardinal points represented by the head, hands and legs, once we are fully framed and our face is recognized (we can also lean towards the lenses to be better identified, and then return normal pose), you can proceed to audio. Here Kinect records the background noise of the environment, so as to establish the minimum noise threshold and record only the sounds higher than it. At that point, it checks the level of the stereo or TV speakers, in order to perceive the difference between the user's voice and that of the game audio and, finally, asks the player to read a sequence of numbers to verify that the voice is recorded correctly. English users, for example, are already able to give voice commands to Xbox thanks to Kinect and a complex audio reception program that also allows you to give indicationsions on one's geographical area of origin, so that vocal inflections and dialects can be distinguished. In Italy there is still no such support and the Kinect audio sensors are only used for chatting, for sending voice messages and for those games that ask, in addition to movements, to underline certain moves, perhaps by shouting (imagine a more powerful punch in a fighting game), or to interact with avatars, perhaps calling them by name as in Kinectimals. The last phase is called ~Calibration~ and requires the use of a postcard with a smiley on it, found in Kinect games (recognizable by the purple color of the packaging). The postcard should be centered with respect to a rectangle that is displayed on the screen at different sizes, so as to suggest the distance at which it should be placed in space. Here the peripheral takes note of the user's distance and of the longitudinal space it has available. Once this last step has been completed, you are ready to begin. New Dashboard and features The new Dashboard, the one born with the autumn update, has a simplified version specifically designed for Kinect. The fundamental functions are identified by mega buttons which are selected by hovering any of the hands over them for a certain number of seconds, set in such a way as to prevent any movement by the user from turning into a selection input which would have led to continuous opening and closing windows. In this mode you can send messages, browse your friends list and view videos and marketplace content, check your unlocked achievements, simply by moving your hands and flipping through the menus as if they were the pages of a book. The central button of the pad is replaced by a pose, in which the left arm must be moved away from the body by about 15 degrees for a few seconds, and thanks to which the menu is accessed to return to the dashboard, to calibrate Kinect or to navigate objectives and list friends, with all the appropriate options. The feeling is that this mode is slower than the usual one with a normal pad, but the idea, which you get used to rather quickly, of being able to simply turn on the console without looking for the pad and while continuing to move around the room, without sitting down as is usually done, it has a charm of its own. The inveterate gamer will hardly replace this experience with the more direct and immediate one of a pad, but it is probable that a more ~comfortable~ or younger user will soon get into the habit of standing in front of the monitor, greeting Kinect and interacting this new way starting in the next few months. Especially when voice recognition is introduced and you can turn the console on and off by calling it up. The new video chat, which also works with MSN contacts if you log in, clearly shows the potential of Kinect, given that once the user's silhouette is identified, this is followed if he moves in front of the TV with a zoom that tightens on the face, always putting it in the foreground. If another player enters the field of view, the view automatically zooms out to show both. If the main user leaves the room, Kinect focuses on the other who remains and, at that point, begins to follow this last one. To better understand the concept, all you need to do is have the patience to view the long super direct dedicated to Kinect, in which we have shown precisely these aspects of the Dashboard, as well as some launch titles, including Kinect Adventures, which is included in each package . Kinect Adventures Kinect Adventures is included both in the package of the stand alone device, sold for 149.99, and in the bundle with the console with 4GB of memory, replacing the hard disk, for 299.99. It is, essentially, a fun demonstration that allows anyone to test some of the main features of the peripheral, in a series of tests, progressively more complicated, divided between five different activities. The common denominator is that, also shared by the other Microsoft Game Studios launch titles, of games that do not need the instruction booklet to be enjoyed: you stand in front of the camera, read the description of the movements that we will be called upon to perform and you can start. There are five activities and they range from the famous rowing boat race, which moves left and right and which you blow up to collect the medallions scattered along the waterways; cart racing, where you have to move, duck and jump to avoid obstacles and collect tokens; a room without gravity, in which you have to fly by ~flapping~ your arms and move in depth to explode floating water bubbles; an aquarium sunderwater, whose surface is cracked by a series of fish that produce leaks that must be plugged with feet, head and hands, in what is a three-dimensional version of Twister, the home game to be played even in two with the mat resting on the floor ; the equivalent of Block 3d, in which you have to hit balls with your body to break the blocks that appear at the bottom of a room reminiscent of those where you play squash. At any time the player can be joined by another who places himself in front of the Kinect and in each of the activities. It can be played online and, at the end of each adventure in which the game is divided, prizes are unlocked with which to dress one's avatar and a series of statuettes that come alive following the player's movements, which can also be recorded combined with phrases or versacci shouted at the sensor, and which can be uploaded to the internet and shared with friends. Just as it can be done with all the photos that are taken during the games and which immortalize the most absurd poses. Although it is evident that it is little more than entertainment, the choice to include Kinect Adventures in the bundle makes sense precisely for the heterogeneity of players who have decided to buy the peripheral these days and for those who will decide to do so in coming weeks, given that in any case the idea of having to move in three dimensions to command an avatar requires a bit of adaptation for anyone and that Adventures has a handy initial scheme that displays on the screen the correct distance at which to position yourself, depending on want to play alone or in pairs. The most attentive players, who have followed the dozens of news chasing each other on the net in recent months, will be able to evaluate Kinect's delay in recording the user's movements and transforming them into commands and realizing that this does not exist for the dashboard and that it is of the same entity as that of the other motion controllers present on the market for most of the launch titles, with exceptions that time will tell if due to the inexperience of the programmers or to the characteristics of the peripheral, but which for now are negligible, above all in front of the experience as a whole. Seeing your avatar crossing his arms on his chest, moving his legs and hands, while replicating the pose assumed in front of the screen in real time, makes you smile and understand that there are so many possibilities for use. Going to plug one of the leaks in the aquarium, moving a hand in the air, without hesitating as if the leak were really in front of us (after a little practice) is an experience worth trying. While waiting for games that exploit them in greater depth, for now, the expense to be faced must be evaluated on the basis of one's desire for technology, faith or otherwise in the continued commercial success of Kinect (which, in case, will bring with it titles and commitment by software houses), or having children, friends or siblings with whom to share a fun and, undoubtedly, new experience. The evaluation, for now, is absolutely positive, both in terms of the build quality of the hardware and the goodness of the software which recognizes the different parts of the human body by translating them into commands as if they were the buttons on a joypad. Multiplayer.it, today as in the past and next few days, will continue to cover the individual launch titles to try to help you understand if what's on the plate is enough to make you sit at the table with Kinect. On this page, which for a while will be on the Xbox 360 homepage, the list of articles and videos will be constantly updated, which will gradually be activated and which will help you clear your head.
