{"name": "Spiderman: The Movie", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spiderman-the-movie-2.html", "text": "A bit of Marvel continuity Who is Spider-Man? (Warning, spoilers for those who have not seen the film) In the Spiderman video game, as well as in the film, the birth of a superman is first explained and then his maturation, due to a profound human tragedy, which leads him to become a superhero ; everything follows the continuity of the original Marvel series quite faithfully with some small changes to obtain a more captivating story and, consequently, a more compelling game. But to understand who Spiderman is we have to start from the beginning, from the origins... Peter Parker lives in Queens (a district of New York), and is raised as a son by his uncles Ben and May, having lost both parents in tender age. The boy attended high school immediately demonstrating a very generous character, a more than brilliant mind but revealing himself to be decidedly clumsy in his behavior. A problem that soon leads him to become the victim of the pranks of the typical school bullies, one of whom is the boyfriend of the woman he is in love with: a splendid Mary Jane. But one day something in the boy's life changes forever: during a school visit to OsCorp, a company where genetic modification experiments are carried out on spiders, one of these stings our hero, changing his life forever. In fact, Peter will wake up the next day with fantastic and amazing powers: from now on he will be able to climb walls with his bare hands, shoot a substance similar to a spider's web from his wrists, while his physique will become super-athletic allowing him to acquisition of the strength of a spider (obviously in proportion) and a sixth sense that will make him sense the dangers in advance. It's time to put these great powers to the test! The ~human spider~? No, ~Amazing Spiderman~! Our Peter will initially use these powers to be able to earn a few dollars in the professional wrestling circuit, wearing the clothes of a warrior masked with the eccentric name of a human spider but, right at the end of a fight, he will let a criminal escape, not being his problem. Unfortunately, returning home, Peter will discover that his uncle Ben was killed by that same thug during an attempted robbery. From that moment something in Peter dies; but from the incredible pain a hero is born, The amazing Spiderman is born, a warrior who will live with guilt in his heart and with the last words of his beloved Uncle Ben in his mind: ~with great powers come great responsibilities~. This is the background. You will start the game when Peter is looking for Uncle Ben's killer and you will experience first hand the birth of the hero before dealing with the great historical super-villains of the series, in a whirlwind of events that will follow one another until the end of the game. If you think that Spiderman could be an arcade title in the strict sense of the genre and therefore without any strategic or reasoned component, you are very wrong because the game is proposed as varied and complete. In fact, we will go from missions in which you will have to act in Stealth mode in order not to be identified by enemies, to races against time, essential to defend hostages in danger, then passing through air and land combat actions or clashes with the ruthless Bosses of the moment. From roof to roof, canvas to canvas After the overview on the history of the character and more generally on the construction of the game itself, all that remains is to analyze the product under the aspect that had most perplexed industry experts in the period prior to the game's release, i.e. the technical sector- graphic.br> I can, without fear of contradiction, say that the graphic aspect has undoubtedly offered a more than pleasant surprise, with an Xbox that does an almost impeccable job: beautiful and defined textures, skyscrapers with excellent reflective surfaces with perfect rendering , a line of sight deep and without any imperfections, water and explosions that make the idea masterfully. In short, everything settles on almost excellent quality including the control system during flight, the excellent compass-altimeter orientation system and the engaging combo system on which ground combat is based. The only small perplexity to move to the game is the management of the camera which does everything to try to follow our hero in his stunts, but failing always to be punctual and precise. However, if you have not played one of the previous chapters, certainly the control of the character initially may seem quite complex, but I canensure that in both the classic and advanced versions (the two fixed pad configurations you can choose from) the Xbox controller is exploited in the best possible way. While the four main buttons X, B, Y, A are respectively assigned the punch, kick, canvas and jump functions, the combination of the Y button with the four main directions will allow you to use the web not only to immobilize the enemy but for actions advances such as the web gauntlets, the dome or the impact web, all without counting the possibility of throwing the web at an enemy and then pulling them towards you. These actions are then accompanied by the possibility of flying with the cobweb threads with the R key, throwing the cobweb thread vertically with the L key, activating the Lock-on on an enemy with the white key or moving the camera behind you with the black one . And if you're really a joypad wizard, perform the Yo-Yo Spidey, hanging from a ceiling and slowly moving up or down so as not to be seen by the enemy. (The description of the commands is related to the classic mode, for the advanced mode the differences are slight) Your friendly neighborhood spider-man and green goblin Spiderman is therefore, summing up, an excellent game, accompanied by the enthusiasm and appeal of a great Hollywood masterpiece, with many advantages (varied and intelligent missions, a nice, well-characterised, alluring and fantastic to control main character, total freedom of movement at 360 and a relatively user-friendly control) and some defects of not excessive weight (a sometimes lame camera and some slightly frustrating moments of the game). But Treyarch, the developer, was not satisfied with exploiting an excellent license and has well thought of filling the game with authentic touches of class and bonuses for the more persistent: new costumes, movies, gallery art and the real ~State of the Art~: a bonus that rewards the player who has the skill and perseverance to finish the game in Hero mode with the possibility of reliving the story and the game itself with a new character with new moves, skills and controls and therefore a completely new and revamped game plan. Exact! If you manage to finish the game with Spidey in Hero mode, Harry Osborn, Norman's son, will appear and as the Goblin, riding his biplane and armed with pumpkin bombs, he will relive a new and different adventure by retracing the same locations you passed with Spiderman but managing, however, to make them seem new and never completed thanks to the change of perspective and style of play, which you will have by approaching them in the role of the green elf. Concluding Coming to conclusions and analyzing pros and cons after this broad overview, I can only recommend the title: it is worth all the money it costs, it will offer you an exciting adventure between the roofs of skyscrapers and sewers infested with criminals; the main character will immediately capture you with his sympathy whether you are a fan of the comic series or a newbie to the world of comics. In any case, it will be impossible to remain impassive in front of the classic enemies of the spider, all excellently made. Last tip, if you haven't seen the film yet, watch it and then go to your trusted dealer to get your hands on a copy of Spiderman for Xbox (I say this openly after having seen them all, it tears both the PS2 and the GC). An intense and exciting adventure awaits you!!! Pros: Well characterized character Excellent and well cared for graphics A wide range of available actions Cons: Sometimes the camera will make you seasick You will have to wear red-blue tights Total lack of localization (at least the subtitles could be in Italian ...) Materials: Screenshots Special Screenshots Trailer Tips Spideman in comics Spiderman on the big screen Spiderman on console Tricks From the big screen to the console The hype surrounding this title is great, especially after the release of the spectacular film directed by the genius of Sam Raimi and starring actors of the caliber of Tobey Maguire (Peter Parker/Spiderman), Kirsten Dust (Mary Jane Watson ), Willem Dafoe (Norman Osborn/Goblin) and J.K. Simmons (a fantastic J. Jonah Jameson). Many may not have too much confidence in this game since usually the movies based on the comics are almost painful (X-Men has in any case reversed the trend) and in turn the video games based on the films are always a big unknown parsome rare positive surprises. Does this mean that a licensed video game based on a comic book movie could be an eyesore? Certainly not in this case. As a fan of the series on printed paper I can safely say that the film is quite faithful and manages to convey the sensations transmitted by the comic with a good approximation. And what about video games, you ask? Fortunately there are all the elements of the film but not only: much more action and many more high-caliber enemies await you, all taken from the comic series, starting from the Vulture to get to Goblin, passing between various villains and super-villains more or less less aggressive, with the pleasant and interesting ~gem~ represented by Kraven the hunter, exclusive to Xbox. So are you ready to put on your tights and fly among the skyscrapers of New York?", "date": "2002-06-17", "grade": null}
