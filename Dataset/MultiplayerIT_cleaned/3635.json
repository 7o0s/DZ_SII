{"name": "Tales of Symphonia Remastered", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tales-of-symphonia-remastered-recensione.html", "text": "Tales of Symphonia still remains one of the most loved titles in the long-running series of Japanese RPGs by Bandai Namco, but perhaps also one of the least played, despite having already been re-proposed on several occasions: the last one dates back to 2016 on PC, and a few years first it was the turn of the Tales of Symphonia Chronicles package on PlayStation 3. The original game dates back to 2003 on a console that didn't really have a very wide circulation: Nintendo's GameCube. Maybe that's why Bandai Namco brought it back revised and corrected on PlayStation 2 - but only in Japan, when Tales of were in fashion at the time - and in fact that's the version that, later, it was decided to remaster for the later platforms. Today, therefore, it's up to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with PS5 and Xbox Series X | S included thanks to backwards compatibility, but in the review of Tales of Symphonia Remastered we will explain why it is a half-finished reissue. The few news Tales of Symphonia Remastered, the cast is one of the best in the series Tales of Symphonia Remastered is a title that will especially fascinate nostalgics because well, it's old. Antiquated, we could say, in several respects, starting with the cel-shaded 3D graphics that transpose the soft and refined line of the designer Ksuke Fujishima (author, among other things, of Oh, my goddess! and Sakura Wars) into super deformed proportions. . The deformed style was strong in those years and several would have had to wait before the Tales of series shrugged it off: despite this and the somewhat wooden animations, Tales of Symphonia boasts a sober and memorable character design, scenarios details and a generally high-level artistic direction. The remastering has further defined the images, which now appear sharper and cleaner, even net of high-resolution effects: Bandai Namco's RPG is completely 3D, therefore we have spared ourselves the usual gap between polygonal models and rendered backgrounds that featured recent remasters of similar titles. In this sense, it is a pity that we have not managed to improve the quality of the few but memorable cartoon scenes, nor the fluidity of the code which, being based on the version released on Steam in 2016, remains anchored to 30 frames per second also on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, in case you choose to play on those platforms. Bandai Namco has actually optimized everything better, just as they promised, but it is clear that this feature leaves a bit of a bad taste in the mouth. On the other hand, and here the donkey really falls, Tales of Symphonia Remastered adds practically nothing new to the latest reissue: the contents are the same, moreover dating back to the Japanese Director's Cut for PlayStation 2, and therefore include the double opening sequence, English and Japanese voice acting, extra costumes and some gameplay features that fans of the series - or owners of the previous PC edition - should be familiar with. Big absent, however, Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World, and that is the controversial sequel that was included in the Chronicles package of 2013. A lack that further penalizes the relationship between quality, content and price of this version. Crash course Tales of Symphonia Remastered, the 3D world map can be explored on foot and in flight Now that we have reviewed the novelties of this Remastered version, or rather their almost total absence, we can deal with the actual game: Tales of Symphonia is a vintage Japanese RPG that strongly respects tradition. Exploration of maps and mazes, 3D world map to be tackled on foot and in flight, real-time combat typical of the Bandai Namco series and a typical anime story, but among the best in the series. The protagonist is Lloyd Irving, a fearless young man who will have to accompany, together with his friend Genis, the same age Colette and her bodyguards Kratos and Raine in a sort of procession: Colette, in fact, is the chosen one who can restore the mana of planet Sylvarant. Obviously the matter is much more intricate and the group will find themselves forced to save not one, but two worlds ... or to sacrifice millions of innocent lives. Tales of Symphonia Remastered, the combat system is dated but still fun If the plot, in our opinion, is significantly more engaging than the average of Tales of, the same cannot be said today of the combat system: if you have known the Bandai Namco series with the recent Tales of Arise, then you can put a cross over its fast-paced real-time gameplay. Tales of Symphonia is still a game often years ago and as such does not offer all the refinements that the developer has brought to the series over time: dubbed the Multi-Line Linear Motion Battle System, this iteration of the combat system remains in real time and encourages the player to combine attacks normal and special associated with controller keys, but compared to more modern dynamics it lacks sharp detail. Indeed, compared to the GameCube smooth edition, this version includes the Unison Attacks - executable only after loading the appropriate indicator - and the Mystic Arts which were exclusive to the Japanese version for PlayStation 2, but otherwise Tales of Symphonia is a Fairly obvious RPG in terms of mechanics, but with an interesting character growth system, given that they can be customized by equipping the so-called Exospheres that unlock additional Arts and skills. Tales of Symphonia Remastered, Bandai Namco has further improved the definition Fans of the Tales of Symphonia genre might like it precisely because of its ~old school~ characteristics which, nowadays, are increasingly falling into the background. Compared to the modern Tales of, Symphonia offers a 3D world map to be explored in the third person which, although sparse and decidedly retro, was a pleasure to see again. The work on the secondary missions, the secret collectibles and, above all, the dungeons, is more than appreciable, especially thanks to the presence of fairly challenging environmental puzzles and puzzles. Thanks to well-written dialogues translated into good Italian, to the memorable soundtrack by Motoi Sakuraba and a cast among the best characterized in the JRPG field, Tales of Symphonia remains a highly recommended title if you missed it at the time and have not taken advantage of the editions published over the years, but perhaps this is precisely why we would have expected a most prestigious review.", "date": "2023-02-15", "grade": "7.0"}
