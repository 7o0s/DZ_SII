{"name": "SOCOM: Confrontation - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/socom-confrontation-recensione.html", "text": "SOCOM had the merit of clearing online multiplayer for PlayStation 2 users, as well as the use of the headset for voice commands and communication with other players. The first episode of the series, released in 2002, offered gameplay based as much on stealth elements (the same ones that had decreed the success of Siphon Filter on PSone) as on strategy. In fact, to complete the missions, it was necessary not only to manage one's own character, but also to issue orders to a certain number of companions capable of offering cover and support during the various phases of the action. The developers of Zipper Interactive have adopted a conservative approach, as often happens when a product is enjoying a certain success, and so the subsequent episodes have seen only marginal improvements, in terms of weapon management and multiplayer modes, leaving a technical sector almost unchanged anything but dazzling. It has therefore been for some years now that fans of the series have been asking for a renewal, awaiting the transition to the nextgen with trepidation. Hard to say if SOCOM: Confrontation is what they wanted, given its particular nature: devoid of any ~story~ mode, the game offers only online multiplayer through seven different modes, for up to thirty-two players at the same time. Question of modality Once the game has been installed on the hard disk via a special application (mandatory operation, which requires about 3 GB of free space), the Confrontation main menu allows us to start a quick game or adjust the parameters for a personalized session. You can also use an editor to change your character's appearance, both in terms of facial features and skin color, as well as the shades of the camouflage uniform. The operation must be carried out twice, given that depending on the case we will find ourselves controlling a special forces agent or an unscrupulous mercenary. As mentioned above, there are seven modes at our disposal, with almost complete coverage of the various possibilities. The ~Breach~ mode sees the commandos engaged in the destruction of a target located in the territory of the mercenaries, therefore in the role of the ~good guys~ we will have to make our way inside a structure and plant a bomb, or alternatively eliminate all the members of the opposing team. In the shoes of the ~bad guys~, on the other hand, we will have to defend the goal with all the resources available, until time runs out. Almost all modes do not provide for respawn when playing ranked games, so in case of elimination we will have to limit ourselves to being spectators until the match ends. ~Control~ is a ~territorial~ type match in which the objective is to take control of the largest number of sensitive points within the map. There are five areas to guard in all, and when time runs out, the team that has conquered the most, or the surviving one, will win. In the ~Escort~ mode, the commandos have to escort a certain number of important people to the extraction point, preventing them from being killed by the mercenaries. The game ends in favor of the ~good guys~ if at least two out of three VIPs are saved or if the enemy team is completely eliminated. It is possible to order VIPs to follow us by pressing the X button, and in the same way they can be ordered to stop while we monitor the situation. A similar situation occurs in the ~Extraction~ mode, where you always have to escort some VIPs but only after having freed them from the clutches of the mercenaries. Things get more difficult, therefore, as to free the hostages you must necessarily make your way into the enemy's hideout. If we control the ~bad guys~, the game boils down to a defensive ambush with orders to shoot anything that moves until time runs out. The ~Demolition~ mode corresponds in some ways to the classic ~capture the flag~: there is an explosive in the center of the map and our team's goal is to recover it and place it in a strategic point. Clearly, it is possible to eliminate the character who collected the explosive to get hold of it, so the teams have to do a lot of cover work to be able to end the game successfully. The last two modes, ~Suppression~ and ~Elimination~, are classic death matches that differ in the possibility, in the first case, of activating (finally!) the respawn. With the respawn active, the victory goes to the team that at the end of the time has totaled the highest number of kills, otherwise the one who survives wins. Feeling and gameplay Harassed by more or less serious bugs, which made am. players very nervousericans and possibly the reason why the European release has been delayed by a few months, SOCOM: Confrontation is sold in shops individually or bundled with the official Sony headset for PlayStation 3. On first launch, the game requires the installation of the latest patch available and therefore protects us from most of the problems encountered so far by US users. Unfortunately, however, the ~presentation~ factor has been decidedly neglected by the guys at Slant Six Games (the team that took over from Zipper Interactive for the development of this first ~nextgen~ episode of the series), given the lack of any tutorial that can make us familiarity with the control system and with the game structure before launching into online multiplayer: given the time advantage of American players, the first sessions thus end up literally turning into a massacre against us. Beyond the good technical realization, which we will examine in the next paragraph, Confrontation does not make who knows what changes to the gameplay compared to the historical standards of the franchise and therefore is terribly backward when compared to any third person shooter for PS3. Guilty, any ambush system is missing: once behind a shelter, in order to be able to see the enemy we will have to tilt the Dual Shock 3 (which in this case lends its motion sensors to the cause) or come out dangerously in the open. Before each mission it is possible to select the desired equipment (primary weapon, secondary weapon, grenade, etc.), with a clear difference in terms of results if you have the cunning and experience necessary to choose the right weapon for that particular situation. As usual, the approach of the game is ~realistic~, that is, a blow to the head or a short burst is enough to be eliminated, although an arcade solution has been adopted for the vital energy system, with the classic energy bar placed at the bottom of the screen. Technical realization The graphics are generally well done, with a large number of polygons on the screen and some complexity in the design of the maps. Moving your character within urban scenarios gives a certain satisfaction; satisfaction that unfortunately diminishes as soon as the situation gets a little complicated, with the frame rate feeling the pinch and revealing all the fragility of the engine. The extension of the maps varies according to the size of the match, this means that in 16 vs 16 matches we will be able to count on larger environments but we will also have to deal with a series of still unsolved bugs that afflict the online component of the experience. and that during the most crowded matches they don't fail to show up. The polygonal models appear detailed at first, only to reveal their flaws when the character is knocked down and lying on the ground in unlikely positions. The animations are well done (the run was rendered very well) but they definitely lack variety, while the interactivity with the environment is limited to a minimum where instead it promised who knows what. The sound is a bit too sparse, with music reduced to a minimum and realistic effects but not of great impact. The screen texts and dialogues are in Italian, the localization is well made. Comment Given the presence of only multiplayer modes and the low retail price, SOCOM: Confrontation appears almost like the expansion of a game that never existed on PlayStation 3. Fans of the series have been waiting for the transition to the ~nextgen~ for a long time, but they certainly could not have imagined such a result, in which disappointment reigns supreme. Without the backbone made up of the single player, which has always been of great substance in SOCOM, we are faced with a meager product, devoid of so many solutions that at least could have guaranteed an enjoyable experience (a minimum of training, the presence of modes that provide for respawn even in ranked matches, etc.) as well as elements that have been the rule for years and not the exception for third person shooters, such as the ability to lurk. The initial impact with the game modes (which despite being seven do not guarantee a great variety of situations) is very discouraging, the combat system tastes old and the technical realization appears excellent only at a superficial glance. Finally, the most crowded games are marred by a series of still unsolved problems and bugs, so much so that it is better not to think about what the game was like without the various patches. Only recommended for those who have just finished playing the latest episode of SOCOM on PS2 and are literally dying to play online with the benefits offered by PSN.
