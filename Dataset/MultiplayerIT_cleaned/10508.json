{"name": "Fuoco", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/70731-against-the-fire-fuoco-fuochino-o-acqua.html", "text": "Developed by Meridian, Against the Fire! puts the user in the shoes of Andrew, a young and very unfortunate firefighter: during his first day of service, in fact, a terrible fire breaks out inside a hotel, and it's up to him only to deal with it since his older colleagues are all busy elsewhere. A storyline that may not be revolutionary, but which certainly serves as a valid expedient for a simple and intuitive action game: now let's see if Against the Fire! manages to go beyond the simple hit-and-run divertissement. Fight fire with water From the first glance, it is clear how the developers of Meridian have not deviated in a particular way from their previous work, or the very successful Alive4Ever, capable of entering the top 10 of the most downloaded games in relation to its release period. In that case you had to fight against hordes of zombies, while in Against the Fire! it is necessary to use a hydrant to extinguish the fireballs that roam the various stages, but in terms of play mechanics little or nothing has changed: counting on the presence of two virtual analog sticks in the lower part of the screen, the one on the left is used to move the character, and the one on the right to direct the jet of water. In short, the setting is different, but Against the Fire! it basically plays like Alive4Ever, although there are a couple of features to differentiate them. In the title subject of this review, the primary purpose of each stage is to recover the survivors present and bring them to the exit in the shortest possible time, taking care not to end up burned during the work. Handy arrows around Andrew indicate the direction to follow to reach the unfortunate ones on duty: however, as the adventure progresses, the scenarios become more and more complex, requiring the user a considerable effort of memory in the advanced stages to remember the way. Against the Fire! counts on the beauty of 50 levels of progressive difficulty, at the end of which a score is assigned mainly based on the speed of execution of the rescue. Of course, even the number of extinguished fires has its importance, and it is no coincidence that scattered here and there are power-ups that guarantee an enhanced jet of water for a short period of time: not only that, there are also bonuses capable of triggering the turbo in Andrew's movements, or the more common ones useful for restoring portions of energy or quantity of oxygen. Entertaining at first, Against the Fire! increasingly highlights the limits of its play structure as the stages progress: the rather bland pace of play does not help certainly in this sense, making the last levels more of an agony than a pastime, given the slowness with which Andrew traverses the rooms in search of survivors. Then there is a serious factor of challenge that goes beyond obtaining the best evaluation at the end of each scenario: completing the missions is far too easy, and not everyone craves the idea of breaking their records for simple sport. The technical realization does not help to improve the evaluation of the Meridian title much, also settling on non-exceptional standards. In short, for 79 cents you can't expect a masterpiece, but on the AppStore there are still several much better products at the same price range.
