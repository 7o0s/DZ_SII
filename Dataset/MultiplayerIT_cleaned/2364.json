Praise must be given to the style of Namco, capable of performing an excellent restyling job on a title released three years ago, and which instead can now enjoy settings and characters that are more beautiful to look at, thanks to the use of a higher number of polygons compared to the original. Just take a look at the textures and special effects present in the game and above all in the bonus missions (obtainable after completing the Story Mode) called Crisis Mission and specially developed for the PS2, to be convinced of how the aforementioned work can certainly be considered more how satisfying. We are finally pleased, then, to note how the much universally hated jaggies (well-known by now with the name of aliasing) are practically non-existent in this DVD, unlike what could be seen in its NTSC version instead. As for the sound sector, it must be said that it is honestly average, with effects such as shots and explosions that do their duty, and with discreet background music mostly taken from the first episode of the series. We have already mentioned the dubbing, and it seems useless to rage, even if to tell the truth, it deserves it. TWO IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN ONE As almost everyone knows, what made the difference in Time Crisis was a new and original game structure, which in some ways differed from everything that had been seen in the gun games of previous years. Naturally, TC2 also shares the same structure. The action is seen subjectively, as are the movements, which however are completely automatic. As before, you can press a key to be able to take cover behind obstacles and reload the gun. The novelty of this sequel is the simultaneous presence of two characters. In fact, now, playing single-player, our colleague will join us throughout the adventure, but, being managed by the CPU, his contribution will be more choreographic, given his inability to score even a single shot. The beauty is that you can now participate in the action from different angles, depending on the agent we will play. This gives way to the Story Mode (taken from the coin-op) not to always present the same enemies in front of us and always in the same sequence, which otherwise would have greatly shortened the longevity of this title. Yep, longevity. This is precisely the key point of Time Crisis 2. Playing the main mode at the preset difficulty level, i.e. ~normal~, it takes yes and no half an hour to complete it. The credits available are not in a fixed number, but variable, or rather, they can be increased, to be precise by one for each game over, until they are unlimited in a short time. And this is certainly the only gross mistake made by Namco in this conversion. To this we must add a too high number of lives (or energy, if you prefer), which however fortunately can be modified, and the fact that, unlike in the past, the time factor influences the player's choices in an almost nothing, since the expiry of it, instead of ending the game, brings the negligible consequence of the loss of one of the aforementioned lives. And in a shooter called ~Time Crisis~ 2, the latter really seems like a huge mistake. Luckily the programmers have at least seen fit to insert a new mode made especially for the PS2, namely the already mentioned Crisis Mission, or rather particular game situations with certain objectives to complete. These missions, in addition to other minor bonus subgames, make you want to watch this DVD again sooner or later once Story Mode is over. Another relevant novelty, certainly very welcome, is the possibility of playing, again single-handedly, but with two pistols at the same time; one in the left hand and one in the right hand, just like in the best western movies, so to speak. Given therefore the confirmed full compatibility with the old type G-con [but that it is exclusively the original, as far as I know from personal tests ;(( ], it shouldn't be too difficult to get a second gun to be able to try at least one turn the thrill of this beautiful innovation by Namco.And if you are the lucky owner of a nice 28-inch TV, you can take full advantage of the two-player cooperative mode via split-screen, in which the second player takes on the role of the other agent. Below 28~ it is advisable to leave the vertical division aloneof the screen reduces too drastically the area in which it will be necessary to shoot. As usual, the idea of the i-link (present here) is interesting, but difficult to implement in practice. FOR MANY BUT NOT FOR EVERYONE So what to say ultimately about a game that many of us have probably been waiting for since 1998? Well, once again due appreciation for the work done by Namco, we must remember however that this is certainly not the DVD suitable for being inserted into the PS2 and then left there for whole weeks. Its longevity, in fact, despite the modifiable difficulty, stands at low levels. Sure, it's not easy to imagine a shooting that has infinite playability, but here it could definitely have been done better. The advice is therefore, to buy Time Crisis only if you already own a Guncon (so that you can still exploit it adequately), or if you are a fan of this kind of videogames, and you have enough money to be able to afford the package that also includes the new (and improved) pistol model. Pros: Great graphics Namco worthy gameplay Well done special missions Well thought out GunCon 2 Cons: Limited longevity Poorly done split-screen Ridiculous voice acting THOSE WHO DO NOT DIE SEE IT AGAIN The first episode of Time Crisis was converted for the domestic market thanks to the publication that it had on the PSone. The same, however, did not happen for the sequel, released in '98 in the arcade. This is because its graphic complexity and the particular two-player mode made Namco intelligently fall back at another time towards a conversion on hardware powerful enough to fully show the desirability of this Time Crisis 2. The plot, given the type of game, it is very simple, and perhaps, I would even say trivial. Told by graphically poor cutscenes and horribly dubbed speech (to say the least) in Italian, it begins with the kidnapping of a young lady named Christy by a criminal organization ready to take over the world (but go?!) , called Neodyne. Thus, it will be up to us to play the role of one of the two agents, Robert and Keith, sent there together to cover for each other, with the intention of thwarting the plans of the villain of the moment, a certain Ernesto Diaz, and of a found Wild Dog. more evil than before.", "date": "2001-11-12", "grade": null}
