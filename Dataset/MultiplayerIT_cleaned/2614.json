{"name": "Basketball Arena", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/basketball-arena-recensione.html", "text": "If you have tried Head Ball 2, the previous Masomo mobile game, the Basketball Arena review will certainly sound familiar to you. The English team, in the best tradition of the genre, has in fact taken a successful formula and tried to expand its personal universe by applying it to a different sporting discipline, in this case basketball. The differences, however, are not limited to the sport practiced by characters with huge heads and ~flying~ limbs, in the classic Rayman style, that we find in the game. In fact, peculiar, almost strategic mechanics have been introduced in order to make the gameplay less obvious, building the inevitable progressive structure made up of athletes, crates and upgrades to unlock around this system. Gameplay After completing a very short tutorial, the gameplay of Basketball Arena is confirmed as particularly immediate. Using a very fast and effective matchmaking we will in fact be able to challenge many opponents in frenetic one-on-one matches, in which whoever scores the most points within the time limit wins. Simple, isn't it? The touch controls recall in many ways those of Brawlhalla-style productions, we are therefore talking about a platform setting to which simple ball physics has been applied and the strategic elements we mentioned at the beginning, which limit and to determine our shooting ability. The traditional rules of basketball apply, with two or three point shots depending on the area of the field in which we launch, but there is obviously a lot of emphasis on tackles to steal the ball from the opponent, rebounds and quick shots : each of these actions consumes a notch of energy and forces us to finalize as quickly as possible. Then there are some interesting extras, such as the special powers: they are unlocked like all the other elements of the game, therefore by grinding games or through microtransactions, and allow you to obtain substantial advantages to be used at the right time: reducing the opponent to a sheet of ice , throw him an explosive balloon, become invisible for a few seconds, and so on. Structure and technical realization The structure of the Basketball Arena is presented in a traditional way, with the inevitable mix of events, leagues and Season Passes to maximize rewards. The entire progression system refers to blockbusters such as Clash Royale for the enhancement and unlocking of new characters (divided into three categories as they become more performing: Rookie, Pro and Superstar) via card, with also the classic four slots for the opening of the crates. It is possible to play for free without major problems, at least until you reach a point in the ~league~ where the opponents start to get a little too strong to have hopes without our roster making a leap in quality . The pay-to-win implications, from this point of view, are unfortunately inevitable and it will be interesting to understand how developers will be able to maintain a minimum degree of balance to protect users who have no intention of spending. However, there are enough facets to guarantee interest in the long run: in addition to the many unlockable characters, with different characteristics, it is possible to hire new coaches to expand the team and transform the experience in this way. The risk is in fact that of an excessive repetitiveness of the action, and from this point of view a lot depends on your enthusiasm for basketball. As far as the technical realization is concerned, the graphic style takes up that of the aforementioned Head Ball 2, therefore it is recognizable although perhaps not exactly refined: the animations of the ~flying~ limbs are what they are, but the mix of colors and details, together with the arenas that are becoming increasingly populated and rich, help to satisfy the eye.", "date": "2021-02-10", "grade": "7.2"}
