If Mighty Flip Champs! and Mighty Milky Way were already great titles, it was Mighty Switch Force! to consecrate the ability in terms of level design of the guys from Valencia: in the end, Mighty Switch Force! it was just that, a concentrate of level design. With a lovely character design. And a rather ingenious use of 3D. Okay, there was something more that made that funny hybrid between a puzzle and a platformer irresistible, to the point of convincing Nintendo to convert it for Wii U in the form of the high resolution Hyperdrive Edition. A port that solved some problems, starting with the poor longevity of the original title: expect further evolution with this Mighty Switch Force! 2 was lawful, but things didn't all go the right way... D.I.A.F. With her policewoman's uniform hanging on the nail, the protagonist of the series, Patricia Wagon, is wearing a new one: that of a firefighter. It's his new job, and as a result there's a pump replacing the laser pistol on the first Mighty Switch Force! while the source of his troubles remained the same, the Hooligan sisters. In this sequel, however, we won't have to arrest them, but rather save them from the fires in which they were trapped. The pump, therefore, becomes our new magic wand: it allows us to extinguish outbreaks and eliminate some enemies, but also to destroy some blocks of mud, dissolving them, or to push some little monsters into traps. It therefore performs more or less the same function as the laser pistol in the first episode, immediately underlining the first both positive and negative characteristic of Mighty Switch Force! 2, and that is that at times it is much, too similar to its prequel. The new puzzles are ingenious, but the game almost seems to introduce them as soon as possible, only to bring them back in the final stages, just when they are about to get really interesting. Among the new puzzles, we particularly liked those that require you to create a path through which to slide the water jet of our pump, so that it reaches a specific point. All the others, however, we have already seen in the first Mighty Switch Force! and we have to admit that we were quite disappointed by the lack of creativity demonstrated by WayForward. The wooden blocks to direct flaming enemies towards? Already seen. Some stages even appear to be copied sprite by sprite from the prequel, and a fan of the series will need only one glance to solve the seemingly more complicated puzzles. Mighty Switch Force! 2 is a great example of game design, but it's too similar to the previous episode Short but intense Naturally, the possibility of moving some blocks by pressing the back button of the Nintendo 3DS also returns, but also in this case it is a feature already seen and abundantly used in the prequel, and which in Mighty Switch Force! 2 soon loses bite and originality. Fortunately, the first levels of the adventure assume that the player already knows what he's getting into, consequently their complexity and general difficulty level are a little higher than the incipit of the first Might Switch Force! Newbies might be a little taken aback, but everything is very clear and within a few minutes you will immediately understand how to use the pump and solve the various puzzles which, assembled in sequence, will form the most intriguing levels. Nonetheless, Mighty Switch Force! 2 carries with it the worst flaw of the prequel: the duration. Again we are dealing with sixteen levels, and if you already know the mechanics of the series and the philosophy of its puzzles, it takes just under three hours to complete them all. To increase longevity we should think of the newborns hidden in each level, to be saved ... in kicks, and the slightly retro idea of completing each stage again with the simple purpose of beating your own record. The problem is that there isn't a leaderboard that allows you to compare it with the times of the other players, so it becomes quite an operation in itself. Nothing to say, however, on the technical side: this WayForward production is also striking for the great care placed in the somewhat vintage technical realization: very colorful and well-animated sprites, engaging and lively tunes, captivating illustrations and very nice characters.", "date": "2013-07-19", "grade": "7.3"}
