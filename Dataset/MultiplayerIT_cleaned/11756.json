You don't get mind-boggling numbers, but it allows you to make money without major economic efforts, exploiting intellectual property with a relatively low value because it has been out of the market for years. After all, producing new triple A games has become very expensive, so not everyone can afford to attack that sector... in fact, many don't even want to do it, due to the risks it entails and the fact that even many ~rich~ publishers are fleeing from it ran away, plunging into predatory economic models that allow you to make much more money with less effort. So over the years we are having more and more reissues, remakes and remasters, which if you like are also indicative of the creative stagnation that the sector is experiencing (but this, as they say, is another story). In such a picture, it is not surprising to have to write the review of Zool Redimensioned in 2021, a remastered edition of an old platformer that caused a furor on the Amiga, which lay in the cemetery of forgotten franchises. A bit of history The levels are the same as the original Zool, but revised and corrected Zool: Ninja of the ~Nth~ Dimension was released in 1992 by Gremlin Graphics. George Allan, the programmer of the game, tells in the book ~Commodore Amiga: A Visual Compendium~, that ~Zool was born when Ian (Stewart, one of the founders of Gremlin Graphics ed) saw the scrolling demo I was working on after Switchblade II. I he teamed up with graphic designer Ade Carless and it didn't take long to get the preliminary game design in. It's just a collecting game inspired by Mario and Sonic, although I can't even remember if I played at the time or less Sonic.~ Although it was already the 90s, it was not uncommon for video games, especially in the West, to be born from technical experimentation. Amigans were hungry for a fast platformer that recalled Sega's title and Allan had the right scrolling to make it happen at the right time. The writer played Zool at the time and loved him dearly, despite all his flaws. Overall it was a well-made platformer, made by a well-known and appreciated programmer on the European scene, who had in his portfolio some well-loved action titles such as Venus: The Flytrap and the aforementioned Switchblade II (the original was not his). For this reason, the first adventure of the ninja of dimension N did not struggle to enter the imagination of us convinced Amigans, who immediately praised it as the masterpiece that it was not and gave it a piece of our memory, also encouraged by the sector magazines, which they incensed quite a bit. Zool gameplay today Zool levels are full of secrets Zool Redimensioned is like a big patch that came out almost thirty years too late. It's the work of someone who has read all the retro gaming forums where the game is mentioned and, after compiling a wish list from old fans, has put his hand to the code to create the perfect version. In fact, it would be enough to list all the new features to write the review, because each of them is the answer to some request that can be found in the discussions between enthusiasts. The gameplay itself remains that of a classic 2D platformer, with a fairly fast pace, with levels and enemies from surreal settings (a mode of sweets, one of musical instruments, one full of toys and so on) but now the shot is much wider and immediately shows a more substantial part of the area in which we are; Zool can double jump, which helps a lot in certain situations; the physics has been revised to make the controls less slippery and the graphics of the parallactic levels have been redone to avoid the loss of readability, which was another downfall of some versions of the game. The difficulty is much lower than the 1992 title, due to the enlarged shot It should be emphasized that the starting point is not the Amiga version, but the Megadrive one, a fact that will make more than one person turn up their noses. In addition to those listed, all the other changes have been aimed at improving accessibility, i.e. making life easier for new players (who will probably ignore it, but it's always effective to give yourself a contemporary tone even when you're performing an operation blatantly nostalgic). For example the levels have been revised to make the action smoother; Achievement-related collectibles have been added, and it's now possible to restart from the level reached, even after exiting the game, instead of always having to start from scratch. If desired, there is also a hardcore mode, which follows that of the original Zool, pensata for players who don't want to give in to the comforts of modern life (but will have to anyway because some changes are unavoidable). What is not working A more marked graphic update would have been welcome Overall Zool Redimensioned works, and this is its biggest problem. Stripped of its time and the original desire of an aging generation, what remains, despite the changes, is a well-crafted platformer, with well-crafted levels, uninspiring bosses and a general direction without particular flashes. what is missing most of all is the ~technical fact~ that generated it: that desire to evolve technology, making possible what was considered impossible, building a game around it with joy, shamelessness and a great underlying ingenuity. It was a formula that made it possible to create miraculous products, but also enormous crap. The bottom line is that Zool was a good game and Zool Redimensioned remains a good game. Those CD-Roms were modern objects at the time, today they are vintage objects (or almost) The problem is that in the meantime all of his models have evolved, perhaps even worsened, but they have rendered the outward gaze that had generated it empty, stripping it. What remains is an old horn gramophone dusted and repaired for fans of vintage objects, a video game antique that stops saying something as soon as you start considering it for what it should be and never will be. Ultimately , Zool Redimensioned is certainly an enjoyable and well-conceived platformer, which will appeal to lovers of retrogaming and the history of video games forgotten or ignored by the masses. Its qualities are undeniable and the remastering operation done by Sumo Digital Academy has substantially succeeded, for what that may mean.", "date": "2021-08-18", "grade": "7.0"}
