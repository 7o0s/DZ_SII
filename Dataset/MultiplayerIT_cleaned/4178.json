{"name": "Hello Neighbor 2: la recensione del ritorno del misterioso vicino", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hello-neighbor-2-recensione.html", "text": "Initially Hello Neighbor was intended to be a one-off title, but after its success with around 2 million copies sold, Dynamic Pixels and Eerie Guest Studios came up with the idea of creating a sequel. The first chapter was very immature, but the idea behind it was interesting, so much so that it also became a fun content for streamers and content creators. The announcement of Hello Neighbor 2 has therefore aroused a lot of curiosity about how both the story and the game mechanics could evolve. While the storyline has been enriched by comics and novels off the screen, the mysterious neighbor has continued to hide his secrets. In this way we had the opportunity to find out more about Mr. Peterson and we returned to sneak into apartments in search of the truth. In our review of Hello Neighbor 2 we will tell you about our escapes and our discoveries, but above all about how Mr. Peterson has not been our only problem. Old habits never die Quentin returns to investigate the neighbor's life in Hello Neighbor 2 Being a sequel with a small time leap compared to the first chapter, Hello Neighbor 2 keeps the general structure of the game unchanged. As journalist Quentin we are back on the hunt for news of the mysterious disappearances of children in the town of Raven Brooks and guess with what purpose? That's right, discovering the secrets of our ~friend~ Mr. Peterson. We can say that the hatred towards us hasn't subsided like our desire to sneak into his property: these two factors, strangely, still don't make him friendly at all, ready to track us down and drive us off his property. But the thirst for truth is relentless and even at the cost of being kicked out repeatedly the mystery must be revealed. The stealth dynamics remain intact as in the first video game and all the gameplay focuses on sneaking into apartments in search of clues that can explain the mystery that hovers over this creepy town. After a short introductory film and a sudden encounter with the neighbor, Hello Neighbor 2 begins, introducing us to the mechanics with a small environmental puzzle, one of the many present and which characterize the gameplay. Raven Brooks Mystery In Hello Neighbor 2 we are not the only ones investigating Mr. Peterson Our adventure begins exactly as we left it and the first objective is Mr. Peterson's house, this time manned by a policeman, theoretically intent on patrolling the sequestered area after reports received for suspicious activities. The first puzzles are quite basic and show some improvements over the illogicality found in the first chapter. In Hello Neighbor 2 with a minimum of exploration and attention to detail we have never run into difficult puzzles to solve, finally easy to understand, leaving the only difficulty trying not to be discovered. To make everything more usable, the objects with which you can interact are reduced to the bone and are exclusively those necessary to progress in the mission or to capture the attention of the enemy on duty, such as the alarm clocks scattered throughout the rooms. No more chairs to throw at the angry Mr. Peterson in an attempt to block him, this time we just had to rely on the right timing in hiding. As in the first Hello Neighbor, Quentin can rely on his bag with tools such as scissors and crowbar to be able to interact with barred doors and cobwebs. The drone camera is added to the investigator's arsenal in this second chapter, an interesting idea but which does not find real use in the dynamics of the game. Although ideal for monitoring the movements of the owner of the house we are sneaking into, very often it is decidedly more practical and immediate to rely on the ~hit and run~ tactic, hiding at regular intervals once we have learned the patrols carried out by the characters. A town full of secrets The neighbor is no longer our only goal and in Hello Neighbor 2 we visited other wacky characters Hello Neighbor 2 not only implements small innovations, but is also longer lasting than its predecessor, although it will take you about 3 hours to complete it. The trick to extend the duration lies in exploring more houses and buildings apparently belonging to people involved in the mystery of the disappearance of children from Raven Brooks. Although the exploration of the neighborhood is rather free, the apartments to be explored are unlocked only by following a rigid progression imposed by the game. After solving all puzzlesinside Mr. Peterson's house we will discover that to get to the solution of this plot we have to visit our neighbor, now camped in the decaying museum of the town. After the first raid, the real progression of the game begins, preceded by a flashback that tries to reveal some secrets about this cryptic story. Upon awakening we always find ourselves inside Quentin's headquarters and the many cameras pointed at Raven Brooks show us which character we will have to visit before trying again to break into the museum. We have three objectives: the pastry chef, the old gentleman who lives in the suburbs and the mayor. In each house there is a fundamental object to be able to continue inside the museum. The puzzles will become slightly more complex as you continue through the game, up to those present in the luxurious villa of the mayor who will require multiple objects in order to unlock the mechanisms inside. New neighbors, same problems In addition to a not exactly intelligent AI, the puzzles present in Hello Neighbor 2 have not proved to be well thought out Hello Neighbor 2 was announced with some important promises from the developers, namely an AI capable of studying our behavior in the game and able to put us to the test. Unfortunately, these words have been disregarded and the problems of artificial intelligence that afflicted the first chapter also recur forcefully in the sequel. The AI does not seem to have received particular improvements and makes the experience quite frustrating in some moments, especially in the final stages of the game. Inside the museum where the neighbor is holed up, for example, there are sections with the floor that are unavoidable in some situations and creak that will immediately attract Mr. Peterson's attention even if he is very far away. Not having a choice of path, also due to a restricted game environment, makes some portions of the game unnecessarily unfunny, simply forcing us to run away to try again. Even in the event that we are discovered there is no real penalty; Quentin is thrown out and we will have to start the exploration again with a rather close checkpoint and in most cases keeping the objects collected shortly before. Graphic upgrade Hello Neighbor 2, although plagued by technical problems, has undergone a nice graphic upgrade However, what can be seen from the start of the game is the important graphical improvement that Hello Neighbor 2 has received. The cartoony art style manages to give the product a modern look and the work done on the lighting makes the game world lively. The Raven Brooks neighborhood, although not very extensive, is full of details but the houses that can be visited are only those useful for the progression of the adventure. The interiors of the houses, on the other hand, are rather bland and with repeated assets, which do not stand out for their originality. In some structures it is also possible to see windows that are not perfectly aligned which created some problems for us to pass them. All this is accompanied by a lack of polish in the hitboxes too, getting stuck between objects more often than we thought during our attempts to escape. The general feeling is the same experienced with the first Hello Neighbor: a good gameplay idea but with a technical realization that leaves something to be desired. The graphics and the quality of the interlude videos remain only a small successful aspect that collides with too many untreated details, making us think of a game packaged a little too hastily.", "date": "2023-01-08", "grade": "5.0"}
