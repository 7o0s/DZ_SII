As you can see, over the last few months we have told you many times about the strategic Splash Damage, a long and exhaustive path that can take us up to today, the day in which we can finally publish the review of Gears Tactics on Xbox Series X. This very interesting Gears spin-off will also be available from November 10 on Xbox One and Xbox Series S, so don't worry: no one will be left out. However, you will have to wait a little longer to get reassurances about the less powerful Xbox versions but since it is a strategic game, although graphically very nice, we expect a generally high quality standard, without compatibility problems that could affect its high technical rate. While we wait to try the game on other platforms as well, let's try to understand again what Gears Tactics is, what its strengths and weaknesses are, what technical features Xbox Series X users will benefit from and what new features will be made available in the next few days, this time for all versions in circulation. Natural affinity Exactly as we wrote on the occasion of the debut on Windows platforms, Gears Tactics represents an excellent starting point of which we would like to see a new chapter soon, or at least an expansion that enriches its simple but successful formula. Gears Tactics takes the gameplay of the XCOM masterpiece to make Gears of War a full-fledged strategy game. Transforming such a tight action into such a reflective genre might seem like an extreme idea, yet the introductory mission is enough to take note of a natural affinity between the two versions of the game. The greatest point of convergence between the Gears action game and the strategic one is undoubtedly the great weight that the cover system has, an element usually essential even in tactical games, including XCOM. Even the simple subdivision of weapons that has always distinguished the series is well suited to the strategic counterpart, especially if an object such as the Lancer and its close combat capabilities find space in the group. Ultimately, there is no better intellectual property than the one created by Epic in 2006 to attempt a transition like the one managed by Splash Damage, and the results can be seen. Here comes Jack the Robot! Gears Tactics knows its stuff, despite some flaws that the developers have tried to smooth out by offering in this incarnation a renewed version of the original campaign, much more varied and fun than the one available since its PC debut, which took place in April 2020. variety was basically the only weak point of this production, built around a rather schematic development that made the last few hours of the game all too repetitive. On consoles, but soon all this will also arrive on PC in the form of a free update, it is possible to face the same story with some precious innovations: the presence of Jack The Robot among our units, one of the most original protagonists of Gears 5, and new enemies that will bring multipliers and special rules to the battlefield that can add another tactical layer to the product. Jack The Robot is not just any unit added in a hurry, but just like the other characters he can count on a rich selection of skills that will allow for profound customization. For example, it can give the entire team a consistent bonus to accuracy, or focus on a single character in order to increase his stats in a more substantial way than it would have done to the entire group; whoever wants can set Jack to make him more effective in defense or in attack, unlocking and enhancing functions such as the Barrier or the Shield. Jack can also be used for excellent diversions: among the many we particularly appreciated the attraction mine capable of attracting enemies and exploding immediately afterwards, inflicting enormous damage on all those who will be fooled by its mesmerizing sound, and the hijack mode that will turn a threat into a valuable ally. As it is easy to understand, the presence of Jack The Robot and his abilities would risk making the new campaign much easier than the classic one, for this reason waves of enemies have been added that are immune to certain types of attack, or with characteristics that force you to radically change the rules of engagement in order not to succumb to their special blows. The result is not so much a more difficult campaign, but certainly much more varied in the individual missions, which still remain distrebuted in a very schematic way. A step forward, of course, but above all for those who have already had the opportunity to play Gears Tactics in its original form and who will now have one more excuse to face the challenge all over again, rather than for those who will approach this strategic game for the first time . This is also why the new mode is only available once the first, more balanced one is finished. Veterans and newcomers Microsoft was right to keep this exclusive in the garage until the arrival of the new Xboxes, because it is an excellent game but above all one of the very few first party novelties available on the next gen, whose launch is mainly characterized by precious updates dedicated to games that users have probably already enjoyed in the past, as in the case of Gears 5, Sea of Thieves and Forza Horizon. A game that offers always very fast-paced missions, with waves of enemies that will often continue indefinitely if not interrupted, for example by throwing a grenade into one of the holes typical of the series. Among the most appreciated features, the absence of a grid which usually divides the squares in which to move in turn-based strategy games, and the presence of a function that allows the units to keep a particular area under control in order to protect it from the passage of any enemies. All features that allow the gameplay of Gears Tactics to proceed much faster than in other similar games, in order to make it fresh for strategy veterans and at the same time more digestible for those who don't frequent the genre much. Power X Graphically speaking, the game looks more beautiful and vivid than ever on Xbox Series X. From the point of view of detail it does not differ much from what is appreciated and played on PC with maximum settings, but the image generally appears sharper and HDR expresses much more vivid colors than what has already been experienced on a computer. The game, for those equipped with compatible screens, can also be pushed to 120fps even if we are still talking about a strategic one, so the frames per second are important but up to a certain point. On Xbox Series X it is possible to play Gears Tactics both through mouse and keyboard, peripherals that the console will recognize an instant after having connected them to the USB ports, and through the classic pad. Strangely, Microsoft had embargoed the considerations on the latter and, while respecting the decision, we never understood why, after all, compatibility is total and the mapping of the commands does not present particular solutions that distance the functions from what already seen with console versions of other similar strategy games.", "date": "2020-11-05", "grade": "8.2"}
