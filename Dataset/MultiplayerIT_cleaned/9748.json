Last Window, a direct sequel to Hotel Dusk: Room 215, opens not by chance with an escalation of misfortunes: immediately after being fired from the Red Crown, Kyle learns that the Cape West, the condominium in which he has lived for some is about to be sold, that he has a mountain of unpaid arrears and that a stalker is carrying out research on him. Just when he prepares for the idea of having to pack his bags and leave the apartment, however, a mystery related to the building's past resurfaces from nowhere, thus forcing the protagonist to improvise again as a detective and shed light on an unexpected and disturbing case. And, to be on the safe side, Cing wanted to re-propose the same formula as the first chapter, made up of wonderful noir shades, very expressive artwork and a narrative that loudly claims a prima donna role. A fictional adventure Last Window is set only one year after the events told in Hotel Dusk but, leaving out some sporadic references, it can be played easily even by those who have never approached the series before. The place has changed, the characters as well, but the structure has remained the same, and the events alternate again in a single large building inhabited by the rest of the characters. The DS must once again be held as if it were a book, with the map of the condominium on one side and the three-dimensional environment on the other, while the developers have not even bothered to review the graphic style. Not that it's a bad thing, on the contrary: the black and white illustrations underline the noir mold of the story in a heavy but pleasant way, while the three-dimensional graphics blend very well with the very short scripted events that you often come across; it's really rare to find something out of place, or an element that clashes in a particular way with the rest. The bulk of the game, even this time, is still the interaction with the other inhabitants of the building, sometimes walking around the corridors, others blissfully closed in their rooms. Everyone has a marked and original personality, and it never happens to find a profile that is too flat or stereotyped, and indeed each of these manages to make the Los Angeles of the 80s that forms the backdrop to the story more credible and fascinating; moreover, the quantity and quality of the illustrations created by Cing's artistic team help to make everyone much more expressive and convincing. Each of these elements ensures that, unlike many other graphic adventures, it is always a pleasure to meet a character and start a long discussion. However, if on the one hand Last Window brings with it all the most intriguing, original and successful aspects of Hotel Dusk, unfortunately it also inherits some of its main defects: the plot that is the background to the game, although narrated in an exquisite way through the excellent dialogues and introspective monologues of the protagonist, is too linear. The player will not be able to clearly influence the events, which are told to him step by step, just as if he were reading a book. In this regard, the developers have once again proposed small quizzes at the end of each chapter, so as to test the player's attention and help him remember the most important events. Furthermore, the game sites gradually compose a real novel, which can be accessed at any time: written by Martin Summer, the novelist who lived in room 211 in Hotel Dusk, the text represents both a splendid way to relive the story of the Last Word, and a source of clues about some characters and situations. Then there are the puzzles, which had not already convinced us in the previous chapter and which once again are rare and not very fascinating: most of the time we find ourselves having to activate buttons or turn knobs, while a small crossword puzzle seems more elaborate that are proposed, and the most interesting puzzles have nothing to do with the originality of those proposed in Another Code. Once again one gets the impression that many of these mini-games have been inserted with force, as if to remind occasionally that it is still a graphic adventure, and not an elaborate visual novel.", "date": "2010-10-11", "grade": "7.7"}
