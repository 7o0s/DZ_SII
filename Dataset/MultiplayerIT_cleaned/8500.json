{"name": "Assassin's Creed Valhalla: L'Alba del Ragnarok", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/assassins-creed-valhalla-lalba-del-ragnarok-recensione.html", "text": "Assassin's Creed Valhalla has been an extraordinary success and at the same time has found itself occupying a delicate position for the Ubisoft franchise, halfway between the traditional chapters and the mysterious Infinity platform. It is certainly for this reason that the French house has decided to extend the post-launch support of the game beyond the canonical twelve months, launching in this case not a simple DLC but a rich and full-bodied expansion: The Dawn of Ragnarok.Using once again the narrative expedient of the visions of Eivor, the adventure takes us to Svartalfheim, one of the nine kingdoms of Norse mythology: originally inhabited by the dark elves and some dwarves, sees in the latter the only survivors of a violent invasion carried out by the armies of Muspelheim, led by the powerful and ruthless Surtr. The events arouse the attention of the Aesir, but for one reason in particular: Surtr has had Baldr, one of Odin's sons, kidnapped and is holding him prisoner somewhere on Svartalfheim. For this reason, Havi decides to cross the borders of Asgard to save him: a mission that will prove to be more insidious than expected, as we are about to tell you in the review of Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok. History Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok, Odin discusses with two dwarves As with all Assassin's Creed Valhalla DLC, the story of Dawn of Ragnarok begins in Ravensthorpe, the Viking settlement defended by Eivor: the warrior has a vision after falling asleep under his tree, finding himself once again in the role of Odin, but for a mission outside the walls of Asgard: his son Baldr has been kidnapped by Surtrs and taken to Svartalfheim. Determined to save him, the father of the gods reaches the enemy's fortress together with Frigg, Baldr's mother, but the clash with the fire giant and his evil bride, Sinmara, highlights all its limitations, with dramatic consequences. It is at this moment that Eivor wakes up with a start, immediately going to Velka so that she can help him immerse himself again in those visions. When he awakens, the Havi finds that he has been rescued by two dwarves, who tell him how Muspelheim's troops have invaded the kingdom and massacred their people, forcing the few survivors to hole up in ancient underground shelters. If Odin's mission coincides with the liberation of Svartalfheim, if his fury against Surtr should help the dwarves, so much the better. Thus our character receives a bracelet as a gift, the Predator of Hugr, which allows him to acquire five new powers, and on the strength of these unprecedented abilities, he embarks on the discovery of a scenario that includes towers and peaks to climb, fortresses to conquer and a fair variety of enemies and bosses to fight, belonging to both the Muspel and the Jotun. Fire and ice, what more could you want? Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok, Glod Also characterized this time by an excellent dubbing in Italian, an element that today is really the case to appreciate, The Dawn of Ragnarok boasts a large number of characters: some well characterized, others rather disappointing. See, for example, Glod, the half-blood son of Surtr, and the way he concludes his story: like that, without a bang, meaningless. The plot at the end has implications of a certain impact, but once again suffers from excessive haste both in direction and in the screenplay, historically unable to settle certain dialogues or to give more space to specific figures, and so their eventual departure leaves no mark. Setting Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok, a panorama of Svartalfheim Svartalfheim is clearly an abstract world, reconstructed on the basis of legends, but the design of the setting convinces and fascinates, thanks to the peculiar mix of earth, ash, forests, water and snow, huge towers and huge statues that alternate with mountains, large rocks suspended in the sky and a handful of settlements that in this case stand out for their bizarre vertical development architecture. The map itself is very large: to move around you can ride a huge deer, use fast travel from a point of interest to the other, proceed on foot or transform into a crow by exploiting the powers of Odin's bracelet. The speed in this case is not phenomenal, but by unlocking this ability at the beginning of the expansion you will be able to complete the climbs and the relative synchronizations in a few seconds, ~breaking~ the traditional gameplay of Assassin's Creed. Structure Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok, the Havi on a mountain top watches the weigh-down The structure of Dawn of Ragnarok is basically what players of Assassin's Creed Valhalla are already well used, with a series of main missions that must be completed in order to conclude the adventure, but also raids (with our fellow Vikings to help us, which frankly makes little sense...) and pretty simple side quests. There has been a lot of talk about the duration of the expansion, which however we completed in less than twelve hours. It is frankly difficult to imagine that the thirty-five hours the developers were talking about can be reached only with the side activities, but it must also be said that we were not given the time (understatement) to check this out. In any case, once the main storyline is finished we will be able to try our hand at the Arena of the Valkyries: an arena mode with clashes of variable difficulty and applicable malus to increase the rewards, with which to then buy a new set for Odin. Gameplay Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok, one of the new powers in action: allows you to freeze enemies So let's get to the gameplay: you will remember that in our preview of The Dawn of Ragnarok we had expressed our doubts to the developers regarding the expansion progression system, which is not separate and independent but takes up the character we used in the Valhalla campaign , with his power level, equipment and abilities still available. Well, we have exactly the problem we expected to find, the same one we talked about in the special dedicated to Assassin's Creed Crossover Stories: tackled as endgame content, with a protagonist of approximately level 400, The Dawn of Ragnarok unfortunately presents a very trivial degree of challenge, which does not actually suit our abilities and thus ends up nullifying the interesting work done with the introduction of divine powers of the Havi. Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok, Odin transformed into a crow flies over the scenario These five powers are unlocked by using Hugr's Predator on the corpses of some killed enemies and last a handful of seconds, with the possibility of increasing their effect and above all unlocking a second slot by spending the solar flint acquired with raids. It is only possible to equip two powers at a time, activating them with the right trigger and the left and right directions of the d-pad, but to change the setup you have to go to a dwarven refuge or acquire the skill we need on the fly. This mechanism makes perfect sense and adds a minimum of strategy to the use of powers, but we repeat: with an endgame character you will be so strong that you will hardly pay the necessary attention to such innovations. The possibility of transforming into a Muspel or a Jotun to blend in among their ranks takes on little relevance when it is enough to shoot a forest of arrows in slow motion to eliminate entire groups of enemies, weapons (including the new spear Atgeir) they deal massive damage and you have six flasks for health recovery. Assassin's Creed Valhalla: The Dawn of Ragnarok, the unhappy outcome of the first clash with Surtr Our suggestion to make sense of the experience of The Dawn of Ragnarok is therefore to intentionally depower you and deactivate your skills, however absurd this may seem to you; or enter the options and increase the difficulty level of the fights to the maximum, so as to remedy the obvious lack of a clearly wrong balance. Once this task has been completed, you will certainly be able to appreciate the different types of enemies present in the expansion, their patterns of various attacks and the numerous boss fights that you will find yourself facing during the campaign: if memory serves us there are eight of them and some of them, thanks to the involvement in the narrative, are deeply felt. The powers of Hugr's Predator Rechargeable through killings or by acquiring energy from some plants or altars, the Predator of Hugr is the bracelet that the Havi receives at the beginning of the expansion and which can give him five new powers, to be stolen from as many types of enemies. The giant crows will allow you to transform into a crow, so you can explore the scenario in an unprecedented way, while Muspel and Jotun will give you four different abilities, two for each faction: the ability to resist the touch of lava and to resurrect the dead to create a small support army on one side; the ability to teleport with arrows and freeze enemies on the other. Each of these five powers can be upgraded by blacksmiths in dwarven settlements. Graphics and sound Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok boasts very suggestive views AssAssin's Creed Valhalla is probably the open world with the best landscapes ever and matching that level of quality by designing a scenario from scratch was clearly no simple feat. Despite this, Svartalfheim certainly offers several very suggestive glimpses, the very panorama of this mixed world dominated by the roots of Yggdrasil can only fascinate and exploring it far and wide therefore confirms itself as a pleasure rather than a task. graphics of the expansion is excellent, in particular as regards the design of enemies and supporting characters, although it is possible to notice in some cases less defined textures covering the rocks and some glitches that we hope will be fixed already on day one. Little to say about the sound: we imagined a little more present music, but the accompaniment appears adequate and the aforementioned Italian dubbing is once again a guarantee.", "date": "2022-03-09", "grade": "7.8"}
