{"name": "Far Cry", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/far-cry.html", "text": "When one man alone can make a difference We talked about the fact that there are numerous possible solutions for every situation and also about the vast open-air environments, although there is no shortage of indoor sections of all kinds. However, the crucial point remains, which is constituted by the artificial intelligence of the enemies. The Cry Engine allows for elaborate team strategy by opponents, who are so able to coordinate to the point of putting even the most shrewd player in trouble, particularly at higher difficulty levels, making you feel the weight of your inferiority numerical. The most interesting element, however, is what Cevat Yerli (CEO of CryTek) during the interview given to Multiplayer.it last September, defines Sensory, the simulation of human sight and hearing. According to this very refined development model of the AI, the mercenaries are able to react dynamically to the stresses produced by the surrounding noises, keeping in mind the golden rule ~if we see them, they see us~. This constant dynamic adaptation also applies from the point of view of the style of play, the more ~discreet~ users will therefore find themselves faced with mercenaries more similar to silent snakes rather than rude warriors. Combining this advanced behavior orientation with hierarchical coordination between the enemy ranks, each clash takes on ever-changing nuances, forcing you to remain constantly focused; you'll end up believing that those bastards are really after you! Although Far Cry may appear to be an elite game for small home commandos, the truth is that one of the major concerns of the development team was to make the title easily usable by as many players as possible, studying a happy balance between realism and arcade. The most evident result of this philosophy is what can be found in the behavior of the weapons, which moves away from the ballistic psychosis of Counter-Strike without renouncing some element of verisimilitude. Also in this case, more attention has been paid to quality than quantity, in the sense of wanting to make available to the player an arsenal which, although not very vast, caters for the most diverse tastes, putting in your hand a silenced MP5 or a discreet P90, arriving but to the rocket launcher and the explosive shotgun, with which to announce your happy entry onto the scene. On the contrary, the vehicles are nice little cars, without many frills and immediate to drive, with a single button for the accelerator and one for the machine gun, if any. In addition to the well-known jeep and the fast motorboat, there is also the dinghy, the glider and the unexpected forklift, mostly good for solving trivial puzzles. While we're talking about puzzles, let's take this opportunity to clarify right away that Far Cry offers nothing but an elaborate and addictive dose of action. Giving the game all the credit for the elements covered so far, we recognize that the story is non-existent, the non-player characters are a handful of stereotypical extras (very rare by the way), and you will spend the time making funny comments (and a somewhat loutish), more suitable for a marine stationed on Mars who watches porn movies to while away the time. This means that there will be nothing to do but find the colored card, plant the explosive and flip a switch, while all other interaction with the environment will go through the barrel of your gun. From the preview photos we expected a bit of narrative tension, but from this point of view we were deceived, and even the encounter with the living ~experiments~ conducted off the Asian coasts turned out to be a bit obvious. In any case, Far Cry does not lose its solidity, and the intensity offered by the single-player mode relegates the online experience to the rank of a natural complement, without introducing substantial innovations. The only element emerges in the Assault mode, where each player will have to choose between three different classes, deciding whether to opt for the Grunt, the fighter par excellence, stronger and better armed than the others, or whether to impersonate a Sniper or the more eclectic Support, able to repair vehicles, build and demolish bases, and equipped with different health packs. While the Assault mode offers a challenge between two teams, one of which attacks while the other defends, the remaining Free for All and Team Deathmatch modes are the classic clashes where the winner is whoever kills the most enemies, respectively in single or in teams. Although the maps suitable for the multiplayer challenge are particularly well done, Far Cry offers a complete Editor for creating customized maps, which can also be linked together to form real mini-campaigns. Beyondbeing able to intervene on the hundreds of parameters available, you can ~enter~ firsthand within the map under construction, immediately testing its potential in the development phase. A burning sun We underlined this from the beginning, thanks to the Cry Engine all that glitters is gold starting from the incredible effects of reflection and refraction. Until now we have admired the waves in broad daylight, but testing the final version we were enchanted by the moonlight reflecting on the sea, or by the marshy waters of the underground marshes. Adding to all this is the finely reproduced vegetation composed of various plant species that flex under the push of the wind, including birds that take off (nicely pulverized) and beaches that really seem to be made up of myriads of very white grains. Every effect made available by the new technologies has been implemented and combined with the solutions offered by the Cry Engine: shadows and volumetric fog blend with transparencies and thanks to the polybump, it is possible to render models with few polygons starting from the same ones with a greater number, without losing anything in quality. The result is there for all to see: highly detailed models and sensational textures carefully applied to every element of the game. Let's also not forget that there are no scenographic fictions, everything that appears on the screen is three-dimensional and perfectly ~playable~. Faced with such an imposing mass of polygons, Fra Cry could not betray himself on physics, which on the contrary is developed with great skill, in particular as regards the movements of human bodies. At this point we just have to mention the sound sector, which follows the player's actions by increasing or decreasing the pace and volume according to what is happening on the screen. In addition to the enveloping soundtracks, the noises of the surrounding ecosystem were reproduced very naturally, an element that will also prove to be fundamental for gameplay purposes. Final comment Far Cry is immediate and engaging, with numerous difficulty levels that make it suitable for all audiences. The highly advanced artificial intelligence capable of organizing itself into teams, combined with the original setting, offers numerous innovative ideas for gameplay. You will find in your hands a dose of action full of strategy and flexible to your style of play, framed by an excellent technical realization. The only comment that can be made to the game concerns the disconcerting linearity of the plot and the absence of any noteworthy interaction with the scenarios. For the rest, it's a great test for a European team entering the market with a product that we recommend to everyone without reservations. Pros: Immediate and engaging Highly evolved artificial intelligence Technically splendid Cons: Narration reduced to the essentials Awkward checkpoint saves A latest generation PC is required A hostile nature The PC shooter scene is dominated, with good reason, by the stature of Doom 3 and Half-Life 2, whose by now hackneyed issue of the stolen code has given it the aura of myth. A ray of light called Far Cry managed to filter through the heavy clouds of these awaited masterpieces, which after having depopulated for two years in preview at London's ECTS, is ready to definitively lift the curtain on its real potential. The curiosity that this title has managed to arouse make it one of those games on which everyone places their own personal expectations, which will in part be disregarded and in part satisfied, but which we assure you will not disappoint you, because Far Cry shines with its own light. The diamond in the center of the glow is the Cry Engine, the proprietary engine developed by Cry Tek, capable of giving life to those water surfaces that have been Far Cry's calling card in the technical demos that have taken place in recent years . We will have the opportunity to talk about this later, in the meantime let's take a look at the unusual setting, composed of tropical islands surrounded by the waters of the Pacific, where in the role of Jack Carver you will find yourself investigating Valerie, an alleged reporter who you have offered to accompany with your boat. If from a purely aesthetic point of view the rainforest and the equatorial climate intrigue and fascinate, from a gameplay point of view they lay the foundations for a ~sensory~ approach to the gaming experience. The goal is one, to survive, if this means blowing up some communication antenna orcleaning up a couple of underground labs doesn't matter to Jack, as long as he remains standing at the end of each session. What has been said about the setting plays a fundamental role here, because the vastness of the open spaces, with a horizon line of 2 km (relative to the size of the game of course), will put you in front of strategically complex situations. There are three factors that combine to make this shooter a rewarding rain warfare, the aforementioned scale of action, the multiplicity of possible approaches and styles of play and artificial intelligence. As regards the first point, it has already been said that there is a lot of road to go: we managed to swim for over three minutes in an attempt to get around a furious war zone and it was just one of the many viable roads, each of which assumes a different style of play. If your favorite musical instrument is played by pressing the trigger, you will find yourself painting the walls of enemy bases red, or in the middle of open battles along the lines of Halo (this time without reinforcements though), while if you are one of those who like to crawl slowly like snails among the fronds avoiding danger (we swam just to buy time), you will find kilometers of mud to chew. Between one extreme and the other, every nuance is allowed, and according to the situation you can opt for one choice rather than another, but one fixed point remains, you haven't come to the tropics for a holiday and whatever you choose to do, if not preceded by careful planning will prove to be a failure. By this we mean that every damn meter of jungle you will have to earn with your teeth, but the satisfaction you will feel in leaving behind death and destruction is unmatched.", "date": "2004-03-26", "grade": null}
