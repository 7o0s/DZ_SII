{"name": "Shadow Man Remastered", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shadow-man-remastered-recensione.html", "text": "(Re)writing, in May 2021, the review of Shadow Man Remastered, a title released in August 1999 (we talked about it several years ago in an episode of What happened to them?) could appear like the usual nostalgia operation, but in reality there is also another reason that prompted the publisher Night Dive to get their hands on this classic of the nineties: the promotion of the new saga, published by Valiant Comics, released at the end of April. A commercial maneuver in the name of economic prudence, given that, as is explained in the title, it is a remastered version. This means that, except for the game engine (however the KEX, also used for other remastered edited by Night Dive, follows all the characteristics of the proprietary one), the levels and most of the assets are the same used illo tempore for Nintendo 64, Dreamcast, PlayStation and PC releases. The work of the technicians focused mainly on the textures applied to the polygonal models, updated to high definition, on support for modern resolutions such as 4K and on the introduction of new post-processing effects such as Ambient Occlusion and Anti-Aliasing . A title from Nintendo 64, and it shows Efforts that are far from bringing Shadow Man to an acceptable condition by current standards: if already at the time, while not disfiguring, Acclaim Teesside's game didn't make you tear your hair out for the aesthetic aspect, today the result of this make -up makes even more marked the imbalance between the ~contemporary~ of the surfaces and the cumbersomeness of the animations which manifests itself with peaks of embarrassment in the facial ~movements~ during the animated sequences. And yet, the artistic direction still manages to have its say: despite the limited amount of objects to interact with (mostly barrels and ropes) and the inevitable simplification to which they have been subjected, the settings continue to be very evocative, whether it's a river in Louisiana, the alleys of New York or one of the floors of the Asylum, an imposing and disturbing cathedral of evil. Thanks also to the excellent soundtrack entrusted to Tim Haywood, called back to the recording studio to remaster the original tracks. The audio sector has always been one of the strengths of Shadow Man and listening to the notes of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata during Jack the Ripper's initial monologue still has a certain effect years later. The Italian dubbing is excellent, just a pity that some previously cut and now re-inserted dialogues have remained in English. Who is the real Shadow Man? It may be useful to shed some light on the universe created in 1992 by the pens of Jim Shooter, Steve Englehart (screenplay) David Lapham (artistic direction). Originally titled Shadowman (without spaces), the protagonist of the first episodes was Jack Boniface, who appears in the video game only in a small cameo. Valiant was acquired by Acclaim in 1996 for $75 million, in a move described by the company's former CEO Greg Fischbach as ~a bloodbath~ (actually the expression was a little more colorful). To take advantage of the characters in the portfolio of the third largest comic book publisher (including Turok), the company entrusted Iguana UK (later to become Teesside Studios) with the development of a tie-in which, while maintaining characteristic stylistic features such as the underworld and voodoo, created an original plot by entrusting the role of the protagonist to a new hero, Mike LeRoi. This warrior was then used both in videogames and in printed media, where he continued to gather considerable acclaim, so much so that the rapper Ice Cube proposed himself as the protagonist for a film. With the failure of Acclaim in 2004 the chapter of LeRoi, also continued in the modest sequel Second Coming (exclusive PlayStation 2) ended definitively. New control system The changes to the control system are those from which the title has benefited most: at the end of the nineties a common defect in many games was precisely that of the movements, considering that the coupled mouse / keyboard was taking its first steps. Today Shadow Man is extremely more usable with the two peripherals par excellence of personal computers, but also with the analog sticks of the joypad. Some small defects, such as the extreme precision required in the jumps or the difficulty in moving underwater, are the legacy of an engine that has the beauty of twenty-two springs behind it, but with which after a while you can live with without too many jerks of anger, also considering the welcome introduction of the automatic aim which has calibrated the difficulty during the firefights downwards, moving them on the secreducing the level of the playful offer and rendering pioneering features at the time almost useless, such as first-person aiming or target lock and, in part, also the numerous weapons that are unlocked in the continuation of the adventure. Metroidvania with dark souls Yes because, after all, Shadow Man is first and foremost an exploration and platform game, where you can navigate the labyrinthine levels of Deadside, a sort of underworld where most of the action takes place, and Liveside is the real challenge. Elements that today would characterize it as a metroidvania, environmental puzzles that, despite the technical limitations, are still interesting, forerunners of collectibles (the 666 Govi that increase the health of the protagonist, Mike LeRoi), complete an offer of great quality and quantity . The architecture of the maps is an element that bears witness to the simplification direction undertaken over the years: with fierce backtracking and imaginative passages to say the least, the Shadow Man levels could prove to be a real obstacle for the new ones as well as for the older generations, given that already at the time the risk of abandonment after a few hours was anything but obvious. Scattered in the most improbable places are the Prave Souls: you have to collect them all to get to the final battle with Legion, the demonic being described by the Gospel according to Mark (My name is Legion, because there are many of us), whose ultimate goal is to destroy the world of the living. In the remastered edition these ~Dark Souls~ are even more numerous, given that three previously cut levels were included due to the technical limitations of the consoles of the time, and this brings the total count of hours close to fifty to get to the titles of tail.", "date": "2021-05-04", "grade": "7.0"}
