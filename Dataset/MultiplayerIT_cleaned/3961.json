The representation of war in video games has sometimes been the object of criticism, stigmatized because it is too cynical and monolithic, often action-oriented and only minimally on the role of the individual. Treasuring these arguments, four years ago Ubisoft Montpellier brought Valiant Hearts to our screens, an effective 2D adventure that set out to represent the First World War with an immediate but touching look, a simple but fun gameplay and even a descriptive character function . The little pearl born from the French house was successful - so much so that in the meantime the game has landed practically everywhere, including Nintendo Switch - but for game director Yoan Fanise it was also a stimulus to try and take on new challenges. From these premises was born Digixart, a new independent label that has set itself the goal of creating projects with an undeniable artistic propensity. 11-11 Memories Retold is the first work created by the young team from beyond the Alps, and it is once again a war story, albeit profoundly different from Valiant Hearts, both in terms of structure and visual representation. The title was created in collaboration with the British animation company Aardman Animations and is produced by Bandai Namco Entertainment, but also sees the participation of the actors Elijah Wood (that you will all remember as Frodo Baggins in The Lord of the Rings) and Sebastian Koch (Bridge of Spies, The Danish Girl) to the dubbing. Given the topics covered, the project was at the center of a partnership with the British organization War Child UK, which made it possible to create a DLC for charitable purposes. So continue reading our review to find out what makes 11-11 Memories Retold an adventure in its own right in the vast panorama of contemporary videogames. War stories: two sides of the same coin Toronto, November 1916. There are twenty-four months left until the armistice that will put an end to hostilities between the German contingents and the forces of the Triple Entente formed by the British Empire, France and Russia. Harry Lambert (Elijah Wood) is a young Canadian boy with a natural talent for photography. He has a crush on Julia, the daughter of the photographer where he works as an apprentice. In his naivety, he feels a sincere feeling of envy for the attention that the girl shows in the presence of the resolute Major Martin Barrett, who has come to the city looking for a photographer to accompany him to the front to document the deeds of the allied troops. Dazzled by the desire to feel important, as well as by the possibility of exerting the irresistible charm of the man in uniform on the fair sex, Harry decides to embark with great enthusiasm for Europe, destination Vimy, unaware that the experience in the Old Continent is destined to change it forever. Germany, November 1916. Kurt Waldner (Sebastian Koch) is a German family man; works as an engineer in a factory that assembles airships on behalf of the Reich. After intervening to repair one of the radio stations in the facility, he accidentally learns of an attack involving the battalion in which his son Max is. Determined to shed light on the boy's fate, the man decides against his will to enlist and is thus assigned to the Teutonic troops stationed right on the Vimy ridge. Albeit with diametrically different motivations, the circumstances push the two protagonists to experience the war from around the corner, a handful of kilometers away from each other. Here they become spectators but also parties to the immense atrocities and suffering caused by trench warfare. Through the traditional third-person perspective, the sequences as the two soldiers alternate seamlessly. In 11-11 Memories Retold the player systematically divides himself between the events of Harry and those of Kurt, which will come to intertwine in an increasingly profound way, to then be directed towards opposing outcomes on the basis of the final choices made by the player. The story begins slowly, offers some flashes but is marked by a mostly linear progression, giving ample space to the reflections of the two soldiers, their hopes and a lucid reading of what is happening at the front. What turned out to be apt was above all the choice to entrust the narration to the protagonists themselves. The interpretation of Wood and Koch manages to make up for the lack of visual inputs related to the expressiveness of the characters, taking into account the fact that the looks and even the gethese turn out to be only sketched, even in the most touching moments or in the most dramatic ones. The musical component effectively carries out the rest of the work, especially in the final segment, where the emotions and questions about the fate of the protagonists become significantly more palpable. Sketchy gameplay and impressionistic graphics Compared to Valiant Hearts, the gameplay of 11-11 Memories Retold is clearly slower and more staid. The player is given plenty of time to reflect on the sentences articulated by the protagonists along their journey, but also to explore the settings in search of collectible objects or to exchange brief words with soldiers and other individuals nearby. What contributes to making the new work signed by Digixart special is also the graphic design, which replicates the style of impressionist paintings to generate the sensation of being in front of a painting that has come to life. In this sense, the pictorial formula has served as an expressive tool to allow the user to focus on the game for what it is: a text that does not set out to represent the war itself, but intends to focus on the people who, despite them, have been forced to live with that conflict, to suffer suffering and devastating losses. And although the effort made from an aesthetic point of view seemed appreciable to us, it is worth noting that the decisive brushstrokes and the fluctuating outlines of objects and characters end up causing a generalized visual fatigue, clearly perceptible at various moments in the story. Not finding ourselves in the presence of an action title, the great war outlined in 11-11 Memories Retold is not just a place to take up arms and prepare for the worst; at the center of the representation we find above all the analysis of the human condition, as well as the relativity of the very concept of enemy, which frees itself from a perception made of absolutes and ends up fading into gray scales which are confirmed in the continuous intertwining of Harry's destinies and Kurt. However, it should be noted that the work does not fail to focus on the assaults with white weapons, the machine gun discharges, the passage of bomber planes or the use of gas that was used to flush out the enemy, but all of this ends up being nothing but an accessory element for very different purposes. Although the experimentation should be considered appreciable, both from a conceptual and aesthetic point of view, we find that in 11-11 Memories Retold a solid point of connection between all the activities that can be carried out between one level and another has been missing . This leads to a tendential static nature of the action, which regains greater momentum and expressive coherence only in the final portion of the story. Just to be a little more didactic, the actions that Harry and Kurt can perform can be expressed in various ways. Kurt, for example, can write letters by choosing from a number of text options. Harry, on the other hand, is able to take photographs to fulfill his role on the front, but he can also try his hand at shots to be selected and included in his letters to his beloved Julia. Beyond these distinctive features associated with the two protagonists, in other moments of the story it is possible to play cards with fellow soldiers, solve small environmental puzzles, perform mini-games that require pressing some buttons with due timing and more. And although the variety of actions seems to have been chosen to never make the interaction predictable, it is clear that each of the prefigured approaches is too basic and only tentatively sketched, resulting in a lack of structural character.", "date": "2018-11-11", "grade": "7.5"}
