However, the dynamic duo that makes up Tangrin Games did not let themselves be intimidated and decided to release their first work in time, which we had already tried a few months ago: such audacity deserves in itself to be awarded, but as we will see there are not many other reasons why this indie title deserves a place of attention in the Steam library, the digital delivery platform on which it is distributed. Tangrin has talent, but with KYN he has put too much meat on the fire Tactical pause as if it were raining The story begins when the two protagonists, Bram and Alrik, having come out of a cave after undergoing a series of tests that have given them supernatural powers, return to their village of origin only to discover that the situation has worsened and that an evil entity has set the Vilborg region on fire: what better opportunity to test new skills? The plot does not represent the strong point of the project: the narrative canvas is rather banal and the choice of the programmers to give it a cut halfway between the light-hearted and the demented goes in the opposite direction to the desirable one, i.e. that of capturing the attention of the player. The result is that you will often end up skipping conversations with non-player characters quickly, also considering that the dialogues are one-way due to the lack of alternative answers. As can be understood, therefore, the structure of the game is fundamentally based on the fights, made particularly interesting both by the difficulty rate, calibrated in the high area even at levels that should be more accessible, and by a combat system enhanced by a refined management of the time factor . To get the better of the most difficult groups of opponents you need to make use of all the skills of your men, obviously including those that can only be activated for a few seconds, but the frenzy of the action prevents, despite the keyboard shortcuts, managing the whole party. The programmers have therefore inserted the possibility of slowing down time, by pressing the space bar, to manage each individual character more calmly. However, the risk that the pace slows down is averted by the fact that the ~bullet time~ is only available for a few instants, after which it is necessary to wait for it to recharge: the result of this setting brings a touch of originality that could be borrowed even from future productions and perhaps with a larger budget. Proven structure The artificial intelligence also deserves a mention: too many times, even in the most famous titles, the enemies hurl themselves against the player without paying attention to their own safety. In KYN, on the other hand, slightly more varied behaviors are simulated: when they find themselves in numerical superiority, the opponents will not pay attention to the defenses and will concentrate on one or at most two members of the group, usually those who have sent themselves ahead; once the enemy ranks have been thinned out, the survivors will flee, forcing the player to follow them even for several meters, with the risk of running into other hostile groups that populate the map. The intellectual quotient of ours acts as a counterpart, who do not deign to help their comrade under siege or to respond autonomously to enemy fire, thus forcing a tedious and continuous management of the party which, for the reasons just described, risks find themselves in difficulty even against the simplest opponents. A little above the importance of the characters' secondary attacks was highlighted: the growth system is based as always on experience points, but these accumulate only at the end of each mission. The development is very malleable and branches out on the basis of three macro areas: soul, body and control, which in essence are reflected in the magical skills, combat skills with melee and throwing weapons. Every fifteen levels, three new powers are unlocked (of which only two can be used at a time); there is also a particular one related to the recharge of stones of the mind. However, one of the peculiarities of KYN is given by the possibility of modifying the distribution of points with which to enhance the skills at any time, so that you can easily retrace your steps at any moment of the game. A choice that honestly didn't seem happy at all: Bram for example was born as an archieking, but he can nonchalantly become an equally good wizard or warrior, without the new specialization involving any kind of penalty in terms of money or experience. So much freedom turns out to be a double-edged sword because you inevitably risk losing empathy with your men, perhaps the most important aspect in an RPG. Linear structure Crafting represents another of the important aspects in the economy of the game: going into it is a demanding task (and unfortunately not at all rewarding, due to a cumbersome setting) because with the dozens of ingredients that are collected at every turn, it is possible to create numerous combinations; however it is necessary to at least get used to it because some artifacts can constitute the classic weight that moves the balance in favor of the player in the more advanced levels. The typical action of KYN foresees that the group moves from the starting point to the arrival point, once reached which you enter the hub city of Vilborg, where you will find quest givers and other points where you can take care of the inventory of the characters. Along the way, dozens of monsters that are quite affordable, but of growing ostracism, prepare for more demanding final battles and where the strategy is more heavily involved. There is no shortage of nice variations on the theme, such as defense missions or other escorts. The maps are linear: from time to time some branch hides a secret treasure, but in principle it is a question of following the main path until the end of the level. There are about thirty of them, each of which takes about an hour to complete: this means that the end credits can be reached in just under thirty hours - a respectable value with which, however, the experience of game, given that very few will want to start all over again just to try some skill that they had decided to discard the first time (and which in any case can always be recovered during construction, as mentioned above). The player controls the party, which will grow progressively until it reaches six units, with the predominant use of the mouse and the QWE keys, as well as the aforementioned and fundamental space bar. The isometric view frames the playing field and can be moved freely, so as to allow the members to act on very distinct areas, and on more than a few occasions the possibility of dividing the group will be exploited to manage it on fronts so distant as not to be included in the same screen. It's not just about combat situations: from time to time Zelda-style puzzles have been inserted that require you to direct the characters to pedestals to activate otherwise inaccessible areas - pleasant moments that enrich the gameplay and allow you to take a breather. Bringing the camera closer you can get to appreciate details that would usually go into the background, but for most of the action you will prefer to keep it as far away as possible to have a more tactical view of the battlefield. Stylistically, the work done is appreciable, especially considering that it is the sweat of only two fronts. The landscapes are well done, the color palette is bright and goes well with the setting of the game, and even the characters, especially those controlled by the player, are characterized with care, albeit with some unavoidable ups and downs. Unfortunately, the variety of enemies and the interaction with the landscape are not high, but as mentioned, one could certainly not ask for much more from Tangrin who used the Unity engine. The soundtrack is spot on, which plays its own without leaving a mark, less well the effects, of low quality and quantity. Good, albeit minimalist, the graphical interface, which in a few screens collects everything you need to know to keep inventory and characters under control. Conclusions KYN shows off several touches of class inserted in a game structure that does not shine for originality, while some unfortunate choices make it turn its nose downwards. The narrative component and the growth pattern of the characters, i.e. two of the fundamental aspects for a traditional RPG, are more or less deliberately left in the background in favor of focusing on the combat system, made interesting by the presence of the strategic pause and the good level of challenge offered by enemies and crafting. However the battles, always quite demanding, rarely manage to be truly epic and above all they do not know how to adequately reward the player. Echoing Vandal Online colleague Carlos Leiva's brilliant observation, there is more love in KYN che budget: Tangrin's passion clearly transpires and is enhanced by some interesting insights; unfortunately there are some errors, this time more than ever understandable, which fail to raise the title from mediocrity, even if, working on patches, some decimal points could also add to the final grade.", "date": "2015-08-14", "grade": "6.3"}
