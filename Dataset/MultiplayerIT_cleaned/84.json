{"name": "London Racer: Police Madness", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/london-racer-police-madness.html", "text": "Sitting behind the wheel, you can choose between: ~Quick Play~, a random mission among those unlocked, ~Career~, a career in the Police, ~Single Race~, play a mission of your choice and ~Bad Cop~, a mission of your choice in which it is necessary shoot. Receive orders from in-game superiors, complete patrol laps on time, scan suspicious cars (complete with license plate reading as you whiz along at breakneck speed), reach them if they try to escape and arrest them, shoot if necessary! Meanwhile a constantly growing bar (which you could give an incentive by collecting the bonuses that constitute overwhelming evidence) will allow you to invoke help from colleagues upon its completion, if you collide with obstacles and innocent vehicles the bar will regress a few positions, if you then drive as wimps you will reach the maximum infractions and lose but you can always recover hitpoints with wrenches. Successfully complete the missions and your commander will entrust you with more powerful machines, new gadgets to improve them, you will have more exciting and dangerous tasks to complete with weapons power ups and even a helicopter at one point in the game! PRO Performing on low-end models Immediate and clean AGAINST Hateful and repetitive sound pattern Those extra graphics of the latest generation titles are missing", "date": "2007-02-18", "grade": "S.V."}
