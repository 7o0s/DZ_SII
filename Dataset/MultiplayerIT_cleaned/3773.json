{"name": "Truberbrook", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/truberbrook-recensione.html", "text": "We measured ourselves with Truberbrook's review knowing that we were facing a classic graphic adventure, one of those that respect the dictates of the genre both in the mechanics, simplified but still faithful to point and click, and in the humorous vein that represents an essential component in a genre that makes fiction its mainstay. Nothing new, therefore, including the science fiction setting which, among other things, has become increasingly popular since this genre has come back into vogue. But this Central European adventure has something more. And that's what helped the German software house btf's title cross the Kickstarter milestone of 80,000 euros in just 30 hours. A handcrafted adventure The greatest peculiarity of Truberbrook, excluding the renunciation of the umlaut on the letter u outside the German territory, lies in the miniature scenarios that are made entirely by hand and digitally transposed to give us environments with breathtaking details and a decidedly particular rendering. The characters, characterized by a decidedly European angular design, are applied successively and the detachment is evident, but the overall effect - thanks to the excellent quality of the models - does not clash, ending up recalling some period adventures characterized by elements drawn and others digitised. The result is surprising, and although not all the settings can boast the same care, there is no shortage of glimpses destined to remain in the memory for a long time. But this is not enough to make a video game worthy of the name. And here we are finally talking about this German adventure set in 1967, in the midst of the Cold War, with a Twin Peaks-like beginning in a German village on the slopes of the mountains. Truberbrook is the name of the place, while the subtitle of the game, ~a nerd saves the world~, explains everything we need to know about the character, an American physics student whose name, Hans Tannhauser, betrays Teutonic origins. And they are origins that mention a phrase from Blade Runner, recalled several times by a title that is inspired by classic science fiction, from the X-Files to Star Trek, adding a pinch of Stranger Things and transporting everything to a difficult period for the world . Therefore, it is inevitable to expect implications of a certain thickness, even if our protagonist faces it with a smile, convinced that he is on vacation thanks to a journey won by chance that leads us to a place lost in nowhere and apparently devoid of any attraction. Thus begins, making the first acquaintance with the bizarre characters who inhabit Truberbrook, an adventure that talks about quantum physics, parallel universes and other mysteries that lead us by the hand through the acts of an adventure that opens gradually, offering us more and more puzzles complex. The difficulty, however, is not the central point of the experience, even when the map opens up and the puzzles span different settings. And it's probably a desired setting for an adventure that doesn't force us to look for improbable combinations. The interface is basic while the inventory can simply be looked at, with the title that allows us to use only objects in our possession that are compatible with what we are doing, combining them automatically. This means that the player's ability, excluding some more complex puzzles, is all about investigating, talking to the characters and also exploring the elements not indicated by the aids, which can be recalled with the space bar, which could unlock new situations in a game that aims to flow smoothly, somehow bridging the gap between classic graphic adventures and cinematic ones. The scenarios, unfortunately, are not many, but they change (sometimes suddenly) and evolve, giving us a fluid and decidedly engaging experience. A sliding adventure, perhaps too much Truberbrook, we said, is an experience that gets rid of unnecessary complications and does not focus on difficulty, relying on a handful of hand-made scenarios which, seasoned with real-time reflections and dynamic lighting, satisfy our senses on several occasions. There are also some interlude scenes, short but effective, which give the work a roundness often absent in graphic adventures with an inevitably limited production value. And this without considering the excellent English dubbing, at least for the three main characters, which is paired with spot-on humor, sometimes even markedly adult with a classic German gag based on an oblong vibrating object. In some moments, however, the verve fails, the characters lose depth and only the plot remains which offers some delicious ideas but in some cases it seemshastily pulled away, leaving us dumbfounded in front of a product that fluctuates in every sector, although it always remains enjoyable. Enough to leave a bitter taste in the face of a less than exceptional longevity. According to the developers' estimates, based on the material created, Truberbrook should last from 7 to 10 hours, but in our case we reached the final in six hours or so, losing some time also due to some rather heavy bugs that in the version we tested they forced us to reload the game. We also retraced our steps several times, among other things repeatedly sipping some animations due to a not perfectly designed fast travel, to visit some areas which, while remaining open to visitors, quickly exhaust their usefulness, bringing all the action to focus on the main areas. And even considering that in the Truberbrook area the small village is truly the center of the world, we felt it was a waste of space. All weighed down by a soundtrack that undoubtedly evokes an atmosphere halfway between sci-fi and paranormal, but does not shine for quality and originality with the exception of a single sung song which, among other things, is functional to a game scene. This, however, does not compromise the enjoyment of a title which, although simple and imperfect, is thoroughly enjoyable, between ancient scriptures, well-chosen twists and a couple of rather intriguing puzzles. However, he stumbles precisely on the final sequence, made special by the only relevant choice of the game, but short, confusing in the mechanics, weak in terms of characterization of the characters and not very refined from a technical point of view. However, it does not compromise too much a final as short as it is suggestive, it glosses the excellent business card of a software house capable and determined not to leave anyone out, at least from the point of view of the platforms since unfortunately there is no trace of subtitles in Italian. The PC version will in fact arrive on March 12, both on Windows, Mac and Linux, while the console version will be available on April 17 on Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 for around 30 euros. And the list of logos on the official site includes the Android one, an indication that the possibility of a mobile port is more than just a promise.", "date": "2019-03-11", "grade": "8.0"}
