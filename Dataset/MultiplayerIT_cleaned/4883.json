{"name": "Welcome to the Jam", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/183048-nba-playgrounds-welcome-to-the-jam.html", "text": "All it takes is a crossover, a pass and a shot for a basket to understand where the charm of NBA Playgrounds is, an arcade basketball game that tickles and satisfies the itch of those who have been orphaned by NBA Jam and NBA Hang Time for years. With the NBA2K series, or the latest, forgettable attempts to revive NBA Live, the combination of video games and basketball has become increasingly synonymous with sports simulation, with painstaking attention paid to team management and planning of every action, offensive or defensive as it is. Developed by Saber Interactive, NBA Playgrounds changes register and presents itself as a cross between NBA Jam and NBA Street, with the bar tending more towards the insane and exaggerated of the first. It's a two-on-two arcade game, recreating the light-hearted, over-the-top experience of 90s gaming while modernizing it in a way that EA has failed to do with recent NBA Jam ports. NBA Playgrounds has that light, fun, over-the-top approach that basketball fans have been missing Boom ShakaLaka! One of the main differences with other titles on the NBA, Playgrounds slams it in the face as soon as you start the game the first time. By unpacking three packages containing five random ~stickers~, the first players with whom you can compose your team are unlocked. Rather than having a full roster available from the start, NBA Playgrounds gives you access to an ever-growing selection of athletes as you receive packages. Fortunately, this is a different system from the one adopted by EA with the FIFA Ultimate Team: the packs are obtained by accumulating experience points, leveling up and completing tournaments, there is no shadow of microtransactions and the developers themselves have promised that future additions to the roster will come in the form of free updates. At the moment, however, it is possible to unlock over 150 athletes, from current names like LeBron James, Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant to former champions like Magic Johnson and Allen Iverson. It's a simple and smart way to encourage you to play and replay the (few) available modes, but this does not mean that it is a flawless system: transforming athletes into stickers of different rarities, obtainable only by leveling up, means that the more you go on, the slower you receive packs, while the chances of finding duplicates increase and you risk spending dozens of hours without ever getting that Shaquille O'Neal card that your friend caught in his first pack. The caricatured style of the athletes should be an indication of how little NBA Playgrounds takes itself seriously, but it's when you take the field that the game shows all its eccentric personality. Between exaggerated elevations, slow-motion dunks and acrobatic crossovers, the experience is reminiscent of the NBA Jam brawls both offensively and defensively. The 12-second limit per action (unlike the traditional 24) imposes a tighter pace and quicker exchanges, while the absence of fouls makes for a very physical and aggressive game. NBA Jam's iconic ~on fire~ is replaced by a system of random power-ups that are activated by filling a meter: there is one that allows you to perform a foolproof shot, another that doubles the points you get for dunking , yet another that makes you run without getting tired. Predictably, every action is accompanied by commentary from an enthusiastic commentator, who has some amusing outbursts (sometimes breaking through the fourth wall and directly insulting the player) but lacks a catchphrase  la BoomShakaLaka. However, NBA Playgrounds does not limit itself to replicating the disengaged and light approach of the Electronic Arts series, and indeed puts its effort into making each game more challenging and interesting. Running, crossing, shooting, or trying to steal the ball are all actions that consume momentarily energy: pushing an opponent has a good chance of causing him to lose the ball, but at the same time it can leave the player breathless and unable to create a shooting action. As if that weren't enough, the timing required for the shot to hit is very strict, with an execution window so tight that it almost clashes with the arcade nature of the game. Placing a basket is obviously more or less easy also based on the athlete's statistics, but in general it takes a bit of practice before making perfect shots with a certain frequency. Once you have practiced in the Exhibition mode and completed the six available tournaments, there is nothing left to do but challenge other players in multiplayer. It's a pity, however, that while the local experience for up to four friends works great, online it is only possible to compete against another player chosen at random through asimple matchmaking system. It is not possible (at least for now) to play with friends, organize small tournaments or even just customize a game by changing its time and power-ups. Mismatch for Switch Although we tried NBA Playgrounds mainly on PC, a few games with the Switch version immediately made evident the disengagement with which the developers of Saber Interactive brought the game to the newborn Nintendo console. The added value given by the possibility of playing away from home or away from the TV brings with it many compromises from a technical point of view. Load times are close to (and in some cases exceed) a minute, the experience is generally less fluid and there are fewer viewers or details in the background. Characters lose shadows, are significantly lower resolution, resulting in a duller look than their PC and console counterparts. Add an annoyingly strong vibration that can't be disabled (except from the console's system settings), and the fact that the online mode is not present at launch and will only be added at a later date. Last month, Noriaki Shinoyama, engineer at Epic Games Japan, said that to bring a game made with Unreal Engine 4 to the Nintendo Switch ~developers simply press a button~. Well, we wouldn't want this ~miracle button~ to make us forget, as in this case, the importance of optimizing a conversion.", "date": "2017-05-12", "grade": "7.8"}
