It could not have gone otherwise if we consider that Toys for Bob has done an excellent characterization job, recovering the typical spirit of the character, his supporting actors and even his nemeses to put them at the service of a non-original but well-written plot, made up of skits that we found really funny. Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, one of the funny skits. In a nutshell (it's still yet another review of the game you're reading!), the events of the fourth chapter follow the original trilogy and see Doctor Neo Cortex and N. Tropy manage to escape from their dimensional prison thanks to Uka Uka, who manifesting his powers to the maximum, he gives life to a space-time anomaly. The event reveals the existence of the Quantum Masks to the villains and spurs them to give life to yet another plan for the conquest of the universe: whoever controls these sentient objects has the dominion over space and time, and so Cortex and his allies embark on the enterprise not knowing that Crash and Coco will try to stop them again, with the help of one of the masks: Lani-Loli. Gameplay Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, in the game there is no shortage of reversed sections in which it runs towards the player. If from a narrative point of view Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time flawlessly resumes the story that had been interrupted several years ago now, but which we were able to relive in the splendor of an excellent remake thanks to the N. Sane Trilogy, also on the gameplay side the new episode confirms the link between classic mechanics and the need for modernity. In command of Crash and Coco, freely selectable at the beginning of each level, but with the possibility of gradually controlling various other characters including Tawna, Dingodile and Neo Cortex himself, all equipped with peculiar characteristics and abilities, we will have to overcome levels which develop in three dimensions and which present the inevitable mix of crates, traps, platforms, tracks and enemies. Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, Tawna is equipped among other things with a handy grappling hook. Proceeding in depth (with the support of a highlighted projection of our shadow to control the position during jumps) or laterally, as in the classic chapters, we will find ourselves facing increasingly complex and demanding sections, capable of literally making our hands sweat while we try to reach the coveted checkpoint. own raison d'tre; on the other it inevitably creates a trial & error approach which in some cases has seen us die forty times in a row. Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, a boss fight that made us curse a lot. Beyond the various playable characters, which are introduced during the campaign but which represent a very valid reason to return to already completed levels or face new ones, it is precisely the four Quantum Masks that introduce the most interesting novelties on the mechanical front, thanks to their respective powers of manipulation of reality. Acting on the right trigger, we will in fact be able to make certain objects appear or disappear when we use the aforementioned Lani-Loli, rotate quickly and therefore make much larger leaps and ~glides~ with Akano, slow down time with Kupuna-Wa and finally reverse gravity with Ika-Ika. In short, we are talking about a rather varied set of special skills, capable of adding depth to the experience. Structure Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, Dingodile features some nice levels. Then there is the discussion on the structure, which is literally the master in the case of Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time. We have mentioned the theme of replayability in terms of apple picking, but it is only a piece of the puzzle expertly packaged by the guys at Toys for Bob, who have filled the game with extras capable of increasing the duration and enjoyment of the campaign : it can be completed in just over ten hours, but only by leaving behind all the extras, which in fact double this value. After a brief introductory phase, we will in fact be able to visit nine different worlds, each characterized by a particular theme and divided into a variable number of internships. Marked un first completion, however, we will be able to replay them in N. Vertita mode, unlock the Flashback levels and the aforementioned extra stages in which to control the various Tawna, Dingodile and Cortex. The PC version Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, PC performance is jumping for joy. After the dutiful review of the many merits and few defects of Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time, it's time to talk about the PC version and how the game has been optimized for the Windows platform. Let's start immediately by saying that the graphics are truly excellent: the amusing cutscenes give way to settings that wink at the classic ones but are not afraid to innovate, alternating with completely new and very rich scenarios from a visual point of view. All this very colorful abundance moves at over 100 fps on an RTX 3070 in 4K and with all the settings at maximum: thanks to the almost fixed view, it is clear, but also to the good conversion work carried out by the Beenox developers. However, some anomalous situations are noted: during the first boss fight it even drops towards 20 fps, and strong slowdowns also occur in the most crowded and complex locations, forcing you to fall back on a lower quality preset. We are talking about an inconvenience that we imagine will already be fixed with the possible day one patch and that we would tend not to consider as the normal consequence of the greater weight of some scenarios, given that a reduction in the frame rate that reaches even 80% implies for inevitably some problem. Beyond this, however, there is really nothing to complain about and indeed the scalability of the experience even on less performing configurations should be ensured. Of course the PC version only resumes (and in many cases improves) what we have seen in the console versions of the game, without introducing adjustments regarding aspects such as collision detection, which in several moments appears a bit slippery and devoid of the tolerances to which modern gaming has accustomed us for years now. Even this frustrating roughness was probably part of the plan.", "date": "2021-03-27", "grade": "9.0"}
