And a decent amount of spin-offs and remakes, Gust's Atelier series is one of the longest-lived on the market, dating back as far as 1997 and the very first PlayStation. Paradoxically it is also one of the lesser known, and for good reason: it has never enjoyed great publicity and has always addressed a small niche of aficionados with very particular mechanics and tones. Not all the episodes have peeped out in Europe, however we haven't missed the annual appointment with the series since 2010: in this sense, Atelier Escha & Logy represents the first real step forward for the Gust brand, which finally try to get out of its niche, to address a wider audience and to shake off the clichs that accompany each release. Gust's new Atelier is also aimed at those unfamiliar with the series, modernizing it to the right point Eschatology The original title of this Atelier contains a very clever play on words: the conjunction ~and~ in Japanese is written ~to~ and therefore the title literally becomes Atelier Escha to Logy. Eschatology is a theological philosophy which essentially reflects on the end of the world and the destiny of humanity. And in fact the adventure of Escha Malier and Logix ~Logy~ Fiscario starts from that ominous assumption: the first is the only alchemist - a classic - of the small village of Colseit while the second, an engineer, arrives directly from Central City with a mysterious past but a very clear goal, and that is to shed light on the mysterious catastrophe that has brought the world to its knees. The two protagonists then become part of the government's Research and Development section and will have to work together to increase their prestige and, later, save the world. The story of Atelier Escha & Logy is set four years after that of Atelier Ayesha, but it is not necessary to have played the previous episode to understand the story since the references and quotations are very few and superficial: indeed, for most of the There is very little story adventure and Gust, for some reason, has decided to condense it all into the last two chapters and close it with a good number of multiple endings. A good eighty percent of the story is therefore based on the numerous supporting actors and their micro-stories: on the one hand we appreciate the desire to characterize them sufficiently, on the other hand their exaggerated stereotyping leaves a bad taste in the mouth. To unite all the characters there is the universal theme - and repeated a little too often, to tell the truth - of dreams and the commitment to make them come true, appreciable but a little too abused especially in RPGs of Japanese origin. Atelier Escha & Logy thus gains a rhythm and an atmosphere that make it more similar to a school anime: perhaps a little too carefree, it only takes off at the end, when the more savvy players might have abandoned it in search of another jRPG with the most challenging storyline. Tempus fugit At the beginning of the adventure we are allowed to choose the protagonist between Escha and Logy: the slogans of the game suggest that the gameplay changes according to the chosen hero, but our impression was that the game remains as it is and that change are only a few narrative sequences depending on the point of view selected. In other words, Atelier Escha & Logy behaves a bit like the recent Tales of Xillia, implying at least two playthroughs to be able to grasp every nuance of the story. On the other hand, it is true that the two characters differ in their abilities as alchemists, with Escha specializing in mixtures and potions and Logy more accustomed to the manufacture of various weapons and equipment. Choosing one or the other, however, does not involve any kind of imbalance as regards the structure of the game which, as per tradition, makes ~crafting~ its backbone: it was precisely this characteristic that isolated the brand in the niche we were talking about, which is why Gust has made an interesting and delicate turn to make the series breathe more. Alchemy is still fundamental in the progression: Logy and Escha will have to pass tests to continue in the story, and they will only have a few months to succeed. The time limit characteristic of the previous Ateliers is also present in the new installment, in the sense that each action or mission ~uses up~ a part of the time left before the deadline for completing the main mission in progress expires, which would lead to disadvantages such as the loss of certain rewards or certain endings. In this case, however, the conditions to be met are much softer and one can safely complDo the main mission practically immediately and then dedicate yourself, for all the remaining time, to the various optional sidequests to increase our alchemical competence and get your hands on various bonuses. In any case there is a lot to ~craft~, but the interface and mechanisms have been simplified and structured in such a way as to make each step much simpler and more intuitive than in the past. If alchemy has therefore been extremely facilitated - which could make the purists of the saga turn up their noses, at least until they realize how much more enjoyable it is now - the same cannot be said of the combat system, which instead has deep earned. Playstation 3 trophies Fifty-three trophies by Atelier Escha & Logy: forty-two in bronze, eight in silver, two in gold and platinum to culminate the collection. If for some it is enough to follow the story, for others it will be necessary to commit to dissect both the alchemy and the combat system, collecting objects and facing monsters as much as they can. Carpe Diem Exploration is in fact a key moment in the adventure, not only because it is necessary to continue the story and to obtain some of the rarest materials for our alchemical concoctions, but also because it is during our wanderings through caves and forests that we will meet enemies: a contact with their polygonal model will lead to a change of scene and the entry of our party on the battlefield. In spite of what one would expect after having played the previous Atelier, the combat system of Atelier Escha & Logy is surprisingly interesting and accurate, based on a curious mix of turns and real time: the main party is made up of three characters, supported by up to three support companions. Each attack inflicted or received loads a special indicator which, in essence, can be consumed to make the support characters also intervene during the turn of those in the front row. The possible actions are assigned to the joypad keys, thus involving not only the direct intervention of the player but also a good degree of strategy: loading the indicator to make several characters attack in sequence triggers a powerful special blow by the last fighter , but it also means sacrificing any defensive boost in favor of a character in difficulty. Alchemy also plays an important role in the economy of fights because weapons can be infused with natural elements that inflict more or less damage to enemies and also because it is possible to build countless bombs and chemicals capable of debuffing opponents and applying conditions negatives of all kinds. Players who have become familiar with the mechanisms of the Gust title will be able to dominate the battlefield from the very beginning, and will have fewer problems when, suddenly, the level of difficulty will grow exponentially towards the last hours of the game, causing many frustrations. In short, veterans of the franchise may feel at home up to a certain point, but fortunately they will recognize Gust in Atelier Eschy & Logy, whom they have come to appreciate also from a technical point of view, with her great attention to detail and delicacy traits used to bring the game world and characters to life. Also in this case the balance is not exactly perfect, with the variety of locations that make up for their linearity and the obsessive attention paid to clothing and details compensated by slightly woody animations, a dancer frame rate and a decidedly more faded than that of the previous Atelier Ayesha, even if the latter - probably - was a deliberate choice and does not affect an overall satisfactory cartoon look. The soundtrack closes the circle: a beautiful soundtrack with inspired and catchy songs, but also an incomplete and questionable English dubbing in terms of acting. Thankfully, Gust has surprised the Western Territories with the ability to switch to Japanese audio - hopefully that's the new rule and not just an exception.", "date": "2014-04-04", "grade": "7.7"}
