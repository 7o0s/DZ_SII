{"name": "Rush Rally Origins", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rush-rally-origins-recensione.html", "text": "It seems to be witnessing a sort of rebirth of the arcade rally, as this review of Rush Rally Origins also demonstrates, which comes a short distance from that of the excellent Art of Rally. Needless to say, it is from the indie environment that this type of game draws new lifeblood, the only production environment that can give space to more original and risky interpretations of racing, not caring highly about the presence or absence of official licenses and pushed realisms. And that's exactly what we needed, it seems: there is a remarkable freshness in these games, despite their roots in the more classic racing game tradition, in this case also with a deliberate return to the ~origins~ affirmed since title of the game itself. Rush Rally Origins is a rally racing game with a basically arcade soul, but which does not disdain a rather deep driving model, simple to manage but capable of giving great satisfaction. On the other hand, the Rush Rally series is now a sort of institution in the mobile field, with the first chapter dating back over five years ago and a series of evolutions that have led it to become a sort of real sim -falls with Rush Rally 3, and then suddenly retraces its steps with this new Origins, which as the title says tries to recover some typical characteristics of the first chapters. Among these is the particular shot from above, which allows you to see the game from an isometric view or with a camera fixed behind the car, in both cases with solutions that prove to be surprisingly practical, although at first glance they seem archaic forcing. It is easy to see, especially with the isometric setting, a reference to the legendary Neo Drift Out for Neo Geo, and the spirit is actually close to that type of game, even if the guide system is actually much deeper and more realistic in several respects. Gameplay: pocket rally Rush Rally Origins is an arcade top-down rally racing game Rush Rally Origins points to the arcade but does not disdain a certain attention in the reproduction of the driving model, which is rather accurate compared to what one might think at a first and quick glance. The thing that strikes the most in the gameplay is the fact of being able to find an excellent balance between an intuitive control system and a level of challenge that remains very sustained, immediately imposing a considerable cleaning in the trajectories and the ability to gnaw seconds at every corner, always pushing to the limit. Also from this point of view, the elements of contact with Art of Rally are many: driving gives great satisfaction and requires fluid movements and immediate adaptability, obviously focusing a lot on drifting, in a way that is not too realistic but truly satisfying. The only drawback lies in the somewhat uncertain behavior of the car from the point of view of physics, so the consequences of a contact on the side of the track can be rather unpredictable, even if this is somewhat part of the typical dynamics of the genre.Not there are official licenses but the cars are clearly drawn from the classic tradition of rallying, with the presence of the legendary Group B and Group S and a series of tracks that recall the historical settings of this sport, between Scandinavia, the Mediterranean, Africa and more at interior of 6 rallies divided into various routes. With the isometric view, Rush Rally Origins recalls some classics of the past such as Neo Drift Out The lack of a real multiplayer mode is somewhat surprising, with the possibility of facing the time challenge, the classic championship with progressive unlocking of races and cars or taking part in races together with other cars managed by the CPU. The main mode is clearly the Championship, which is also quite challenging from the first races, with the need to immediately get good times in order to unlock the next stages, with a certain sense of progression given by obtaining new cars and upgrades. Graphics and controls Rush Rally Origins also features a race mode with multiple cars on the track Aiming for realism but making the necessary compromises to work best on mobile devices, visually Rush Rally Origins simply looks like a racing game from several years ago, but there is a certain consistency in the way the rally is staged in this game. The cars are well made and animated, the dust rising from the dirt road surface is precisely what we want to see as we negotiate the corners sideways and everything else, ultimately, counts up to a point. Of course we are far from certain artistic interpretations capable of giving a stylistic imprinteven to a racing of this type (yes, we're still talking about Art of Rally), but there's a remarkable consistency in the graphic aspect of this game, which is especially designed to scroll quickly. Which also happens without major problems, although on older devices the 60 fps tend to show several drops. Likewise, the audio is precisely what one might expect from such a title, without appearing particularly accurate or realistic but however able to replicate the roars of the Group B racing cars quite satisfactorily. Rush Rally Origins obviously offers the classic variety of road surfaces A significant problem is represented by the control system: both solutions clearly studied for mobile devices, i.e. the virtual commands on the touch screen and the inclination via gyroscope, prove to be rather insufficient to guarantee the right precision, especially in a game that makes the lightness in the adjustment of the trajectories a fundamental element. By far the best solution, if not the only one able to do justice to the game, is then the use of the controller, with all the lack of practicality that this entails in such a context.", "date": "2021-09-05", "grade": "7.8"}
