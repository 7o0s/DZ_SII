{"name": "Gunfire Reborn", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gunfire-reborn-recensione.html", "text": "Released in the midst of a decidedly full period of important games, also with regard to the Xbox Game Pass catalog, it is easy for this title to go unnoticed, which is why we are interested in talking about it in the Gunfire Reborn review. The Duoyi Games game has been on Steam for almost a year where it has already garnered widespread acclaim, as demonstrated by the generally very positive user reviews, but is only now arriving on consoles and in particular on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One, with a launch directly within the Game Pass catalog. And it's a significant addition, although it may not seem so at first glance, which deserves to be tested and explored even though it has arrived in a period in which attention is turned to other high-caliber releases. first person with a roguelike structure (or rather ~rogue-lite~) which has as protagonists various anthropomorphic animals with different characteristics and abilities, engaged in the exploration of dungeons made up of progressive levels. Put like this, it seems simply another of the many more or less indie experiments seen going in this direction for some years now, and in fact it cannot be said that Gunfire Reborn differs much from what has been seen in many other titles, but it is the excellent execution and the way in which the various elements are perfectly combined with each other that characterize this experience and make it stand out in a remarkable way compared to the sea of other similar proposals, and it is no small matter. Let's face it: it's difficult to be conquered at first sight by images and videos of Gunfire Reborn, and the vagueness of the name doesn't even help in this sense, but although it is hard to find some original elements, the work carried out on balancing and finishing of the mechanics make it a highly recommended choice for anyone who does not mind the roguelike-style loop mechanic. Fighting animals and oriental myths Gunfire Reborn, some of the playable heroes There isn't exactly a great focus on the story in Gunfire Reborn, yet the staged world has something magical, inspired by Chinese mythology and the legends of the Asian continent, as befits the origins of the Duoyi Games team. There are six heroes represented by anthropomorphic animals who, for one reason or another, have to explore four areas made up of different progressive levels, built in a procedural way and with a boss at the end of each area. That's it and there isn't much to add on the narrative front, but it's what happens by exploring these levels that we are interested in examining, because a single run into Longling's tomb (the first explorable world) is enough to fall into a whirlpool from which is difficult to get out. The four worlds are characterized by very different settings, but each of these is in turn divided into 4 or 5 levels of increasing difficulty, built randomly but following elements reiterated according to the scenarios, reaching up to the arena containing the boss, usually challenging enough to require several successive runs to reach the right level of experience and skill required to beat it. Gunfire Reborn's graphics are simple, yet impactful Each level offers various waves of enemies to be killed, characterized by different specific types for each world they belong to, but all more or less inspired by Chinese folklore and traditions, although represented in a decidedly cartoonish way. Even the selection of the character follows a progressive logic: at the beginning there is only one available immediately, while the others can be obtained by reaching more advanced experience levels or by spending large sums of Soul Essence, fortunately without micro-transactions with real money. Each hero modifies the gameplay in a sensitive way, given that the fighting styles are quite diversified, beyond the common use of firearms, which can further vary with the different choices that can be made in the evolution of each one, through skill trees. Steady progression and not Gunfire Reborn, a moment of firefight in the desert As we have said in other cases, there are essentially two pillars to consider when dealing with games of this type: the combat mechanics and that of character progression, and Gunfire Reborn succeeds perfectly in both areas. The progression is typical of the rogue-lite, with part of the progress that is transferred from one game to another in the face of the loss of all the power-ups and weapons collected during the game, once the game over is reached. forces us to restart the exploration from the beginning. The levelsthey are full of loot of various types, including elements released by downed enemies and chests to open, as well as bonus sections that offer additional challenges for rare rewards, but all these elements - with any purchased upgrades - remain available only during the run in course, except for the release of particular skills that allow you to transfer some of these characteristics, while the permanent progression mainly concerns the talents. The talent system is based on 5 parallel skill trees, plus a linear one linked to the specific hero used, while the others are generically applied to all characters. Gunfire Reborn: Talent skilltrees With the essence of the soul conquered during the various attempts it is possible to unlock the new abilities placed on the various trees, all passive and aimed at increasing the effectiveness in the use of weapons, special abilities and survival and exploration skills. These elements accumulate and remain from game to game, thus representing the basic elements of progression in the game and triggering the classic dynamic of the genre that sees us becoming more and more powerful and capable with each attempt. It's a rather deep system: the skill trees are very linear and don't allow for great customization, but the quantity of elements to unlock and above all the variety in the basic characteristics of the characters to conquer make the evolution of these very interesting. Shooter mechanics and gameplay basics Gunfire Reborn: The first boss The basic mechanics of the gameplay is the classic one of first-person shooters based on fast action and a right combination of the use of different weapons and support skills, with jumps and strafe to guarantee some evasive maneuvers. The action works well and is fun, above all thanks to the excellent sensation that the weapons give back, in the so-called ~gunplay~: despite the cartoonish and very unrealistic characterization, the developers have managed to build a well-functioning dynamic shooter, characterized by a good weapon response, with believable motion, spin, and recoil beyond arsenal imaginativeness. Basically, an overly accentuated aiming assistance is detected, but it is still possible to deactivate it to find the best setting for every taste. The weapons follow the main models (pistols, short or long range rifles, elemental energy weapons, crossbows, daggers and more, as well as explosives) but have characteristics that also vary on a random basis, with the application of additional powers that make them all unique and upgradeable by paying the right price to the ~craftsman~ that can be found around the dungeons. A maximum of three can be carried, one of which is fixed (the starting gun), so it is important to get to know them and use the right ones for each situation. To move forward in Gunfire Reborn it is essential to alternate the use of weapons with special skills , especially using some of the more advanced characters that rely heavily on this aspect. These work as a sort of alternative attack with different effects depending on the chosen hero and can be enhanced both through fixed talents and by activating the scrolls collected during the runs. Gunfire Reborn: Tomb of Longling is the first setting of the game In addition to this, another characteristic aspect of the game is the use of the lightning, fire and corrosion elemental powers, which can be associated with the special ability or with the weapons themselves: the particular thing is that these powers can be combined with each other, determining different and additional effects compared to the basic ones and applying a further tactical element to combat. To all this is obviously added the cooperative multiplayer, an element of great importance. The game can easily be experienced in single player without the experience being undermined by a structure that necessarily involves the intervention of other players, but in the more advanced and chaotic stages it is clear how the maps and situations are designed to understand a number more fighters in action, which of course also increases the fun. A pleasant but uninteresting world Gunfire Reborn: Enemies may be inspired by Emperor Qin's Terracotta Army The cartoonish characterization, made up of cel-shading and anthropomorphic animals, manages quite well to give a peculiar identity to Gunfire Reborn, but the game world is never particularly interesting and in-depth. The narration is clearly not a strong element in this title, nor even necessary to be able to fully enjoy it, but certainly a greater interest in the background of the characters and on the particular construction of theThe setting would have made everything more interesting. Especially since the references to Chinese mythology represent an excellent starting point for building an interesting lore, but these remain substantially limited to a general artistic direction, rather than characteristics exploited for in-depth world building. It's a shame because more charisma would certainly have helped, just as it worked very well for Hades, to give an illustrious example. Stylistically, the choice adopted for the graphics also reflects the need to run the game with optimal performance on any platform, as well as also have to do with the rather small size of production. Another positive effect of this general simplicity in the representation is the remarkable cleanliness and clarity of the action: you always have a precise vision of what is happening on the screen even in moments of greater chaos, with perfect visibility on the opponents' shots and on those that we can achieve. In the tested build, the game also has a frames per second counter in a corner of the screen and this always shows remarkable numbers, even if it is difficult to confirm: it also reaches 200 FPS and in action it always remains at least above 100, but there it must be said that it varies continuously, even if this is not particularly perceptible.", "date": "2022-10-27", "grade": "8.2"}
