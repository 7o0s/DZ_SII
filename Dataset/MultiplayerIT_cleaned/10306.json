It matters little if the food is typical of fast food (hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza) and the drinks are anything but healthy (whiskey, wine, sodas). Parties are for having fun, right? And then down to gorge yourself, trying to down as much stuff as possible (since it's free) without your stomach rebelling. The puzzle game created by Vivid Games refers to the classics of the genre and shows us a large board divided into boxes, in each of which we find food or drink of different types. These objects must be put together to be consumed (and therefore disappear from the board), and their intake moves an indicator located in the upper part of the screen in the direction of liquids or solids. Our goal is to eat and drink as much as possible before our alter ego gets sick and rushes to the bathroom to throw up. Bread bread... Boozle presents itself as the classic ~thought-chatter~ application, in the sense that it is based on a ~survival~ structure in which there are no stages to overcome or locations to see: only a single game which can last more or less time depending on how we play it. As we couple the same objects and move the bar that regulates the balance between liquids and solids, in fact, things get more difficult and rapid associations fail, so much so that it becomes necessary to risk in order to score a few more moves. An example: the bar is dangerously close to the right limit, ~gorge~ (solid food), and we should move the indicator to the left but there are no drink associations available. We therefore have to analyze the board, make another ~solid~ pairing and then very quickly take some liquids for the indicator to stop and move before feeling bad and incurring the ~game over~. Pairing groups of four or more objects in the same row produces spectacular effects, with multiple eliminations that however become difficult to manage from a balance point of view. The ~shiny~ objects even produce ~explosions~ inside the board, while the digestive tablets allow us to bring the situation back to square one. ...wine to wine The game control system is very simple and immediate, and is based solely on the touch screen. We have to touch and drag the boxes that interest us, moving them one column towards the group with which the association would be created. The small size of the boxes can create more of a problem when we have to touch and move them, especially when we have to make very rapid pairings. Making a mistake in this situation, when the bar is moving rapidly towards one of the extremes, can be really frustrating. The technical sector accompanies the action in the best way: the graphics are nice, very colorful and ~readable~, with a drawing style appropriate to the light-hearted atmosphere of the game. The movement of the squares is fluid, the ~special effects~ appear appropriate and there is no noticeable stuttering or slowdown. The sound is made up of really nice and catchy music, just a pity for the small number of songs (just a couple). The effects are clearly sampled and alternate noises that are anything but pleasant, as one might imagine. Finally, it is possible to replace the musical accompaniment of the game with a personalized playlist. The tested version is 1.1 App Store links", "date": "2009-12-17", "grade": "5.5"}
