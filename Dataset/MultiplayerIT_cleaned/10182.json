Mario Kart did not invent the arcade-type racing game, but its characteristic structure, its particular imagery and its peculiar rules, distilled with care, have codified a real sub-genre, that of the so-called ~kart racing~. Let's take settings, characters and vehicles as distant from reality as possible, insert them in a bright and colorful context and complete the simple driving on the track with objects and weapons that can be used in the race that push the competition between the drivers to a fever pitch: with these ingredients we are able to propose a worthy exponent of the genre, clearly with characteristics derived from the progenitor branded Nintendo. The operation works even better if the characters and settings of the game refer to a universe already well known by users, possibly cohesive in some way but also varied enough to provide different and interesting ideas and suggestions. The recipe fits perfectly with this Sonic & Sega All-Star Racing, or rather Sega's answer to the karting game of its old rival from the big N, which - regardless of the inevitable comparisons with the Nintendo title - above all has the merit of bringing an excellent exponent of the sub-genre to all platforms on the market. Although the structure of the game obviously proves derivative, Sega has managed to characterize the game in a convincing way, with its typical magic that shines through every pixel on the screen, starting from the usual brilliant blue sky as a backdrop to the adventures of the pilots, in pure Sega/Sumo Digital style. A good product with some defects, which will not fail to fully satisfy those who need a Mario Kart substitute, technically well packaged. Super Sonic race Now, therefore, the canvas is the typical one: on absolutely improbable tracks we find ourselves running with a character chosen from the large array of possibilities, endowed with its own characteristics and a specific associated vehicle. In addition to driving skills, which translates into knowing how to tackle curves in the best possible way and, essentially, going faster than the others, a skilful use of support objects is also indispensable, consisting of attack weapons, momentary accelerations or systems of defence. The circuits are obviously inspired by the various settings of the Sega games whose characters are part of the cast, including the Sonic series, Samba de Amigo, House of the Dead, Billy Hatcher, Jet Set Radio, Shenmue, Virtua Fighter and many others. constituting both an inexhaustible source of varied scenarios and an irresistible stimulus, for fans of the publisher, to discover all the levels and unlock all the characters. The vehicle control system, directly borrowed from the one present in Mario Kart, makes the most of the spectacular tortuosity of the tracks, with the continuous need to carry out long drifts on bends which allow, at the end of the trajectories, to obtain momentary accelerations which are essential for get the better of your opponents. The driving system is obviously simplistic, as befits an extreme arcade, but the controlled drift system is enjoyable and inserts a minimum technical expedient to take into account in order to hope for good results, in particular by going up with the level of difficulty. Apart from the fun of the race itself, the title also leverages the collecting spirit, as often happens in these cases: each game session involves the accumulation of a certain number of ~Sega Miles~, real virtual currency that can be spent on 'purchase of new pilots belonging to the historical Sega catalog and new tracks, which works quite well to ensure a certain longevity to the single player. A varied experience The Grand Prix (for points on five tracks) and the single race are obviously the main game modes, in which what matters is essentially finishing first in the points classification or at the finish line. It's the main multiplayer option, here in both online and offline versions with split screen (for up to 4 players, in this case) and ultimately the one on which the game is based, in the long run. However, there are different irons in the fire when it comes to the single player, especially with the introduction of ~Missions~. Those who have played the new Out Runs, from the first Xbox onwards, will have a rather precise idea of what this option offers: it is about obtaining certain objectives within the various tracks, salways driving your vehicle but performing actions that differ from the simple race against your opponents. It involves, for example, collecting a certain number of objects on the course, performing a certain number of drifts, passing through particular points of the course and so on, in an attempt to obtain the highest possible score at the end of the challenge and thereby unlocking the next mission. There are more than 60 levels, which guarantee a good and abundant variation on the main theme of racing, although in most cases they are real mini-games to be tried no more than once. The completion of the missions also determines the accumulation of Sega Miles that can be spent on new drivers (with related vehicles) and new tracks. The wide selection of riders, in this sense, is based more on the desire to collect than on an attempt to give greater variety to riding styles. Although there is a discrete difference between the characteristics of the various drivers and their associated vehicles, in terms of acceleration, speed and road holding, these do not result in large differences in the reaction to hits on the track, which somewhat limits the strategic value of the choice of sod. Xbox 360 goals The game rattles off a good amount of achievements in the normal course of racing, both in single player and multiplayer. Many are those traditionally inserted within the progression between levels, but several are linked to the achievement of particular objectives between the number of victories, performance in the race, characters and scenarios purchased through ~miles~. Good integration of achievements. Blue skies and green forests The biggest risk one runs into, when embarking on the development of a game that owes so much to a famous predecessor in terms of structure and concept, is that of not being able to instill an identity of its own in the new product, which therefore in the anonymous canons of the clone without history. It must be said that this is not the case with Sonic & Sega All-Star Racing, which thanks to the strong characterization of Sega and its reliance on a universe well known to the vast majority of gamers, is capable of distinguishing itself as a product endowed with a certain identity. Certainly the stylistic variety of the series condensed in this racing game tends to create in some cases a bizarre jumble effect, but a basic homogeneity is recognized, given by the common denominator of the Sega style, summarized in the bright colors, in the soft lines of the sector graphic and, of course, in the brilliant blue sky that forms the backdrop for most of the tracks. In general, therefore, the graphics sector has been promoted, which fully performs its function, especially within a game of this genre. The only discordant note is a certain instability of the framerate, often put to the test by the amount of elements present on the screen and by the general speed of the action, which noticeably loses its shots in some cases, passing from a fluidity that touches 60 frames per second to situations in which the movement of the screen becomes significantly more jerky. For its part, even the audio accompaniment seems to have ~Sega~ written on all sides: carefree tunes alternate with classic electro-rock songs that seem to come straight from the Japanese house's arcade tradition. Ultimately, a well-packaged product from an aesthetic point of view, especially fitting for the chosen genre, albeit with some uncertainty regarding the framerate. The Wii version On a purely content level, the Wii version of Sonic & Sega All-Star Racing is exactly identical to the PS3 and 360 counterparts: the dispute therefore moves mainly on the terrain of graphic design, the victim of an inevitable downgrade. In any case, it is difficult to criticize the Sumo Digital developers given the reference hardware, which as usual heralds problems such as the low definition of the textures and a reduced polygonal complexity: elements that contribute to making some objects on the screen barely visible, but which have no further gameplay consequences. The game also rests on a frame rate lower than that of the other versions, but which at least is confirmed (almost) always stable. As far as the control system is concerned, however, it was wisely decided to put the motion sensor functionality of the Remote into the background to entrust the default task to the more precise combo with the Nunchuck. In general, therefore, it is a more than satisfactory conversion work, whose only bad luck lies in the fact of finding itself on the same console that hosts his majesty Mario Kart, which necessarily increases the risk of destructive comparisons and thengenerous.", "date": "2010-02-22", "grade": "8.0"}
