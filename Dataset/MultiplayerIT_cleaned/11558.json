{"name": "Frontlines: Fuel of War - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/frontlines-fuel-of-war-recensione.html", "text": "The third World War The sad leitmotif that runs through Frontlines: Fuel of War from the same title to the plot, is the global energy crisis, which leads the global geopolitical structure to the creation of alliances and opposing blocks to contend for the last resources of the planet. So the good old ~red threat~ is dusted off: on the one hand the Atlantic Alliance, so to speak, with the United States and Europe together, and on the other the Red Star, which brings together Russia and China in a new Soviet-style superpower . The battlefield, once again the powder keg of the world, is the Middle East, the last place on earth from which it is possible to extract the precious oil which is now running out. The story is projected into a near and decidedly disturbing future, in which the oil crisis leads the superpowers to a sort of novel trench warfare in an attempt to grab the richest area of crude oil left on Earth. So here is the setting that forms the backdrop to the game, in which we find ourselves interpreting a soldier of the Coalition, whose team finds itself on the front line in the midst of the Third World War. Note the interesting narrative solution adopted: the progression between the levels is marked by the presence of a reporter, who accompanies our team, who witnesses the events happening around us and who also assumes the part of the narrator, who update on the world situation. In this way we witness both the classic wink towards the canons imposed by Hollywood war productions, with scenes full of pathos and pressing and ~testosteronic~ dialogues from within, i.e. when we find ourselves playing the protagonist soldier, and reflections more calm and reasoned on the whole situation of the war, when the word passes to the reporter (almost omniscient, here) in the more purely narrative phases, giving greater depth to the story and a decidedly more interesting cut. A company shooter The developers responsible for Frontlines have EA's Battlefield series in their curriculum, and it is something that is perceived immediately, even without reading it around. The Frontlines DNA perfectly reflects the professional career of Kaos Studios, born with a Battlefield 1942 mod, established itself within DICE with Battlefield 2 and later acquired by THQ to work on this title. A training course that evidently led to an evolution of the Battlefield concept, within a completely new game. As for the single player, Frontlines offers a rather limited campaign, which unfolds in 8 missions divided into various points, but which in total will hardly take about ten hours to complete. If you add an artificial intelligence that is not too developed, and a plot that hardly manages to captivate the player too much, you have a fairly accurate picture of how the game focuses entirely on multiplayer. There are, however, strengths also in the single-player campaign, with the variety of situations that amazes at first (the amount of means to be used is truly remarkable), and some moments of the story remain impressed: being inside of a tank in the middle of a nuclear attack, complete with a mushroom cloud in the background carries a certain charge of pathos, so to speak. However, it is noted that the single player is in truth an adaptation of the multiplayer structure within a more specific context, and the lack of incisiveness of the plot and dialogues demonstrates it amply, even if the work appears to be done with undeniable care. As for the direct confrontation with the enemy, an elementary unit in the gameplay of an FPS, there is a damage management system that is sometimes not fully convincing: fragging, in essence, cannot be as satisfying as in other games of this type generally, partly due to certain imbalances that afflict online clashes, and partly due to a lack of precision in the long-range collision system, which can be corrected in part by disabling aim assist. Multiplayer So let's come to the section that most characterizes Frontlines: multiplayer. Here, the similarity with the Battlefield series becomes almost embarrassing, although it must be said that there are not many current titles that have followed the approach of the DICE/EA shooter, and that the developers have been, in their own right, decisive for building that series, before moving to THQ. The whole dynamic is based, as the title says, on the battle front line: within the various maps, ~points of interest~ are placed which must be conquered by the teams in the field, in order to move the border line in favor of one or the otherfaction. This determines a certain organization of the battle, which allows large-scale clashes without giving in too much to total chaos (not for nothing, one of the main features of the game is its ability to support multiplayer up to a maximum of 50 players, thanks to the use of dedicated servers): in fact, we know where to go, and where it is highly probable to find the enemy concentrated in force, according to a logic imposed by the need to conquer certain strategic points and defend them (which, however, does not prevent some systemic flaws, such as being eliminated several times and without the possibility of salvation from enemies suitably stationed in the automatic respawn areas). The possibility of driving various types of vehicles also allows here a certain variety of action and strategic approach to battle: tanks, armored vehicles and helicopters can be piloted with a certain ease and can give great satisfaction. Another particular feature, still partly mediated by Battlefield and partly also seen in the recent Call of Duty 4, is the possibility of specializing your fighter in some battle area. Before respawning, we can select the fighter's category (assault, heavy assault, anti-tank, sniper, etc.), which determines the basic equipment and the skills that can be acquired in battle: the latter are three for each category, and are earned with results obtained in the field (elimination of enemies or conquest of objectives). In essence, these are additional skills that allow, for example, to improve one's basic skills or to use useful tools such as drones (basically land vehicles or radio-controlled aircraft equipped with lethal weapons), or even to call air attacks on points at will on the map, just to give some examples. It is an interesting system to manage the characters and vary the dynamics of the matches a bit, but it also has some flaws: in particular, the classes are often not well balanced, and some are decidedly more effective than others, especially if you consider that it is impossible to vary the basic equipment at will once you enter the battlefield (it is impossible to collect conventional weapons from the scenario) and so, for example, whoever chooses the gunner is forced to fight only with the bazooka or the pistol. Apocalyptic scenarios The graphics sector is based on the well-established and now widely known Unreal Engine, which on the one hand allows for a predictable good result but on the other hand tends to flatten the aspect of the game on a generalized ~already seen~. Lighting effects, shaders and different textures have a decidedly familiar look to those who have had to deal with the many other action and shooters based on Epic Games technology. Nonetheless, the aesthetics are well cared for, and the variety of environments is quite remarkable, although it does not generally reach the quality level of a Call of Duty 4. The wide scenarios and the possibility of using vehicles allow a much freer approach to the maps , which can be traveled and explored through numerous paths, although in some cases the vastness of the horizon is compensated by a somewhat heavy use of the fog effect, which can be rediscovered above all by using helicopters. Very evident, it must be noted, is the instability of the framerate, capable of passing from brief moments of absolute fluidity at 60 fps to vertical collapses during the most agitated phases, generating an annoying sense of confusion, both in online matches (in which the lag tends to occur with a certain frequency) and in the single player mode (where strange phenomena of crazy physics and mysterious movements of the enemies are detected, in some cases). Nothing to complain about the audio sector, which in all respects is confirmed to be of excellent workmanship: from the epic-Hollywood music (with hard rock influences if necessary), to the well-dubbed dialogues up to the sound effects, which include some of the best reproductions of shots heard lately in an FPS. Comment Frontlines: Fuel of War is not a game destined to remain in the annals of gaming history, but it was not born with this intention either. It appears as the result of a filing implemented on the Battlefield structure, and more than dignifiedly fills the void currently left by the EA series, as a shooter based mainly on ~extended multiplayer~ in teams. Therefore, those who know this series will find themselves perfectly at ease with this Kaos Studios game, while those who have not yet experienced it will be able to enjoy this excellent substitute all the more. Once the lack of originality is archived, Frontlines proves to be a game that can be largely improved, especially as regards the management of the clashes, the netcode (easily fixable with updates), the balancing of the classes and, possibly, a more in-depth single player. In any case, it remains a great choice for post-Call of Duty 4, and for those looking for a multiplayer FPS with an alternative structure, waiting to see DICE.Pro's answer: Good team multiplayer Use of various means Implementation satisfactory technique Cons: Nothing new compared to Battlefield Short and uninspired single player campaign Some problems in the management of firefights Xbox 360 goals Frontlines contains 1000 gamerpoints distributed in 30 unlockable achievements. The organization of these seems to incite the player to repeat the campaign several times, in search of ever better performances. In addition to the classic objectives of games set on multiplayer (amount of kills, shooting accuracy, resistance, etc.), many points can be accumulated not so much by simply completing the single player missions, but by doing so by respecting certain parameters (time, lives used or other). In general, a demanding task but not too much.", "date": "2008-03-17", "grade": null}
