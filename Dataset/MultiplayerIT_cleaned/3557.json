{"name": "Like a Dragon: Ishin!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/like-a-dragon-ishin-recensione.html", "text": "No one can deny the value of the series known so far as Yakuza when it comes to virtual tourism, visual fidelity, atmospheres and attention to detail for a setting, the Japanese one, which remains decidedly fascinating in the eyes of Western users. The franchise has enjoyed a substantial relaunch and the Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio thought it was time for us to savor something new... or old? Nine years after the original publication, here we are with Like a Dragon : Ishin!, the remake of what stands as the most famous spin-off of the SEGA game. In short, the term ~old~ takes on various connotations, in this case: on the one hand because we are dealing with a title from 2014, which inevitably carries with it the limits of a formula that has only recently been slightly revised; on the other hand because the story is set between 1866 and 1867, at the end of the Edo period. Is it worth embarking on this journey to feudal Japan? We reveal it to you in the review of Like a Dragon: Ishin!. History: the souls of renewal Like a Dragon: Ishin!, the protagonist Ryoma Sakamoto has the same face as Kazuma Kiryu It is an era of renewal (~Ishin~, in fact) that which forms the backdrop to the dramatic events of the protagonist of Like a Dragon: Ishin!, Ryoma Sakamoto: the fictionalized version of a real figure, a skilled and courageous samurai determined to overthrow the Bakumatsu shogunate and who in this adventure has the features of Kazuma Kiryu, as well as several well-known faces from the SEGA series ~interpret~ as many characters who join the story. What appears before our eyes actually seems a sort of suggestive representation theatrical, in which there is no shortage of tragic moments, violence, betrayals and mystery. Back in Tosa after a hard training in the art of the sword, Ryoma collides with the injustice that reigns supreme in his hometown and decides to start a revolution together with his half-brother Takechi Hanpeita, head of the Loyalist Party, and the his stepfather and mentor Yoshida Toyo. However, the latter is assassinated by a masked warrior just before revealing his plans to restore peace and justice to Tosa and Ryoma, who cannot avoid embracing him on his deathbed and who was already wanted by the authorities for having defended a woman and his little girl by a pair of soldiers, he is falsely accused of the murder. Cornered, he flees to Kyo, present-day Kyoto, in an attempt to find the killer and exonerate himself. A year later, assumed the fictitious identity of Hajime Saito, the protagonist of Like a Dragon: Ishin! he discovers that the peculiar fighting style used by the assassin, called Tennen-Rishin, is linked to the leaders of the Shinsegumi military brigade, known in the city for its ruthlessness. He therefore decides to join it in order to be able to get closer to his goal without arousing too much suspicion, but he has to deal with the cruelty of the troops and with the political twists and turns of a plot that will not lack surprises. Like a Dragon: Ishin!, Ryoma in the ranks of the Shinsegumi As per tradition, the story represents a fundamental element of the experience proposed by the SEGA series, and the remake of Ishin! he is no exception, even if he stumbles into some less guessed narrative solution. The authors working at the Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio certainly know how to best characterize the characters, and although in this case the cast is far too numerous, with some figures inevitably downsized compared to their roles in the various chapters of Yakuza, the final result remains very valid Merit also and above all of the cinematographic cut and the perfect rhythms of a direction that in the management of the shots is still very mechanical (after all, this spin-off is still the son of a development that started from the foundations of Yakuza 5), but which he takes all the time necessary to best represent both Ryoma and his multiple supporting actors, whether they are allies or opponents, giving them the strength and character of the franchise's voice actors. And yes, there are subtitles in Italian. Structure: the activities of feudal Japan Like a Dragon: Ishin!, Ryoma strolls through the streets of Kyo After a preliminary phase that takes place in Tosa, the action of Like a Dragon: Ishin! moves to its main setting, that of Kyo, which appears in front of our eyes with a large and suggestive structure although at times labyrinthine, divided into districts each characterized by different commercial activities where we can eat, buy consumables, raw materials and even weapons to significantly enhance our equipment. The formulait is that of the classic Yakuza, which could be reduced to a ~go from A to B and enjoy the next interlude sequence~, but which in reality offers a lot of substance and entertainment; even more so if our intention is to thoroughly explore all that experience can give us and thus bring the duration of the campaign from about twenty-three hours of a quick approach to fifty or even one hundred requests if we want to complete everything 100% . Like a Dragon: Ishin!, another walk in Kyo, this time in the evening Clearly on the front of quality, detail and interactions Ishin's scenario! pays duty and cannot compete with the most recent versions of Kamurocho, Sotenbori and Isezaki Ijincho, also because it is enough to stroll through the streets and shops of ancient Kyoto to realize how the graphic layout belongs to a largely outdated generation, and in this discourse also includes the loadings (almost instantaneous on PS5, in any case) that accompany the entry into certain areas or buildings. That said, there is no doubt that the numbers of the game are eloquent and attempts have been made to pack alternative modes capable to capture our attention, above all the Another Life section in which Ryoma takes care of her country house, which she shares with the young orphan Haruka, producing ever more abundant and refined vegetables, working the catch and preparing dishes through special mini-games at the purpose of collecting the money necessary to redeem the villa. Sure, the fun of management at Cabaret Club is far away. Gameplay: a matter of style Like a Dragon: Ishin!, an easily misunderstood scene If in narrative and structural terms Like a Dragon: Ishin! boasts a system that is still pleasant and attractive today, especially for fans of the series, in terms of gameplay there are some important distinctions that need to be made. As mentioned several times, we are dealing with the remake of an episode released in 2014, but already at the time the Yakuza action formula felt a bit the weight of the years and a stubborn lack of innovations. So yes, the mechanics of game appear necessarily antiquated and unfortunately from this point of view the four different fighting styles available to Ryoma do not help much, if we consider that one is frankly ugly and impractical to use (Firefight, in which you only use the pistol) and another is strongly unbalanced and ineffective from mid-campaign onwards (Free fight, therefore with bare hands as in the classic episodes), while providing the necessary upgrades. Like a Dragon: Ishin!, one of the many fights in which we will take part The style based on the katana remains, Game of Swords, beautiful to look at and functional when you get medium-high-end equipment, although rather woody and bound in the movements by a necessarily traditional setting; and the spectacular Crazy dance, in which the character alternates sword and gun producing combinations not only with a great visual impact but also devastating in the presence of the necessary upgrades. The main novelty compared to the original Ishin! lies in the possibility of using the Trooper Cards, i.e. special cards that work in a very similar way to what was told in the review of Dynasty Warriors 9: Empires, not only inside the dungeons but also in the main map, which adds a pinch of thickness to the experience while carrying a comic and exaggerated interpretation of the fights that we would have preferred to remain confined to the old expeditions. Graphics: remake or remaster? Like a Dragon: Ishin!, Ryoma and the other characters in the remake have undergone obvious changes Like a Dragon: Ishin! technically stands as a remake of the spin-off released in 2014, in the sense that the developers have replaced various graphic assets, in particular the textures, and substantially modified the lighting system to give the characters and settings greater depth. Therefore, we didn't limit ourselves to increasing resolution and frame rate as happened for the re-editions of Yakuza 3, 4 and 5, but neither was a radical job done at Kiwami. The fact that the visual sector still has a bang today is obviously due to the extraordinary work done at the time for a project which, it should be remembered, was developed in cross-gen for PS3 and PS4. Having said that, observing the geometries, the animations, the interactions with the scenery and the transitions, the dated nature of this production inevitably emerges, which manifests itself especially in movement, with the 4K at 60 fps that are not enough to mask it. finally word for the sound, which can also count in this case on the great atmospheres ofttated by dialogues in Japanese, extremely heartfelt and convinced, and by a design that in general contributes a lot to the creation of a suggestive environment, full of charm, further enhanced by a selection of very beautiful music, starting from that of the introductory sequence.", "date": "2023-02-17", "grade": "7.5"}
