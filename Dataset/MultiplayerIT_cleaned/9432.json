However, Spiers from this point of view would not, at first glance, have any particular reason to emerge from the crowd: in fact, it can easily be classified as a classic tower defense title. What makes the Prophetic Sky game interesting is the beautiful (albeit inevitably stereotyped) story that binds the events narrated, combined with a careful and profound dubbing of the narrator, capable of transmitting strong sensations despite the zero gameplay innovations introduced . Once upon a time, so long ago The story of Spiers begins in the long mists of time, when the first Makers (literally ~the Creators~) built the known world from scratch; these sorts of demiurges, to use a philosophical term, once dead must be constantly replaced by someone, in order to avoid the cancellation (and therefore the destruction) of all the things they created. To maintain this continuity, therefore, universities were set up, with the sole purpose of training future Makers; one of the most famous, Laro, and his three promising students are entrusted with the task of defending the world from the escaped Draelus (ex rebel Maker) and from the ambiguous princess Evil, whose rhythmic hordes will tenaciously invade the symbolic places of the cultural tradition of the Makers. Once in the middle of the battle, the game concept, as already anticipated, returns to the most classic grooves of tradition: based on the resources available (consisting of mana spheres), it is possible to summon various types of defensive coils (or turrets), from place enemies along the way to hinder or deflect them. The coils, depending on the disciple engaged in defense, can be linked to the power of fire, ice or light, with always different animations and reactions (for the special ones). In fact, while the basic turrets all have the task of shooting darts, the powers linked to the higher level ones vary according to the element used; each coil then has three degrees of upgrade, to increase the range and firing frequency. Placing the defenses on special portions of land (suitably highlighted) will then bring tactical advantages, such as an increase in the mana available or the greater power and effectiveness of the attacks carried out. Even on the enemy front, there is no news of any kind: mercenaries, rangers, archers, various more or less metaphysical creatures alternate in the various waves without leaving their mark; the boss battles are decidedly more interesting, especially at the highest difficulty level. Although the map view is initially very small, optimal defense management was made possible thanks to the intuitive two-finger pitch-to-zoom. Some marginal problems can arise in the presence of contiguous coils, in the case in which one wishes, for example, to upgrade one and eliminate the other; however, a little more attention will be enough to get the situation back under control. Going forward in the main mode, it will be possible to summon extra aid, in the form of animals or objects useful for battle; available only once in the many hordes, the use of such items must undoubtedly be done with care and attention. Like any self-respecting Tower Defense, Spiers also makes longevity its strong point: certainly not for the story, which is actually very short (and destined to continue in an announced Episode 2), but for the various puzzles available at the end of the main quest, i.e. the Gauntlet mode and the classic Survival. In the first, you will have to defend yourself from the hordes with various types of turrets chosen by the CPU, while the Survival Mode will measure the survival time of increasingly powerful enemy waves. Technically, the game has a somewhat retro, albeit pleasant, feel to it; the characters are very small, but the animations of the coils and the colors in general are quite appreciated. Note of merit, however, to the narrator's dubbing, capable of immersing the player in a mystical and fascinating context thanks to the excellent setting and courtly timbre. Finally, we point out the compatibility with Game Center, even if obviously there is no type of multiplayer.
