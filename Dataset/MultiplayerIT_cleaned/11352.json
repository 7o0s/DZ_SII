{"name": "Speed Racer - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/speed-racer-recensione_a.html", "text": "Racing & punches If you have seen ~Speed Racer~ at the cinema or you remember the old cartoon series from which the film is based, you will be well aware of the type of races in which the protagonist participates aboard his ultra-technological racing car. These are events marked by improprieties, in which the cars not only travel at an almost supersonic speed, but are equipped with the most varied gadgets: missiles, blades, spurs and so on. To defend ourselves from the inevitable attacks of our opponents, therefore, we will find ourselves having to practice the so-called ~karate car~, or rather we will have to ram the other cars after having made some jumps with a twist. This is a very important element within the gameplay of Speed Racer, which is emphasized in the Wii version but which on the DS becomes even fundamental to achieving success in each race, much more than the boosts: every time we find ourselves close to a opponent, we will have to press the B button to start a combat sequence in which whoever presses the right button at the right time wins, a bit like in rhythm games. If the attack succeeds, the car that has the worst is greatly slowed down in its race, while the winner sees the boost bar fill up. This element has also been managed differently compared to the Wii version of the game: the bar is unique and lets us enter the ~zone~ (a sort of ~state of grace~ in which we travel very fast, beating the other competitors) only when it is completely full. To activate the boost, you need to hold down the back button R, within a control system that certainly appears well organized: button A is used to accelerate, button B to jump, button Y to straighten the car in in the event of a skid, the L backbone to brake (and to perform a controlled skid) and finally the d-pad to steer and control rotation while the car is in mid-air. This DS version also includes a series of new possibilities and an interesting upgrade system: the more races you win, the more your fans are, with the result that you can use new cars for each of the available drivers. Every time we find ourselves close to an opponent, we will have to press the B button to start a combat sequence in which whoever presses the right button at the right time wins. Technical realization Speed Racer's graphics are characterized by an excellent frame rate, which makes the circuits flow with surprising fluidity and speed, without hesitation or slowdowns. The cars are well done, accompanied by visual effects that effectively emphasize certain situations (loops, stunts, drifts). The design of the tracks is excellent and the tracks are very different from each other, also and above all for the use of colours: compared to the Wii version, the shades used are decidedly more ~classic~ than ~acidic~, but the final result is equally great. The action is accompanied by a series of fairly well-made music, engaging enough and well paced, while the effects are average. The organization of the commands is excellent, as already mentioned, and the use of the back keys is reduced enough to be able to withstand long gaming sessions. The response to inputs is immediate and precise, but it must also be said that the peculiar characteristics of the DS have not been exploited in the least: stylus and touch screen are never called into question. Comment We are faced with an excellent tie-in, perhaps less engaging than the Wii version but with a greater depth, thanks to the possibility of using different cars for each driver, which are unlocked as the number of our fans increases. The approach to the races is different, and on DS the fights count for a lot, perhaps too much: every time you spot an opponent it is a good idea to try to hit him, because it is a simpler maneuver than the banal overtaking (and, above all, produces better results). The graphics are really great and flow very smoothly: a feast for the eyes. In short, Speed Racer turns out to be a really nice surprise even on Nintendo DS: the ideal purchase if you are looking for a fast and fun arcade racing game. Pros Smooth and colorful graphics Numerous unlockable cars Fun and adrenaline-pumping Cons Limited ~combat~ system No online multiplayer Track action too oriented towards clashes", "date": "2008-06-19", "grade": null}
