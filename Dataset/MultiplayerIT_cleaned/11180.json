In this case through the practice of Yoga, one of the orthodox systems of Hindu philosophy from which Western practice has drawn some aspects such as meditation, breath control exercises and asanas (the famous ~positions~ with which Yoga is commonly identified). Unfortunately, the result offered by this software for DS is far from satisfactory, due to a series of sins that we can consider capitals that affect its enjoyable and productive use. But let's analyze things step by step: the first thing we are asked to do (after having accepted a disclosure for use) is to register our profile, entering name and weight. We will then be asked to do a breathing test which will record our exhalation/inhalation values. At this point we will be able to choose the most suitable method for us between ~Power Yoga~ and ~Tailored Yoga~. Daily Power Yoga involves learning a four-day sequence and is aimed at oxygenation. Every day we will have to perform a series of figures, the first of which we will take as an example. After having accepted a second disclosure on the risks that we will run if we execute the figure without respecting the suggestions given, we can move on to the lesson relating to ~greeting to the sun~. On the upper screen of the DS, a figure will show us how we will have to continue in the exercise, essentially a bending with straight legs, and how we will have to keep breathing. And we immediately notice the limit of this software: not making use of vocal support (the program is substantially devoid of any recorded indication, the only soundtrack is a boring ambient music) it is absolutely impossible to perform the exercises and at the same time use the stylus to give commands to the console and control the rhythm of breathing as indicated to us. Unless we grow a pair of eyes behind our necks, of course. This problem, in addition to forcing us to break the rhythm that should be regular in the performance of our exercises, completely nullifying its meaning and purpose, is even dangerous in some more advanced figures that require the maintenance of a certain balance. For example: during exercises, the ~dot~ key may flash on the touch screen to indicate when caution is needed during execution. But in the event that you are in a position of delicate balance how can you use the stylus to discover the ~more information~ of the moment? Maybe while we're in arc position? To these questions, the only answer we feel like giving is to get supported, in our lessons, by a partner who illustrates what happens on the screen. Necessity for our safety and to make the software usable which, unfortunately, nullifies its ~do-it-yourself~ nature. Comment My personal yoga trainer is a product that we do not feel like recommending to anyone who intends to approach the world of meditation and yoga positions. In fact, its defects make it absolutely unusable, forcing us to interrupt the performance of any exercise and therefore lose position and breathing to interact through the stylus with the console. In fact, the absence of voice commands makes it impossible to follow the screen while one should be concentrated in positions that require attention, potentially also exposing us to the risk of loss of balance and consequent fall. A failed experiment, therefore, due to the lack of exploitation of the console's capabilities. Pros: Interesting themes on paper Cons: Dangerous if used alone No voice commands Impossible to perform positions and control the screen at the same time", "date": "2008-09-22", "grade": null}
