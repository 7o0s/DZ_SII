We take inspiration from the genre of roguelike RPGs, characterized by high difficulty and procedurally generated levels, which has spread like wildfire after the success of titles such as The Binding of Isaac, Spelunky and Rogue Legacy ( actually the genre was born at the end of the seventies, but let's skip it). After a trial period, many began to graft this technique onto various genres, thinking it was the key to making the perfect game for the public on every occasion. Unfortunately, several recent examples have shown us that this is not the case. If Daylight by Zombie Studios, recently released on PC and PlayStation 4, has already failed to bring procedural levels and the horror genre together, today it's up to Sir, You Are Being Hunted to repeat the same failure. If we think about what works in successful rogue-likes, some key elements immediately come to mind: the ever-changing levels, the demanding challenge, the taste for discovering hidden content and unlocking it and so on. Someone will also indicate another element, no less important than the others: the brevity of the individual matches, in which there is no dead time. Let's also point out another fact and mix it all up: Most roguelikes that work are 2D. Obviously ours are not canons and we don't want to say that a 3D game with procedural levels, where the games last for hours, can't work regardless, because it would be superb of us to say so (also because there are virtuous examples like Tower of Guns which they work great). But it is clear that the adoption of the third dimension opens up specific problems in the design phase, which, if added to a complicated genre like the horror one, based above all on the ability of the story and the scenario to involve the player, as well as on the of or of the protagonist with the unknown, can lead to frictions. Will the roguelike structure also be able to penetrate the world of horror games? Avoidance and Search Sir, You Are Being Hunted seems to have all the right ingredients to please: mysterious story, original scenario, grotesque tones, sympathy from the development team and a very high theoretical longevity, guaranteed by the adoption of the aforementioned procedurally generated levels. Starting the first game you have to let the system create the five islands on which the adventure will take place, which can also be maintained in other games, or can be replaced by another five islands, repeating the process from scratch. The aim is to hunt for objects while avoiding being killed by some strange robots that emit beams of red light from their eyes and other implacable enemies. The first steps are really very promising: after a very short text tutorial, which is activated every time we perform a new action, we look around to see some houses, a ruined wall, a forest of very gloomy trees and even the skeleton of a church that seems to rise in the middle of nowhere. Of the interface we immediately notice the visibility indicator, which determines how much we are exposed to the sight of enemies, and the presence of two values that we will discover to be decisive for the gameplay: health, self-explanatory, and energy, which is consumed by exploring and running and which must be restored by eating the delicacies that are around. The stealth system is elementary but it works, and requires you to move constantly on your knees, perhaps passing through areas of tall grass or staying behind cover, to avoid being seen. If an enemy robot identifies us, you can always try to escape, to heal yourself calmly from the damage suffered (this applies to the early stages of the game, because in the advanced stages, escape is much more difficult and you die much more easily). There are some goodies that we are pleased to point out, such as the robots that are attracted by the glow of our camp (so you have to be really careful where you stop to rest) and by the crows that fly away from the roofs of the buildings in case of annoyance. So far everything looks good and we do not deny that in the early hours Sir, You Are Being Hunted looks like a really good game. Unfortunately this is not the case. There is too much space to fill. Empty boxes Nothing is really enough to understand that Sir, You Are Being Hunted doesn't have much to offer: going around you find very little of interest, if not repeating the same actions over and over again, and the disappointment is bitter when you discover that all the buildings are just big boxes insidewhich you can't even enter. For example, do you remember the church we mentioned earlier? Well, looking at the profile of an imposing building that emerges from the mists of a haunted place, what makes you want to do as good gamers? Go in there? Well, you can't here. Whether it's a small house in Canada, or a large castle, each building in Sir, You Are Being Hunted admits only one interaction: having identified the door, click on it to see the objects inside (mostly rubbish) . End. No exploration, no mysteries, no secrets, no nothing. It cannot be entered even to hide from pursuers. The problem is that, apart from a few objects that are used to face the robots or to help us find the seventeen fragments that are needed to finish the game, the rest of the objects are almost useless. So imagine the following playful scenario: you have to go around gigantic islands and repeatedly search the buildings as if they were crates, often moving very slowly due to the stealth mechanics. Add to that a frustrating save system, which allows you to record your progress only in the presence of monolithic stones or boats, and which therefore often results in deaths that force you to repeat long game pieces, and you realize that the prospect of replaying the entire adventure with five islands other than those assigned to you by chance in the first game can be a punishment rather than a feature.", "date": "2014-05-13", "grade": "5.8"}
