{"name": "Recensione ISS2 Pal", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-iss2-pal.html", "text": "A few options In ISS2 before and during (after pressing the pause button) each match it is possible to choose: the type of formation (4-3-3, 4-5-1... or even create one by choosing positions and propensity to 'offend' of each individual player), the players to send onto the field (some may not be in shape), the markings (zone or man) and above all the game strategies (from all in defense to all forward, through counterattack, pressing. ..). There is no lack of choice of shooters (penalties, free-kicks and corners) and the captain. Each game can be played at a different speed, in fact we will be able to choose between 9 levels. There are only three difficulty levels: easy, normal and hard. The duration of the meetings is limited to 3, 5 or 7 minutes. The controller keys are freely configurable, just as it is possible to choose the activation of the cursor on the controlled player (automatic, semi-automatic or manual) and the vibration (on or off). For friendly matches it is also possible to choose the time (day, evening, night or random), the weather conditions (clear, cloudy, rainy or random), the stadium (one of 9 or random), the referee (3 possibilities or random), the form of the players (perfect or random), the presence or absence of extra time (with a possible golden goal) and finally the clock (real time or accelerated 90 minutes). In each game, and at any time, we will be able to choose the distance (1-10) and height (1-10) of the pitch frame, for a total of 100 combinations! Control system In ISS2 we use all the keys on the controller. The response of the pad to the commands given by us is always fast (just enough) and precise. To move the players we can either use the left stick or the digital cross. To shoot we press the blue button (X), to make a pass we use the green button (A), to make a cross or a high pass we press the red button (B) and for the through ball we press the yellow button (Y). With the white and black keys we perform one-two 'close to the ground' and one-two 'high' respectively. The right trigger is needed to sprint/run, while with the left one we select the player to control (if we have set the manual 'cursor change' in the options). If we press the right stick and move in one of the four directions we can select one of the tactics chosen before starting the race (however modifiable at any time of the game by pressing the pause key). The functions of the buttons change depending on whether you are defending or controlling the goalkeeper. To avoid making the review excessively heavy, we can still say that it is possible to dribble, slide, shoulder, trip, give effect to a shot, let the goalkeeper out (just hold down 'Y') ... Important to mention is the system designed to carry out free kicks or corner kicks. The interface, even if questionable from an aesthetic point of view, is very functional; in fact, we can decide the height of the shot/cross, the power (press once to start the yellow bar and then it is necessary to 'confirm' before it reaches the limit) and the effect (once the power has been chosen, the cursor will go back and we will have to stop it to the right or left of a hypothetical neutral zone, represented by a black dash, to obtain the desired effect). Certainly much easier to accomplish than to explain in words. To increase familiarity with the interface we can take advantage of the training mode (specifying free kicks). The word to the field... Let's get straight to the point by stating that ISS2 is halfway between a 'classic' ISS (therefore arcade) and a Pro Evolution (defined by all as the football 'simulation' par excellence). It happens that building actions is quite simple (even getting to the shot is) but from here to score in clusters there is a lot of it. Thanks to an excellent AI in the defensive phase (even without resorting to man marking) we will not suffer crushing defeats from the CPU. Many 'advances' will be automatic (a bit like in PES) as well as seeing your men return to defense to hold their position. Close matches in midfield will be frequent, often to score you will have to shoot many times as the goalkeepers skill is high (perhaps a bit too much). The satisfaction of achieving a well-deserved goal will make you rejoice (it happened to me). ISS2 like 'real' football will give you all the emotions you are looking for, even the negative ones; you will curse when alone in front of the goalkeeper you will kick over the crossbar! The anegative aspects are not lacking (as happens for every title): what irritated me the most is the management of the view: when you score with shots from outside the area, the camera immediately follows the author of the goal without letting us 'taste' the ball at the bottom of the bag. The ball-player collision system is not convincing and sometimes there is the annoying 'magnet effect' (especially in the stops) or even worse the goalkeepers reject the ball without actually touching it. Fortunately, these last aspects do not affect the more than good playability. Graphics Let's start with the creation of the players. Each model is composed of a high number of polygons and the proportions of the body are respected. The most famous footballers (Totti, Raul, Figo, Rui Costa, Beckham, Rivaldo, Batistuta...) enjoy an impressive virtual alter ego for similarity. Unfortunately, there are no facial expressions on the face but only a hint of the lip when scoring a goal or suffering a disciplinary sanction. The numerous animations of the players are overall of good quality, except for some 'accelerated' movements of the goalkeepers who sometimes throw themselves and fall back on the pitch in the blink of an eye. Every now and then, depending on the number of players on the screen, the fluidity of the animations fails (nothing important anyway) or rather, in 'crowded' situations, the graphics engine 'eats' a few frames. The speed of the game remains almost constant. The shadows are exceptional, complete and truly realistic on some pitches. The lighting effects (especially during the day) that can be seen in stadiums with particular structures (or rather those that project 'complex' shadows on the pitch) are simply superlative. The 4 shadows (around each player) that can be appreciated during matches illuminated by the spotlights are also excellent. Now let's talk about the stadiums (9 in total). The impression they give is good even if the textures used leave something to be desired. The textures used to represent the fans are sufficient, while the waving of the flags is good. The playgrounds are probably the 'Achilles heel' of ISS2; some of them are awful, both in the feeling of blur they offer and in terms of the choice of colors. Unfortunately there is no trace of bump mapping and this is especially noticeable when the view is lowered to let us take a 'set piece' (free kicks from the  and corner kicks). Luckily some of the pitches are passable and, thanks to the dynamic lighting, it looks much better. We also mention a few graphic goodies that the title offers us. On the pitch there are the referees and the fourth official in charge of signaling injury time (but it is not always possible to appreciate it, you will have to 'hope' for an interruption of play around the 45th and 90th minutes) and substitutions ( very choreographic even if it 'forces' the Xbox to show us the black screen for a couple of seconds, due to loading). On the sidelines there are microphones and cameras that rotate according to where the game action takes place. There are numerous and satisfying scenes of exultation after scoring a goal. Ball physics All in all, the physics of the ball is convincing even if, in high passes, it seems that the friction offered by the ground, after the rebound, is excessive (in other words, the ball is sometimes too 'heavy' and not very elastic). Long passes close to the ground, on the other hand, suffer from the opposite phenomenon, in fact they seem to 'slip' away. Setting a game speed between 1 and 5 these phenomena are less noticeable. Replays The replays of ISS2 disappointed me as it is not possible to rotate the camera to better appreciate the goals scored. Luckily you can save them to your HD (or memory card) and review them via the goal gallery option. Sound The sound effects are on average discreet: some stadium chants are good while some repetitive musical accompaniments from the stands are mediocre. The worst effect is the one used to underline the bounce of the ball: really bad (it's similar to that of a basketball bouncing on the parquet). The sound effects of when it is kicked and of the shot hitting a post or crossbar are excellent. The commentary, completely in Italian, is pertinent even if sometimes the comments don't reflect what was seen on the field. A bit boring, as repeated several times, the phrase And here, dear friends, has really demanded ua little too much. The emphasis given to the description of the various game actions (shot that hits the post, scoring a goal, booked...) is almost always spot on. It is exhilarating to listen to the stadium speaker announcing the scoring of a goal, while we 'enjoy' the replay. To conclude... ISS2 proved to be a good title (defects included) full of interesting ideas (interface for taking free kicks and corner kicks above all) and more realistic than one might expect. ISS for N64 and PES for PlayStation2 are the previous titles that Konami was 'inspired' to create this ISS2, skilfully mixing the arcade features of the first and the attention to detail of the second. Ultimately it is undoubtedly a title that should please everyone. Pros: Comprehensive Editor Player and Shadow Realization Immediate and immersive Goalkeeper skills AI in defense Cons: Limited replays Stupid camera on goal Horrible textures for some pitches Collision system not always accurate Materials: Tips Video Exclusive to ISS2 Presentation After a long wait, Konami's first football proposal for our beloved Xbox has finally arrived among us. After a somewhat original presentation, accompanied by a beautiful piece of music, we are ready to press start to start playing. The menu that appears to our eyes is animated and pleasant, has background music (cannot be excluded) and is completely in Italian even if it has incorrect translations. We can choose between Friendly Match, International Cup, Custom Championship, World Championship, Training and finally Options. If we choose Friendly match we can play alone against the CPU or, if there are other friends with us, we can have fun up to a maximum of 4 (1 against 3, 2 against two 2s,...). The international cup is the World Cup mode, and is designed for the single player; we can choose one of the 58 national teams available (there is even Jamaica) and embark on the world adventure going from the qualification rounds (3 races) to the coveted world final. In the personalized championship, on the other hand, up to 8 players can take part (8 teams max) who will be able to face each other in one-way matches or in round-trip matches. In the World Championship mode (wrong translation) you can choose whether to participate in a cup between European teams or between teams from the American continent. The training mode turns out to be absolutely essential to become familiar with the set pieces, described below. Unfortunately it is not possible to carry out any type of training to kick/save penalties (fortunately to kick them just press 'X' and give the direction with the left lever; the same goes for parrying). In the Options menu we can decide whether or not to listen to the commentary (also in Italian), save automatically, modify the players and teams, access the goals gallery (after having saved them on HD) and load/save the data in special slots of the HD. Noteworthy are the options that allow us to completely edit the players (name, height, weight, hair color, skin color, technical skills...). In addition to this, it is possible to create our favorite players from scratch and replace them with the existing ones (later we will have to save), or modify a team (choose the 22 starters from the 33 available, change the name, shirt number and even the uniform! As an example, I can say that there are forty types of knits!). In short, we have a very complete editor available! Of course, if we were to mess things up, it will always be possible to bring the team database back to its default conditions.", "date": "2002-05-12", "grade": null}
