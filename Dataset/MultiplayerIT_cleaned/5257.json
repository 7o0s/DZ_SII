Thinking about that Nintendo 64 cartridge nostalgia and memories merge; the impression, in writing this incipit, is that an avalanche of years have passed, yet no. Just sixteen have passed - we repeat -. Sure, it's not a little: some readers weren't even born, others babies or barely teenagers. However, it is an incredible amount of time if you stop to analyze what is left today of that non (or in any case less) mainstream videogame era. Well, a little, just a few survivors who are still trying to break through the wall of anonymity of the new generations of players. Because the bulk of those who play video games today, either for personal reasons or for affinity of taste, will hardly ever seriously get their hands on an exponent of the Paper Mario saga. And the developer Intelligent Systems knows this. The gaming industry needs economic sustainability, but also quality to satisfy historical fans; and then you need ideas, you need the experience of knowing how to tell a story without making anyone who is experiencing it boring. Everything is even more difficult if the graphic style used winks at the target of players who are not easily categorized, who are equally difficult to satisfy in their search for the pleasure of playing. Paper Mario: Color Splash goes exactly in this direction, taking a step forward towards a difficult horizon: the search for a niche of connoisseurs, ever more eager than today for a product that is not perfect but more than appreciable in the sum of its parts. While not perfect, Paper Mario: Color Splash entertains with unsurpassed craftsmanship! Paper worlds If you have followed news and previews, if the general chatter about the title has fascinated you up to now, then you know very well that the focus of Paper Mario: Color Splash is not the combat system. Attention: this absolutely does not mean that the attention dedicated to it is little, nor that the artisan skill of the developers has failed for once. It is that it is clear how much Intelligent Systems this time wants you to enter a world in the first place and tell you a Paper Mario-style fairy tale. And then - and only then - let you use the GamePad to give free rein to their extraordinary authorial madness. What awaits those who trust the team is a carefree, vibrant world, delicate in establishing itself with a sublime but very, very funny and refined artistic style in the proposition of scripted dialogues and interventions. And then, well, comes everything else. We understand that we might seem simplistic, but we see no better way to present you the new Intelligent Systems effort than to tell you what Paper Mario: Color Splash has really given us and is still giving us, that is, many pleasant moments, able to make us smile and stimulate us to eagerly await the next line of dialogue. There is little to do: at the narrative level this is a product written and orchestrated with great skill. There is no cinematographic research, you will not find pomposity or Hollywood recipes, only and exclusively a superfine grace in proposing a constant whirlwind of dialectical ideas, brilliant exchanges, puns and funny characters. It is from this substrate that we must start, otherwise the risk of trivializing the design choices adopted is just around the corner. Starting right from the least memorable part, the combat. Bunches and mauls Against all odds, Intelligent Systems implements the card system of its predecessor Sticker Star without losing some typical rhythm game traits of the Mario&Luigi saga, but further simplifying the factors involved. With up to 99 cards available, the deck can be scrolled on the GamePad, the card will then be placed on a board with variable slots. Then the color phase is activated - collectable by interacting with almost every element in the levels - which will determine the strength of the blow, and in succession the activation of the chosen cards. Each stage is carried forward by pressing the ~Done~ key, with the result that the flow greatly relaxes input handling. If we combine the almost non-existence of any advancement factor - except for life points - we arrive at the conclusion that combat is a planet in its own right, where collecting stronger or already colored cards becomes a sufficient (not necessary) condition for advance without major problems. This is not necessarily a criticism, simply a line drawn under the concept expressed above: considering the original combat system of the first Paper Mario, deepened with the Millennial Portal but then abandoned and made more casual with Super Paper Marior - a full-fledged platformer - and tacked on a card system with Sticker Star, the direction of the team is clear. Unfortunately, the desired simplicity of the system gives way to fairly immediate gameplay strategies: as soon as you have enough coins to buy the desired cards, advancing through the levels becomes more of a pro forma than anything else. Fun, sometimes sparkling but clearly an accessory part of the entire system, which directs the real playful fulcrum to the evergreen backtracking, exploration and a couple of goodies. Scissor nib We were saying, back tracking, precisely that element so strictly a child of level design. If this works, the rest is cascading. Thankfully, the skill of Intelligent Systems - now a master of level building thanks to the recent and successful puzzle experience on the Nintendo 3DS - is second to many others. The decision to set up a Super Mario World-style isometric map is not trivial: each level is thus limited in its size, setting, in its elements that can be activated and peculiar characteristics. All factors that help the team in the narrative, proposed in leaps from one level to another, from one character to the next, with non-pioneering but absolutely tantalizing gameplay brackets in the middle. We add the element of color, in every sense: the ability to use the hammer to paint or complete sections of the level without paint - by the way, carried away guess who? - provides the player with a completionist scale that will make him alternate between advancing and stopping in already visited levels. Furthermore, since we are talking about paper, Intelligent Systems inserts a slightly minor but welcome gameplay feature: the scenario gap. In certain situations, the GamePad becomes a palette where you can cut out parts of the screen to allow Paper Mario to advance or certain triggers to be activated thanks to the use of specific cards. In short, it is clear that there is nothing epochal in all this, but it is precisely the developer's ambition not to go in a direction that undermines what has already been acquired by enthusiasts, with a view to usability that manages to address multiple intervals personal data. The team really seems to want to whisper a quantity of pleasant elements to be savored individually which together enrich the picture, succeeding and winning its bet even if not at the table. Brilliant lines There are however two elements in which Color Splash really shines: the script of the dialogues and the technical/artistic system. For the first, it is easy to say: applause to anyone in Frankfurt who has taken care to carry out the localization because the landing in Italian is applause. The puns, the jokes, the intelligent reflection in the common speaking of some lines of dialogue made universal in an absolutely non-trivial way, the sentences and the personality of Tinto, Mario's assistant, the sympathy of the Toads. It shouldn't be easy to make people laugh with such innocence, yet Color Splash will give you spontaneous smiles, always correct in choosing the dictionary, suitable and usable for all ages. On the other hand, looking at the artistic side, we are again faced with an excellence, once again with a cartoonish style, once again with a unique paper personality that envelops every element of every scenario. The faces of the supporting actors, the postures of the enemies, the environmental and architectural elements are rendered with such attention to detail and with such an aesthetic taste that you will have to work hard not to become attached to the visual proposal of Color Splash. Last sound note: the internal composer of Intelligent Systems has once again hit the mark, with a lineup that makes excellent jazz his favorite base on which to build the arrangements.", "date": "2016-10-05", "grade": "8.5"}
