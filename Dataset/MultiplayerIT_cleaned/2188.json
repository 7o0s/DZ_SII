{"name": "Maximo: Ghosts to Glory", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/maximo-ghosts-to-glory_a.html", "text": "Shields, spells and ~spade de foco~... Having said that, it seems right to me to introduce the weapons and various bells and whistles system that haunts the Capcom title, in short: throwing weapons have practically disappeared, shields and armor break after lowering a counter, weapons acquire special abilities as well as our alter ego, and last but not least, the search for Koins and diamonds is encouraged as various bonuses can be bought at decidedly high prices in the levels. Let's go back to the attack system: the basic sword blows are normally 4, normal, rotating blow, with two hands to cut the body into two symmetrical parts (if it were possible ..) and as in Sega's dear Golden Ax double jump and blow perpendicular to the ground which hurts a lot (also used to activate checkpoints). These basic attacks will be joined by other special ones that are released as you progress in the game from chests and enemies: combos, special hits, rotating shields and fire properties are the first you encounter. All these attack possibilities are easy to learn and equally easy to implement, so it can be said that the control system does its job very well, even if you have to be very careful when attacking an opponent. As in a fighting game, timing is a must: if a shot doesn't hit you risk your opponent hitting you back and the view isn't much help unfortunately...; We also have the parry key but it won't be used very often. Nostalgic graphics and sound Graphically, the game is a feast for the eyes: the fluidity is exceptional, and the animations are very good. The special effects are also of fine workmanship: flames, flying souls and ghosts who exhale (?) their last breath are made with extreme care as has rarely been seen so far. In terms of textures, however, the music changes: the quality is generally very high, especially as regards our alter ego and various skeletons and monsters, just focus on shields, white underpants with little hearts and various reflections on helmets and armor, while those that were once called backdrops can be perplexing. From afar everything seems to be done extremely well, and to tell the truth if you get close to a wall or a rock ridge, the applied textures do not lose detail and remain defined and intelligible. What we don't like, however, is the extreme flatness of the whole: it seems to be back to German expressionist cinema like ~the cabinet of Dr. Caligari~, in short, the polygonal models and related textures look like large painted sheets rather than solid polygons. The backdrops, a term has never seemed more appropriate, look like theatrical sets created with maniacal care, but which definitely clash with the visual richness of the moving characters. Same thing for some of the ground textures of the cemeteries, very nice and detailed, but incredibly flat. The direction of the game is not excellent: if the cut of the oblique shots is decidedly unsettling and atmospheric, the impossibility of rotating the camera to our liking is certainly a point against Maximo. You will often find yourself impaling enemies and ravines with the consequent loss of life; we also have a button that allows us to automatically center the shot but it seems more like a sort of extreme help than something placed there to help us explore the levels, like saying bugs and sudden patches. very high: suffice it to say that the background themes are clear reinterpretations of the music of the two classics of the good old days (listen to the music of the options menu); various effects and samples are also at very high levels. Here we sing and carry the cross, cross and delight: Playability. And now let's talk about the playability, cross and delight of the Capcom title. The first thing that catches the eye is the high degree of difficulty of the title, a real point of contact with its two predecessors. Although learning the commands is easy and intuitive, during the first few games you will crack a large number of times and given the small number of continues and saves, you immediately understand what kind of title you are dealing with. Challenging, tough and sanguine, getting to the end is certainly a real feat, there is no final scene, easter egg or gallery that holds, finishing the game has never been so damn satisfying. However, there is a downside, all of this is paid for today as then in terms of blasphemy caused bywidespread frustration syndrome. The excessive difficulty, combined with a poor implementation of the camera which, as I said, alters our perception of the collisions and jumps to be made, will lead the less patient souls to the threshold of defenestration of the pad. Since the saves are sipped, repeating entire sections because it was wrong once again to jump because you can't see the other bank, would make even the most blessed of saints lose his patience: the Tomb Raider syndrome strikes again .. Ultimately the only real flaw (or value depending on the reader) lies in the level of difficulty, never so high in a current production. Those who have played with the putative fathers of this title will find in Maximo the only true heir to a long tradition that flourished in obscure and infamous arcades. Probably more than Mario64, Maximo has not just succeeded in the feat, despite the use of 3D, of not altering the spirit of his fathers. In other words, the excessive use of polygons and textures has probably never been so respectful of its origins: the three dimensions are all there, but luckily for us they are only a matter of graphics. Beautiful and impossible, quoting Gianna Nannini Pros Excellent animations and textures of the characters Perfect in recreating the spirit of the two predecessors Cons Extremely flat backdrop textures Very difficult and frustrating Ineffective camera implementation 3D killed the 2D stars? Plagiarism, copy or postmodern? None of the three, more simply an act of love towards a couple of titles that in the 80s and 90s were the main cause of blasphemies that flooded the air better and more than any exhaust fumes: in short, we are talking about Ghost n' Goblins and its sequel, Ghouls n' Ghosts, made by Capcom of course. Not that Maximo is the exact 3D transposition of the two previous titles, we can frame it from the point of view of the aforementioned act of love: practically every main feature of the title derives heavily from its predecessors, the character, weapons, enemies and construction of the levels in I am a clear example. It has been said that we are dealing with a 3D game: this has led to a radical change in terms of exploration, in fact we manage our alter ego in the same way as any Crash Bandicoot, or rather like 99, 99% platformer in 3D, over-the-shoulder camera and great freedom of movement . If in Castlevania for PsOne the little freedom of movement imposed by the two dimensions was sublimated by the retracing of the levels based on hidden skills, here and now the designers of the title allow us to deviate from the track that leads us to the end of the level through small detours that normally they are rewarded with chests or various coins.", "date": "2002-03-21", "grade": null}
