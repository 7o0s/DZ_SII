{"name": "Astral Chain", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/astral-chain-recensione.html", "text": "Astral Chain - review: considering that it was born from the ashes of the glorious Clover Studio, whose original role was to bring together some of the most irrepressible talents of the ~old~ Capcom, the fact that PlatinumGames is today seen as one of the best forges of talent in the world of Japanese development shouldn't come as a surprise. It is a team that is often difficult to manage, where internal upheavals are not lacking and not all projects are necessarily successful, but whose cult of beautiful games has influenced and evolved the entire action genre, training many young people with the potential to become tomorrow what today are figures like Kamiya, Mikami and Inaba. Among them, the most promising recruit is undoubtedly Takahisa Taura: a rather shy boy, endowed with the ability to always forcefully give his mark to the titles on which he works; certainly not underestimated talent in an industry where the majority of designers keep retracing paths already traced by others in the past. Consecrated by Nier Automata (a game which, moreover, has boosted the team's non-florid finances when it was most needed) and closely followed by some of the greatest luminaries of Japanese gaming, the good Takahisa has therefore earned the right to face his final test: to fill the role of director of a new video game called Astral Chain. In short, wanting to forcibly paint PlatinumGames as a sort of video game university, and the previous games Taura worked on as her main exams, Astral Chain can easily pass for the degree thesis of this eclectic designer. Therefore today, in the guise of the ~examination commission~, we are ready to evaluate it... and we assure you that it is not the case to forget the praise. A structure with no weak links After completing Astral Chain, painting it as a summation of experiences seems to us the only possible move. After all, this game is yes an action equipped with the usual extraordinary spectacularity that we have come to expect from Platinum titles, yet it is one of the most solid agglomerations of ideas ever to emerge from the house, capable of merging its main characteristics into a single and explosive experience where , although the fight is always the protagonist, the remaining parts of the whole do not look bad in direct comparison. In fact, there is no need to be deceived by the fact that it is a debut feature by a young director, or with a less flashy technical aspect than that of other action blockbusters in circulation: Astral Chain is not in any universe considered as a ~secondary project~, and indeed it is a painstakingly cared for work, capable of constantly leaving anyone who decides to dive into his world speechless. Indeed, it could easily compete for a position in the ~top 3~ of the Japanese software house, and it is certainly not a statement we make lightly. Much of the credit goes to the perfect management of the pace of the game, which keeps you glued to the screen mercilessly despite a progression that is anything but fulminant (but not slow, mind you). The narrative accompanies the action in a great way, with very suitable ~shonen manga~ tones and a storyline which, although not without ingenuity and trivial moments, is tantalizing for the entire duration of the campaign, also by virtue of a rather well-rounded science fiction background. studied. Thus, more experienced users do not run the risk of feeling excessively limited during the first hours, since the calm general progress of the mechanics is made adrenaline-pumped by the whirlwind of events into which one is catapulted from the first chapters. The fact that the complex combat system around which everything revolves is fed to the player in small spoonfuls is therefore a brilliant move, and leads to gradually learning the pros and cons of each Legion, how to adapt to the enemy offensive, and how to develop one's own character to be ready for any situation. In other words... Astral Chain is designed to prevent any type of user from feeling bored, be it an action neophyte (for which, moreover, there is the possibility of tackling everything in an easier way) or a beating veteran virtual. Standing on a legion Since we have taken out the Legions just above, it is appropriate to go into the detail of the combat system, because when you decide to dive into battles, Astral Chain provides such an ocean of systems and brilliant inventions as to risk drowning a player reluctant to waste time. Everything revolves around these Legions, in fact: ~trained~ versions of multidimensional creatures known as Chimeras,and only means for humanity to survive their attacks (which in the game have already forced the population to flee the earth by taking refuge on a huge space island called the ~Ark~). You will start with only one of these summons, however as you progress through the chapters you will get five, each with specific development branches and skills that can be equipped at will. However, these powers are not the only useful element of your floating companions, because the Legions can be hurled mercilessly against the various enemies of the game, actively used to perform special actions, manually moved around the battlefield at will, and exploited to block or fend off opponents thanks to an energy chain that binds them to (or to, since you can choose their gender at the start of the game and customize their appearance) protagonist. Your alter ego is in fact equipped with quite basic combinations and a transformable truncheon that can turn into a gun or a sort of broadsword, but you shouldn't expect particularly striking kung fu moves or complex combinations in solitude from him. The advanced mechanics are all directly related to the summons and their use, and you will be able to implement truly devastating series only after having unlocked some specific combos (which can be activated by pressing the same key in time used to recall the Legions during certain maneuvers), or skills that have strong synergy with each other. To give you a clearer example: Some Legions are particularly suitable for stunning the enemy due to their speed, while others are perfect if used in a devastating offensive; just chain someone down (you just need to swing the Legion around the target) and stun the remaining dangers with the proper technique, then move directly to the next Legion, power up, and unleash a brutal burst attack capable of disintegrate almost any chimera. This is just a basic example, moreover, because the game offers plenty of choice when it comes to strategies: in fact, you may also want to stay in the rear and shoot by sending particularly resistant heavy Legions forward; lure flying enemies to you to slaughter them while standing; or even cover you with shields with the Legion Axe, release it on enemies, and go on the attack with the Legion Bow from afar well protected, while it unloads blows on anyone who gets in front of it. Gameplay like a Swiss army knife See it this way: if V of Devil May Cry 5 could be considered a valuable but only partially successful attempt by Capcom to create a modern - and valid - version of the gameplay of Chaos Legion (an old classic based on the concept of summonable monsters), Astral Chain is what is born when a team like Platinum starts from that idea to structure an entire combat system: a real pleasure for any heart-pounding action aficionado. Then there is a further gem to fully improve the experience, or the ~puzzle element~ of almost every advanced battle. The diversification of enemies is still impressive here, and some of these are equipped with abilities that can nullify your attacks, stun you, or generally make things much more complicated than they should be. The judicious use of the Legions during similar situations allows to bypass such obstacles, since each of them has, as already mentioned, the ability to perform special actions: the Legion Beast digs up burrowing enemies, the Ax is capable of detonating barriers energies and parry large projectiles, the Sword of cutting the connections between the offensive chimeras and those capable of enhancing them, and so on. That wasn't enough, all these actions translate very naturally within the exploratory and investigation phases, giving shape to that balance between the parts that we rejoiced in at the beginning of the article. The various chapters of Astral Chain, in fact, are not a simple succession of battles, but offer slower and more reasoned interludes, where the player has the opportunity to help the population of the Ark in various ways (he still plays a police officer) , or must travel the psychedelic dimension maps of the Chimeras. There are many secondary missions of this type, and even if some are nothing more than additional fights or minor fetch quests, the variety of tasks remains very remarkable thanks to the diversification of the Legion's talents necessary to solve the environmental puzzles present. A praise therefore to the originality of the Platinum Games, which have been able to make even missions that require the delivery of a large ice cream to a child challenging and amusing. As for the alternative dimension instead, albeit with onescarce artistic variety of settings, you will find often surprisingly complex maps waiting for you, so much so that you willingly push yourself to waste a few hours looking for all the chests hidden among the red crystals that fill them, or looking for the right combination of powers to advance. This subdivision of the phases of the Astral Chain campaign leads the longevity to far exceed that of other pure action, so much so that it will take you about twenty hours of play to complete the main story. Care in the technical realization and lethality However, we are facing a Platinum title, and as such its longevity is certainly not limited to just completing the campaign. Even in Astral Chain replayability is an integral part of the product - each battle and secondary red quest assigns you a score - and indeed, precisely because of the Legions, retracing the already completed chapters is particularly recommended, since right from the start you will find optional blocked areas explorable only with certain summons obtainable only later (so you will not be able to get the highest scores without having them all available). Fortunately, you can replay the previous chapters thanks to a comfortable terminal in your office. Also for completionists, Astral Chain contains an internal achievement system complete with rewards in the form of items and customizations, and a system of modifiable costumes and colors that demonstrates a considerable effort from the team in developing every single aspect of their creature (there's even a terminal where you can clean your Legions of crystals from the alternate dimension, as if to mimic the ~brushing~ phases of recent Pokmon). So everything is flawless? Not exactly; on the other hand, perfection is not a thing of this world, and even Taura and her people, however skilled, make mistakes. In the case of Astral Chain, part of the problems depend on the frame rate (which unfortunately does not exceed 30 fps, with rare drops in the most agitated situations) and on some other gameplay flaws, clearly not sufficient to ruin it but still capable of preventing it from overcoming this aspect other classics of the genre such as the aforementioned Devil May Cry 5, or Bayonetta itself. In fact, to adapt to the frame rate, the game's dodge boasts a window of invulnerability that cannot be underestimated, but at the same time a recovery period after moving longer than usual, which prevents the use of this defensive maneuver in bursts. There is obviously no shortage of alternative protective options - a well-timed evocation of a Legion is equivalent to a perfect parry with counterattack, and the Legion Ax materializes defensive shields - yet the dryness of the maneuver can catch you off guard, and sometimes the combination of powers enemies makes it really difficult to come out unscathed from certain series of combined attacks (also for this reason, the final score seems to be influenced very little by the damage received). It's not a choice that everyone will like, but it makes sense at least to respect the rhythm of the fights; camera and targeting are less good, with the first having the usual flaws of many action (sometimes it is too close, and with the considerable number of enemies on the screen or the need to follow your own Legion it can become confusing), and the second which does not always point to the closest enemy, creating some difficulties with specific opponents capable of making the other chimeras invulnerable (which for obvious reasons should be eliminated as soon as possible). Impossible to penalize so much a combat system so atypical and successful for similar things, however. Astral Chain may not reach the almost fighting game technicalities of the latest Devil May Cry as Nero and Dante, or the perfect marriage of fluidity and complexity of the two Bayonettas, but its formula so far from tradition - and the incredible flexibility of the itself once you learn how to properly combine the Legions - places it without a shadow of a doubt among the best action games around, plus a seriously more sophisticated and enjoyable ~side dish~ compared to the games mentioned above (and the vast majority of Japanese action games in circulation). Just think, as the icing on the cake there is also a rather amusing local cooperative, which allows another player to use your Legions. If a respectable soundtrack is added to all this goodness - with sudden genre changes and some masterful accompaniments in the most impressive scenes - the final result is without a doubt one of the most successful titles for Nintendo Switch.", "date": "2019-08-26", "grade": "9.2"}
