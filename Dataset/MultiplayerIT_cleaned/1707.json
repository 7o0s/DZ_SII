{"name": "Road to Rome Battlefield1942 Expansion", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/road-to-rome-battlefield1942-expansion.html", "text": "Rollin' around the town From Anzio to the Strait of Sicily, up to Montecassino, this is more or less the gist of the Road to Rome maps. To maintain a certain common thread, the graphics (textures, etc.) of the 6 new battlefields are the same: barren textures, pseudo-Mediterranean trees and about a dozen models of houses, hovels and other accessories to give you the idea of run around the lawns of our house. Certainly better than the original textures in any case, even if I often had the impression of being more in Greece than in Italy. However the maps are pretty big, larger on average than those in the original game: maps like Operation Husky perform very well if played on 50-person servers, on our meager 32-person Italian servers you feel ~a bit lonely~ and it loses a bit the feeling of being in the middle of a battlefield. Generally speaking, the quality level of the maps is quite high, but you should send a nice postcard to DICE to show them what the strait that separates Sicily and Calabria looks like, because from the ~Baytown~ map it is clear that we don't have the slightest idea . The new toys... Even the fleet of BF1942 has been updated, apart from the APCs and the various jeeps, most of the tanks are brand new: all the old crawlers have been eliminated from the new maps (we don't know why, given that the Tiger was heavily used by the Germans in Italy) and were replaced by new models, such as the American Grant tank and the small but agile Italian Carro Armato. The vehicles are well-balanced and have second-seat guards, making cooperation between two players less risky than in the original game, where the gunner's seat was basically ~the dead man's seat~. The planes, on the other hand, see the introduction of new twin-engine bombers, powerful and fast, capable of dropping 4 bombs per hit on the target: pray you have enough AA guns, or these cursed ones will give you no rest for entire games. On the other hand, the good old fighter-bombers and B17 heavy bombers disappear from the new maps. And off to the saddle! At the Bersagliere... We are in Italy and the Royal Army could not be missing, perhaps the funniest novelty (at least for us) is the introduction of the Italian army into the game, the dubbing of the voices is done quite well, if nothing else it is not ridiculous, and the Bersagliere-style skin discreetly characterizes our men in the field. Finally I can shout ~forward Savoy~ while I hurl myself at the enemy, spitting lead from my Breda: it won't be a BAR1918, but, at least aesthetically, it looks good. The other big news is the French army, how? Didn't you know that the French had an army during WWII? Did you think they had surrendered and immediately dropped their weapons? Well according to DICE it didn't go like this and we can't help but smile at the funny screams of our dear frog eaters. However for historical correctness they gave their doctors a nice English Sten machine gun and sent them to conquer Montecassino, in short, the DICE fail in history and geography, but in the end how much do we care? Patches and structural improvements The whole expansion brings the game to version 1.25, but by now you will sooner have the 1.31 patch ready to install, if you want to run happy and happy on some server. The singleplayer hasn't changed one iota and it's only useful for me to take screenshots, so forget it and arm yourself with patches and browser servers to jump into the online fray. So I buy it or not? In conclusion, I could summarize the whole essence of Road to Rome in one word: short. In short, here in Italy Electronic Arts comes to sell us 6 maps and 9 tanks for almost 40 euros, the same price as the original game. This means that you pay around 6.5 for each map you take home excessive. Ultimately RtR is also a good product, if you don't focus so much on the historical inaccuracy and arcade realization that characterize the title from the first version. The latest patches make it much more playable and stable, and the new maps are tactically very interesting as well as fun to play on ~massive~ servers. If BF1942 has really wowed you then RtR could be one of those ~must have~ titles, but if BF1942 hasn't fully satisfied you, or left a bitter taste in your mouth you're sure to want more, and for another 40 euros? So I buy it or not? Pro 6 new maps, 9 new vehicles The Italians are a hoot BF1942's engine at its best Cons 6 new maps, 9 new vehicles, 40 euros DICE have never read a history book in their life Those damn stationary guns always take me out BattleField 1942 Full Review Battlefield 1942: Road to Rome It is a stormy day, the sky is a gloomy steel color and the wind blows darkly among the few trees left standing. The dust mills around the men of the German garrison who take shelter in the trenches dug all around the ruins of the abbey. Artillery and B17s hammered all night, turned the earth of the hill, tore the men holed up out of it and scattered them around like the wind scatters dry leaves. Now a slight rumble can be heard from the valley, dozens of diesel engines are trudging along the paths that lead to the summit, the men in the trenches prepare the panzerfausts, the crewmen pile up ammunition near the anti-tank guns: the sun has just risen, it will be another long day. These are probably the atmospheres that the DICE guys had in mind when they conceived Road to Rome. The new expansion dedicated to Battlefield 1942, Electronic Arts' sales success for the past autumn, which managed to oust giants like Return to Castle Wolfenstein or Medal of Honor from their everlasting thrones of the most played online games (we don't mention Half Life, because now it is obvious ... his reign has been unchallenged for five years, making comparisons is almost heresy). After taking us from the sands of the deserts of North Africa to the atolls of the Pacific, BF1942 wants to guide us by the hand through the battles that led the Allies to conquer Rome. How to do it if not with 6 new maps and a good handful of additional vehicles? Well let's see what came of it.", "date": "2003-03-26", "grade": null}
