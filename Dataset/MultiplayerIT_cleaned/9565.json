{"name": "Un amore di Neanderthal", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/83044-hooga-un-amore-di-neanderthal.html", "text": "The Neanderthal man, who lived during the Paleolithic period, was probably not a gentleman, and used to settle disputes using heavy axes made from trees. We can easily imagine how such a guy could react if someone takes the liberty of kidnapping his woman! Well, in the new title developed by iQUILIBRIUM Games for Chillingo, Hooga, this eventuality manifests itself inexorably, placing us in front of an adventure that winds along sixteen levels full of pitfalls and obstacles to overcome for love to triumph. Our character can move and jump as in the most classic of platformers, but he also has a series of offensive maneuvers that are not to laugh at. By double-jumping, he can spin rapidly and deal heavy damage to enemies he comes into contact with, then ricocheting off his target until he is completely annihilated. But that's not all: right from the first stages he receives the help of a sort of shaman, who gives him different throwing weapons: an axe, a knife, a stone and so on. Fundamental tools to defend against the attack of the many dinosaurs that populate the prehistoric world represented, in a cartoony but effective way, on the screen of the Apple device. You're prehistory, man! Hooga's gameplay is simple but solid: you explore each scenario in search of items to collect and at the same time clean it of the dangerous creatures that infest it, paying attention to the traps scattered around. Some elements of the background give a pinch of variety to the action, such as the large mushrooms that function as trampolines, allowing us to reach otherwise inaccessible areas, or the lianas, useful for making dangerous descents in complete tranquillity. When a platform is unstable or we need to cover a greater distance than usual with a single jump, we can also glide to reach the goal. All very simple actions to perform, on paper, thanks to the excellent layout of the controls: a virtual stick placed on the left side of the touch screen is responsible for moving the character, while on the right we find the icons for jumping and attacking. In short, the picture drawn so far shows us a product that is certainly not original but has a certain charm, which brings the typical dynamics of excellent platformers such as the aforementioned Prehistorik Man to the iPhone, iPod Touch and even the iPad (in the HD version of the game). Unfortunately not all donuts come with a hole, and in the case of Hooga there are big problems with the responsiveness of the touch controls, which severely limit our freedom of action and create great difficulties, especially during jumps and boss fights . The latter, which characterize the conclusion of each stage, are also marred by a series of limitations and an overly simplistic approach, with the monster on duty that can be shot down simply by hitting it with a ranged weapon after reaching a safe position. Moving on to the technical aspect, it is absolutely necessary to congratulate the developers for the excellent work they have done, worthy of much more expensive products in terms of quantity and quality. Although in fact the drawing style is not always impeccable, with some solutions of dubious taste, it is accompanied by a great variety of contents, with the scenarios that differ substantially from each other as well as the dinosaurs that populate them.
