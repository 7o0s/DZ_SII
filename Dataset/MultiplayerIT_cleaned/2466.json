{"name": "International League Soccer", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/international-league-soccer.html", "text": "The graphics, this unknown International League Soccer opens with a CG presentation that is so reminiscent of the legendary 90s on a cosmetic level. Nothing horrible but we are far from today's quality standards. We must not forget that we are in the PS2 planet After the preliminary settings the Taito game shows everything a gamer would never want to see or hear on his beloved black console. In fact, graphic defects of the most varied nature are wasted on the field. The players are animated in a very approximate way and the slowness with which they move is so reminiscent of the dear zombies of ~Resident Evil~. The frame rate stands at about the now exceeded 30 fps and the polygonal engine is quite tired in the presence of multiple players on the screen. The pixels are clearly visible even from afar (sigh ed) and flutter left and right on the video. The public was created by the Taito programmers using poorly made bitmap images, and is equipped with an animation that is really funny (we are talking about 2-3 fps!). The only nice animation that can be noticed is the one that occurs when a fake shot is made but we are still set in prehistory. Anyone could make an effort to find some positive notes in the graphic sector of the game in question but this search would be in vain in all cases. The programmers have therefore done a very approximate job as regards the cosmetic sector of the game which also makes us regret the times of the excellent, albeit old-fashioned, ~Winning Eleven 3~ for PlayStation. And if you want to compare International League Soccer with the latest KCET home game on PS2, well! There really is a chasm between the two titles. International League Soccer VS Winning Eleven 5 0  1. A very arcade game As far as the playability of the reviewed title is concerned, it must be said that it is well suited to its graphics (and this is certainly not a compliment. Ed). In fact, the controls present an extreme ease accompanied by such an unpredictable response in the game. The reaction times of the players to the commands given to the joypad are too slow, which is not a secondary detail in a game, such as football, in which frenzy and immediacy play a fundamental role. Not to mention the absurd mileage interventions in tackle slipped from behind that too often are not seen by the referee who seems to be suffering from chronic blindness. The setting of the keys can be configured as desired by the player who can choose either to use a single multifunction key, i.e. for all game occasions, or more keys (recommended hypothesis). The maneuvers that can be performed by virtual players are really reduced to the bone. It is in fact possible to walk, run, pass, cross and shoot. By double pressing the L1 key it is also possible to take a double step which is used to get rid of some opponent who hinders the way to the goal. The team's game maneuvers are really slow and the goals scored often derive from actions worthy of the best Mai dire Goal bet. In fact, the most effective tactic to win consists in stealing the ball from the opposing defender thanks to a butcher's slide (even from behind, no problem!) and flying towards the goal, then placing the ball on either side of the goalkeeper. But what fun! Also in this respect the Taito game fails to involve the gamer, making him bored after only a couple of games. A very small consolation is the possibility of playing up to 4 at the same time thanks to the multitap, which in any case fails to raise the playability of this title which remains at low levels. International League Soccer VS Winning Eleven 5 0-2. A cabaret chronicle Other aspects of ILS that disappoint are longevity and sound. The first, even if supported by different types of contestable competitions, fails very soon mainly due to the lack of playability which does not amuse the player right from the first moments of the game. There are about forty selectable teams and they refer to the major national teams. In the game it is possible to play a friendly match, the final rounds of the world cup, the world tournament divided into groups and, surprisingly, a game mode called World ranking mode which allows you to play different matches with the consequent vote assigned by the CPU to the individuals departments of the controlled team (attack, midfield and defense). At the end of the round then, depending on the global vote received, we will be given acode which, if entered on the official site of the game, will give the user's position in the ILS world ranking! Doesn't that sound fantastic to you? Not me. Matter of taste. Another sore point that contributes to worsening the poor quality of the Taito product is undoubtedly the sound. Without taking into account the relaxing music that accompanies us in navigating the various menus (certainly better than the fluctuating ones heard in WE5), the stadium chants that form the background to the games are too repetitive and badly made. In fact, only noise and confusion reaches our ears. The situation doesn't improve if you add a commentary that is ridiculous. The two (imaginary) reporters are equipped with digitized voices that would be better suited to a television show, being also equipped with a not indifferent repertoire of hilarious jokes. In fact, it is not uncommon to come across their comic and demented outings that delight cabaret fans. Very comical! The sound effects of the actions on the field are mediocre and are very reminiscent of those heard in Virtua Striker on DC. International league soccer VS Winning Eleven 5 0-3. Ultimately, the Taito-branded game loses the direct clash with the giant Konami on all fronts. The cause is obvious: non-existent playability. A title that was not really needed and its release will not make anyone jump for joy, not even the most die-hard fan of this beautiful sport. Unfortunately, PS2 pal owners will have to wait for the month of October before they can get their hands on the best football title ever, or the never too famous Winning Eleven 5! While those who have the opportunity to play the jap version, continue to enjoy it to the fullest, at least until the release of the sixth episode scheduled for the summer of 2002. International League Soccer - World Ranking Mode: www.internationalleaguesoccer.com Pros: E It's a soccer game Cons: Mediocre technical realization. Unplayable and not fun. I sound laughable The most beautiful sport in the world For years now the football kingdom of video games has been dominated by Konami which almost every year manages to outdo itself by churning out a new title that is even more beautiful and fun than its predecessor. Just take a look at Winning Eleven 5 to immediately realize it. The proven control system and increasingly realistic graphics make the KCET saga a must for football fans and non-football fans alike. So how to subvert this monopoly? Taito tries to provide an answer with this ~International League Soccer~ (European version of ~Greatest Striker~ jap), a game in which, only in the ~almond eyes~ version, a USB microphone could be used to interact via voice commands given in some phases of the action such as offside, the exit of the goalkeeper and so on, for a total of about 40 commands. Sorry to say but in this title it only takes a few minutes to enter the club of depressed gamers. I would not dare to call this ~International League~ a football game as it would tarnish the reputation of this sport. Unfortunately there were many who were waiting for a good European game with which they could play while waiting for the release of that Konami-branded masterpiece in the old continent. A pity for all. In fact, Taito's game is not convincing at all from all points of view but above all from that of playability, really ridiculous! It takes very little to realize that you are faced with a title that stands at very low quality levels. It pains me to note all this, especially if it is assumed that the undersigned is a football lover.", "date": "2001-06-28", "grade": null}
