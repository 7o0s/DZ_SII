Usually strategic games are characterized by a particular care used above all in the phase preceding the battle or the preparation of the army and the various choices to be made to ensure victory. In Dynasty Warriors 3 the strategic element is present, but elements typical of a fighting game have been added to it. The roster of characters that you can choose has been expanded and a lot. At the beginning, 10 characters will be available, but over time and battles you will unlock new ones up to a total of 41 warriors. Compared to the second episode which boasted 8 game maps, in Dynasty Warriors 3 you will find the beauty of 20 brand new maps to explore in addition to the previous 8 appropriately redesigned and expanded with new elements. Once you have chosen the character and the scenario you will be assigned to an army that obviously prepares to fight against the enemy. As logic of the game your character will have to assert himself in battle and kill as many enemies as possible to gain notoriety and importance among the soldiers and advance in rank. The aim of the battles will be to kill the leader of the enemy army. In battle you will move like in a fighting game being able to perform various types of attacks and combos. Each victory will also guarantee you, in addition to a passage of rank, also objects and spells that you can use later. The missions are much more complex than those tested in Dynasty Warriors 2 and even the enemies will not be complete idiots. In fact, they will attack following precise patterns and in case they are decimated they will never submit to your mercy, but will flee and then return with reinforcements. The strength of a hundred men in the hands of one man! The leaders of the armies will be able to issue orders for the deployment of troops and use certain types of attacks called ~musou~ which can kill several enemies at once. You will notice these attacks when you see an unleashed fury coming towards you while making space by making soldiers fly left and right with the broadsword; a bit like Gats does in Bersek when he sees demons and doesn't understand anything anymore. These attacks are very useful especially from a practical point of view as you can kill twenty enemies at a time and immediately get face to face with the boss. In Story Mode you will be able to fight in the scenarios set in the era of the ~Three Chinese Kingdoms~ and during the battles or in the breaks between one battle and another you will be able to enjoy watching beautiful videos made in computer graphics and finely dubbed that explain a little what has happened or will happen in the course of history. Finally, the game has a very fun multiplayer mode in which you can challenge a friend and this mode was the subject of study between me and Fabio ~Akira~ Viola who, after repeatedly defeating me with his army, forced me to abdicate and take refuge in the hills! Hard Rock in Ancient China! Dynasty Warriors 3's graphics are structurally well done. It's not easy to create a strategy with elements typical of a fighting game that has solid backgrounds and at the same time lots of characters that move around the screen without causing slowdowns. In fact, the framerate shots are present, but this flaw is justified by the excellent gameplay that allows you to turn a blind eye to a possible shot here and there. The characters are made with polygonal graphics and their clothes echo the customs and traditions of Ancient China. The movements of the characters on the screen are fluid and you will hardly see any slowdowns on the screen even in situations of total chaos. Overall, the graphic sector will seem somewhat obsolete especially to the fine palates who have enjoyed Metal Gear Solid 2 lately, but remember that the strength of the game is above all in the gameplay which constitutes a project in an unforgettable succession of epic moments. The soundtrack is very unusual for a game set in Ancient China. The music is of a Hard Rock style much more suitable for a high school party rather than a battle for the conquest of a large part of the Asian continent. Conquer Ancient China! Dynasty Warriors 3 is an innovative game that tries to get out of the usual schemes of the integrally strategic game. Just the possibility of personally fighting in battle as in a fighting game also brings this game closer to an audience of gamersless theorists and more practical who prefer to resolve disputes with blows even if a minimum of strategy in what you do is always appropriate to avoid being surrounded and ending up like a rat! Pros: Tons of characters to select 20 new game maps and tons of missions to complete Story Mode has really cool cutscenes Multiplayer mode is hilarious Cons: Some framerate shots Soundtrack is not appropriate I found it a bit easy The Dynasty of Warriors continues on PS2 After the excellent impressions aroused by Dynasty Warriors 2 which last year received a good response from critics as one of the best action games produced for PS2, this year Koei has opportunely decided to develop a sequel entitled Dynasty Warriors 3. The The incredible graphics and strategic difficulty that conquered the players of the second episode return in the third accompanied by a gameplay to which major improvements have been made that eliminate the defects found in the previous episode. Dynasty Warriors 3 looks like the sequel to the second episode, but compared to the latter it is larger, more exciting and improved in every detail and all this can only give the player a truly elevated gaming experience. nast", "date": "2002-05-11", "grade": null}
