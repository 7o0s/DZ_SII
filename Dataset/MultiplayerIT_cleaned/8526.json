These without distorting too much the concept that has always been the basis of the brand if not in the contents and in the visual sector (it is no coincidence that the developers themselves have used the term fan service to indicate their project), which relies on a considerable dose of violence and based on excellent playability, they managed to combine graphics that exploit the third dimension with gameplay anchored to the more traditional expression of the fighting game, effectively resetting the saga and making it start again, well, practically from the beginning. After some time, the game finally lands on PlayStation Vita with what, let's face it right away, is not the usual revised, simplified and corrected home console port to which software houses have too often accustomed us in the past. As far as the contents are concerned, in fact, the game offers practically all the methods and features present in its home counterpart, but these, some more, some less, have been further enriched with extra material, including all the DLCs released in recent months for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 editions, including those of the characters. This means that Kratos (hero previously present only on the Sony flagship), Skarlet, Rain, Freddy Krueger and Kenshi join the plethora of fighters including the various Liu Kang, Sub-Zero, Cage and Sonya Blade. However, going into detail, let's go in order by starting to analyze what is in our opinion once again the beating heart of the game, and that is the Story mode. It allows players to experience almost a sort of adventure told from multiple points of view as if it were a film, thanks to an excellent direction that alternates the clash sequences with interlude videos created ad hoc to correlate the events related to the various protagonists . In practice, there is not only a sequence of fights in the ring which then lead to a final film, but also moments outside the actual tournament. Back to the Future The plot tells how, after centuries of Mortal Kombat, Emperor Shao Kahn is about to crown his plan to conquer the world, since he has practically defeated Raiden and his allies. But Raiden himself manages at the last moment to send a mental message back in time to his past self to warn him of the danger and show him the right way to prevent those events from happening in the future. Closing the parenthesis relating to history, let's talk about two other modes which in turn give prestige to Mortal Kombat, namely the one called Kombattimento and the one called Torre delle Sfide. The first is ideally the classic Arcade, but only enriched by various contents and by different possibilities of competition, such as for example the one named Skalata, from where to make the long journey that leads up to the final clash with Shao Khan, even in tag. This last function in fact allows the gamer to select a team made up of two characters to alternate subsequently in the ring at any time, giving rise, at the moment of the change, to assisted or combined moves simply by using the two analog sticks together, with the right one used also to the task of managing the second wrestler. The second method, on the other hand, deserves a separate discussion. For those unfamiliar with it, the Tower of Challenges is a section of Mortal Kombat where you have to face dozens of tests one after the other, with the inclusion of some of the famous mini-games of the saga such as the classic challenges of all time on strength, reflexes or on luck (also present in Test, within the Kombattimento mode), which put a strain on the player's mental and reflective abilities. The Tower doubled Well, this mode on PlayStation Vita returns richer than ever with all the contents already appreciated on home consoles but further enriched by a second version called Bonus, which offers an enormous amount of unpublished tests, about one hundred and fifty, designed to exploit the technical characteristics of the new Sony laptop, through which to unlock other additional material, such as new costumes for the fighters from Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. Clean the screen of blood splattered on the video during a fight by rubbing the touchscreen, under penalty of total loss of sight of the situation, shake the console, tilt the scenario to one side or the other to try to gain an advantage over the opponent, detonate or deflect swarms of bombs, drop them on top of a horde of zombies to protectere the kid version of a wrestler, collecting bonuses that increase speed, health and attack power are just some of the challenges to do with Vita's commands. Speaking of the latter, there are also two further mini-games that are added to those already present and which respectively exploit the touchscreen and the gyroscope of the Sony laptop. The first is in fact a sort of Fruit Ninja in a bloody version, with the melons to be cut here replaced by leaping human heads to be cut in two by rubbing your fingers on the screen above them, and by some bombs, to be detonated by shaking the console. The second is instead a real test of balance in which the gamer must try to keep his character poised, within a certain amount of time, above an abyss on the bottom of which there are alternately spikes, hungry piranhas or very sharp blades , avoiding making it fall and die. This becomes increasingly difficult given that as the level progresses, the seconds within which to resist suspended in the void increase and are thrown against the wrestler of human parts to throw him off balance. Playstation 3 trophies There are 51 Trophies made available by Mortal Kombat for PS Vita: 38 Bronze, 10 Silver, 2 Gold and 1 Platinum. The rewards, many of which are difficult to obtain, are distributed throughout the game modes both offline and online and require the achievement of certain objectives to be unlocked. In the first case, for example, it will be necessary to finish the Tower of Challenges or the Story modes, overcome all the mini-games, perform all the secret finishers of all the characters or defeat a particular opponent. In the second, however, Trophies can be obtained by participating in a hundred online fights, winning at least 10 classified and so on. Platinum is only earned at the end, unlocking all other prizes. Fatality at your fingertips If, therefore, from the point of view of content, the work done by the developers turned out to be very accurate, the controls in turn certainly do not disappoint. We know that transposing a fighting game onto a portable console without distorting it or overly simplifying it is certainly not an easy task, as we said at the beginning, but both the generous dimensions of PS Vita and the willingness of NetherRealm Studios to offer a product that lives up to expectations fans undoubtedly ~helped~ the porting process. If the playability and violence have in fact remained intact compared to the original product, with the frenetic fights that concede almost nothing to tactics and which take place in two-dimensional scenarios with a fake 3D effect for the backdrops, complete with a camera that follows the action by zooming or enlarging in the key moments of the challenges, a couple of changes are recorded substantially only in the different arrangement of the commands on the buttons of the console and for some options related to the specifications of the Sony laptop. For the latter, applause goes to the developers, who have been able to implement the front touchscreen and the accelerometer in an intelligent way so as not to distort the gameplay. As already known for some time, however, the tactile surface on the back of the console has remained unused: after various experiments, NetherRealm Studios has decided that it would be more of a stretch than a positive introduction to the management of the clashes. However, going back to talking about the traditional controls, the old Mortal Kombat players, once they get the hang of it, will immediately find the usual feeling with the controls, just as newcomers will find a gameplay purged of the complications that the series had over time granted. In detail we have the front keys used to accommodate single strokes, the D-Pad which proves to be more precise in managing movements compared to the analog (usable for the same purpose), especially for more complicated combinations, while the two left back and right are assigned respectively to the execution of the catches and the parry, or to the X-Ray if pressed at the same time. The latter, devastating moves capable of reducing the opponent's vital energy by a good 25-30% by literally breaking his bones, can also be performed by touching the appropriate icon at the bottom of the touchscreen. In all cases, this attack can only be performed when the appropriate bar is full. It, called Super Meter, is divided into three portions and also manages other moves depending on its filling level: with one notch you can perform an enhanced attack, with two a Breaker to interrupt the opponent's combo and with three the already mentioned X-Ray. Also for the Fatalities, the terrible but spectacular ~final moves~ that are now famousThe final yell of ~Finish Him!~ allow the victor to wreak havoc on the defenseless body of the enemy, you can choose between traditional and tactile controls, with the latter being more comfortable to use. All inside the Krypt Every fight, every trial, everything in the game rewards its overcoming with gold tokens to spend in the Krypt, an interactive environment where you can unlock costumes, moves and an endless list of other extra content. Finally, the multiplayer deserves a separate discussion. There are several multiplayer modes both locally and online via Wi-Fi, ranging from classified fights, traditional or in tag, to fast ones, passing through the different variants of the case, and then thanks to an effective match making system you always meet challengers of your own level. From what we have been able to see with our tests, in local matches against another player (essential that he has his own copy of the game), the title performs quite well keeping the action fluid, while in online ones we occasionally had some problems, with the input given to our character that sometimes didn't seem to reach him correctly. Where Mortal Kombat sins, on the other hand, is certainly in the graphics sector, which in some moments leaves something to be desired in terms of detail. While on the one hand we have visually well-made scenarios, with arenas reproduced with a certain attention to detail and even seasoned in some cases with animated elements in the background, on the other we have polygonal models of the wrestlers decidedly not up to the potential of the Sony handheld console. In fact, these show little attention to detail, with a rough structure for the limbs and poorly finished textures for clothes or skin. In short, nothing in the least comparable to the admired counterparts on Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3. However, these shortcomings appear more of a compromise than a mistake on the part of the developers, an obligatory choice in order to be able to maintain a constantly fixed framerate at 60Fps and without sagging of any kind even in situations more chaotic. And if you think of the fact that the defects just described are obviously highlighted more in close-ups than in distant shots and in the middle of a fight, you understand how this doesn't constitute so much a ~nuisance~ to the gamer's gaze. The audio is good, at least as regards the effects and the soundtrack, epic in the introduction of some encounters, a bit retro instead in other situations, a little less as regards the dubbing, which is in Italian only during the scenes interlude of Story Mode, and not during battles, where it remains in English. The reason for this criticism is to be found in the voices, at least some, of certain characters, decidedly not very appropriate and sometimes annoying.", "date": "2012-05-22", "grade": "8.6"}
