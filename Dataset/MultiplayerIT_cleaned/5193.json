Sometimes the goals are modest and so are the results, but there are cases where talent and know-how actually make the difference. Gear.Club is a perfect example of this, given that it is a project developed by Eden Games, the authors of V-Rally and Test Drive Unlimited, who first brought it to Apple TV as a timed exclusive (initially with the title of GT Spirit), to then realize the reduction for iOS devices and, shortly, Android. We are talking about a driving game proper, with an arcade connotation but with some simulation implications (see the collisions between the cars), equipped with a rich single player campaign and an equally rich upgrade system that allows you to upgrade real cars that can be purchased using two different currencies. In fact, the game uses the freemium model, so it can be downloaded for free but with some constraints regarding the unlocking of vehicles and races. In reality, the approach chosen by the developers is immediately anything but limiting: there is no indicator of the energy of action and you can therefore try your hand at all the runs you want without timers or other expedients, simply you have to do a little grinding when you want to raise the virtual money necessary for the purchase of a particular custom-built one and thus access the events reserved for the higher categories. Gear.Club is a solid and full-bodied driving game, equipped with an almost perfect control system Brush the curves In addition to the elastic and sensible freemium model, what is striking about Gear.Club is the perfectly calibrated control system, especially if you choose to use the accelerometer. The various settings allow you to modify the response to inputs so that the car responds to stress exactly as we wish, and in addition the options allow you to choose between three different presets, each characterized by the presence or absence of driving aids: automatic acceleration and braking , traction control and so on. Surprisingly, right from the start it is possible to deactivate any assistance and still be able to tackle races successfully, brushing the curves while slightly tilting the device and braking when necessary thanks to a simple touch of the screen. The secret also lies in the substantial performance advantage enjoyed at the start of the campaign, but which will gradually decrease when we stop applying the upgrades. There are many races and they are unlocked as the victories are brought home, but it is also the management of the workshop that has a positive impact, given that the developers have decided to focus on this element to insert an additional progression factor: the garage it must be improved and strengthened, so that it allows you to adjust any parameter of the car, including aesthetics. The result is a very varied and fun experience, whose only flaw is the lack of attention to some technical aspects: the polygonal models of the cars are excellent in terms of detail and fidelity, there is no doubt, but they run within a little too flat due to an effect that is not exactly at the top. There is also a frame rate dancer on the iPhone 7, and it is actually somewhat surprising: let's hope that an update will fix things.", "date": "2016-11-02", "grade": "8.5"}
