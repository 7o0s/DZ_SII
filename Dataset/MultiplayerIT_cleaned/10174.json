Here are the journeys of the starship Enterprise during its five-year mission, aimed at exploring new worlds, in search of other life forms and civilizations, until arriving where no man has gone before. ~ It was with these words that Gene Roddenberry presented us, back in 1966, a series that would become one of the most beloved and most prolific in the history of science fiction. Its success was due to many factors, but among them we cannot fail to mention the strong romantic and heroic component, the fascination of space exploration and the route into the unknown, as well as the commitment from a social, ethical and political that above all the classic series introduced into the genre of television series. It is therefore with our eyes (and hearts) turned towards the stars that we are preparing to welcome onto our screens the adventures offered to us by Cryptic Studios through Star Trek Online, with the expectations that any fan of the saga certainly has and the great desire to tackle deep space aboard our starships. Captains in search of an author The first thing we have to deal with, as in any self-respecting MMO, is naturally the character creation screen that will represent our alter ego during our travels and adventures. Needless to say, the little jingle that welcomes us immediately after passing the login screen is a real jab to the heart and even though we are now adults, vaccinated and supposedly even a little disenchanted, the emotion makes us squeeze our eyes and fingers look happy. Initially we can only create a character of the Federation, later discovering that we will have to reach the sixth level with at least one of them to be able to unlock the creation of a representative of the Klingon Empire faction. In both cases, however, we have a more or less vast range of races to choose from, clearly linked to the history of alliances and conflicts that we have learned from the saga. There are many options that we have available to customize our character, especially as regards the aesthetic traits which obviously vary from race to race. Each species also has distinctive peculiarities as regards skills: one or two are pre-established and the remaining two or three at our free choice, unless we decide to create our own alien race from scratch, in this case having to choose all of them features. It is clear that some races are more or less suitable than others for the class we will choose to play, among the three available: tactical, scientific and engineering officer. The first of these is a sort of ~soldier~, more suited to direct combat, the second will play the role of healer and the third will support the group through the use of technology. The class we choose will influence the way we fight both in space and on the ground, so it will be important to dedicate a minimum of study to it. Unfortunately, most of the additional traits that we can assign to the character are related to combat on planetary soil, while the more useful ~space~ traits are greatly reduced in number. Mister Sulu: WARP speed! Once the creation of our character is finished, we are catapulted into the introductory video of the game which can only continue to feed that first emotion felt. It is the voice of Leonard Nimoy that welcomes us, the interpreter of the ~Sr. Spock~ that we all know well. The events it tells us are those we witnessed in the latest film dedicated to the series, the very recent ~Star Trek~ by J.J. Abrams: We are about twenty years after Spock used red matter to create a black hole that would allow him to travel through time and prevent the destruction of the two Romulan home planets. In the game, however, we will not face the parallel reality created by Spock, but rather we will follow the original timeline in which the universe, devastated by the annihilation of the Romulans, will again find itself experiencing the open conflict between the Klingon Empire and the Federation , with the Borg threat once again urgent. The Klingons, in addition to picking on those poor Romulans and gorns, accuse the Federation of having been infiltrated by the Undine, a race with shape-shifting skills which, to be honest, would seem (depending on which side you look at it from) to have infiltrated even among the Klingons themselves. With all the diplomatic complications and the resulting Iron Curtain atmosphere and which renders the plots and conflicts typical of the series quite faithfully. In any case, our tutorial first of all forces us to deal with Borg with non-stratosphe artificial intelligencegames that will allow us to get a little carried away with the game mechanics on land and in space, as well as gain command of our first Miranda-class starship. I already have a female to worry about. Her name is Enterprise. And the time also comes to properly analyze the crosses and delights of this MMO. One of the delights, as you may have already understood from the tone of this review, is certainly the atmosphere generated by the setting of Star Trek itself, reconstructed with a certain care and trying as much as possible to listen to the requests of the users themselves and the fans of the series. Being called to the screen by some admiral of the fleet who wants to entrust us with a mission is pleasant, as are the occasional encounters with famous characters from the series itself or with their direct descendants. The navigation of sectors and galaxies certainly has its charm and we are immediately bewitched by it, but we soon realize that it suffers from the lack of a fundamental feature of the series: exploration. Who among us does not have in mind that ~to go where no man has gone before~? In Star Trek Online we will indeed find more or less unexplored areas with unknown planets, randomly generated in the relative map. What we will have to do, basically, is to go around scanning the anomalies detected on the map, which in some cases will simply allow us to collect materials and in others to discover unknown systems that will open up short missions in their orbital space or on the surface. However, it doesn't take long for the formula to get boring, considering that it doesn't even retain the taste of ~exploration~ but that it is basically about random encounters in which you fight a little and then go back to where we came from. And here comes what is probably Star Trek Online's biggest cross: the missions. There are basically three viable alternatives in addition to the exploration ones: the patrols, which lead us to defend systems, the ~Fleet action~ and the episodic ones. Fleet actions are basically instanced combat quests to be played with other players, mainly in space, while those that tell the story follow the episodic narrative line that retains a large part of the game's charm. All missions, of whatever kind, take place in space and/or on the ground. In the first case, the game works well, with mechanics very similar to those of that 2002 Bridge Commander inserted in graphic and audio effects that once again win the hearts of fans. We have a certain number of skills of our choice, given to us in part by our ship's officers whose growth we will also have to take care of in the choice of skills, in part by ourselves and the role we have chosen to assume, in part by the configuration of the ship itself . A large part of the game is involved in customizing ourselves, the ship and our officers through objects and scores for the Trekkian alternative of the well-known ~talent tree~. The problem in this case is that the explanations on the values of skills and objects are so lacking as to not be able to get a precise picture of what is better to enhance or which object is better than another, if not on an intuitive level. The combat in space, rather slow in movement, is all based on combinations of phasers, disruptors and torpedoes, careful to keep up the shields and bring down those of our enemies. All obviously using the other skills, whether they are healing, attack or buff. Uhura, signal our surrender If the fights in space, despite their slowness, simplicity and repetitiveness can be really fun, missions on the ground are literally unbearable. It is basically a question of descending on planets or space stations accompanied by other players or by our officers managed by the AI (not as good as it could be), to kill everything that stands between us and the fulfillment of our objective. The clashes with enemies are the most obvious and mechanical we have seen in an MMO, with an almost zero level of challenge and just a couple of keys to press in combination to pull out the tooth. The mechanics are also quite absurd, with crouched aiming systems that give shooting bonuses but without the possibility of using sensible cover systems, inaccurate hand-to-hand combat like never before, a camera system that seems unthinkable and an automatic target mechanism which makes us continually lose sight of our chosen objective to move on to what the system deems most appropriate. The graphics, based on the Champions Online engine, are the very bestgnosa and not very detailed and all combine to make us breathe a sigh of relief when we can finally return to our ships. For the same reason, even the ~capitals~, the bases that act as a meeting point for the players and which include a badly managed Auction House, the post office and the shops are very little frequented except when it is really necessary to do something that cannot be fulfilled comfortably from your command bridge. Enter a route. Homeward. But let's finally come to the big question mark that still hasn't been answered: what about the MMO aspect of the game? In fact, from the beginning it seems clear to us that the Cryptic Studios game has been calibrated on a level of difficulty such that it is easily playable in single player. In ground combat, for example, replacing ship's officers with other real players only makes things even easier, while as far as space combat is concerned, the instance system makes it extremely penalizing to be able to play with your own friends. Once a group has been created, it is then a matter of pure luck to be able to enter the same combat instance, making team play essentially useless. Of which, moreover, the need is not felt at all, considering that the clashes are essentially reduced to a continuous tank & spank which, although incredibly satisfying and fun, limits the need for interaction with other players to zero. The server chat, one for all players of all backgrounds, is nothing more than a cauldron of questions and comments about the game, some interesting, some simple chat chats between strangers. It is in fact difficult to witness the formation of Fleet (the analogue of guilds) on the game, there are almost no requests for recruitment at all and one seriously wonders if one is not actually in a huge single player and multiplayer game instanced with nice MMO bonuses. As well as why we pay for a subscription. However, a possible answer to our question remains and lies in the PvP sector of the game. As we said at the beginning, in fact, once a Federation character has reached the sixth level, it is possible to create one from the Klingon Empire, which will have an extremely limited PvE sector and will essentially be focused on PvP. At the moment, however, it is really too early to express any considerations in this sense, considering that not only is the PvE end game of the game still far away for everyone, but above all as regards PvP there are very few players who have ships at levels high enough to be able to define its dynamics and involvement. We therefore reserve the right, later in time, to analyze what balance the game will be able to achieve in its Massive Multiplayer Online component. For the moment we conclude our analysis convinced that we are faced with a title with potential, both thanks to the universe to which it refers and to the mechanics on which it was structured. The game, despite the many flaws on which Cryptic will have to work a lot, manages in any case to offer fun mechanics and to create that alchemy and atmospheres that keep the player glued, and perhaps hypnotized, for long hours in front of the screen. Let's hope his future features a jump into hyperspace that truly takes us where no player has gone before.", "date": "2010-02-26", "grade": "7.0"}
