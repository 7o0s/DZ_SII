And the reason is simple: attracted by the promise of being able to actually keep their memory and ability to reason fresh and trained, users remained glued thanks to a small number that tried to estimate the player's brain age. Dr. Kawashima: Exercises for Mind and Body starts from the same premise, and while the very usefulness of Brain Training has been questioned many times, the allure of challenging yourself and tracking your abilities through comprehensive graphs has remained. Namco Bandai's title, exclusive to Xbox 360, not being able to focus on the portability of the Nintendo version, however, presents itself as a hybrid between a personal trainer and a family party game, offering a series of mini-games divided into categories and which all require the interaction via Kinect. 360 exercises As the title clearly suggests, one of the biggest changes compared to Brain Training for DS is directly related to the new control system used. Thus, alongside exercises to train memory, reflexes and reasoning ability, new mini-games peep out to train body movement. However, it must be said that these particular exercises almost always require small and discreet movements, giving the impression that they have been implemented more to make sense of using Kinect than to actually keep loose and in shape. This does not mean that these mini-games are boring: on the contrary, one of the nicest exercises concerns body coordination, and sees the player move his arms in order to create a bridge to allow some colored vehicles to pass from one side to the other in the right order. What is certain is that those who want to keep fit would do better to turn to one of the many and more complete fitness games, since from this point of view Exercises for the Mind and the Body is really lacking. The rest is reproduced in an identical way to what was seen in the other games of Dr. Kawashima: a daily exercise allows you to keep trained day by day thanks to some mini-games chosen at random, where progress is saved and compared over time; there is also the inevitable calculation of brain age, as well as the calendar on which to apply the stamps every time you complete your exercises. However, those who just want to have fun for a few minutes, without necessarily following the card proposed by the game, can play one of the over twenty mini-games available at any time, offered in three difficulty levels. Another novelty is represented by the possibility of playing in company: from 2 to 4 friends can challenge each other in a sort of TV show, in which they take turns performing randomly chosen exercises, while a Wheel of Fortune could apply handicaps to each challenge, including one that doubles the speed of the game or a mosaic effect that makes it difficult to distinguish the figures on the screen. Too bad that, although Xbox 360 seems predisposed to such use, there is no possibility to compare one's statistics and progress made with one's friends online. Dr. Kawashima: Exercises for the Mind and Body is certainly an interesting attempt to bring Brain Training to home consoles, where the inability to train anytime, anywhere has been compensated for by interacting via Kinect, adding seemingly nuances more playful, but which always and in any case push the player to rack his brains.", "date": "2011-02-09", "grade": null}
