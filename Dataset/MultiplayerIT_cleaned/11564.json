{"name": "Bully: Scholarship Edition - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bully-scholarship-edition-recensione.html", "text": "Bully eat bully It can't be easy watching your mother take off with her seventh husband on a year-long honeymoon and be thrown into the toughest boarding school in the whole country. But this is the fate of the ~lively~ fifteen-year-old Jimmy Hopkins, and it is also the starting point of Bully Scholarship Edition, a school action/adventure that takes some elements from the latest Rockstar productions and combines them into a decidedly one-of-a-kind title. Even before the gameplay (however excellent), the greatest strengths of the Rockstar production reside in the storyline and in the setting, both finely outlined: Jimmy is therefore forced to emerge in the difficult environment of the Bullworth Academy, populated by bizarre teachers and students of every genre, from the most hopeless nerds to sportsmen all brawn and no brains. All framed within the confines of a plot that is as light and ironic as it is exciting, which unfolds using real-time cutscenes that are excellent for the quality of the dialogues and dubbing (strictly in English). From a playful point of view, Canis Canem Edit is configured as a free roaming action/adventure with GTA-style missions, characterized by ample space for the user's discretion in facing the hard school life. 8 new missions, new subjects and multiplayer for this re-edition of Bully Bully eat bully A first aspect in this sense concerns the relationship with the lessons, which the player can decide to follow or skip in order to pursue other objectives. Every day, the bell rings at 9 and 13, marking the beginning of the morning and afternoon sessions: if you choose to do something else, you have to be careful of the patrols of prefects who will try in every way to block Jimmy and send him forcibly in the classroom. However, avoiding the teachings altogether can be decidedly counterproductive, considering how by overcoming the minigames of the various lessons it is possible to learn new skills or enhance those already acquired: therefore, by doing gymnastics you learn new fighting moves or increase your precision with weapons ; following the mechanics course you become capable of building bicycles to be used at will; again, working in the chemistry laboratory, the faculty of creating objects (stinky vials, firecrackers, itchy powder) with the apparatus present in one's room becomes available, and so on. One of the most successful and convincing aspects of the Rockstar product lies precisely in its intelligent exploitation of mini-games, scattered throughout the adventure not only in the form of lessons, but also as parts of missions or sub-quests. It's hard to get bored in Bully: Scholarship Edition also thanks to an almost perfect pace of play: as soon as the boundaries of the Bullworth Academy begin to get too narrow, the gates are opened that lead to the surrounding city, decidedly extensive (especially if one considers that the means of locomotion are mainly limited to skateboards and bicycles) and very rich in shops, secrets, submissions and minigames. This new version for Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii as well as having added 8 new missions, for a total of 82, and 4 new lessons (biology, music, mathematics and geography) has introduced a rather interesting offline multiplayer mode for two people. There are ten events in total, dedicated to the different lessons and you can challenge your friend in mini-tournaments ranging from geography to photography. The minigames are fun (great for a double challenge with nunchucks), certainly not a big plus for those who have already played the Rockstar title, but overall they are perfect for a small variation on the theme. The big lack of multiplayer on Xbox 360 is certainly the fact of being exclusively offline, without even presenting an online ranking system, a significant lack for a reissue dedicated to the console famous for its ~Live~. Beyond all the highly appreciated diversions that the game offers, Bully: Scholarship Edition still remains the adventure of a fifteen-year-old bully, and all the actions that can be performed by the user are developed on these bases. In addition to engaging in various missions (including pranks, brawls and competitions of all kinds), our Jimmy can interact in a variety of ways with his fellow students. These, in fact, in addition to being all 100% characterized (every single character has his own name, his voice and his way of doing), can welcome the stimuli launched by the protagonist in different ways: a nerd will run away from faced with a threat, while a gymnast will respond in kind with a push, looking for a physical confrontation. Alsowith the girls of the institute there are some very specific social dynamics: Jimmy can woo any student in order to get a kiss (which gives a temporary energy bonus), but only those who consider him at their level will deign him the grace. And this is just the tip of the iceberg of a highly developed AI system, which makes life inside the world of Bully: Scholarship Edition an experience that is really hard to resist. But an action/adventure cannot be defined as such without a little healthy violence, and here the Rockstar title offers a combat system inherited from The Warriors that works wonders. Excellent controls on Wii and Xbox 360 a breath of high definition In addition to throwing punches and performing combos, Jimmy can produce tricks and counters of various kinds, always helped in case of need by an ~arsenal~ that counts slingshots, marbles, baseball bats, soccer balls, Frisbees, bricks and so on. . The interactivity with the setting is also combined with some particular moves, which can see Jimmy lock the opponent in a locker or push him into a garbage can; not only that, when the energy of the enemy on duty is close to zero, it is possible to humiliate him with a special blow and then see him run away like a little girl. With all this meat on the fire, Bully: Scholarship Edition runs smoothly, despite the fact that at times there is a feeling of deja-vu regarding the objectives of the various missions: indicatively, it takes between 15 and 20 hours to complete end the main adventure, a figure that rises exponentially if you try your hand at exploring the myriad of extras offered by the Rockstar product. And in the face of so much videogame goodness, thank goodness that the new Bully: Scholarship Edition cosmetics does justice to the efforts made by the programmers. If for Sony hardware it was an excellent product, brought as it is on Xbox 360 it would have made a poor figure. Rockstar rolled up their sleeves and modified the graphics engine to adapt it to high definition and 720p managed by the Microsoft console. In the test carried out we noticed in principle a marked improvement not only in the game environments, from the classrooms to the outdoor areas, but also in the polygonal models of the characters and in their animations. There are certainly game areas that are more refined than others and there are also several low-resolution textures, an example above all the school playing field. The frame rate does occasionally play tricks and we saw sporadic dips in the game engine, but certainly not enough to spoil the fun and enjoyment of Bully: Scholarship Edition. As for the Wii version we have to praise the work done by Rockstar, certainly the original product was better suited to the Nintendo hardware, not highlighting botched textures and pixelated shadows. The frame rate is decidedly more stable, giving a very enjoyable experience thanks also to an excellent adaptation of the controls on the Wii peripherals; motion control has basically been used to replace the standard buttons to perform certain actions, such as fighting or using ranged weapons. Finally, really nothing to complain about the sound sector: the aforementioned stellar dubbing is accompanied by convincing effects and a soundtrack composed of vaguely 70s melodies that blend perfectly with the tenor of the game. Comment Ironic, varied, original, profound, engaging: they are all adjectives that well represent Bully: Scholarship Edition, yet another Rockstar title capable of combining ~uncomfortable~ topics with an absolutely top-level game structure. Jimmy Hopkins' epic in the world of bullying is a concentration of withering dialogues, goliardic missions and juvenile brawls, all immersed in a sea of minigames, sub-quests, unlockable secrets and hilarious side elements. Bully: Scholarship Edition is the perfect game for those in withdrawal from GTA, deadly in its irony and exceptional freedom of movement. We liked the Wii version very much, adapting the Wii-mote perfectly to Jimmy's actions, but Xbox 360 owners shouldn't miss the chance to play the Rockstar title either, the high definition adaptation turned out quite well, shame about the lack of any mode via Xbox Live. Anyone who has already played Canis Canem Edit will still not have incentives to play this re-edition, the extras are not enough to justify the purchase again, all the others must give Bully: Scholarship Edition at least one try. Pros Solid and rich game structure Great attention to detail Fascinating storyline and setting Nnew graphic adaptation Cons A bit repetitive in some stages Lack of an online mode on Xbox 360 Extras won't make those who have already played the game repurchase Goals 360 To get all 1000 points divided into 38 objectives we will have to play the Rockstar title for many hours, not only will we have to finish the main storyline but also venture into the sub-quests. A challenging and sometimes boring task since we will be able to obtain many points only by repeating certain actions over and over again. Bully: Scholarship Edition is available for Nintendo Wii and Xbox 360 and has been tested for both platforms.", "date": "2008-03-14", "grade": null}
