Weeks of travel to find ourselves immersed in the snows of the Valley of the Cold Wind, without food, without heating and ready to leave for the Spine of the World for a mission that promises to be desperate, to be optimistic. Despite the frost, there are plenty of places heated by lava. Wild beasts, demonic creatures and demonic wild beasts will oppose our path, just to stay on topic. Not to mention the undead, mystical creatures, giant insects and many other fantasy delicacies. Unlike other lucky heroes, we can only rely on our weapons to communicate. Let it be clear that engraving greetings on the heads of enemies with a flail is not bad, only that when it's time for an aperitif you never know who to invite. Once the matter has been resolved and a lot of cleaning done, an activity that will require more than forty hours of gameplay, we will leave for Lonelywood to stop the barbarians led by Wylfdene. The nice and burly big men are gathering to destroy the Ten Cities in the name of Tempus, god of war as well as Nordic sanitary pads with wings. Distributed a lot of slaps here too, we will finally treat ourselves to a healthy rest awaiting the arrival of the Enhanced version of Icewind Dale II, which will force us to wear our synthetic dragon fur again, with troll skin sequins, to get back to dancing. Lasts the life of adventurers. Heart of Winter also included in the price of the mobile versions Unlike what happened with Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition offers the complete gaming experience even to those who purchase it on mobile systems. Available in iOS and Android versions, it does not require you to pay an additional price for the Heart of Winter expansion, which is already included in the package. The mobile versions of the game both cost 8.99. Improved version Thinking back today to how Icewind Dale was received in 2000 makes you smile. Developed using BioWare's Infinity Engine, it was considered the weak link in the ideal trilogy of series that formed with Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment. Some hand-drawn scenery remains fascinating, despite the past time Not that it has ever been singled out as a bad game, mind you, just that many have considered it the least relevant of the group due to its focus on combat rather than story, dialogue and choices. The smile comes to us because when compared to many modern titles, Icewind Dale also stands out for its complexity and depth. Who would have thought that? In fact, thinking about the criticisms of the time makes it clear how much the world of video games has changed and how much today's expectations are very different from those of the past. In the age of DLCs that last half an hour, who would complain about an expansion like Heart of Winter that lasts more than twelve hours? With Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition, which includes the base game plus the aforementioned expansion, Beamdog has done neither more nor less than what was already done with the Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate: it has taken the original title, leaving it unchanged in appearance, but he adapted the interface to 1080p, adding some secondary missions and fixing some problems that weren't so then; for example, he updated the creation of the party by adding the classes introduced by titles such as Baldur's Gate 2. In short, if you played it at the time you will not find big revolutions, even if it must be said that this was never the goal of similar re-editions. We paid a visit to the frozen lands of Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition. Let's find out if they have borne fruit Frost preserves the skin The game system has remained practically unchanged, with the party made up of six characters that can be entirely created by the player, or that can be chosen from those pre-cooked by the developers. Between ourselves, at the time this card wasn't even too complex Unlike the aforementioned Torment and Baldur's Gate, the player leads a full party from the start, with no ability to hire characters known in-game. This translates into greater customization of the entire group, but with the obvious implication of not offering parallel stories related to secondary characters. Indeed from a narrative point of view Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition remains the weak game that it was, with the thin story used as a mere excuse to justify the long series of fights one has to go through to get to the end. Even the aforementioned missions added with this edition do little or nothing to improve the narrative side. Speaking of fights, here too no significant news: quanwhen enemies are encountered, the action can be put into tactical pause to give orders to the various characters, in order to manage their behavior on the battlefield (decide who to attack, which spells to cast, how to position oneself in relation to enemies and so on) . In short, the novelties of this Enhanced Edition mainly concern some general improvements and the possibility of playing a much loved title, including an expansion, on the most modern machines without too many headaches. It's not much for those who own and played the original, but newcomers with no preconceptions about the inevitable wrinkles will surely like it.", "date": "2014-11-11", "grade": "8.0"}
