{"name": "La nostra eroina Trilli", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/83549-disney-fairies-trilli-la-nostra-eroina-trilli.html", "text": "A magical enchanted world where, hovering in the air, an elegant luminous trail is left... it is right here that the fairies and elves of the forest live where reality ends and fantasy begins! And it is in truth with the imagination that Disney has always captured the attention of young and old as in the film ~Tinker Bell and the Great Rescue~ where the protagonist Tinker Bell (Tinker Bell) manages to understand humans even if they perceive the opposite just a jingle of a bell, and it is she who is in fact on the fixed world to bring summer together with elves and fairies. Here they meet Lizzy and her dad with whom the usual fairytale plots are created. All this partly coincides with the story that will appear in the title of the same name for Nintendo DS: the real protagonists here, however, are us players who have the task of bringing summer to the Glade of the Fairies through a ~volume of work~ such as to succeed to complete all the stages in the proposed map. Trilli is our sweet prompter who will help us in this happy task, she is a Fatafatutto - one of the many species of fairies - and will appear at the right moments giving us pearls of wisdom to face this indigenous world of hers. But there is also the exquisite possibility of choosing between 4 mini-games inspired by the film: Woodlice Race, Fix the leak, Twirling plates, Set the table. For example, Fix the loss is a nice game of skill, which differs a bit from the female imprint of Tinker Bell and the Great Rescue. In the center of the screen we find four panels forming a square, the aim is to rearrange the panels to connect the pipe that is drawn above through multiple shapes that we will have to fit cleverly to be able to recompose the exact drawing, so as to make the water flow repairing the leak. Summer is up to you! The Minister of Summer, a nice chubby red-haired lady has a task for us, she will invite us to create a Summer Garden for the great end-of-season tea and to carry out the orders all we have to do is have the patience and skill to create, plant and cultivate. Creating the character often turns out to be boring if the choice simply falls between hair and clothes, the game gives us the possibility to choose to be one of the existing fairy species that reflects our ~talent~: Fata Fatutto (like Tinker Bell), Garden Fairy, Water Fairy, Animal Fairy and Light Fairy. Well, in addition to the species, we have the possibility of choosing between names and surnames, dressed in leaves or petals, shoes and crowns. Of course, all this can be earned along the way like any self-respecting game, in fact often every step reserves a change of clothes that we can immediately put on or leave aside. A nice change of look could be the one made of petals, directly from the Solstice Shop which creates, thanks to our help, phenomenal skirts from the delicacies of a freshly grown blue hydrangea among the flowers of our Summer Garden. Among the various entertainments you can find mini-games here too, one of the nicest could be the one where we have the task of managing the direction of the sun's rays in the best possible way to make our sunflowers blossom and therefore earn the reward. These six new adventures to be experienced with the magical fairy friends will take us back in time, as in every self-respecting fairy tale there will be a happy ending, many encounters, obstacles and adventures that make the title perfectly in line with the ancient flavors of fairy tales. Practically Tinker Bell and the Great Rescue, it is very smooth and does not get boring thanks to its continuous ~changes of plans~: in the choice of the character which, as we said, lies the talent of every single species of fairy, the path remains the same but the mini-games change to example if you choose to play a Fata Fatutto we will come across a fun game where we will have to glue broken objects in the shortest possible time. Saving the game turns out to be difficult for those who are not very familiar: you have to follow the icon indicating a backpack that appears on the touch screen at the top right and from here choose ~System~ which will allow us to save the game. Yufff...work done! Two icons will accompany us on the touch screen, one is the one previously described, while the other indicating a manuscript illustrates our next moves to be made, indicated by a flashing yellow dot on the map that indicates our position and an arrow that instead shows the position to reach. All the fairies will surround us to give us a hand, along the way we will also find some nice elves friends of Trilli who will contribute to the excellent successa of our task. Summer will come and we will find ourselves in an enchanting green expanse enjoying the heady scent of the hot season and... of victory!", "date": "2011-01-18", "grade": null}
