Well, maybe not; yet given the final result, and after having a lot of fun challenging friends and relatives to the last roll of the dice, we can only be happy that Nintendo wanted to continue the brand in question on Wii U as well. Those with a longer memory will perhaps remember that the first episode appeared on the Wii about three years ago, in a period of decline for the highly successful Kyoto console and general rejection by users of those casual and party games that they had definitely saturated the market. Nonetheless, the game turned out to be of more than good quality, managing to propose an all in all conventional formula in a fun and engaging way. Today things in the world of video games are extremely different, the balance has changed, yet that doesn't mean that what appeared to be fun three years ago shouldn't be fun these days too, right? Wii Party U arrives on Wii U completely under the radar, almost as a surprise: but those who usually have a house full of people should start raising their antennas. Differently beautiful The similarities between the first Wii Party and this new chapter are many, starting with the way of selling; yes, because even in this case Nintendo has chosen to offer the game in a package combined with a Wiimote Plus, at a total price of around 50. A decidedly interesting figure if you consider the cost of a single remote control, and which allows you to have a precious extra controller at your disposal. This is a fundamental factor to say the least in the case of Wii Party U: yes because, although there is the possibility of tackling the game (or rather, some parts of it) even in singles or in pairs, it is quite evident that the best is get only with three or preferably four participants. Multiplayer is obviously the key to a product of this type, and precisely because of the importance of witnessing the actions and reactions of the protagonists ~live~, there is no online mode; a choice in our way of seeing absolutely correct and coherent. So, if it weren't already clear enough just by reading the title, we repeat it again: Wii Party U is a product to be played exclusively in a group, otherwise it is better to stay away. With this well-printed premise in mind, we can calmly evaluate the work done by Nintendo, perhaps immediately removing the tooth regarding the technical component which certainly constitutes the least brilliant part of the package. In reality, this definition could be euphemistic, because Wii Party U follows in a substantially unchanged way the minimalist and stylized Mii-based style that has characterized Nintendo's ~casual~ productions from Wii Sports onwards. If it weren't for resolution, textures and some effects, in fact, Wii Party U could easily be mistaken for a title for the previous generation of consoles from the big N, and not even one of the most beautiful; honestly we have never considered this artistic style particularly successful, yet the Iwata company seems to want to continue undaunted on this path. However, it is an aesthetically very simple, graceful, colorful, functional, harmless title, but nothing more than this. Closing the parenthesis, we can therefore focus on the contents offered by Wii Party U, which fortunately are quite another thing ... If you're looking for a party game, you can't go wrong with Wii Party U Let's have a party We don't really like the definition of ~definitive~, yet Wii Party U is undoubtedly one of the most complete, robust, rich and varied party games we have ever played. It is evident that Nintendo wanted to concentrate years of experience in the field of casual games in a single product, and in fact the amount of modes available is initially even a bit disorienting. The bizarre couple made up of Gualtiero Festivaliero together with Gelsomina Partitina (?!) will take the user by the hand, a sort of ~landlords~ able to provide information that is not always necessary and useful. The basic structure is divided into three macro sections: Group Games, Home Games and Table Challenges, each of which is further fragmented into several different modes. Group Games basically include that kind of purely competitive situations, in which mini-games play the main role. What changes is practically the whole ~outline~, which can vary from a simple board game-like structure, complete with dice to roll to advance in the boxes, to more original formulas that are much easier to deal with than to describe in words. We were talking about the mini-games, which are the protagonists of this section: I knowNo a total of 65, and are based both on situations of all against all, that of one against the other. The remarkable thing, and far from obvious, is the fact that a very good part of the 65 are actually very, very fun and enjoyable, as well as characterized by an extraordinary variety, a sign of a particularly strong imagination of Japanese game designers. Giochi in Casa is instead made up of 8 completely different experiences, a sort of collection of more structured games which in many cases involve the challengers in a more ~physical~ way. For example Intrecciafalangi is a kind of Twister in which instead of fitting the bodies on the colored dots you do it with your fingers on the Wiimote and GamePad buttons, Doodles Quiz is a variant of the Pictionary, Indovina la Smorfia uses the camera from the controller to take pictures the grimace associated with a situation that the companions will have to guess, and so on. Also in this case the variety is the master, although it is possible to recognize some situations in which perhaps too much has been asked of the precision of the detection of the movements (such as in Water Bearers). Lastly, Challenges from the Table is a collection of mini-games that only use the GamePad, in that attempt undertaken by many to give real meaning to the touch screen of the Nintendo console. The result, although not always entirely successful, once again confirms the great creativity behind Wii Party U, despite the limits imposed by a resistive and above all non-multi touch touch screen. Finally, the possibility of evaluating any of the activities offered by the game from one to five stars deserves a mention; the interesting thing is that one's opinion is then averaged with that of all the other users in the world, so as to be able to obtain in a practical way a general indication of which situations are most appreciated by the ~general public~ and possibly favor them moment of choice.", "date": "2013-10-23", "grade": "8.3"}
