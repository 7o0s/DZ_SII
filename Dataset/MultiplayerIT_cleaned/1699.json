{"name": "Panzer Dragoon Orta", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/panzer-dragoon-orta-3.html", "text": "New and stronger wings. There is a war between the forces of an empire that wants to resurrect, by any means, and a group of rebel soldiers who do not want to see ancient technologies of destruction resurrected. In the midst of all this is Orta, a mysterious girl, locked up in a fortress and awaiting a more uncertain fate than her past. The empire is on her trail and when all hope seems to be lost, a dragon falls from the sky snatching her to a terrible end. These are the premises of Panzer Dragoon Orta (PDO from here on), from which the player is taken through ten stages, which tell an epic and memorable journey, which will not fail to fascinate anyone who embarks on it without prejudice. The risk is to brand PDO with the label of a simple shooter, which lasts the time of an infinite series of continues, as if you were in the arcade at home. In reality, the programmers have included some innovations that make the fourth episode of the series one of the most interesting and technical shoot'em ups ever and, thanks to the many surprises in Pandora's box, they have made it a rightly long-lived game. From the very beginning and throughout, you are in control of the dragon, which you can move around the screen using the left analog stick of the joypad. The seabed cannot be freely explored, but will flow below you in the best tradition of Japanese-style shoot-and-run, giving you the opportunity to get close, but giving you limited interaction with them. However, PDO is a 3D game and this has allowed the programmers a series of possibilities, the first of which is to rotate the view through 360 (thanks to the left and right triggers of the pad), allowing you to respond to assaults that come from any direction and that you can prevent thanks to a radar that indicates on which side the next enemies are looming. There are three types of attacks at your disposal: the gun held by Orta, the dragon's laser, which allows you to lock more monsters and kill them in sequence, and a berserk attack, which will make you invulnerable for a few moments and which will reload with spend some time. Compared to the previous episodes, some new features have been included, which open the field to a range of strategic possibilities when facing different game situations. The most important novelty is the one that allows you to glide, bypassing the end-of-level bosses, so as to dodge the most powerful attacks and which allows you to reach the weak points of the creatures, so as to eliminate them. However, this possibility of accelerating or decelerating has a cost and cannot be used at will, forcing you to make precise and well-balanced choices. The dragon can also take on three forms of different lengths, which evolve by collecting power-ups in the form of globes of pulsating energy. The basic form is light and fast, it allows you to lock multiple enemies with the multiple laser and to perform up to two consecutive glides; the intermediate form allows you to attack only four opponents with multiple lasers, but inflicting much more damage, and is limited by the fact that it is the only one that does not allow gliding; the third is the most massive one, which allows you to perform up to three glides in a row, but which does not allow you to use the multiple laser. The combination of all these elements, especially playing PDO at difficulty levels above easy, give life to a game that will not fail to excite you and make you damn your soul with continuous changes between the different forms of the dragon and with the careful observation of the attack patterns of the end-of-level bosses, in order to identify the right strategy to overcome them unscathed. Probably, those who do not like shoot'em ups will not find enough bread for their teeth, but the advice remains to give this title, at least, a careful chance. In the Sign of the Dragon. Panzer Dragoon was one of those titles that left a mark in the history of video games and, at the basis of so much glory, it is certainly the unmistakable design of the settings and creatures that populate this wonderful world. Since the time of the Saturn, many other titles have tried to take up its charm and inspiration, but none of the many imitations has managed to render the same feeling of amazement. The episode on Xbox presents itself at its best right from the start of the game and unfolds for ten stages full of surprises and without a drop in tension and quality. The hardware of the Microsoft console is exploited properly, thanks to a wise use of every possible effect, from bump mapping to particle explosions, which make a fine show, but always in the right way, without taking center stage, but helping bring to life some of the most beautiful creatures you have ever seen in a video game. The frame rate is always fluid and constant, but this notation cannot fail to take into account the structure of the game, which is much less stressful for the CPU than other 3D games that require much heavier calculations. Another hallmark of the series has always been the soundtrack and the audio sector in general. Also in this case Smile Bit hits the mark with a new edition of that music, halfway between tribal and new age, which, especially if listened to on a quality sound system, will know how to envelop and guide you until the end of the game. Pandora's Box. The real core of PDO's longevity is all in Pandora's box. Each time you finish an internship, you will be awarded a score and, depending on your skill, the pieces of a truly enormous puzzle will be unlocked. The secrets enclosed in the box are very different from each other and will not fail to delight you: from the images and artwork of all the episodes, to the countless files that describe the Panzer Dragoon universe, creating an absolutely credible and highly detailed land and story for all fans of the saga. However, the programmers have also thought of invigorating the gaming experience, giving the possibility of performing some submissions by impersonating secondary characters of the main adventure and hiding the entire first episode of the series, thus filling what could have been a gap on the side the longevity of the title. Comment Panzer Dragoon Orta is a great game, full of charm and so accurate that at times its nature as a three-dimensional shoot'em up is confused with that of an epic and fantasy adventure. Full of secrets to reveal, memories to get lost in for hours, it's a gift for anyone who has experienced the Saturn season in one of its most beautiful moments. For all the others, it remains one of the best shooters ever and a title, to which it is a must to give at least the opportunity to be captured and fascinated. The main adventure can be finished in less than ten hours of intense and technical gameplay, but the sub-games and Pandora's box surprises will keep all players busy for a long time, leaving them with a nice feeling of contentment. It is not possible to recommend the purchase of PDO sight unseen, but it is not possible for Xbox owners to let this title slip away without dedicating at least one intense game session to it. Pros One of the best episodes of the series and an excellent shoot'em up Full of surprises and secrets Under the immediate surface, a lot of strategy for fans of the genre Cons Behind the many delights, it's still a shoot'em up and you might not like it to all The longevity of the main adventure, if you don't want to get lost in Pandora's box Some legends are ancient and important and it is right that they are handed down over the years. The legend of Orta is narrated through two generations of hardware, because it's not the one linked to a girl without a past who finds herself catapulted into events that are too big for her, but starts from further away. It is the story of a lineage of very powerful dragons, full of energy and with an intense gaze like that of a child who knows that it can hurt, because it is different from the others. The Panzer Dragoon series was born on Saturn, Sega's 32-bit console, a machine that didn't have a chip dedicated to 3D acceleration and that was offering itself helplessly to the PSX and that Ridge Racer which, appearing out of nowhere, brought disturbing omens . There was no trace of Daytona USA in the home version and Sega users began to doubt and fear, when, suddenly, they found themselves in front of the eyes Panzer Dragoon of Team Andromeda. To put it simply, no one had ever seen such an inspiring and fascinating 3D game before. Suzuki's arcade racer came out a few months later with clipping problems and embarrassing cosmetics, at least compared to the expectations of the general public, and it was clear to everyone that Panzer Dragoon had something special, linked to the skills and sensitivity of its programmers , as well as its nature of shoot'em up on rails which made the polygonal engine less heavy to manage. After years of silence, two shoot'em ups and an rpg, a real cult game, Smile Bit releases the fourth episode of the series on Xbox and the fear that it could be a mere commercial operation dissolves in front of one of the most beautiful games of the saga and one of the milesori tests of the Microsoft branded console.", "date": "2003-03-31", "grade": null}
