And in fact we are faced with a game that at first leaves us quite perplexed, wanting to think in the classic terms of a western player, and which requires a certain predisposition to be properly appreciated. But no more talk and let's go in order; we can afford it since, after a long time, Hyu-Stone is also among us, with the name changed to a caption Splash or Crash in Europe, and to a funnier Kersploosh! in America. Then maybe one day they will explain to us how much the men who study the game titles for the different markets are paid, but that will be another article... Leap in the dark Splash or Crash also tries to justify its unusual concept with the outline of a plot, told through dialogues between the ~protagonist~ and his mentor, but story and text are so, shall we say, useless, that we will leave them out. The fact is that we find ourselves catapulted into the magical world of throwing stones into wells, with the aim of reaching the bottom in the shortest possible time, and we don't control the thrower, but the stone. And what is there to check, you will say. The stone falls and sooner or later reaches the bottom, it is the law of gravity. But if you say that, it's only because you've never been there, in a well, and you don't have the slightest idea of what you can find there nowadays. Yes, it's full of obstacles down there, bumpers, alternate routes, headwinds that slow you down, lava flows that damage you, sliced pizzas, giant donuts that give you a boost, and balloons that give you some HP back. That's right, we tell you that we have seen it: at this point it becomes clear how controlling the thrown stone, with a view from behind the Space Harrier, is vital, to ensure that it can avoid the various obstacles and take advantage of the bonuses , to reach the bottom quickly and possibly in one piece. We have talked about stones up to now but it would be better to talk about objects in general, because if it is true as it is true that at the beginning you have at your disposal a trivial slow stone, which makes little use of boosts and has a not very high number of HP (these are the characteristics that distinguish each object, and which directly affect its manoeuvrability), you will soon unlock another nine ~projectiles~: from the totally indestructible rubber ball which is greatly slowed down by various obstacles due to its composition, to that of iron that is a little, but a little, more fragile, much faster but so big that it obstructs the view, up to the little jewel that goes like a splinter but breaks on first contact. The same goes for the pits: ten in all, each one more difficult than the other, increasingly crammed with stuff popping up from everywhere, alternative routes, tricky obstacles that look like donut-boosts but make you stop right in the middle of the descent . The 3D effect In the body of the review we defined it as ~extraordinary~, here we increase the dose and say that it is one of the best uses of stereoscopy, at least as far as eShop games are concerned: obviously the concept and the view from behind lend themselves perfectly to the artifice, but the guys from Poi Soft did their bit calibrating it to perfection and on a very broad horizon. Not even affecting fluidity, this is certainly a very great added value; bringing the product back to its historical context, the Japanese release of the console, we can then even speak of a real ~manifesto~ of the 3D effect. Well done! The wishing well The indestructible rubber ball and the phenomenal iron ball are among the first projectiles to be unlocked, and since we are very smart, we immediately benefited from them to complete the game in less than half an hour: in fact, each well lasts as long as possible, even playing badly, a minute and a half, excluding the last one which is a little longer. We won't hide from you the sense of disappointment felt at first: is that all? Ten levels, very short, which would also be difficult to try to complete them well, but why bother seeing that the two spheres above are practically unbreakable? And so, as good reviewers, we suspected that there was something more, and we started replaying everything with other objects, faster and more fragile: a whole other world. Not wanting to go to the excesses of the ~Teardrop~ which has only one HP, already with the classic medium choice it becomes very difficult to get to the bottom healthy, and each well must be managed with a large dose of reflexes and coordinatesnation, as well as replayed several times to memorize each mechanism, which as we have already specified are renewed from stage to stage. The same goes for the ~bolides~ available: theoretically the mere difference in speed and boost may seem little to distinguish them from each other, but these parameters have a direct impact, we repeat, on the ~maneuverability~ and each therefore requires a sensitivity and a way to play differently: and this is the true spirit of Splash or Crash, extreme replayability in search of perfection, if not exactly, of something that comes very close to it. As well as, as a good old school, the highest score and the best time, to then be exchanged with other players via Streetpass. Connecting with this spirit is certainly not for everyone, but it is essential, we believe, to fully appreciate the work Poi Soft, to evaluate its longevity which for those who get involved can even become infinite, being the classic game to pull off in a short break, and incidentally allows you to objectively judge the excellent graphics, colorful, fluid, fast, defined, and the extraordinary 3D effect. Little hope instead for the sound: a single piece of music repeated for each well, and classic and forgettable sound effects.", "date": "2013-03-08", "grade": "7.2"}
