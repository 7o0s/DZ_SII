Well, with popularity comes interesting promotional opportunities, such as being able to become the protagonist of a video game. That's right, people who became famous with video game let's plays and who at some point can make let's plays of their own game: let's-play-ception. The mobile game that we are about to review is precisely PewDiePie Tuber Simulator, a freemium casual game for iOS and Android devices that starts from the experience of the famous PewDiePie and, without explicitly mentioning the Google video platform, urges us to become ~ tuber~ professionals by making videos of various kinds, gaining an increasingly large following and customizing the room from which we broadcast in various ways, so as to further increase our chances of clicking and monetizing. Turn on the webcam, let's get started. PewDiePie Tuber Simulator is a pleasant and carefree casual game, but without original ideas The price of contempt The first thing that strikes you about PewDiePie Tuber Simulator is undoubtedly the excellent mix of retro-style graphics and sound, capable of offering good quality, colorful and nice pixel art, as well as melodies that closely resemble the tunes of some titles for Commodore 64 and which remain in the lead after a few seconds, also due to their extreme repetitiveness. The early stages of the game obviously constitute a tutorial with respect to the mechanisms that characterize the gameplay, and which will see us move from one screen to another, accompanied by PewDiePie's voice, passing from the production of new videos, possibly concerning trendy topics, to purchase of useful objects to personalize the room and gain further views; from the enhancement of skills, which occurs through the use of ~brain points~ obtainable as our following increases, to the part dedicated to the delivery of ordered objects, which we can speed up by trying our hand at Puggle, a minigame that mimics the classic Peggle but in which we drop a pug to collect multipliers and thus decrease the timing. In short, the title of Outerminds is not lacking in nice ideas, which offers pleasant entertainment subject, however, to all the limits of a production of this kind, with clear casual traits, with limited interaction to the bone and discreetly waiting times long. After a while, in short, you will find yourself providing some input and closing the application to move on to take care of something else, opening it later to reap the benefits of what you have done and perhaps unlock some new objects. In short, the theme addressed by PewDiePie Tuber Simulator is tantalizing and some ideas appear original, but in the end it is a casual game like there are many, unable to offer real innovation within a genre particularly fossilized on certain mechanics .", "date": "2016-10-06", "grade": "6.0"}
