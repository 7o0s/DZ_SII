{"name": "Donkey Kong Country", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/donkey-kong-country.html", "text": "Genesis and miracles of a modern classic When the ancient Donkey Kong was named after him, he should have been called Monkey Kong. But the translation error of the Nintendo correspondents, who substituted a ~D~ for the ~M~ of Monkey, introduced the idea of a ~sinny monkey~, a stubborn monkey, who liked it so much that it was left for the final game , the same game in which a certain Jumpman, later Mario, saw the cold light of the monitor. Thanks also to that Mario, Nintendo was able to establish itself as the undisputed leader of the video game market, building a market which, except for a small controversial parenthesis constituted by the Megadrive and until Sony entered the field, was to all intents and purposes an empire. But 1994, the release year of Donkey Kong Country, had been preceded by the affirmation of Sega and its aggressive blue hedgehog, which depopulated in the critics and in the charts by cutting huge slices of the market to the big N. Nintendo immediately ran for cover with a series of titles of great impact, among which, precisely, the great return to the video game of Donkey Kong. The restyling of the ape and the development of the new game, under the protective wing of Nintendo, was entrusted to the gurus of Rare, active under the name of Ultimate since the early 80s and hired by Nintendo to be part of the ~dream team~ of developers who should have strengthened the soft library of the then fluctuating Nintendo64. Rare, now sold by Nintendo to Microsoft to the regret of many fans, revived a much more modern-looking Donkey Kong and inserted in a universe of places and characters (including Diddy) completely independent from the classic and high-atmosphere Nintendo fauna . The audio and particularly visual impact of the game, a classic but challenging platformer and not without original gimmicks, was devastating. The English developers used powerful workstations to render (using the ACM technique) extremely defined character models and background elements with a digital-art look, then transferring them into simple animation frames and making the most of the CPU and graphics processor of the SuperNES to obtain graphics of a fluidity and resolution, but also of a style, never seen on a sixteen bit. Genesis and miracles of a modern classic On the gameplay front, Donkey Kong Country had a platform system that borrowed a lot from Mario, but differed from it in a number of elements: the slightly reduced proportions between the characters and the playing area, all at the service of the graphic impact; the alternate use of Donkey and Diddy, the latter slightly faster, and the defeat after the knockdown of both; a fairly linear series of levels but with a fairly high difficulty and an ~old-fashioned~ progression; the addition of the possibility of eliminating enemies by rolling on them while running as well as with the canonical head-jump; interacting with barrels, bouncy tires, go-karts and other active elements that often required excellent reflexes; and the ability to ride different animals with specific properties, which opened up various and alternative gameplay elements. The real flaws were few, and they didn't lie in an alleged repetitiveness of the action or in the excessive focus on graphics. Rather, they were limited to the arbitrariness of the position of certain bonuses, the scrolling that on rare occasions made the most challenging pieces frustrating, and the lack of notable extras once the game was 100% complete. In short, Donkey Kong Country was a real killer application destined to remain in history. It spawned two sequels on SuperNES and a parallel series on the old GameBoy, as well as being converted to the GameBoyColor in an 8bit version (perhaps less sinister and at least more ~poetic~ than the present conversion) and inspiring the 3D experiment of Donkey Kong 64 for Nintendo64. Here, however, we are faced with the official and faithful conversion on the GBA, a laptop that comes right from the heart of the SuperNES. Let's see how this transposition works. Donkey Kong Country on GBA: the loss of feeling As we have mentioned, the gameplay of Donkey Kong Country is substantially faithful to the original. The most important innovations consist in the order of some levels, which appears strangely altered, in the modified patterns of certain bosses and some enemies and in the possibility of saving the player's progress at any time, making the game less frustrating but also much less demanding. proceed. To this must be added a series of extras, including: the Time Attack mode; the hero mode; the collection of ~snapshots~ of characters and environments, to be observed in a special photographic book; and the new mingames. The first is titled Funky's Fishing and presents itself as a fishing game with mechanics entirely borrowed from one of the Mario Party minigames (which is little surprise, considering that it is entirely Nintendo's sack flour); the second is called Candy's Dance Studio and is borrowed from musical games, for which it consists in pressing, at the right moment, the keys relating to those that appear on the screen to give life to a dance to the rhythm of music by our character. Both games, especially the first one, are quite fun, and work very well in multiplayer. Donkey Kong Country on GBA: the loss of feeling Bonus aside, the result of the transposition is a game faithful to the original, but much less demanding due to the possibility of saving at any time and the presence of a directory summarizing the bonuses of each level, absent on SuperNES. On an audiovisual level, unfortunately, the transposition is clearly lower than one could and should expect. As far as the audio is concerned, the fantastic music of the original (funky, tribal; evocative, unforgettable, in some cases truly poetic) has remained almost intact, but of a much lower quality due to the GBA's audio processor and above all the ridiculous speaker (but you can fix it with headphones). Graphically, the situation is similar. Although technically more powerful and versatile than the SuperNES, in fact, the GBA does not work in exactly the same way, and must also come up against the limits of a portable screen. The price is that some backgrounds have been reworked and cropped slightly to cope with the different proportions, often resulting in much less definition and losing some levels of parallax scrolling. Criminal act is then the choice to significantly increase the brightness of the environments and characters of the game due to the well-known darkness of the GBA screen, with the result of unjustifiably altering the graphic feeling of the original, which was very atmospheric and quite dark and finds itself literally watered down here, even overexposed when played on a GameBoy Advance SP. A huge tug at Nintendo for not having studied active brightness control and above all considering the possibility of the game being enjoyed on both the backlit and non-laptop versions! Fortunately, the animations of some enemies are slightly improved, and we can see previously missing elements such as small snakes, spiders, insects and bats that populate the seabed and platforms. Some cutscenes have also been sharpened or added from scratch; but those that replace the original backgrounds of the secondary characters of the game, such as the old Cranky or Funky Kong, have clearly deteriorated, losing many visual goodies and references from Nintendo and Rare classics. The same impoverishment can be found in the text of the game: in the original the dialogues with the characters were full of self-irony and humor towards the history of Nintendo, the classics of video games and even the competition, while on the GBA they were completely eliminated in favor of disjointed sentences regarding the highly anticipated progress within the levels. Cranky Kong, in particular, embodied the old video game hero who perpetually laments the lack of simple, no-nonsense video games ~of my day~, suggesting that the historic, first Donkey Kong was indeed him. In fact, in the original intro the gamer witnessed Cranky intent on playing an old music box on a red scale identical to that of the old arcade game. Soon after the current Donkey and his trusty Diddy burst in, forcibly kicking the old man with their loud stereo, thundering music and new title. All traces of all this have disappeared on GBA. The verdict on the remake Donkey Kong Country for the GBA is a faithful conversion to the original for SuperNES only for its playability in the strict sense, which derives from the similarity of the hardware and the consequent lightness in the conversion effort. It is therefore a high-class platformer, playable, challenging, engaging, with its own uniqueness and worthy of the great history of the genre. But this apparent ~ease~ of conversion has meant that the original feeling has been irretrievably ~lost along the way~, either for the criminal graphic choices, or for the exclusion of some fundamental aesthetic elements, or for the always available saves that make it much less challenging. At least for those who have lived the game,or places it in its original context, Donkey Kong Country on GBA is perhaps yet another proof of the fact that remakes should be considered as ~separate games~, as new titles, and not as the originals of the time. The fact is that time, additions, modifications, brightness changes necessarily work the games sideways, often for the worse. The conversion for GameBoyColor, implemented on an 8bit, was paradoxically superior, with irretrievably scaled graphics but very clean and enjoyable. In this case we have a classic which, in itself, has perfectly stood the test of time: in its playability, even if here it has become a little too easy, and even in its audiovisual proposal, which is equally in the high average of GBA productions current despite the bad transposition of backdrops and animations. As a title, therefore, it would be highly recommended in any soft library. The advice, however, at this point, is to cut the bull's head off and get yourself the original with its SuperNES. An alternative that is still anything but utopian and through which you will play a piece of history that is worth a nine or a nine and a half on a scale of judgment, not its ill-curated sale that scrapes the seven. PRO (The Game) A heritage platformer comes to GBA Great gameplay and great aesthetics Nine years old = fresher than its contemporaries! Extras: MiniGames in multiplayer AGAINST (The conversion) Audio&Video heavily resized Poorly defined and criminally watered down graphics With saves and the bonus index it's a bit easy Lost the nice intro and the irony in the original dialogues Always have time to take a SuperNES GameBoy Advance is, clearly, the console that more than any other in the history of video games could aspire to the title of videogame time machine. First of all, it is backwards compatible with the old GameBoy soft library, which dates back to the dawn of the nineties and was already subject to the recovery of the previous generation. Its hardware architecture, then, is developed starting from the Super NES. The two factors have made the console the scene of a massive process of accumulation and recovery of more or less worthy classics. Donkey Kong Country is certainly one of the most illustrious conversions. It is the fairly faithful transposition, in fact, of an exceptional game both for intrinsic quality and for historical importance. The Nintendo-Rare tandem established it as one of the best non-Mario platformers of the time and generated two excellent sequels but, above all, inaugurated and allowed a real SuperNES-renaissance. Thanks to the renewed aggressiveness, the 16bit Nintendo obliterated the now weak competition of the Megadrive and held its own for at least another couple of years with the more or less impressive advance of the various CD-i, 3DO, Jaguar, Saturn and Playstation. Understanding why this happened is easy when we realize that the conversion we have in our hands of this killer application can boast, in addition to the incorruptible gameplay, an audiovisual proposal that was so exceptional at the time that it remained fresh even at nine years old away and despite a bad redefinition. Pleasant bonuses such as the time attack mode, the two multiplayer mini-games and other little extras are added to the GBA conversion package. Overall, then, it's a decent re-release, a conversion that, regardless of the original, works. However, some choices in the adaptation phase of the game to the new laptop formula are highly questionable and partially affect the feeling, while the extras are nice but certainly not exceptional. The original is therefore ~watered down~. This is where the doubt arises: what if it were better to get a nice SuperNES?", "date": "2003-06-30", "grade": null}
