{"name": "La doppia vita di Wei", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/106886-sleeping-dogs-la-doppia-vita-di-wei.html", "text": "The troubled development of Sleeping Dogs is now well known. Presented under the Activision banner at the Spike Awards in December 2009 with the simple name of True Crime, the third chapter of an old free roaming action saga, the game was canceled from the programs of the American giant after just over two years despite the guys from United Front Games they had practically finished it. Too unprofitable when compared to the big names in the sector according to the Activision bosses, now completely focused on online games. But as they say, time is a gentleman, and not even six months later the publishing rights to the game were purchased by Square Enix who put the developers back in the saddle to arrive at the fateful release date of August 31, 2012. All in simple price of a name change. Hellish business Sleeping Dogs finally arrives on the shelves telling the criminal world of Hong Kong, but instead of making us play a small-time criminal eager to climb the hierarchies of the underworld, it takes us directly to the Infernal Affairs area, and conversely the American remake by Scorsese The Departed. Wei Shen is a policeman infiltrated in the Hong Kong triads, his aim is to get to the big shots to bring down the criminal system from within. Wei Shen's loyalty is the first thing to be in danger as cinema teaches us. If then also careerists and manipulative police officers are involved, it is easy to lose the compass and become a real criminal, getting too deeply into the character. The main merit of United Front Games is that, although handling not exactly original material, it manages to stage an adult story with a good pace, full of interesting supporting actors and which pushes us to get to the end in one breath. A perfect representation of the criminal underworld of Hong Kong, which mission after mission evolves as the protagonist evolves, up to the long and exciting finale. All for a duration of about fourteen hours playing rather quickly and with a fair number of secondary missions completed. In short, not so much, but with an end world available to close what was left open. The development of the game therefore revolves around Wei Shen's ~double work~. Everything we do serves to make the protagonist grow, unlocking peculiar offensive, defensive and social traits as he levels up, as well as various types of facilitation. A complex and deep system that has rarely been seen in free roaming, and which allows us to customize Wen Shei just as we want. Gangster with badge By acting on behalf of the Police, you ~win~ the possibility of stealing cars without setting off the alarm, of disarming your opponents more easily, enabling bullet time during firefights, not to mention less recoil or increased damage during ramming . If, on the other hand, we decide to work for the Triad, the prizes are all focused on the combat system, such as greater resistance to blows with bare hands or white weapons, or they add a series of enhanced attacks and evasive maneuvers. Then by finding twelve jade statues and returning them to the owner, who needless to say is a martial arts master, it is possible to learn advanced techniques for beating hands. These new moves increase the repertoire of attacks available in light of the different types of enemies, each with a peculiar offensive move. The combat system basically revolves around two keys, the attack one, the square, and the automatic countermove, or the triangle. Then of course there's the circle for grip and the x for running. When the enemy flashes red, just time the triangle to counter the incoming blow. This mechanism works very well, even too much, and since to perform the many moves available you have to make key combos that are very similar to each other, everything can become very confusing and not very technical. And if the simplicity of the clashes in itself were not enough, it is possible to perform bloody instant killings by slamming the opponents against well-defined areas of the scenario or making them into slices with cleavers and knives. Furthermore, if you are on the road, just take the jack from the hood of the cars and that's it. In short, there is no shortage of possibilities, on paper the combat phases are really rich, including flying kicks, elbow strikes, stunning blows, sweeps, breaking arms and legs, but in the end they turn out to be easy and repetitive, they almost never push us to really put into practice the teachings of our master. If you do it, it's just for the sake of trying out the new stuff, and not out of a real need to ggame. Super policeman Likewise, the gunfight sections turn out to be a bland, nailless take on the classic shooter with destructible shells. There aren't many, and above all they are ~commanded~, you switch to iron only when the mission allows it. United Front Games also throws bullet time into the cauldron to get out by jumping cover, but given the enemies' lack of tactical acumen, slow motion is more of a tinsel than something indispensable. Wen Shei's customization doesn't end there however. The evolution of the protagonist also passes through his reputation. Fame grows by completing the dozens of side missions available, ranging for example from the usual escort this, take that to clandestine races up to karaoke or love stories. In short, here too there is no lack of variety, with rewards such as the possibility of disarming opponents more easily, of always having a car kindly offered by the gang, greater strength and resistance, but also an increase in status buffs. Yes, a real status buff, as if we were in an RPG. By eating junk food on street corners and drinking green tea in abundance, your energy regeneration and damage are temporarily boosted. Not to mention the massages that allow us to raise the reputation bar faster during fights which, if at most, allows us to intimidate and make health recovery even faster. In short, Sleeping Dogs puts its effort into making our lives as easy as possible. Both the history of the Police and that of the Triad have a good number of secondary missions linked to secondary events compared to the main storyline. Returning to being guardians of the law we can dedicate ourselves to the systematic destruction of drug dealing squares or engage in longer and more articulated investigations ranging from serial killers to prostitution and gambling rings. All by staging well-chosen mini games, fist fights, shootings and of course dizzying car races. If, on the other hand, we decide to increase the Triad experience booklet, we are given the opportunity to help the other members of the gang, lead to more mild extortionate advice not inclined to shell out the grain or steal trucks in turn stolen by a rival gang. Lead sponges In short, from this point of view we cannot complain about the work done by United Front Games to diversify the action as much as possible. The progression from henchman to big shot is well staged, thanks to crude films and missions that gradually engage us in more important issues than the initial low-cost jobs. In short, it is a pity that all this amount of content, the stratified evolution of Wen Shei is not tested by an adequate level of difficulty, by a challenge rate that requires us to put into practice everything we have learned in the course of the game. In this sense then, but it could not be otherwise given the need to maximize the accumulation of experience, it would have been very interesting to include ~crossroads~ missions which decreed access or not to others of the opposite sign, which in short changed the evolution of events. With the star on the chest or with the tattoos clearly visible, the story continues anyway, and you can get to the end having seen all the main and secondary missions of the two sides. The automotive part of Sleeping Dogs deserves a separate discussion. Initially it can be really unsettling, the cars, even the smallest city cars, are real bars of soap, little more than unmanageable even under fifty miles per hour. But just do a little practice, dodging the schizophrenic city traffic to have a lot of fun, perhaps abusing the ram button (essential to quickly put an end to soporific police pursuits) and the one for drifting that transforms Sleeping Dogs into a middle between Ridge Racer and Burnout. A driving model that finds maximum exaltation in the numerous illegal races available on the map, which lead us to compete in the amazing track design of the twisted city of Hong Kong. Dramatically increasing the game content is the inclusion of a sort of ~Asynchronous Autolog~. Again, everything you do in-game, from stunts to completing missions (all of which can be repeated of course) is scored in online leaderboards, with the ability to send challenges to your friends. In this sense, United Front Games has also ensured robust post-launch support full of activities. Hong Kong therefore seems to be a perfect playground for Wei Shen. Playstation 3 trophies Sleeping Dogsawards the player with fifty-one trophies. They all relate to the various types of action that can be performed in the game, but also and above all to the level acquired and the number of Triad and Police missions carried out. There are also trophies related to the unlocks of the ~social~ part. Obviously the most coveted trophies are obtained by gradually completing all the missions, favors, races, extra jobs and investigations of the game. Heavy compromises After this long review of Sleeping Dogs gameplay, the time has come to take stock of its appearance as well. The troubled development is perfectly recognizable in the images sent to the screen of the game. The first impact is still pleasant. Hong Kong is very colorful, alive and vibrant, thanks also to a credible day-night and rain-clear cycle capable of coloring everything with a good number of light effects and shaders. However, nothing to tear your clothes off for, of course, but little goodies that enrich the usual collection of compromises to which a free roaming title must submit with a huge city that can immediately be freely explored in its entirety. The real strength is the city itself then. Quite large, divided into several islands and thematic districts, Hong Kong is a riot of avenues, stairways and narrow alleys that lead us to see the other side of the rich buildings with neon signs, large overpasses, fast factories, ports and fish markets, but also several hills to ~climb~ full of hairpin bends and vertiginous climbs. In short, a precise and detailed reconstruction of the metropolis, perfect for clandestine races with an exciting track design. However, the price to pay for all this is high. Sleeping Dogs is often the triumph of low resolution, both of the generic models and of the environment, of the blur to mask insistent pop-up and pop-in phenomena, of the unsteady frame rate, of a bizarre camera, but also of an artificial intelligence that regulates the city traffic that occasionally gives us pearls of involuntary comedy worthy of the future second episode of Oh My Bug. Luckily, next to this we have to take into account a coherent physics applied to all the objects on the screen, and undoubtedly a Wei Shen animated to perfection both in the fights and in his elegant parkour deeds and equipped, this time yes, with excellent textures ( the model gets dirty, bleeds and clothes tear). The same thing can be said for the supporting characters of the main storyline, a long gallery of gallows pendants in hip hop sauce, wise old men, unscrupulous businessmen and sensual starlets. The original English dubbing is excellent, thanks to a series of famous Hollywood actors hired and the soundtrack is good, a mix of pop, rock and electronic classics, not to mention a good repertoire of Chinese music of all kinds, from irritating songs to songs that seem to come directly from the soundtracks of Bruce Lee films.", "date": "2012-08-14", "grade": "7.8"}
