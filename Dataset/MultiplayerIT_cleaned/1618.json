{"name": "Breath of Fire IV", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/breath-of-fire-iv-2.html", "text": "The fire has already blown The Breath Of Fire series in the West has never achieved the desired success. The third episode, either because it was poorly advertised, or because it came out perhaps a little ~hidden~ did not record excellent sales; in fact, the title presented itself in a good guise, it certainly wasn't at the levels of Final Fantasy VII, but one could rightly speak of an excellent RPG. Be that as it may, it sold little and Capcom itself was up to the last in doubt whether or not to publish this fourth chapter in the West, released in the period of decline of the PSX, and today, after almost two years, arrived on our PCs. The title is packaged in the now classic ~DVDBox~ package and inside we will not find anything, except a postcard with instructions for installing the game. Needless to say, a manual could have been there. The installation proceeds painlessly, transferring the almost 600 megs required by the game to our exhausted hard disk. The game starts with an anime-style FMV presentation that introduces us to the story of Breath of Fire IV; these movies, even on the old PSX, are always pleasant and beautiful to see. Too bad that the worst compression of the PC format makes itself felt, graining the movies and consequently lowering their bill. Those who played the previous episode on PSX will be pleased to see how their old favorites are still present, Ryu in the lead. In the game however, we will take on the role of Nina, traveling in the desert aboard her ~ship~; in less than no time we will be swept away by a creature that will destroy our vehicle. But could it be totally negative as an event? Absolutely not, in fact, thanks to the kind monster, we will come across... yes, Ryu! Stories that intertwine The protagonist of this episode is always the blue-haired dragon boy, Ryu, as well as old acquaintances are Nina and the feline man Cray, engaged in a mission to find the princess but actually involved in preserving the safety of the world. A world that retains all its setting characteristics, always populated by human-animal hybrids. The story of the game is solid and pleasantly descriptive: it includes all RPG topics, such as magic, equipment, experience points, dungeons, chests and random enemy encounters. The playgroup is made up of six characters, three of which are chosen as the main ones, and used in rotation in the battle, which makes the latter more interesting: in this way, while the three characters in the front line engage in hand-to-hand combat body, the three who remain behind can use long-range weapons and take less damage than their more exposed companions. True to Capcom's style of handling combat, you can chain various types of attacks into a series of combos that deal extra damage. Furthermore, Ryu has retained the ability to transform into a dragon when the danger to face requires it. The story does not offer great originality, but it is still perfectly distributed throughout the game and is not entirely free from twists and special events. Appreciable is the amount of fantasy, the presence of a true role-playing game atmosphere: it is not easy to explain, but it is that type of RPG that once started, you will have to complete because its world, its characters they will become you; a real full immersion to understand each other. The characterization of the party certainly does not reach the levels of Grandia II, but it is still held in excellent account, even if to be honest, those of you who have not played with the previous episode will find it quite difficult to settle in completely. especially at the beginning. It can be said that the combat has not changed compared to the past but it is still fun. Innovative compared to the past is the possibility for the characters to increase their skills by learning from some masters they meet during the adventure. The graphics of this game are made up of two-dimensional images that manage to give vitality and personality as if they were more detailed polygonal models, so to speak. Technology On the technical side, the cons are more than the pros: the combat graphics, the effects of the spells and the shots may seem modest but in reality we realize that they are direct and essential, and substantially satisfactory. In fact, this prerogative of preferring leaner animations and graphic solutions allows you to speed up the pace of play. If we stop to observe the surrounding landscape, we immediately notice the immense edges, the square images, the wild flickering and so onhe has more than that; The sound of this game is truly engaging, even if not of good quality: in addition to a series of effects and noises, it makes use of enthralling well-paced music which, especially in the fight scenes, proves to be absolutely neither repetitive nor boring. Breath of fire IV contains a lot of mini games. Some are quite difficult because they have a weight in the story, others are simple and only serve to spice up a slow passage of the adventure (for example, you can enjoy fishing or supervising the construction of a village). Many consider them a bore and skip them because they do not take away or add anything to the progress of the game, others consider them a pleasant distraction while thinking about how to solve the problems that hinder the main mission. Breath of Fire IV is as massive a game as its predecessors. While it adds nothing to the standard RPG formula, it's hard to fault it. Good presentation, an interesting story, a satisfying game system and a visual combination to make it a great product for the gamer who has already been weaned on role-playing for years. In short, Breath of Fire is the perfect incarnation of the Japanese RPG, and if manage to disaccustom yourself to the beauty of the graphics of current games, if you can digest the sad combination of 3D and 2D, you will certainly have fun, also because the title is long and tantalizing until the end. Concluding If it had arrived 2 years ago, when PCs were less powerful, the situation would change. Given that I don't understand why a lover of Japanese RPGs shouldn't own a console, I don't understand the meaning of this conversion. Breath of Fire IV seems to run under an emulator, since it seems to be taken verbatim from the PSX, now dusty. A restyling, serious adaptation work would have been much more appreciable, but maybe I'm asking too much. If you leave out the technical considerations and get used to the pixels (typical of the PsX among other things) you will have a lot of fun with BoFIV, even if it remains a past title and no longer current (it came out as the antagonist Final Fantasy 9!!) But if you want to play a gdr up to the situation from a technical point of view, take a western title or choose Grandia II (superior in many aspects, including playability), or better, buy yourself a nice console (a Ps2 perhaps, where the fifth chapter has just been released) and abandon the strong compromises that BoFIV asks us to run on Windows Try before you buy. Pros: Interesting plot A ~massive~ RPG Long and captivating Characters well characterized Cons: Bad technical realization (already wobbled on PSX) Graphic sector unthinkable in 2003 on modern PCs Awkward controls (much better with a pad) Limping conversion Back in The Days One of the saddest chapters in the playful life of the PC was when a few years ago personal computer users waited with curiosity for conversions of famous titles for Play Station, which, while bringing the games of the famous Sony platform into our homes, also made users for the poor technical quality of these, a direct consequence of the manifest inferiority of the Psx hardware compared to modern PCs Are these times over? Well, it would seem so, given the flood of new generation consoles, whose conversions for PC (especially Xbox) are up to the task. But no, because surprisingly, Capcom brings to our PCs an old title for Play Station ~One~, almost forgotten but worthy of attention: let's talk about Breath of Fire IV. Analyzing the Capcom title, a clear and decisive distinction must be made. On the one hand, the game will interest all fans of the so-called ~jrpg~, who hope so much in the conversions of this genre of titles on PC. Usually these users are not very interested in the aesthetic aspect, paying more attention to the plot and characterization of the characters. There is also a slice of the public, however, who ask that the eye also wants its share. Well, if you belong to this second segment of users, take a good look at the screenshots before proceeding with the purchase", "date": "2003-06-18", "grade": null}
