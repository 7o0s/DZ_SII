{"name": "FIFA 09 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-09-recensione.html", "text": "FIFA makes 09 One of the most interesting novelties of this latest version is called Adidas Live Season, a feature which, in addition to advertising the famous brand of sportswear, allows you to dynamically update the formations and attributes of each player based on the performance provided by the player himself. Adidas Live Season, available for a fee on the PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, will constantly monitor player transfers and performance match after match, updating the statistics weekly. The championships covered by the Live Season are six: Barclay's Premier League, La Liga BBVA, Ligue 1, Bundesliga, Serie A and even the Mexican Primera Division. Electronic Arts has not yet disclosed the price of the subscription to the service, but has made it known that if the user is limited to choosing only one championship, the use of Live Season will be free until the end of the 2008/2009 season. As for the rest, FIFA 09 offers the usual plethora of modes, among which the most interesting are the Manager mode, which allows you to lead a team by managing every single aspect; the Tournament mode, which allows you to play 61 types of tournaments including 42 official ones; and finally Challenge, where you will have to face pre-established scenarios that allow you to unlock special contents. The new interface with customizable widgets is nice, which closely resembles a 2.0 website and fully gives the feeling of a PC game, not converted from the counterparts of the now dominant consoles. But the real sore point is this: the PC version of FIFA 09 is essentially an improvement built on last year's game, and therefore falls short of its PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 counterparts. start with prejudices and try to understand what this title can give to the target audience. The Special Nine The game plots seen in FIFA 09 are quite varied and elaborate, with the great advantage of not returning that feeling of ~planned at the table~ which unfortunately still haunts old and new football titles. As per tradition for all FIFA of the new course, this time too we find a great degree of control over passes and shots, both in terms of direction and depth. This does not mean that there are no problems to report or that the game has reached an extraordinary maturity, but the conditions for having fun are not lacking. One of the improvements that seem more convinced than the last edition concerns the aerial game, now more realistic and satisfying. Crosses are better managed, and scrums into the box for headers or volleys show a certain degree of realism. The artificial intelligence of the defenders is fair, who seem more attentive and reactive than in the past. Even the goalkeepers get away with it, albeit indulging in a few scary duckies from time to time. The physics of the ball is not yet entirely convincing, especially when compared to that on the console (the continuous comparison is a sore point, but unfortunately it is inevitable) and we must also point out the absence of the now famous 10 against 10 online and of some advanced tactical options. Of note is the correction of an annoying bug in version 08, which when playing in Professional mode meant that the controlled player could leave the camera frame: now visibility is always guaranteed. We could surprise you with special effects, but we'll just let you play with the mouse A curious novelty comes from the control systems: in addition to the usual keyboard and joypads, Electronic Arts has also included the possibility of playing with the combination of mouse and keyboard, we weren't even talking about Half-Life. Initially clumsy and bordering on the ridiculous, this system surprises positively once the necessary skill is acquired, and changes the face of the entire game. In the ideal configuration, movements continue to be managed by the keyboard, and the mouse is delegated to shots and passes: just like in a shooter, you ~aim~ with the mouse towards the desired area of the field, then pressing the left button (plus or shorter) a pass is made, and pressing the right one takes a shot on goal. The wheel, on the other hand, has other functions, implemented in a rather original way: by placing the pointer over a specific player and scrolling the wheel, you will get the result of making him snap towards the direction in which he is looking; by doing the same over a free area of the field, however, the player will be able to snap where desired. The wheel also serves to switch players. However, we don't think using the mouse and keyboard will become the preferred method of control for many gamers:the movements with the fully digital keyboard remain really too ~old gen~ compared to what a good joypad can offer; assigning them to the mouse instead we feel that a lot of playability is lost. But a few test matches are still a must, even just to see the same game from a different perspective. Graphics and sound Electronic Arts had long predicted that the graphics in this PC version would fall short of their HD console counterparts, and no doubt this particular promise has been delivered. Even if the general glance certainly cannot be defined as poor, the polygonal complexity and the lighting do not prove to be extraordinary (the 3D grass, on the other hand, is nice). For the animations, the usual speech always applies: some of them are excellent, but others give the feeling of being too fast and jerky, and return a sense of woodiness, starting from the simple run. FIFA has never shone for the resemblance of polygonal models to real footballers, but yet another step forward seems to have been made this year. Not entirely, however: absolutely inexplicable as in the year of grace 2008 there are still some digital alter-egos of famous footballers totally different from their real counterparts. An emblematic example is Pavel Nedved, with completely stoned features and dark brown hair (!), or Alessandro Del Piero himself. In the two test PCs, unfortunately, there was also a rather annoying screen scrolling problem: even with rather high frame rates (60 FPS) and vertical sync activated, moving the camera to the right or left gives a feeling of uncertainty, as if in reality the frames per second were about twenty. We don't know if the retail version will have the same problem, but our review code is certainly very similar. The ~surrounding~ audio during matches is very well done and engaging with cheering, voices from the bench and so on. The commentary entrusted to Fabio Caressa and Beppe Bergomi was extraordinary, probably the best ever seen in a football game so far. Pretty but not very incisive, as always, the soundtrack that accompanies us in the menus, in pure EA style. Comment FIFA continues to make progress, and once again the latest version manages to be the best ever. This PC version, despite being clearly inferior to its console counterparts, is the one that perhaps has benefited from the greatest improvements compared to last season. FIFA 09 in the Windows version may not be the best on the square but it is a good football title that every PC player should take very seriously.
