{"name": "Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mario-luigi-superstar-saga.html", "text": "RPG? This time we really have to wonder if the new Nintendo work, in collaboration with Alpha Dream, can be considered a Role Playing Game. Cornerstones of this genre such as story and exploration are practically non-existent in Mario & Luigi. The story, very banal, is not even made funny or funny (as it would like to be) by the events that happen during the adventure. Exploration is very limited, and the city-exploration-dungeon structure typical of the genre is not present in Mario & Luigi at all. You basically go from one dungeon to another, with short paths between the two still full of puzzles and enemies. Cities are few, and even in these few you won't be able to do much. The inhabitants only give useless information and the sub quests are very few, practically running into a city you will only need to find a shop to stock up on. It would probably be more appropriate to talk about an adventure with turn-based combat, because Mario and Luigi have very little of a j-rpg. It is totally action-based, with its deep, innovative and surprising gameplay. For almost the entire course of the adventure you will simultaneously take control of Mario and Luigi, you will guide a plumber with a cross and the other will follow you like a bloodhound. The A and R keys will be used for the Leader character: with the backbone you will choose the various actions, such as jumping or the hammer, and with A you will perform them. Same thing for L and B, but these will be aimed at the other plumber's movements. There are many moves in cooperation. At the end of the game there will be numerous actions available, all varied and appreciable. As you can guess, controlling two characters on the screen, even with the possibility of performing actions at the same time, is the extra weapon of this game. All the challenging puzzles come from this new idea. The player will have to be very able to adapt to new situations, he will be required on many occasions to have to control both characters at the same time. Initially the control system might seem difficult and slightly cumbersome, but with a little practice you will realize how well thought out and intuitive it is. Variety is guaranteed throughout the game, which will keep you busy for around twenty hours. The fights are turn-based and take place in a different environment from the usual map where Mario and Luigi move. The battles are not random as in many RPGs but will only start if you come into contact with an enemy. You will have to select your actions from a menu, you can attack, defend yourself, use items or, apart from boss fights, run away. There are both individual and collaborative attacks, the latter however, although more harmful to the opponent, will consume points called Brother Points, which can be recharged using some potions. The player will have to keep his eyes wide open during both the defensive and offensive phases. In fact, to hit or take cover, it is not enough to select the appropriate item from the menu, but you will have to press the A and B buttons at the right moment. The combined attacks are combos to be performed with the exact pressure of these two buttons. During the enemy attack you will be given a chance to avoid his offense, it's up to you to jump your opponent or dodge his strike at the right time. Sometimes, with perfect timing, it's even possible to do damage by defending yourself. The fights are well balanced, especially those with ~normal~ enemies. The bosses, while very resistant, are perhaps too easy to defeat. By winning the battles you will earn the usual experience points which, adding up, will make our heroes level up, increasing their characteristics. It will be up to you to decide whether to create a balanced couple or one particularly inclined to one of the many skills. Style To the trivial story are added some truly horrendous dialogues, characters and names: we don't know if the Italian translation has helped to make everything worse, but the game we find in the shops is incredibly stupid from this point of view. A Mario title has never placed particular emphasis on these features, but Mario & Luigi hits rock bottom. Try to be nice and ironic with jokes and nicknames that kindergarten children would call childish. Suffice it to say that the game takes place in a land bordering the Mushroom Kingdom, called Beanland, dominated by Queen Bean and the handsome Prince Bean. A witch steals from this realm the sacred beanstalk, which can only be operated by a graceful and gentle voice, a voice she obviously doesn't have, and steals from Peach. For this Mario and Luigi leave alladventure, to recover the voice of the princess. The only nice dialogues, among other things classics of this series, are those between Mario and the inhabitants who, recognizing him, do not believe their eyes. Even the characters who mock Luigi are quite likable. Incredibly, a bad story and characters with non-existent personalities are contrasted with an excellent artistic work. The top view shows us the characters in all their glory. The whole world is well drawn and animated, graced by very pleasant soft colors. The pleasant illustrations are vaguely reminiscent of those of Yoshi's Island. The items and enemies are almost all taken from the main series, and Mario fans will notice one reference after another. The music doesn't excel but they make themselves heard, the sound effects, especially the voices of Mario and Luigi, are excellent. Comment Mario & Luigi is definitely the most marisco game in the series. The gameplay is well-kept, deep and innovative. The puzzles are very varied, challenging and original. The fights are fun, well balanced and interactive. The part concerning the action is therefore close to perfection. On the contrary, unfortunately, the story, the characters and the cities are aspects on which the Alpha Dream has worked little. The puzzles are totally related to the action, the many sub-quests done in the past you can forget, as well as the characters to interact with. In Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga you jump, fight and solve beautiful puzzles. The story and the characters are only peripheral components, devices to make our heroes go around the world. The game lasts about twenty hours and is certainly worth every single gold coin it costs, it's only up to you to decide if you are willing to pass over these shortcomings so that you can appreciate one of the most original concepts of recent years. Pros: Originality to spare Excellent fights Challenging and varied puzzles Good graphics Deep gameplay Cons: Dialogues more than trivial Small and poorly made cities The first episode that saw the Mushroom Kingdom characters as protagonists of a role-playing video game was Super Mario RPG, released in the last year of the Super Nintendo's life, only in Japan and the United States. The game, developed by Square and published by Nintendo, was one of the last collaborative projects between the two companies. Super Mario RPG combined the classic RPG from Square with the well-known Nintendo characters. Excellent puzzles, amazing graphics and a well-calibrated difficulty made this title great, despite the fact that the story, a fundamental component of every role-playing game, was not up to the rest. Several years later, the unofficial sequel to Super Mario RPG was released on the Nintendo 64, this time developed by Intelligent System, an internal team of Nintendo. His name was Mario Story or Paper Mario, the former for Japan the latter for the West. At first impact with the game, one was inevitably amazed by the graphics, in fact the flat two-dimensional characters (which look like paper, hence the name Paper) moved with ease, and with style, in all polygonal and 3D scenarios. The game compared to its predecessor paid less attention to some typical aspects of the genre, such as the characters, less characterized than in the work Square. Conversely, the gameplay was better and more polished. In addition to fast and technical combat, Paper Mario boasted an interaction with the surrounding environment rarely seen in a j-rpg. Today, at the end of 2003, the third episode of this glorious and anomalous saga has arrived, and surprises are not lacking as usual.", "date": "2003-12-02", "grade": null}
