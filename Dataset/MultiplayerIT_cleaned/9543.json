The advantage of an open and varied market, as the Apple store has proven to be, however, is that of giving the same (potential) visibility to both super titles and small productions, immeasurably expanding the offer and consequently diversifying the demand. However, small productions is not necessarily synonymous with a silly little game (as history has now taught us): Vikings Can Fly! for example, it literally embodies that genius and freshness of gameplay which, with rare exceptions, are in hiding on other platforms, thanks to the simple but very fun mechanics that constitute its fulcrum. With my head in the clouds The story that surrounds the funny situations of Vikings Can Fly! starring Bjorn, a bizarre inventor who is quite well known in his Scandinavian village but who had never done anything important in his life. However, everything changes when one day, approaching a waterfall, he sees a magnificent valkyrie intent on washing herself, without clothes and, faithful to tradition, with a statuesque physique. It is therefore easy to imagine the ~carnal~ reaction of the passionate Viking: his attempt to approach is however obviously (and brutally) rejected by the Nordic creature also because, it should be remembered, the Valkyries were in charge of collecting the bodies of the young heroes who died in battle to transfer them to the Paradise of Warriors; consequently, their physical strength was at least equal to their beauty, with the imaginable painful consequences for Bjorn's rear. Thus seeing the woman of his life fly away, the young Nordic comes to mind all the (useless) inventions he had previously created in order to stay in the air as long as possible; leaping off a cliff over and over again he would finally hook on the right air current and fly in pursuit of his Valkyrie, following in the wake of her intense scent. The ultimate goal of the game is therefore to help Bjorn, through a whole series of tools and power ups, to fly to the kingdom of the Valkyries, crossing the nine worlds of Nordic mythology. Given the size of the Viking, this undertaking will not be at least initially easy: the first take-off takes place from a cliff with the sole strength of its legs; as the only initial aid, it is possible to use a small wooden propeller, which guarantees small altitude recoveries for each glide, and the turbo, a sort of magical serum contained in a cornucopia, capable of making anyone who drinks it levitate. However, each flight attempt, inevitably destined to end up with a terrifying crash to the ground, will guarantee a gold bonus directly proportional to the distance travelled. Therefore, by accumulating money, aids and bonuses will become available, useful for lengthening the glide and increasing the initial momentum. However, the points of the aerial skills must then be added to the bonus items, which, like the values present in an RPG, will improve their aerodynamics, speed, height of the cliff and turbo power from time to time; finally, thanks to three very useful magic runes, the possibility of a sort of rescue in extremis is given by means of a winged sandal, a whirlwind of air and a nice group of Vikings with a shield on their shoulders, ready to throw anyone back into the air was about to fall from the sky. Controlling Bjorn's flight is only an apparently easy operation, because it is necessary to carefully manage all the possibilities offered by bonuses and turbos: the direction of flight is given by the inclination of the accelerometers, which can be set for both horizontal and vertical use . In the air there are gold nuggets, useful for accumulating extra gold, and small boosts for the turbo. The very useful tools that allow careful management of resources are all enclosed in a small window at the top left: altimeter, speedometer and odometer will in fact allow you to always have the situation under control, thus indicating the best time to intervene with a sip of turbo or with a rune. Unfortunately, to obtain the essential items and upgrades in order to lengthen the range of the flight, it will be necessary to repeat flights that are already known to be disastrous many times: this is because the most useful inventions really cost a lot of gold. A risk of repetitiveness is therefore well present but the curiosity to see how far the young Viking can be pushed will quickly take over. Technically speaking, Vikings Can Fly! proves very simple but equally effective, thanks to a fun stile cartoon and the immediately recognizable diversification for the 9 worlds of Scandinavian mythology (which cross each other horizontally without interruption). The title also supports Game Center and offers 44 achievements, each of which returns solid gold (redeemable from the Flight Diary menu) to spend on inventions.
