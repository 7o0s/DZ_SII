Despite the infrared pointing system of the Wii-mote, therefore, capable of restoring a feeling very different from that of a real lightgun, the developers have managed to package excellent quality products, to be played and replayed in search of the highscore. In the case of Gunblade NY and LA Machineguns Arcade Hits Pack, we are faced with a compilation of ~old glories~ branded SEGA and dating back to 1995 and 1998 respectively, reproposed to the nostalgic public (unfortunately not at a budget price, which is surprising not a little) but not only. The two shooters boast extremely similar gameplay, which is based on the use of a large-caliber machine gun instead of the classic pistol. The differences compared to other titles of the genre are evident: there is no need to reload or, on balance, to aim; our opponents are rather resistant androids and what matters during the game is the time it will take to eliminate them, a decisive element especially in the ~time attack~ game mode, in which each area must be completed strictly in sixty seconds. Gunblade NY Set in July 2005 (ergo ten years ~in the future~ compared to the actual theatrical release), Gunblade NY sees the city of New York besieged by an army of heavily armed robotic terrorists. Our character controls the machine gun of an attack helicopter belonging to a special team, and his objective is to eliminate as many enemies as possible through three zones (plus a final one) characterized by the dynamism of the visual, which never stops to move by reflecting in a spectacular but plausible way the movements of the vehicle we are on. As mentioned above, our weapon doesn't need reloading or cooling, and it fires bursts of shots that don't run out: we can try to be precise and maybe hit some headshots in the name of scoring, but these are factors that don't make the difference. difference from completing the game. From the main screen you can choose between two missions, ~easy~ and ~hard~: ~Liberate the UN headquarters~ and ~Liberate Manhattan~. In the first case we will fly over Times Square, the city center and the headquarters of the United Nations, and then move over the water to chase the terrorists who are on board a ship. At the end of each stage we have to face a different boss, sometimes they are small handfuls of well-armed robots or, in the final, a huge mech capable of flying and firing missiles. The ~story~ continues in the second mission, ~Free Manhattan~, which sees us fighting on the Brooklyn Bridge, in Battery Park, in front of the Grand Army Plaza and in the center, trying to destroy the android army once and for all. Although generally this kind of shooter moves on ~rails~, in the case of Gunblade NY the management of the view also depends on our targets: the helicopter will quickly follow the opponents we have targeted, flying over the area until we have managed to destroy them . Our enemies return fire by firing missiles at us that we can intercept; moreover, the android that is about to fire is ~highlighted~, so as to allow us to hit him or in any case prepare for a defensive maneuver. The game over arrives when we have suffered three hits, but the presence of infinite ~continues~ allows us for better or for worse to complete the game even on the first lap, in a handful of minutes and without particular problems. The compilation features a system of objectives that allow us to conquer new ~ranks~ as we improve our performances, as well as unlock variants of the default machine gun to be used in both Gunblade NY and LA Machineguns. As far as the technical aspect is concerned, the game dates back to 1995 and it shows: although the frame rate always remains fluid and the idea of the helicopter translates into rather dynamic and spectacular sequences, the polygonal count is really poor, with which today make us smile (although at the time they represented the avant-garde of 3D). The sound sector is also very ~out of time~. LA Machineguns Three years in the world of videogames are a lot of time, and in fact the technical differences between LA Machineguns and Gunblade NY are quite evident, right from the start.And. The game offers a similar story to its predecessor, although this time the scenario is Los Angeles and our heroes find themselves aboard futuristic flying motorbikes instead of a helicopter. The gameplay is practically the same: there is always the machine gun with infinite shots and there are always the robotic terrorists to destroy, who jump and ~disassemble~ as we hit them, until they explode. Civilians have been added, which we must be careful not to kill (under penalty of losing points, nothing to worry about) and there has been a better job regarding the boss fights, which see us engaged in fighting huge assault helicopters , mechs, tanks, drilling robots and finally a giant flying fortress. Unlike Gunblade NY, the main screen does not offer us two campaigns divided into various areas, but rather four rather short missions (plus one extra), although generally more demanding: they range from the center of Los Angeles to the waters around the Alcatraz prison , from the streets of Las Vegas to Yosemite park, finally flying through the Valley of Fire for the ultimate chase. Beyond a certainly more valuable technical component, LA Machineguns does not introduce who knows what novelties: the scenarios are more beautiful to look at and have more detail, but the number of interactable objects is still low. The polygonal models of the androids are much less angular and finally offer more variety.", "date": "2010-09-16", "grade": "5.0"}
