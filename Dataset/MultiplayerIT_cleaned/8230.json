The first chapter comes out in 2004 and manages to create its own slice of fans, which grows enormously with the release on Steam (we are talking about one of the first games to enter Valve's digital delivery service). From there on it's just bad expansions and disastrous spin-offs that do nothing but alienate the fans, while being quite successful. The truth is that, although there is no official sequel, the story told in the first chapter has been expanded in the various iterations, often taking questionable directions. And here comes Painkiller Hell & Damnation, the latest attempt to exploit the success of the original without investing too much in it. In reality it is not difficult to say that it is the most ambitious title of the series, apart from the progenitor ... perhaps because it is the remake made with the Unreal Engine 3? But if it's a remake, why does it continue the story instead of restarting it? Besides, why does it have fewer chapters than the original? What a headache. The story of the game tells of Death who promises the good Daniel Garner to reunite him with his beloved if he can collect 7000 souls with a new weapon, the Soul Catcher. To do this he will have to recross some of the infernal worlds he has already visited in the past and make the usual massacre of lost creatures. If desired, he can also bring a friend along in cooperative mode because, as they say in such cases, a massacre in company is more fun than a solitary massacre (the levels remain the same, only the enemies increase). We just have to find out whether or not it is worth taking on the role of good Daniel again, or whether it is not the case to send him to hell definitively. The cold numbers Normally, when we talk about remakes, we think of photocopies of more or less old titles updated graphically. In several cases, in addition to the aesthetic updates, there are also relevant novelties in the gameplay, but this is certainly not the case with Painkiller Hell & Damnation, which indeed appears as a bonsai version of the original Painkiller, only with an extra weapon. The game consists of nine levels, plus four bosses, plus a bonus level, which is actually another of the levels designed by People Can Fly somehow placed as if it were an unlockable extra at the end of the single player campaign. Actually playing the Abandoned Factory, this is the name of the extra level, doesn't give great advantages since the tarot that can be unlocked by finishing it is much less useful than the one you get by beating the final boss... mysteries. However, in total they make eight hours of play, to which at least a couple must be added if you play on the Nightmare difficulty level (the third out of four) right away. Finishing the game on Nightmare difficulty unlocks the Trauma difficulty, which is all about partying and increases the challenge exponentially. Adding a little longevity is also the collection of tarot cards, unlockable by achieving one or two objectives in each level. The 2004 Painkiller came out on the market with the beauty of twenty-four levels, of which five bosses, for a total of twenty hours of gameplay (as there is no Soul Catcher, to which we have dedicated an entire paragraph, it was much more difficult to continue ). Of course, Hell & Damnation has the cooperative mode, which can double its duration, but the numbers are quite unforgiving and on balance the original is still a step ahead, also adding that on the various digital delivery services it can be purchased for half the price. price the Black version, which also includes the first expansion, the only decent one. Obviously in terms of graphics Hell & Damnation wins. The use of a more modern engine is there and it shows, especially in the effects and in the improvement of the models, but we took this for granted even before installing it. From an audio point of view, however, the differences are not noticeable at all. We know that it is bad to make a comparison based on raw numbers, but we are always talking about a remake and those who have played the original certainly want to know if it is worth making a further economic effort to try this too. Soul Catcher rules The only big novelty of the game is the aforementioned Soul Catcher, a weapon that will be delivered to us by Death at the beginning of the adventure. This is an exceptional trinket capable of firing spinning blades with primary fire (limited projectiles), and a green ray captures souls with secondary fire (Ghostbusters style, with unlimited charge). After having accumulated a certain number of souls, a projectile can be fired which will subjugate the enemies making them work for us, i.e. they will fight against their own kind. Captured enemies will prove to be an invaluable tool in a great many situations, as they can perform trueand his own massacres before finally expiring. On the positive side of the Soul Catcher it must be said that it is a very fun weapon to use and very powerful indeed, on the negative one cannot fail to notice how it makes the rest of the arsenal almost completely useless. Weapons like the shotgun, the stake shooter or even the rocket launcher will only make a comeback against bosses. In short, we used it throughout the game, without ever feeling the need to switch to anything else. Every now and then we tried to alternate, but quickly fell back. Especially at the higher difficulty levels, the possibility of taking control of the enemies proved to be decisive in order not to die all the time. In fact, using the Soul Catcher, unlike in the past, dying becomes a rare occurrence. This is why we advise you, if you want to buy Painkiller Hell & Damnation, to immediately raise the game difficulty. Since in the preview we mentioned the enemies getting stuck, we're pleased to report that this doesn't happen in the final version, i.e. it seems that the developers have fixed the pathfinding. Sure, they're not smart, but at least now they don't spend their time running into poles or graves. Contents and conclusions In terms of content we are faced with the old and dear metal orgy, already well anticipated by the title, which many have loved in the past and to which the first Painkiller owes part of its success. From this point of view, the imprint of People Can Fly remains very strong, with the new developers, The Farm 51, who have not dared to take half a step forward compared to the original. So here we are called to face hordes of demons and various creatures that seem to come from the covers of the most famous metal records, with that wanted baroque / gore bad taste that many like so much. In short, if you have seen even a glimpse of any Painkiller you know what to expect, also because absolutely nothing has changed compared to the past. It only remains to understand if Painkiller Hell & Damnation is worth the money it costs (about twenty euros). The answer to this age-old question depends very much on your background: if you have already played the first episode and have abandoned the series without bothering to look at the subsequent expansions, you will not find anything here that will motivate you to pick it up again. If, on the other hand, you love the series regardless, because you appreciate its gameplay, or because the setting fits your imagination perfectly, maybe you can give it a chance and you certainly won't disdain it. The game might also appeal to those who have never tried a Painkiller so far and want to try their hand at a frenetic title, very different from current average shooters. Everyone else can safely fly over it... they won't miss a thing.", "date": "2012-10-26", "grade": "6.8"}
