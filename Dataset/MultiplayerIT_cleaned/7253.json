On the other hand, Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, released on Super Nintendo, is unanimously considered a masterpiece of the platform genre, an outstanding example of style and game design capable of withstanding the test of time. And instead, to the displeasure of the servile green dinosaur, the years have passed in a very different way, between rare appearances and even more infrequent protagonist titles that have never managed to renew that indelible mark left with the first adventure. If the most well-founded hopes of a big-style relaunch point to the promising Yarn Yoshi for Wii U which has however somewhat disappeared from the radar, in the meantime fans of the likeable creature can focus on Nintendo 3DS, the console chosen to host this Yoshi's New Island . Yoshi's New Island is decent, but the return of the green dinosaur deserved something more A GPS for the stork The path chosen by Nintendo to give life to Yoshi's New Island rests both feet firmly in tradition, drawing heavily on what has already been seen in previous episodes. The plot itself, subtle and inconsistent, is limited to revealing itself at the beginning and at the end of the game: in summary, the stork who has been entrusted with the task of delivering Baby Mario and Baby Luigi to their intended parents ends up going the wrong way. Resuming the journey in search of the correct address, however, the poor bird finds himself meeting the evil Kamek and his henchmen, intent on kidnapping the two newborns. In the scuffle Baby Mario crashes until he falls on the Egg Island of the Yoshi clan, a place that has lost the serenity it once had since Baby Bowser decided to choose it as his personal holiday resort. Finding unity of purpose, the group of dinosaurs and Baby Mario then choose to embark on the adventure, to find their little brother and defeat the evil invader. Nothing more than a fairy tale with different deja vu therefore, mainly useful for making sense of the journey of the different colorful Yoshis with the small future plumber on his back through the levels divided into 6 worlds. But obviously the link with tradition is not only related to the plot, far from it: a handful of moments are really enough to understand how the game mechanics have remained almost completely unchanged compared to the past, giving life to an experience that users more experienced will find nothing short of familiar. Yoshi's New Island on Nintendo 3DS is in fact a two-dimensional platformer that keeps the formula of the original unchanged, choosing a very specific path that still proves to be quite distinct from other similar Nintendo titles. Here the difficulty, the precision of the jumps, the frenzy and the rhythm are almost abstract concepts, blurry and distant, which only very rarely reveal themselves in some slightly more difficult passage or situation; for the rest, Yoshi's adventure is a relaxing, never frustrating experience, almost a walk for the more experienced who will not find it difficult to reach the end credits with a hundred (really) residual lives accumulated. The idea that Nintendo has chosen to direct the product more decisively towards casual players is corroborated by the presence of the wings; these, offered by a generous green tube following the loss of a couple of lives in the same point, practically allow Yoshi to flutter safely above platforms and enemies, so as to put aside any possible and very remote risk of getting stuck. But if this were not enough, the same tube will then be able to offer golden wings, able to also add invincibility to the aforementioned powers. In short, if we want to put the challenging Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze recently released on Wii U on one side of the platform difficulty spectrum, well, then Yoshi's New Island is exactly on the opposite side. Let me be clear, this in itself certainly does not constitute a defect: on the contrary, it is always a pleasure to be able to see how such different experiences can coexist under the Nintendo label, and within the same genre. Assuming therefore that the high difficulty is not what you are looking for, the effort of the Arzest team is still able to give some satisfaction even to those who have greater skill between keys and directional crosses; this is because, as often happens in the gameplay formula studied by the Kyoto house, this adventure too is taken at different levels of approach, thus proving to be able to be appreciated by different groups of players.If to simply reach the end of the levels, as already mentioned, it really takes minimal effort, things change when you decide to get 100% of what Yoshi's New Island has to offer. In fact, exactly as in the previous chapters, also in this case 20 red coins and 5 smiling flowers are hidden in each level: if some of them are on the ~main~ road, others instead require more research, fully expressing that exploratory element that strongly characterizes the mechanics of the series. In addition, to say that you have really completed a stage, you have to reach the end with 30 precious stars: if finding them is easy enough, it is even easier to lose them, because contact with an enemy is enough to see them vanish in the countdown that begins. he only interrupts by quickly catching poor Baby Mario. Finally, at the end of each level there is a kind of roulette wheel, destined - if so - to transform the collected smiling flowers into medals thanks to which bonus levels can be unlocked. The 3D effect The 3D effect of Yoshi's New Island is really pleasant: while limiting itself to applying the sense of depth to the various levels of parallax, the overall result is able to improve the glance of the game, also guaranteeing greater cohesion between 2D and three dimensional. Our advice is therefore undoubtedly to play with the stick raised. A dancing tribe That Yoshi's New Island is far from representing a breaking or turning point for the franchise, to put it mildly, is therefore now quite clear. Despite this, the developers of Arzest have nevertheless chosen to include some innovations, the most incisive of which is constituted by the Mega Ovoni. Those who are familiar with the character will surely know of the dinosaur's peculiar ability, which allows it to swallow enemies and transform them into eggs to be used as projectiles; in Yoshi's New Island, however, there are also huge opponents, positioned in precise pre-established points, which once swallowed allow giant eggs to be laid. Wanting to overlook the physiological implications and the extraordinary pain that poor Yoshi is probably forced to endure to expel these products, in practice these Mega Ovoni simply allow you to knock down rock walls, pipes or anything else that gets in the way of the pre-established trajectory. In some cases the disproportionate eggs themselves may be made of metal, so as to allow Yoshi to sink to the bottom under water instead of floating as usual. The problem with the Mega Eggs, as well as the Yoshistars that allow you to run on walls or fly like a rocket and watermelons with which to spit seeds, fire or ice, is that they are always poorly amalgamated with the progression of the levels and more generally with the game mechanics: the feeling is that they are more parentheses, among other things rather sporadic, rather than elements inserted into the gameplay in a convincing and credible way. More interesting are the transformations, which take place by entering the vortex portals scattered throughout the stages: in these cases Yoshi finds himself assuming the appearance of different objects such as a hot air balloon, a drill, a helicopter, a wagon, a bob or a submarine, facing short sequences which, mainly exploiting the motion sensors of Nintendo 3DS, give a pleasant variety to the action. Certainly also in this case we are dealing with sections unrelated to the context, but the fact that they can be reached through portals makes the detachment more honest, clear and evident, assuring them the credibility instead absent in the passages described above. Nonetheless, the overall judgment on the level design of Yoshi's New Island cannot exceed the sufficiency. Despite the precious presence of Takashi Tezuka in the role of producer, in the specific case one gets the impression that for the most part it is an academic work, without qualitative flashes, at times even boring and extremely distant from the values of the unattainable progenitor. In a similar way, the battles with the bosses are never surprising: always very easy, short, predictable and very little spectacular. Also with regard to the graphic component then, there is something to discuss: the artistic direction chosen in this case wanted to keep the indications of the episode for Super Nintendo in broad terms, with settings and backdrops that recall the hand painting technique in oil or watercolor, but accompanying everything with characters and elements modeled in 3D. A mix that cannot be said to be perfectly successful; but if you can get used to the stylistic inconsistency after a while, the significant drops in quality are less acceptableitatives of some elements, which appear throughout the course of the adventure, and which is difficult not to categorize as simply ~ugly~. More or less important details that are particularly jarring, especially in the face of other passages that instead turn out to be absolutely pleasant. Something similar can also be said for the musical accompaniment, which alternates catchy songs with soporific ones, uninspired if not downright annoying.", "date": "2014-03-13", "grade": "7.0"}
