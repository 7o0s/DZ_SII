Now, finally, we are ready to talk about it in detail and sum up what is, to all intents and purposes, the first sequel in the history of the saga. As we wrote in this article, the eighth chapter is closely connected to the events of Resident Evil VII: Biohazard; therefore you need to have played it or, at least, know the events. Not surprisingly, Capcom has recently published a summary video of the events in order to refresh the memory, or to create the foundations for those who have not tried it so that they have a starting point to appreciate this new experience. Already from such a premise, or from the fact that Resident Evil Village is the first real sequel ever produced, Capcom's intention to go a little further and try to experiment is clear. Until now all the chapters have always been part of the macro narrative universe of the series but have never influenced each other directly: in other words, it was possible to play them in random order without losing too much of the general plot - except then having to rearrange a couple of things here and there. Creating a still unconfirmed trilogy (which, after playing this chapter, we are sure will be done) and therefore going to work much more on the narrative front pleasantly surprised us. Resident Evil is a saga with twenty-five years on its shoulders, whose success was not at all imaginable at the time and which over time has always tried to readjust itself while never completely abandoning its B movie soul. She had a dark period but was able to recover very well with Resident Evil VII: Biohazard by marrying the original idea of Shinji Mikami according to which the series had to develop in the first person, introducing a new protagonist and at the same time managing not to lose the thread with certain past events. It has, in a sense, returned to its own roots and now confirms the excellent path taken: here is our review of Resident Evil Village. History, atmosphere and narration Out of respect for the restrictions but above all yours as you prepare to enjoy this new plunge into horror, we will not go beyond what is already known about the plot. Three years have passed since the events of Dulvey, Ethan has reunited with Mia and together they have tried to rebuild their lives, they even had a daughter - little Rosemary. What now seems to be a happy family is broken by none other than Chris Redfield: one night he attacks the Winters together with his team, killing Mia and kidnapping Rosemary. It's just the beginning of a new nightmare for Ethan, who will then find himself in a mysterious Romanian village in search of his daughter, but there will be new and dangerous threats to hinder him: from the fierce lycans to the four lords who govern the area, all headed by to the cryptic Mother Miranda: coming out unscathed and together with Rosemary could prove to be a feat beyond his strength. From the first minutes, therefore, Capcom builds the tension alongside the curiosity to know why a hero like Chris has acted in such a brutal way. He therefore manages to put us in Ethan's shoes and his bewilderment in the face of out-of-control events. Once you get to the heart of the game, or after the tragic prologue, the sense of loneliness and abandonment is perceived at every step, as well as the doubt of always being constantly under the eyes of someone or something; we greatly appreciated the fact that, despite the vague security of owning a firearm, one cannot avoid taking small steps and with the utmost caution. Immersion works very well, whether it's in the large halls of Castel Dimitrescu or in the seemingly ordinary corridors of Casa Beneviento, and anxiety will be our trusty companion from the beginning to the end of the game - in some cases with peaks that forced us to stop and take off our headphones. Resident Evil Village, Chris takes Rose away before a helpless Ethan The sound design once again does a masterful job of creating the perfect horror atmosphere, alternating music in a menacing crescendo with ambient sounds up to absolute silence - which is what has put the most tension on us. Although intimidating, in fact, music is an external element that manages to estrange us, albeit very little, from what we are experiencing: suddenly falling silent makes us one with Ethan and the ability with which Capcom has managed to balance all to be applauded. On the other hand, he had already demonstrated the exceptional nature of the sound design both in Resident Evil VII: Biohazard and, to an even greater extent, in Resident Evil 2 Remake: here he confirms onceplus his ability to manipulate our moods with just the use of sound - and sound, in horror or survival horror, is imperative to the experience. As far as storytelling is concerned, almost everything is perfect. Almost because we believe that Resident Evil Village suffers a bit from the middle chapter syndrome - a role that, we repeat, is new within the series: it must act as a bridge between the past and the future, clarifying some outstanding points and opening up to what could happen without exposing yourself too much. Here, in this specific case, the eighth chapter ties together many threads of Resident Evil VII: Biohazard but it is not always clear in its explanations. We specify, some details have always been rather hidden in the plots and only after careful research it is possible to put together a more homogeneous picture, however we believe that taking some more time to better shed light on certain aspects would not have hurt: a document, a movie or a dialogue would have contributed a lot to the initial confusion that caught us at certain moments. This does not mean that the story, as a whole, is incomprehensible or botched; rather, the presence of additional content (along the lines of Not a Hero and End of Zoe) that better balance specific parts seemed quite probable to us. There is a lot of meat on the fire and not all of it has been cooked to perfection but the banquet that is served remains, overall, of very high quality. Resident Evil Village, Ethan makes his way through the cold and darkness of an unfamiliar forest The plot is rather linear, as it has always been in those chapters that were not told from different points of view (therefore Resident Evil 6) but the overall view, made up of more or less sensitive details, is offered only if attention is paid both to the environmental narration and to the documents scattered throughout the game: if a game played exclusively with the desire to get from the beginning to the end will be useful for a summary understanding of the events, proceeding calmly will reward you with a greater contextualization of facts and characters. Our advice is not to rush, take everything that Resident Evil Village has to offer and metabolize it step by step: we are facing the most elaborate plot so far in terms of content, demonstrating a progressive maturation of the saga while not lacking the above elements the lines we have been used to. In terms of pace, an issue that we will return to when talking about the gameplay, the game does not give ground and makes excellent use of twists and turns: just when you think you understand what is happening, the situation takes an unpredictable turn bringing attention back to the highest levels, also giving us another reason to continue. The same tones are changeable, thanks also to an excellent characterization of the four Lords, each different from the other in attitude, narrative background and, precisely, approach to the gameplay side. The latter is moreover built around the narrative, not the other way around, thus making it a key element without which perhaps things would have taken place in a different and less satisfying way. One is, in essence, the lifeblood of the other: the story allows the playful sector to take shape and express itself properly while the latter, in turn, enhances the narrative making it almost palpable. Resident Evil Village, the view of the village and its surroundings is remarkable Gameplay and gunplay Resident Evil Village takes place entirely in first person but, unlike the previous chapter, there is no VR support: we do not exclude that with the advent of PSVR2 it could be its flagship title, for the moment we have to be satisfied with playing it as it is 'And. That's not the only difference, because already starting from the inventory you can see the declared cues taken from Resident Evil 4: together with the merchant known as Duke, a couple of sequences that strongly recall Leon's nightmare in Spain and in general a much more action soul than its predecessor, which in its second part became a boring succession of shootings, Resident Evil Village presents us with a very welcome balance in gameplay. On the one hand, nostalgics will feel partly at home, however without the advantage of ~ special moves~ that Leon and the other characters had: therefore, where the fourth chapter began to become more frenetic but did not fail to offer the player a palliative with roundhouse kicks and suplexes that often compensated for the use of ammunition, here we must understand that we don't dictate the rules - we undergo them and adapt to them, exploiting the environment wisely. On the other hand, the game suddenly empties us of all the adrenaline of a last-ditch fight (literally, especially if there islike us you play your first game in Extreme) to plunge us into the purest tension, deliberately slowing down your pace and leaving us at the mercy of an uncertainty for which not even the comfort of a weapon can do much. We won't tell you who, where and when, just know that Resident Evil Village is a bundle of experiences all different in terms of narrative, as we have already written, and gameplay: from a struggle for survival we will find ourselves racking our brains in front of an enigma, going around the enemies in the hope not become aware of us (we are not talking about stealth but it is still possible to go unnoticed long enough to make it an advantage), to escape from an Alcina Dimitrescu to which our bullets do not even mess up the styling up to fight in real guts where the only hope is in the aim. Resident Evil Village, the lycans are aware of our presence and wait. But then they load... You never get bored and this is the value of the eighth chapter: right towards the end you will be able to perceive a hint of tiredness but it is a smudge from which you recover immediately, thanks to the aforementioned twists and turns. Fight to the last breath, build objects, buy, upgrade, solve puzzles, escape, plan a strategy, in an unpredictable succession that will leave you ever alert; a curious mix of genres that reminded us of all the good of Resident Evil 1, Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 4, applied to the formula adopted by the seventh chapter - here expressed even better. In Dulvey there was a respectable start, which in the long run got lost, while in Romania it is a continuous discovery, an experience capable of reinventing itself so as not to end up in monotony. Some parts may convince you less than others, in the end it comes down to personal taste, but their amalgamation is unique. Considering how much reliance you will have on firearms, we expected a particular care in the merits of gunplay and we were not disappointed: the effectiveness and effect vary significantly from one to the other, alternating them in a run through the quick menu is a very reactive action and you notice a very slight change in running speed based on which one you are holding. The sound design, on the other hand, was less convincing, which only here seemed subdued and not particularly able to differentiate between the dispersal of the exterior and the potential rumble of a more closed area such as the castle's basement. It's a detail that you only notice when you really pay attention to it, nor can it be said that it devalues or undermines the experience in any way. Also because, to emerge is the excellent use of the adaptive triggers of the DualSense. Resident Evil Village, the council of four lords together with Mother Miranda We had already noticed it during the demos but with Ethan's entire arsenal available it becomes much clearer how much care has been placed in this feature. Each weapon has its own specific weight, which is perceived when you lift it to aim: the pressure to be exerted changes and is very evident. However, to make everything even better is the fact that this differentiation is not only necessary between different types of weapons - for example between pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles and so on - but within the same category. To give an example practical, the first pistol you get in the game has no weight and can be cocked with a light pull of the trigger (indicating even its coarser nature), while already a pistol as refined as the Albert-01, available with pre-order, requires a little extra effort. It should also be noted that if a weapon were to be equipped with a stock, the resistance exerted will be less than when it was without one: a gem, we greatly appreciated it. Likewise, shooting requires different pressures but the swerve is less perceptible; nevertheless, work has also been done on this point to make gunplay a relevant part of the experience and not a tinsel. Resident Evil Village, Castel Dimitrescu Vineyards have very realistic bogeymen The Village of Shadows Shooting will, in fact, be the only thing keeping you alive in and around the village. Escape is an option, and in this sense we didn't appreciate very much that some enemies have a narrow area of action beyond which they turn their backs on you and return to their place as if you didn't exist, but it's not always easy to get wings at the feet. Lycans are particularly fast, other enemies may be slower but force you into an excessive retreat, or not allow it at all in any contests. Either way, sooner or later, you'll have to come back to face them if you want to pass. You don't run away.
