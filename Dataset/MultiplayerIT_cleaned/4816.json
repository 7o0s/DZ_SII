However, THQ Nordic decided not to give up and publish the game anyway, perhaps because the development was now in the final stages and it would have been a shame to throw away the work done; or because it is mindful of other publishers who have built their fortune on support for now abandoned consoles (see Electronic Arts, with its sports titles). Whatever the reason for War's landing on Wii U, in short, the seals have been broken once again, seven and a half years after the debut of the Vigil Games action game, and there is a towering Horseman of the Apocalypse determined to have some answers. Will we be able to give them to him? The end of the world The introductory sequence of Darksiders: Warmastered Edition takes up the fine narration in Italian that also characterized the original version, telling us about the truce between the angelic and demonic armies that led to the birth of men. A truce literally sealed by a pact that would only be broken when the human race was capable of fighting its last battle: Armageddon. A very violent meteor shower seems to mark this destiny prematurely, but it is not rocks that fall from the sky but angels and demons, who make the earth their battlefield again and end up extinguishing any form of life. Recalled by the events, Guerra, one of the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, realizes that something is not right: his three companions have not been summoned and the ancient members of the Arso Consiglio accuse him of having acted of his own will, condemning the beings humans and devastating the world. To prove his innocence he will have only one chance: to make his way through the demonic and angelic hordes with his huge sword Divoracaos and find the real culprit. An incipit that does not seem to have aged a day, that of Darksiders, and which can still count on the valuable artistic contribution of the American designer Joe Madureira, who created the protagonist and all the creatures of the game. Of course, the remastering work did not work miracles on Wii U, giving us a technical sector that is halfway between the original 2010 edition and the Warmastered Edition which landed on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. But let's proceed in order. The Legend of War It's amazing how enjoyable and brilliant Darksiders is still after all these years. Thanks above all to the clear inspiration that Vigil Games has drawn from the various episodes of The Legend of Zelda, especially in terms of progression and level design; the fact is that exploring the scenarios in search of secrets, observing objects with which it will be possible to interact only after having acquired certain skills and grappling with the solid, spectacular fights and boss fights that the adventure proposes proves to be a very pleasant experience, even rewarding if let's consider that you don't see many such beautiful games around. The path that Guerra must complete to reach the epilogue of his odyssey, facing ever stronger enemies and ever more complex environmental puzzles, to be solved only through the use of specific powers, therefore remains exciting, net of the frustrating slowness of our movements during the first hours, when we will necessarily have to do a lot of backtracking relying only on our legs. However, the gameplay evolves quickly, and so also the combat system takes on connotations of great thickness in the folds of its many upgrades, which allow you to improve the effectiveness of the shots and unlock new weapons in addition to the sword, as well as new special maneuvers capable to quickly resolve the most difficult duels. Warmastered? The quality of Darksiders is therefore not in question: the title of Vigil Games manages to involve from the very first lines and to convince thanks to the goodness of its design. But what about the Warmastered Edition? Beyond the fact that it seems at least bizarre to witness the release of the first chapter of the series on Wii U almost five years after the publication of Darksiders II, which was one of the launch games of the Nintendo console, we are faced with a remaster half: a product that technically takes something from the versions for current generation platforms, but not enough to clearly differentiate itself from the original edition. The feeling is that the developers had to make difficult choices in the face of the far from overwhelming power available,giving up both 1080p and sixty frames per second instead of a resolution that should be equal to 720p and a frame rate that aims for thirty frames, generally stable but subject to more than one uncertainty. The terrible tearing that afflicted the original Darksiders has been eliminated and the textures of the Warmastered Edition have been inserted, for which we must give credit to THQ Nordic, but the game does not exploit the GamePad in any way (there is no possibility to view map and interface, for example, but only to duplicate what we see on the screen) and the controller does not lend itself very well to the key combinations necessary to perform the various maneuvers, although this is obviously not the fault of the developers.", "date": "2017-06-10", "grade": "7.5"}
