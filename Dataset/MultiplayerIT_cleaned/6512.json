{"name": "White Night", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/146392-white-night-luce-dei-miei-occhi.html", "text": "Last year was particularly prosperous and engaging for fans of survival horror, which, between the return to the scene of Shinji Mikami with his The Evil Within, the excellent Alien: Isolation by The Creative Assembly, the announcement of the new Silent Hill introduced by the terrifying teaser P.T. and, last but not least, various pearls of the independent undergrowth were able to test again now obsolete ~old school~ dynamics, buried in recent years by a commercial action drift that has claimed illustrious victims (who said Dead Space?). 2015 in this light could be remembered as an even better year for survival horror; just think that he made his debut with the ~HD Remaster~ version of the original chapter of Resident Evil and the good Dying Light. Many other titles ~kissed~ by terror will follow in the coming months, such as the long-awaited exclusive Until Dawn for PlayStation 4. Just like Shinji Mikami's masterpiece, the pioneering Alone in The Dark and other disturbing classics such as Amnesia, Outlast, Clock Tower and even the visually splendid The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, is inspired by White Night, the first work of the independent team OSome Studio (which ended up under the protective wings of Activision) which, thanks to its extremely personal graphic and artistic style, has won awards and podiums in various video game events. White Night, which has just landed on Steam at a cost of 14.99 Euros, is generating a lot of interest thanks to the tasty trailers that accompany its promotion; we analyzed it thoroughly and these are our impressions. Lots of lights and some shadows in OSome Studio's fascinating first work I light up immensely Generally the technical component of a work is the last of the pieces that critics put under the microscope, nevertheless there are some products that need a different ~treatment~, especially when the graphic element and artistic flair intimately permeate the gameplay , becoming a fundamental part of the playful experience and not acting as a simple factor that feeds the visual impact. White Night, as you may have noticed from the screeshots that dot our article, is entirely made in black and white, in strong contrast with each other, where the absence of gray scales gives the OSome Studio production the charm of a noir comic in motion. The only color present in the game is the yellow of some specific and faint lights, such as the ephemeral fire of matches, indispensable tools that the cryptic protagonist must necessarily have with him, in order not to succumb to the twisted nightmare in which he is engulfed. We are faced with a survival horror which, due to the peculiar shots of the camera, fixed or semi-fixed, recalls the mechanics appreciated in the very first Resident Evil and in Clock Tower, however in it there is no action component, but only a exploratory soul, which leads to the need to solve environmental puzzles and puzzles, as well as collect objects and interesting collectibles. The title is set in America in the late '30s, immediately after the period of Prohibition and the so-called Great Depression, whose key themes converge in the splendid and disturbing plot that characterizes the work of OSome Studio. It all begins with a mysterious car accident, which will lead the battered protagonist inside the classic corrupt and haunted mansion, a dwelling that hides a foul and anguished family history among its elegant rooms, now in ruins. The details of the story unfold by exploring the building and collecting the diaries of the protagonists involved, a real journey of no return in the absolute and disturbing human madness, catalysed by the economic crisis, by illness and by abject personal interests. It should be emphasized that the screenplay, elegant, profound and mature, is masterfully written, and the texts, very rich in quotations and cultural references, have nothing to envy to those of first-rate theatrical and cinematographic works, involving the player in a whirlwind of sensations out of the ordinary. The evil that winds its way through the written notes, to be read as you would a good book, manifests itself in the form of ghostly female figures that haunt the rooms of the house: there is no way to face them head on, and at first contact you is irrevocably killed. The only solution to stem the problem, when accessible, is the electric light, hand-in-hand with the puzzles that permeate the entire gaming experience. In fact, the black and white colors not only enhance the pleasant visual impact of White Night, but are constantly at the service of the gameplay, a real tool with which the developers play in each sequence. Duringthe exploratory phases, the matches represent the backbone of the survival experience, since a maximum of twelve can be carried at a time and they run out rather quickly, condemning the protagonist to madness - and therefore to game over - if he does not have them. To proceed in the adventure, clearly story driven, it is therefore necessary to ponder one's moves, decide whether to take risks and advance into the next room or go back to the nearest save point. The latter, like the Resident Evil typewriters, are represented by specific armchairs, where instead of ink ribbons it is necessary to light a candle and waste the equipped match. To be fully enjoyed, White Night should be sipped calmly letting yourself get involved in the plot, collecting and reading as many texts as possible in the mansion: in this way, the six chapters that make up the adventure can also be completed in eight or more hours, in based on the player's skill with puzzles. There is no doubt, however, that a hasty and deleterious ~speed run~ could literally destroy the longevity of French opera. Darkness around the corner While on the one hand you are literally ensnared by the delightful script, by the play of light and shadow that hide the disturbing truths of the spooky abode, on the other it cannot be denied that White Night, unfortunately, suffers from some problems that affect its full enjoyment . First of all, the movements of the protagonist, influenced by the shots, work exactly as in the old classics of the genre, and the inputs given are not always fluid and responsive, sometimes generating confusion when one is in the presence of ghosts: not infrequently the daring escapes end badly due to hidden obstacles or continuous changes of shot, which contextually change the direction of travel. The main problem, however, lies in the inaccurate arrangement of the save points, sometimes far too distant from each other, and the sudden deaths caused by the not always precise control system, or by ghosts impossible to see due to the camera, force you to replay entire sequences, breaking the narrative rhythm and the accumulated tension. Another not negligible detail, due to the peculiar graphic style, is represented by the fact that it is not always easy to understand which objects of interest are, furthermore collectible documents, such as books and notes, remain in the scenario even after having collected them, and sometimes loses between those consulted and not. Only old cameras are removed from the stage when collected. However, it must be said that after a couple of hours of play you get used to these imperfect dynamics, and White Night flows quite smoothly until its natural conclusion. Unfortunately there are also a couple of very rare ~lethal~ bugs that force you to start the adventure over again, but the developers are working to solve the delicate problem. From a purely technical point of view, the title suffers from a little aliasing and the polygonal models are not particularly detailed, while there are only two graphic options that can be modified, namely V-sync and anti-aliasing filter. Despite the limitations, White Night is always fascinating to look at, as well as wonderful to listen to, thanks to well-sampled sound effects and a delightful soundtrack, bouncing between jazz and classical piano music, even with songs sung. The quality of the texts, translated into Italian, far exceeds the current average quality.", "date": "2015-03-09", "grade": "8.0"}
