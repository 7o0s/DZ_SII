{"name": "Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "The relaunch of the Square Enix series on the Nintendo hybrid console, which began a few months ago with World of Final Fantasy and continued through iconic chapters such as Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy IX and the recent package which includes, in a single solution, the remastered versions of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2. It was a trip down memory lane that will continue with another spin-off in a few months - Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles, but we have already replayed Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon EVERY BUDDY too! - and which we hope still has several surprises in store for us: in the meantime, however, Square Enix has also decided to bring the controversial Final Fantasy XII to the Switch, whose review you are reading, a title that split the fandom in two at the time of the released (it was 2006) due to its extremely innovative nature that broke with the past and began an experimental path that even today the most conservative fans struggle to digest. The era of Ivalice The names behind Final Fantasy XII are undoubtedly impressive. The directors Hiroyuki Ito and Hiroshi Minagawa are the veterans of Final Fantasy and have been active in the Japanese company since the 80s, while the character designer Akihiko Yoshida is the same one who sketched the first Ivalice at the time of the highly acclaimed Final Fantasy Tactics. The fact that Final Fantasy XII is set in that same world could not therefore preclude the collaboration of the composers Hitoshi Sakimoto and Masaharu Iwata: thanks to them, anyone who fought alongside Ramza Beoulve in the War of the Lions immediately felt at home. A real dream team, in short, which gathered under one roof, at the helm of a great project called Ivalice Alliance, had in hand what probably should have been the greatest Final Fantasy of all time. And yet something went wrong. Yasumi Matsuno, who was supposed to direct and write the story from beginning to end, retired mid-development. Nobody knows the truth: officially there is talk of health problems, but anyone who works in the sector knows that creative differences, delays, budgets out of control were at stake. And maybe that's why Final Fantasy XII trudges a bit halfway: it's almost as if the story and the characters, at the climax, temporarily lose their sense of direction. The story takes a few hours to retrace its steps and then does it with great fanfare, but after a stratospheric start follows a failure that does not go unnoticed. Perhaps the fault lies with Vaan, one of the most innocuous protagonists of the saga who, however, finds himself holding his own against a much more charismatic and engaging cast. The fact is that Vaan should never have been the protagonist: Matsuno wanted Basch in his place, but the bosses of Square Enix still remembered the burn of the excellent but unpopular Vagrant Story and much preferred a teenager in which Japanese gamers could empathize more easily. That's why Vaan, the weak link in the cast, always seems out of place. Retroactively grafted into the late-stage script, he is an observer in a story that already focuses more on the world and mythology than on the cast: an atypical choice for the Final Fantasy series which, before and after, has always focused heavily on the characters. Yet the world of Ivalice has so much to say. The story takes place in the kingdom of Dalmasca, two years after the invasion of the Archadian empire which conquered the capital of Rabanastre on Princess Ashe's wedding day: the young woman therefore loses her father, her future husband and the throne in of a few hours. A series of fortuitous circumstances brings together Vaan, his friend Penelo, Ashe and her bodyguard Basch, as well as the extravagant thieves Balthier and Fran in a single company that will have to embark on a perilous journey to restore the princess her crown and prevent the empire from gaining power beyond all control. Combat in the time of the zodiac Final Fantasy XII broke with tradition in terms of gameplay, adopting a completely different approach compared to previous iterations especially in terms of exploration and combat system. Completely abandoning the scaled worlds and random fights, the Square Enix title catapults the player into an Ivalice divided into macro areas that make up a huge map that we could almost define as an open world prototype. The borders of each map flow into adjacent areas through short loads, but the feeling of being in a huge open area or in an intricate dungeon never disappoints. One of the criticisms that fans addressed to Finto Fantasy XII, years ago, it was precisely about the slowness of walking, exacerbated by the vastness of the maps: a problem that this remastered edition solves with the possibility of speeding up the animations by 200% and 400%, especially speeding up the grinding and any backtracking phases. The party consists of up to three characters who move around the map together, following the leader who controls the player. The combat takes place in real time, choosing a dynamic, called Active Dimension Battle, which at the time was directly inspired by MMORPGs - just like Final Fantasy XI Online, the title that preceded Final Fantasy XII - but which today Switch owners would find much more similar to the setting of Xenoblade Chronicles 2. Enemies appear on the map and the player can decide when and how to attack them through the typical drop-down menu: at which point an indicator marks the time interval between the actions that the player can choose individually for each character. Final Fantasy XII's combat system, however, relies on a complex network of behavioral parameters called Gambit. Initially limited, these parameters increase with time and progression, allowing the player to literally script the behavior of the characters: you can decide, for example, that Balthier uses a healing potion on an ally who has less than 30% health and the artificial intelligence, punctual as a Swiss watch, will follow the set order whenever the aforementioned condition occurs. The Gambit system isn't always intuitive and gets more and more intricate with increasing abilities, spells and conditions that the player can set. If you want you can simply choose each action manually for each member of the party, but the clashes become longer, more complex and frenetic, which is why it becomes very important to make the most of the Gambits in order not to go crazy behind the most complicated situations. In a sense it is a game within the game and with a little patience and strategy scripts can be prepared that can fight entirely for the player against the strongest monsters in Ivalice. However, the understanding and proper development of the License Board remains of paramount importance. They represent the real role-playing development of the characters who acquire specific points by defeating enemies: the player then spends them on these special boards, deciding which skills to unlock from time to time. The fact is that the skills in question obviously do not concern only spells and skills, but also bonuses to statistics or even the ability to wield certain weapons or wear specific pieces of equipment. It should be noted at this point that Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age carries this subtitle due to its revised and corrected nature. Shortly after the release of Final Fantasy XII, Square Enix revived the game in the form of the International Zodiac Job System, a special edition that was confined to Japan for a long time. The remastered version that went around the world a couple of years ago on PlayStation 4 and PC, and which now also arrives on Switch and Xbox One, is based precisely on the International Zodiac Job System edition and therefore allows you to choose a series of predefined boards inspired by the iconic Jobs of Final Fantasy to help the player better develop the characters. If in the original we were a bit left to ourselves, with the risk of forming handyman characters without precise directions, the new License system allows us to better orient each member of the party, specializing him, for example, in close combat (Samurai) or in throwing of healing spells (White Magician). It's a less free solution, yes, but also more elegant, which makes the experience more direct and precise. And in this respect, the Switch (and Xbox One) version of Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age still has something extra. The Switch version Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age on Switch is not a simple and lazy conversion of the last edition for PlayStation 4 and PC. In fact, Square Enix has made some small changes which, on balance, make this version simply definitive. The most striking novelty concerns the possibility of changing Jobs and, therefore, of resetting individual Licenses simply by speaking to the Montblanc moogle in the headquarters of the Centurio Clan. Previously, the player was forced to keep the Jobs chosen at the beginning for the entire duration of the game, perhaps compromising the development of characters more inclined to another discipline than the one selected. It is therefore a feature that fans have been clamoring for years and that now grants an immense freedom of experimentation compared to the past. In this sense, we also appreciated the possibility of setting and saving up to three Gambits per character: in this way you can easily switch from one strategy to another without having to constantly tweak the parameters of the scripts. They are small additions, in terms of gameplay, which however have a significant impact on the quality of the experience in general. In a certain sense, they also rejuvenate a game that in any case carries a good thirteen years on its shoulders. It is important to keep in mind the age of Final Fantasy XII because it is clear that we are not dealing with a technically cutting-edge title, even if it came out practically between PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3, at a time when Square Enix he had by then mastered the Sony hardware and worked small miracles. The credit for the visual impact that Final Fantasy XII still has today, despite the far from impressive number of polygons, certainly goes to the sensational artistic direction of Hideo Minaba and the character design of Akihiko Yoshida. Ivalice is even more beautiful than ever, a fascinating world in which Western and Eastern atmospheres mix and contribute to making each scenario unique. The remaster has made the image sharper and brighter, on Switch almost indistinguishable from the PlayStation 4 version when the console is housed in the Dock. In handheld mode, Final Fantasy XII runs excellently, without any slowdown and without particularly straining the console's battery. The image seemed slightly blurry to us on the small screen of the hybrid console, but it is a subtle difference that you have to make an effort to notice and which goes unnoticed within a few minutes. Final Fantasy XII is also an RPG that lends itself beautifully to portability, although the vastness of the locations return a vaguely more satisfying sensation on the TV screen. In this respect, in short, we can only be satisfied with the conversion for Switch which, moreover, guarantees all the other features already implemented in the previous remastering, including the double Japanese / English audio track and the three interchangeable soundtracks at any time. To all this, you can add the brand new New Game + which allows you to start the adventure over again, importing the objects and money earned in the previous game.", "date": "2019-05-02", "grade": "8.7"}
