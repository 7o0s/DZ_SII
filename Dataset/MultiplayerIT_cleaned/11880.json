{"name": "Age of Empires 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/age-of-empires-3.html", "text": "Unlike the episodes that appeared on PC, we won't find ourselves going through different historical periods, but the whole story takes place during the famous attack by the Ottoman Empire on the island of Malta. Although in a frightening minority on that occasion the Knights of St. John rejected the advance of the Ottomans resisting what has gone down in history as the most famous siege of all time. Will we be able to do the same? The adventures of the main mode, the Campaign, will all revolve around this famous historical event and will force us to defend ourselves in every possible way against the various attacks. As per tradition in Age of Empires we will have to develop our resources to be able to survive the fight. The cornerstone of our management system is the City Center, the building that will allow us to create settlers, the fundamental basic units in the development of our group. In fact, settlers can build any type of building, from houses to barracks, passing from stables to defensive outposts. Each building will have a price, indicated according to the three available resources: food, wood and gold. The ulterior purpose of the ~workers~ is to obtain these resources, by cutting down trees, digging in mines and taking the fruits of the forest. Before developing our village we will have to have enough homes to support the workers and warriors, only later will we be able to give birth to new fighters, the musketeers, the hussars on horseback or the simple pikemen. Each unit has specific characteristics in defense and attack which make them more suitable to meet certain types of opponents. The research and resource management system is perfectly balanced so as to never be frustrating and at the same time allow the right development for our army. The control system works very well and our troops can be managed both through the stick present in some mobile phones and through the canonical cross that is created with the numbers on the keyboard. Each unit can be selected with a simple click while with a double click we will move all the soldiers of the same class, an excellent system for attacks against the enemy. The fights are actually the least fun part of the game, always resulting in the mass sending of our soldiers against the opposing ones. The management of the troops has also been enriched by the possibility of commanding them by pausing the game, in this way it is always possible not to be surprised by the enemy's moves and above all to optimize the time available. The games in the Campaign are always ~rich~ but at the same time not excessively long, in order to make the game usable even in a short break. The other mode present is the Battle mode in which we will be able to play a single mission with customized victory conditions, we will be able to choose between 31 exciting challenges and two different difficulty levels. Technically, the title of Glu Mobile makes an excellent impression, with detailed units, colorful and well-defined schemes and a frame rate that does not suffer in any situation.
