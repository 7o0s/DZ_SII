{"name": "Falchi da guerra", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/102987-starhawk-falchi-da-guerra.html", "text": "Five years after the first chapter, the exclusive ~total~ shooter for PlayStation 3 Warhawk, Sony is back to staging large-scale battles for thirty-two players, bringing with it numerous changes and additions, starting with the title, precisely Starhawk, which makes us well understand that the boundaries of the planets will be transcended. In addition to this there has been a change of developer, LightBox Interactive has taken the place of Incognito, and more generally it is possible to speak of an expansion of the game mechanics, which can be summarized in battles in space and in the strange, but successful fusion, between RTS, or real-time strategy and tower defense. If we then wanted to enclose in this incipit what new Starhawk proposes, we could also say that the game offer also consists of an unprecedented campaign, which despite the clichs of an uninteresting science fiction story, has the advantage of gradually introducing us to all the new construction features of the game. In short, an ~expanded~ tutorial in the form of a story, with its strengths and its (many) defects of course. Emmet the Builder The campaign, lasting a total of about five, six hours, takes us into space during the Blue Gold Rush, with obvious references to the gold fever, to the Frontier, in full western atmosphere. Here too there are mines in the middle and solitary pioneers, while instead of the Indians now playing the part of the villains are the Beasts, humans corrupted by blue geo-energy and reduced to a feral state: real mutant killers. In this dusty and sunburned scenario we will play Emmet, half blood devastated by a showy pulsating blue scar and with a life full of mourning and pain, fighting with his nemesis determined to conquer the system. Only that there isn't a ranch to protect or a town to free from the raids of the outlaws, but mining installations on asteroids and factories to defend, up to the final moments where we pass with ease from the most classic of sieges to the Alamo, just for remain in the western sphere, to the bombing run of Star Warsiana memory. The main merit of these compressed hours of play is to explain how the new game mechanics work, but at the same time it is also its main limitation. Once we reach an area, on foot, or perhaps using the three-seater jeep equipped with a machine gun, we must, as in a real-time strategy game or as in a tower defense, equip it with some structures, useful for enlarging our arsenal or to protect us from the waves that will inevitably hit us with an arrival timer. There are many constructive choices that literally rain from the sky, not all open immediately given the instructive nature of the missions, and they must be decided with one eye on the conformation of the map and the other on the amount of energy available, given that geo-energy is obtained by killing the opponents, destroying their vehicles or collecting what little is available from the barrels found on site. For example, we can build barriers, automated turrets, sniper ambush towers, anti-aircraft laser cannons, armored bunkers where you can stock up on weapons and ammunition, garage for the jeep, the repair shop and above all the ~heliport~ for the Hawk , or the mech that with the simple push of a button becomes a powerful fighter-bomber, capable of upsetting a battle in a matter of minutes, armed with both a homing laser and a cannon, free-fall bombs and launch-and-forget missiles. The dynamics are therefore those of the strategic, where you have to find the weak point of the strong opponent to break through his defenses, only now, starting from the third person view of the protagonist Emmet, the game gives us the possibility not only to guide all means, but also to use the various defensive positions to maximize the damage. Obviously, lacking a managerial part of the economy, everything is played on the meticulous positioning of the structures and defenses facilitated by knowing the landing points kindly indicated on the screen. Without forgetting that, to mimic the cooperative nature of multiplayer battles, it is possible to set up return pylons, thanks to which to call allies who can use the means that we have called on the battlefield. The wave-based, goal-oriented nature of the missions is also the main limitation of the campaign. In the long run everything becomes very mechanical and repetitive given the lack of human unpredictability in the field, and after yet another siege the tutorial-campaign definitely tends to tire. Fortunately some missions take place in their entirety in space, in full dogfight against the ships of the beasts. It goes without saying that they are the best for spezcreate a certain monotony of the campaign, given that the same depth of the clashes on land is also marked off the planets, given that the Hawks are well armed and can also defend themselves with evasive maneuvers and flare launches. Playstation 3 trophies Starhawk rewards the player with 50 trophies related to both the multiplayer and the campaign. The bronze ones are obtained with the progression in the campaign, taking the first steps in the multiplayer or by performing particular kills, while the silver ones will be sweated by reaching particular ~quotas~ in the multiplayer. Team play Once connected to the network, the fusion dynamics of Starhawk literally explode also because this time we will not be faced with the inept artificial intelligence of the campaign and the generic and poorly articulated third-person shooter mechanics, but above all because those that were elusive bases and well-fortified they crumble with ease in the face of a well-crafted human assault. Assaults that to maximize the constructive chaos and the enormous decision-making freedom offered by the game (subject to the careful management of geo-energy) require close cooperation between all team members. In this sense, the microphone is strongly recommended since there is no way to give indications on what you want to do, let alone give movement orders. All then in the name of a practically infinite diversification of each single match given that the battlefield can be shaped to your liking, to implement the most disparate attack and defense strategies. A maximum of thirty-two players can enjoy different game modes, among which the classic Capture the Flag undoubtedly stands out, which needs no further explanation, while Zone commits us to control as many bases as possible in order to ideally connect them to each other to earn as many points as possible. However, there is no shortage of Deathmatch, team or otherwise, which penalizes the reasoned gameplay of the game a little, and the now omnipresent Horde mode for up to four players both online and split screen, a mode that makes Starhawk's link with tower defense. In short, an averagely rich menu, in the end the most passionate players of Lightbox's work will tend to deal only with Capture the Flag and Zones which enhance the game's total freedom of choice. There is also a skill system for the levels that expand, but do not seem to unbalance the efficiency of the players on the battlefield. For example, you can unlock larger magazines, more fuel for the Hawk, the possibility of collecting bioenergy even outside a base, the possibility of being reborn directly armed with a bazooka or sniper rifle and much more. It being understood that in addition to the necessary points, some prerequisites that can be completely framed as mini objectives, or rather trophies, must be satisfied. Technically speaking, Starhawk is not a title that can be placed next to the heavyweights of recent times, but it is undoubtedly a beautiful sight, especially when the sky is filled with Hawks and the laser beams of the anti-aircraft turrets, while chaos reigns on the ground sovereign among tanks, mechs plowing the battlefield, jeeps cruising between bases, and turrets spewing lead at foot soldiers. In short, the glance is extremely gratifying, but after the amazement it is impossible not to notice textures that are not exactly state of the art, a general cleanliness that is not excellent and a rather marked static nature of the environments. This does not mean that the game lacks in detail or special effects, in this sense it is enough to observe the work done for the battles between Hawks in space, where lasers, homing missiles and torpedoes, barrels and pyrotechnic lights are not lacking. In short, we are on more than good levels, certainly not excellent though.", "date": "2012-05-11", "grade": "7.8"}
