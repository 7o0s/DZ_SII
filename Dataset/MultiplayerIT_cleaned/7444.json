The clumsy attempt to propose a jRPG with a vintage flavor, labeling it as a spin-off of the renowned Square Enix brand, had not completely convinced us, and its merits were drowned in a sea of bad ideas. Bravely Default is a real spiritual sequel to that questionable experiment: it shares some important names with The 4 Heroes of Light, is structured in practically the same way and refers to the same narrative topoi. There are four heroes, four crystals to save, one empire to defeat, many classes to master. In short, the idea didn't particularly excite us at the beginning. Then we played with it, devoured it and figured out why it was so successful in Japan. A success, moreover, which convinced Square Enix to re-propose it in a ~director's cut~ version, so to speak, subtitled For the Sequel. It is precisely this enhanced version that Westerners will find on the shelves, an update full of improvements and extra content. No Final Fantasy on the cover this time: yet, Bravely Default is exactly that Final Fantasy that fans have been craving for years and that nobody wants to develop. Bravely Default one of the best jRPG ever, an extraordinary blend of tradition and innovation The long journey of the Vestal Virgin Bravely Default already begins in a very, very particular way: the player is asked to arrange the AR cards included in the package (or downloaded from the Internet and then printed) on the table or to frame a simple flat surface. The console and augmented reality will do the rest, materializing the image of Agns Oblige, a young woman who desperately asks us for help. Cut. A computer graphics film briefly introduces us to those who will become the heroes of the story, among which Tiz Arrior stands out, a simple shepherd who sees his family and his country disappear in a chasm that suddenly appears before his eyes. The only survivor of Norende, Tiz meets Agns right near the smoking crater that was his life: the young woman is a vestal, a priestess who with her prayers keeps the crystal of the Ancheim wind pure. Something very serious has happened, however, because the crystals of the elements have been corrupted: the wind has stopped blowing, the sea has rotted, a catastrophe like that of Norende is not the first and it will not be the last. Agns is a devoted but insecure girl, hunted by the empire of Eternia which has declared the vestals heretics; Tiz, on the other hand, is the canonical good guy, selfless and pure at heart: he can't help but help her, partly because it's love at first sight and partly to prevent others from suffering like him. The two will almost immediately meet their travel companions: Edea Lee is the daughter of the grand marshal of Eternia, a traitor to the empire with a peppery character who will join Agns in her mission; Ringabel is a mysterious womanizer who has lost his memory and who is guided by a bizarre diary that seems to predict the future, step by step. The quartet will face a long and dangerous journey, and believe us when we tell you that it will be worth accompanying them. The story of Bravely Default was written by Naotaka Hayashi, former author of the famous visual novel Steins; Gate, and spares no profusion of twists, genuinely moving moments and hilarious sequences to say the least. It may even seem too traditional, but the pacing and narration are impeccable: you immediately become attached to the four heroes, thanks also to the optional dialogues that allow you to deepen their bond and the history of this bizarre world, and you get to want to get to know their enemies a little better, mostly well characterized, but not always exploited to their full potential. The quality of the texts is excellent, furthermore enhanced by a splendid adaptation in Italian, in case you choose to play Bravely Default in our language rather than in English, French, German or Spanish. Practically every dialogue in the story is dubbed in excellent English, moreover: Agns' voice deserves particular praise, dubbed with great emotional transport, guilty of having made us shed a few tears in the most emotional scenes. And for dubbing purists, Bravely Default also allows you to listen to the dialogues in Japanese: the watchword is customization, both of the story and of the gameplay. Class is not water Bravely Default marries the tradition of old-fashioned jRPGs by proposing a distinctly fantasy setting with a pinch of technology, mostly steampunk, which will remind many of great classics such as FFinal Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy V. The structure, after all, is just that: you get carried away by the story of city after city, from dungeon to dungeon, as you explore the world on foot, by ship, by aircraft. The progression is quite linear, and a colored icon always informs us of our next destination, if the direct advice of the fairy Airy is not enough. From time to time, once the necessary prerequisites have been met, a blue icon appears on the map: it indicates a secondary mission that we can undertake at any time, and which will sometimes also depend on the excellent day/night cycle that changes the world map and the interior of cities. The secondary missions all serve to take possession of the asterisks, i.e. the ~powers~ of the Eternia officers that we will have to defeat after completing that optional part of the story: Bravely Default, in Italian, calls them ~classes~, but in reality they are the Jobs historians of the Final Fantasy series, created by the fifth chapter of 1992 and definitively cleared by Final Fantasy Tactics. Tiz, Agns, Edea and Ringabel can change class at any time, become White Magicians, Black Magicians, Knights, Chronomagic, Thieves, Summoners and so on. The level of each class is unrelated to that of the character and each time unlocks a new active or passive skill. Black Magicians, for example, learn to cast more powerful spells, while Knights learn to increase their physical defense. Once you have chosen a class, you must also choose a secondary class that will give that character the relative set of skills already learned, and a series of passive skills that can be ~equipped~ in an increasingly large number. In short, it is clear that Bravely Default offers an enormous level of customization as regards the ~build~ of each character, but we must also take into account his competence with certain weapons and the relative effectiveness of certain combinations: you want a Red Wizard armed with brass knuckles that can also use the techniques of the Ninja? Please make yourselves comfortable. Enemies, however, give more and more class and experience points, so growing a newly unlocked class soon becomes child's play: the necessary grinding is minimal, if you play with a little strategy, and the satisfactions drawn from the best synergies they are huge. The player is then prompted to modify a couple of parameters which - we are sure - will make fans of the genre jump for joy: it is possible to modify the difficulty of the random encounters at any time, but also their frequency, decreasing them until they are zero or increasing them until you get attacked with each step. In this case, however, the advantage is counterproductive: fewer fights means less experience and, therefore, more Game Over. Microtransactions? We could almost call them ~in-app purchases~, like in mobile games: optional, but present. It is possible to buy the BS drinks with real money, which allow you to recharge the PS points: these are normally recharged every eight hours, and allow you to freeze time during a fight, and therefore to attack defenseless enemies. In short, they represent the last card to play in case you no longer know what to do. Unless you're incredibly scarce, you'll never need it. The best defense is courage The Bravely Default title, then, may also appear senseless (in reality, the subtitle Where the Fairy Flies is clarified by the sensational final twist) but it refers very directly to the main mechanics that characterize the combat system. The latter, apparently, is quite classic: our party on the right, that of the enemies on the left, decides how to fight and a battle is started in which the order of actions is determined by the speed of the individual units. The trick is all in the Brave / Default system, a feature that not only the four heroes can take advantage of, but also their enemies. If you don't learn how to use them, they are painful, and the first hours of the game can even be a bit difficult in this sense. It's easier to prove than explain, but we'll try anyway: essentially, the Default command causes the character using it to ~lose~ a turn, putting him on defense. In reality, however, the shift is not lost, but ~preserved~, because the Brave command allows you to download each shift saved via Default into the next one. In practice, by using the Default command three times in a row, we will then be able to use the Brave command as many times in a row and have that character perform as many as four actions in the same turn: the three stored through Default plus that of the actual turn. It is also possible to use the Brave command without having stored turns with Default, but inin that case our character will no longer be able to act for the corresponding number of ~anticipated~ turns. It's a rather intricate, but incredibly strategic system: you soon find yourself deciding whether to defend yourself and unleash flurries of attacks or take advantage of the conserved turns to get back on your feet, heal and perhaps strengthen a fallen companion in the exact same turn. The possibilities are endless, and the supporting class system makes it infinitely more rewarding. There is a downside, though: since enemies can behave the same way too, especially the bosses, the fights tend to be very difficult from the very first minutes, and often even quite long. Bravely Default is no joke, we want to be clear. We need to know the weak points of the enemies, we need to learn to predict their attacks and to deny anomalous statuses before they devastate our party in a flash. The money is tight and the equipment is expensive: you can't screw up. Lovers of the genre will feel at ease, while newbies may encounter some difficulties, but the option that allows you to alter it and the possibility of speeding up fights by double or quadruple at any time immediately remedy what could have been annoying flaws. Rebuild Norende Each class is more or less versatile in using a certain weapon, and each weapon unlocks up to three special moves that can be used in combat after meeting certain requirements: use the Brave command ten times, for example, and if you are holding a sword you can use the Cut and slice attack. The relative and spectacular cinematic sequence will start a different music than usual: for the duration of the melody the characters will enjoy various bonuses, consequently a good player must be able to coordinate the effect of a special attack with the next rounds of the battle. The special moves are just one of the many tasty ideas that the guys at Silicon Studio have pulled out of the hat. The most curious thing is that they can be altered, not only in the name and in the phrase said by the character who uses them, but also in their properties: they can do more or less harm to a certain type of enemy or inflict elemental damage. The bonuses are unlocked by rebuilding Norende: Tiz's vanished village is the protagonist of a bizarre pseudo-managerial mini-game which we can access at any time by touching the relative icon on the touch screen. To rebuild Norende and its shops, you need to put its inhabitants to work, and the more inhabitants work on a project, the less time it will take to complete it. The inhabitants increase through SpotPass and StreetPass, and if you don't live in a particularly active city in this sense, or you don't know any friends who play Bravely Default, it is possible to easily download a new inhabitant every twenty-four hours. The online features of Bravely Default are interesting: they are just a tinsel and it is not absolutely mandatory to use them, but they represent a nice and, once again, extremely customizable feature. Each character can ~summon~ a friend who will help us in combat, modified by the player we borrowed it. In case of need, we can also access the skills of friends of a higher level than us, and download their possible updates. Norende, on the other hand, can be enriched by ~nemeses~, special bosses that will follow the ~players~ from one Nintendo 3DS to another, and which represent an additional challenge heralding particular rewards. In short, it is not a real multiplayer mode, but a kind of infrastructure that allows friends and casual players to modify each other's games without affecting them in a negative or irrevocable way: there is very little need to use it, and we think it could have been exploited even more boldly. The 3D effect The one proposed in Bravely Default is certainly not a stereoscopic effect that affects playability, but it is done damn well and thanks to a skilful game of shots it embellishes every scene, whether you are exploring, fighting or watching a conversation. Fluidity undergoes an imperceptible drop: in short, activation is recommended. Master touches In short, Bravely Default is a small balancing and gameplay jewel. But it's a gem that many would have preferred to play on a home console because, as you know, Nintendo 3DS is a portable console, and it has technical limitations. Limits of which Silicon Studio largely washed its hands of it, laughing big when two gentlemen who answer to the name of Akih took the field", "date": "2013-11-29", "grade": "9.6"}
