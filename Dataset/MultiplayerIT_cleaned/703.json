We are clearly talking about Divinity Original Sin II, a title now with a few years on its shoulders, which has already been received in an excellent way by PC and console users. Initially released in 2017, it immediately won over the fans of isometric RPGs, so much so that the following year it also landed on consoles in a revised and enriched version. The developers have managed to implement an excellent control system even for the classic pads, bringing the role-playing experience to the living rooms of fans of the genre. Strengthened by their success, they have therefore decided to offer Divinity Original Sin II also on iPadOS, where they can tell the events of the fantasy game world to numerous other users. Let's find out together in our review of Divinity Original Sin II if this adaptation for the iPad has been made with the same care as the other versions already available on consoles and PC. Game structure Do you like Dungeons & Dragons fantasy RPGs? Then you have found something for your teeth, because Divinity Original Sin II is a truly unique gem, especially considering the offer of similar games in the Apple App Store. The structure of the title is strongly linked to old-style RPGs, renewed and modernized to be more accessible, without losing the much-loved complexity and depth in the mechanics. But let's start in order and like any self-respecting role-playing game, let's start discussing the system for creating our character. Larian Studios first established six predefined characters with backgrounds and rather well-detailed characterization. If we decide to play one of them, the others will still be available from the first hours of the adventure to be added to our party. Together the group of protagonists works really well, with unique dialogues that once again highlight their good characterization. However, the true RPG enthusiast will want to create his character from scratch and also in this case we can only congratulate the work done by the developers. The main characters of Divinity Original Sin II Our character editor allows us to choose one of five different races: Elves, Lizards, Dwarves, Humans and Undead. Each of them is customizable in physical appearance, personality traits, main and secondary skills, talents and other little goodies from a real role-playing game. Then there are 14 different classes that vary from the most classic such as the magician, cleric, fighter, assassin, up to other more original ones such as the magician or the inquisitor. You can then spend the first two hours of the game simply playing through the character editor and exploring the various abilities available to each class and race. However, we must not forget that the game will allow us to use more than one character at the same time, choosing the class of each other member of our group of heroes. You could imagine how many possibilities arise already now, without even having introduced the rest of the gameplay mechanics that we will discuss in the next paragraph. But first we would like to make a small mention of the plot, telling you a little about the incipit of our adventure. We would like to emphasize that Divinity Original Sin II is perfectly enjoyable even without having played its predecessor. The events narrated in this game take place 300 years after the conclusion of the first chapter. Following the death of the chosen ruler Lucian, protector of the world from the dangers of the Void, the latter manage to re-emerge by invading Rivellon. After a small battle, the rulers of Rivellon decide to send every living creature with the magical power Source capable of summoning the creatures of the Void to Fort Joy Island. Our protagonist will voluntarily accept to embark on the ship to the island and from here the adventure of Divinity Original Sin II will begin. Gameplay Character sheet in Divinity Original Sin II The control of our characters will be entrusted to us for the first time right inside the ship en route to Fort Joy. This limited and rather closed environment will be the ideal place to learn the first gameplay mechanics. The tutorials are present, but they are not invasive and in a few clicks we will discover the most basic game mechanics. If you are an expert in old-fashioned RPGs you will immediately be at ease with both the graphical interface and the game controls. Less experienced players, on the other hand, will immediately understand the potential ofthis genre and will gradually expand their interaction with the title, gradually deepening the numerous mechanics. In this regard, the developers of Divinity Original Sin II have proposed four game modes with different levels of difficulty. The simplest is the Story Mode, then we find the Explorer Mode, the Classic Mode, up to the more difficult Tactical Mode. In this way, Larian Studios wanted to please all players, so even novices of the genre will be able to approach this type of video game without too much frustration or the need to learn everything right from the start. A combat action in Divinity Original Sin II Arrived on the island Fort Joy, the gameplay of Divinity Original Sin II will begin to show their muscles. The possibilities for interaction with the game world are truly wide with secrets to discover, skills to be used to solve puzzles, relationships with other characters and obviously an articulated and well-structured combat system for clashes. The dialogues between the protagonists and the numerous NPCs are well written, always offering a wide choice to the player, who will not be bored by useless conversations, but will immediately feel taken by the situation. The choices you make will change the story of the game, so you will often find yourself thinking a bit before giving your answer to an NPC. Combat, on the other hand, is managed with a rather classic turn-based system, where every skill, attack or in general every action of the protagonists has a certain cost. Once the number of available actions has been exhausted, we will have to pass the turn to our companions or to the opponent. The possibilities in combat are truly endless, due to the wide variety of abilities of each of the characters, as well as a high interaction with the battle area. Between one fight and another we will be able to forge new alliances with different NPCs, exchange goods with merchants, undertake side quests and so on and so forth. All this will make it easy for you to enjoy a large number of hours of gameplay. If you are passionate about the proposed genre and fantasy style, you will easily reach 100 hours, with a great desire to replay the entire adventure by making different choices and protagonists. iPad version The iPad version of Divinity Original Sin II After reviewing the general structure of Divinity Original Sin II and its gameplay (if you want to learn more, you can read our review of Divinity Original Sin II on PC), let's move on to discussing the porting that took place with this version for the iPad. The title on the Apple tablet has been created with extreme care, totally re-proposing the features of the game already available on other platforms. However, this is a rather demanding software for the tablet processor, in fact it is not compatible with every iPad, but only with the iPad Pro 2018 and later (both 11 and 12.9 inches), including the 2020 iPad Air. The space occupied by the game is 18 GB, a very heavy weight for a mobile application on the iPad, considering that many models have a total storage space of only 64 GB. Despite this, the tablet has proven to be able to manage the complex technical sector of the title, even in the most intricate combat situations, however producing a little heat on the rear body of the device. Small mention also for the audio sector which offers a very pleasant soundtrack, especially if listened to with wireless headphones connected to the iPad. In addition to the fantastic single player campaign, it is possible to play the entire adventure in multiplayer, both locally with splitscreen and online. Online multiplayer is available for up to four users, with the option to play cross-platform with Mac users as well. Split screen offered by the iPad version of Divinity Original Sin II The real strength of this iPad version, however, is the control system. The developers with this port have truly reached the pinnacle in the interaction system, making the title very versatile for any need. Divinity Original Sin II for iPad can be played with a mouse and keyboard, via the touch screen or with Bluetooth controllers. Each of these interaction modes offers a dedicated interface designed to be optimized with the control system used, without proposing any limits in the gameplay. We had fun playing both on the sofa with touch controls or with the pad, but also by connecting the tablet with the Smart Keyboard and the mouse on our desk. From this point of view it is therefore the most complete version, truly excellent both for those who want to look at per the first time experience is for players eager to replay it. This versatility is also perfect for those who do not have external accessories to play from iPad, as they can simply rely on the classic touch controls they are used to with other applications and games.", "date": "2021-05-28", "grade": "9.4"}
