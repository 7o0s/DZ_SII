Not that there aren't any, even if in decidedly smaller quantities than in the past, but apart from the few historical franchises - from the more or less appreciable attempts to renew themselves - there is a lack of new intellectual property and new ideas capable of stimulating the our attention as then. Conception II, sequel to a 2012 PSP jRPG that never saw the light of day in the West, falls into the category of missed opportunities, and not so much because it is lazily based on a tried and tested template - that of Shin Megami Tensei: Persona, in this case - as for the way in which he reproposes it, peppering it with soft eroticism, innuendos and questionable playful/narrative expedients. Conception II is a whimsical jRPG inspired by well-known franchises with an erotic twist Wake Archus and the Gifts of Life Let's assume you've all read the Harry Potter novels or seen the movies. Just imagine what would have happened if Harry, upon arriving at Hogwarts, had been ordered by Professor Dumbledore to copulate with Hermione Granger in order to conceive offspring of wizards. No, it's not bad fanfiction, but pretty much the plot of Conception II, only that the protagonist is called Wake Archus (unless you want to change his name) and he's not a wizard, but a teenager marked by a divine mark that gives him of extraordinary powers. Those like him are sent to study in a special academy, where they are evaluated and trained to fight against the monsters that emerge from the so-called Dusk Circles scattered around the world. Wake, then, is not even any student, but the ~gift of God~, as it possesses an amount of aether energy beyond measure. Which is why he is ~forced~, so to speak, to spiritually join the best girls of the academy through a ritual called ~classmating~: the young girl in question will absorb Wake's ethereal power and will merge it into a special matryoshka from which children will emerge, the physical manifestation of their united powers and, practically, their children. If all this doesn't sound sick enough to you, then know that Wake will be warmly invited by the rector - an old satyr with borderline pedophile comments - to get to know the various female students better and to churn out more and more magical babies. The main plot revolves around this absurdity, centered on the closure of the Dusk Circles and on the true purpose of the academy, and the stories of the various supporting characters, especially the other students who we will have to attend between one dungeon and another to increase the affinity and get better results from classmating. In part dating sim, Conception II completely misses the point by proposing decidedly dull and banal characters: the interaction and dialogue with the girls would be a key element of the gameplay and of the story, but it is difficult to take the various subplots to heart also because of a decidedly childish script that often plays on not so veiled double meanings. It's not a matter of being bigots - we loved South Park: The Stick of Truth, so to speak - but of knowing how to find balance in the context of an adventure like this, something Spike Chunsoft hasn't been able to do. The dating sim component, therefore, becomes a little task to be completed as soon as possible between questionable mini-games and frankly embarrassing dialogues, framed by a decidedly obvious story. The 3D effect Absent during the animated cutscenes and most of the narrative sequences, the stereoscopic effect is instead implemented quite effectively during the exploration of dungeons and fights, even if the cumbersome interface makes it more annoying than pleasant. Wake Archus and the Dungeons of Boredom If you've played at least one Shin Megami Tensei: Persona, then you already know what to expect from Conception II. The central hub is a screen that allows access to the main services of the academy and its surroundings, such as shops and student rooms with which to interact, communicate and build social relationships. Following the story, made up mostly of dialogues between the artwork of the characters, the various Dusk Circles and secondary dungeons are gradually unlocked, which we will be able to explore more or less freely: the concept is that each dungeon is made up of multiple randomly generated floors, and our the goal will be to reach the stairs to the next floor and its checkpoint. Each Dusk Circle offers a themed setting, but the various floors within it are not graphically distinguished from each other, making exploration rather boring and repetitive in a short time. The combat systemttimento, fortunately, while not without flaws, immediately appears quite interesting. The party is made up of four units, which are actually small groups in turn: one is made up of Wake and one of his girls, the others of a trio of children each. The babies - also called Star Children - generated through classmating differ in classes, skills, statistics and elemental affinities that depend on the mother, the relationship she has with Wake and other factors that will make the most perfectionists happy. As disturbing as it is, classmating is, on balance, the most characteristic and successful feature of Conception II. The battle system is just as interesting, but much of its complexity is wasted on how easy it is to get rid of enemies. Basically each fight takes place in turns and the small groups that form the player's party can attack the enemy from one of the four possible directions: some of them, however, will allow you to hit the target in its weak point, inflicting more damage, and certain skills are designed to attack from one or more specific directions. Others add up to this strategic component, such as the Chain Drive indicator which increases by attacking the enemy from risky positions, however rewarding us with extra turns, or the level of Ether Density. However, all these features can be beautifully ignored in the vast majority of fights, and simply end up filling an interface that is not exactly very clean. It is also the fault of the technical sector made up of ups and downs: it is nice to see mum and dad followed by their colorful little children strolling through the dungeons, but the monotony of the settings and enemies, which all look a bit alike, is much less pleasant , as well as aliasing that smears the image, making some fights and cutscenes quite confusing. The same goes for the soundtrack: the music is catchy but certainly not unforgettable, while the dubbing - in English, like all the lyrics - is really bad at times and helps to worsen the already precarious narrative situation.", "date": "2014-05-28", "grade": "6.8"}
