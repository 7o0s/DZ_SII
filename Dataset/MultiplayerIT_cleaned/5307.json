Its other peculiarity is that it was released in preview through the Games with Gold service but the Snowcastle Games title will also arrive on Steam on September 27 and will subsequently be released on Wii U, PlayStation 4, Linux and OSX. Having said that, Earthlock starts, like a thousand other titles of the same genre, with a catastrophic event that puts the existence of the entire planet at risk and which sees us as protagonists of a lifesaver rescue. The world in question is that of Umbra and it took five years to bring it up to us. The pre-alpha of Earthlock arrived in May 2013 and after just under a year the title appeared on Kickstarter. Unfortunately, the campaign started slowly and so Snowcastle Games decided to postpone it to March 2014, however, publishing a concept demo for Windows, OS X and Linux which was fundamental for the success of the funding. At that point, the works actually started but given the troubled genesis and the lack of publicity we are not surprised by the fact that Earthlock has passed on the sly despite being, as we will see shortly, an interesting title. Through ups and downs, Earthlock: Festival of Magic manages not to go unnoticed Yet another end of the world Earthlock: Festival of Magic opens with a parenthesis that introduces us to a young rebel pilot committed to escaping the authority of her father. Having found a way to fly through the skies, the courageous pilot leaves the stage to the equally young Amon, a treasure hunter who lives and works with his uncle Benjo. Our hero's guardian is an anthropomorphic hammerhead fish that we can use for the first mission but who is kidnapped after a few hours of play due to a powerful artifact found in the first mission. At this point we enter the heart of the story that sees us committed to saving Umbra together with a pig robot, a handsome warrior with thick hair and the aforementioned pilot, accompanied by a faithful quadruped. As you may have guessed, the characters and plot are the most classic for the genre and the cosmetics, partly European and partly clearly inspired by the JRPG genre, do not aim to upset the senses but each sector does its duty allowing us to enjoy without too many obstacles some peculiarities of the gameplay. The first is the stance system that allows you to access different skills by changing a hero's specialization in the middle of a fight. The protagonist goes from agile thief to shooter while others access useful buffs thus multiplying the possibilities of action and, consequently, making the tactical dimension of Earthlock more complex. The other peculiarity is the pairing system which, by unlocking talent points and speeding up the charge of the ultimates, adds a further pinch of identity to Earthlock. To increase the bond between our character and one of the companions, it is sufficient to place the two side by side in the relative section of the menu which also allows us to see the extent of the bond indicated first with a blue bar and then with golden stars. In all of this the skills include ranged attacks with counted bullets and all the classic JRPG arsenal of buff, attack, heal and weaken skills. Initially the skills available are few, even counting the stances of the characters, but they grow with the evolution of the characters through a chessboard that allows you to spend the talent points to fill the boxes with certain bonuses until you unlock the different skills that culminate in a skill special. The simple boxes are filled with skills that improve statistics and which are found rather easily while to unlock the other boxes instead the shrines are needed, obtainable with crafting which is also very useful for projectiles and potions, which are often characterized by more important bonuses including very useful resistors. All this gives us a system that does not revolutionize anything but allows good customization and guarantees a rather deep gameplay. Finally, there are the puzzles, simple but made interesting by the possibility of changing characters to overcome certain obstacles, and other side activities, such as tournaments, which guarantee a little break from the monotony in a world which, like in most RPGs of this type, it is decidedly not very interactive. Among other things, the world of Umbra is rather desolate and offers very little outside of the locations related to the main plot. Xbox One goals As usual for a title of this type, the objectives are almost all related to the progression in the main quest or arecumulative mold. To obtain a large part of the thousand points, in essence, it is sufficient to finish the title or face a certain situation a certain number of times even if there are some more demanding challenges such as the one that asks us to obtain the gold rank in all tournaments. Know your enemy There are dozens of enemies between types and variants and they are well differentiated between support, flying enemies, magical creatures capable of stunning, battleships and goblins armed with miniguns that do high damage but, fortunately for us, are also very vulnerable. To hit flying enemies you need ranged attacks which in the case of rifles and crossbows consume bullets forcing us to measure their use, but the application of the effects can force the floating creatures into a crash landing which makes them attackable by those characters who for one reason or another they cannot deliver ranged blows. Unless you waste time dedicating yourself to farming, the clashes become challenging after just a few hours due to the numerous resistances of the enemies. However, these correspond to weaknesses that can be discovered by playing or by consulting the bestiary entry that is unlocked once a new creature is encountered. With the bosses, the issue becomes more thorny, especially when they invest the entire party with deadly blows. But sometimes it is enough to change stance and find the right sequence of attacks to overcome a seemingly insurmountable obstacle. The other way to overcome a difficult point, as we have said, is farming, a great classic of this RPG genre, facilitated by the fact that the enemies are clearly visible on the tactical map and chase us when we enter the aggression zone. By playing with distances, among other things, it is possible to divide groups by facing one enemy at a time, and this possibility can prove decisive when the lack of resources and life put our existence at risk, but in doing so the points multiplier is lost experience that rewards us in proportion to the creatures we face at the same time. In all of this Earthlock makes a discreet display of style. Solid structures, simple but valid textures, great beautiful colors and some valuable effects, such as reflections in real time, give us a good view despite the limited polygon count. The models are quite simple, especially in the case of the enemies, but they are consistent with the setting and although they are stylized, they do not lack some spot-on details and well-finished animations that escape at first glance but are there and contribute to an overall yield more than dignified. Unfortunately the technical sector is soiled by too many slowdowns, unjustified given the mechanics and the polygonal mass, and the interface is incomplete between the selector which does not scroll by holding down the directional control, the lack of the minimap and some other rather evident ingenuity. Finally, the soundtrack is certainly not one that leaves you speechless. Livelier rhythms and a more aggressive attitude would probably have better balanced the too relaxed pace of the title and the lack of speech that takes us back to the distant past as regards the dialogues. In any case, the songs adapt quite well to situations, changing in intensity when the context so requires, and keep going for the approximately twenty hours it takes to complete the title.", "date": "2016-09-12", "grade": "6.5"}
