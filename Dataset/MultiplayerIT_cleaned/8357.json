After version 1.6 established itself as one of the most successful modifications ever, Valve brought the series home, evolved it into a commercial product and released the Source version, the first really important evolution released in 2004 which with his news divided the community. After years of waiting, the house of Gabe Newell offers with Counter Strike: Global Offensive a new sequel developed by Hidden Path, which marks an important step for the brand given the simultaneous release on PC and console and the introduction alongside the classic modalities, of a whole series of expedients aimed at bringing new adepts closer. Bomb has been planted... If you are an avid fan of the classic mod, don't be fooled by the final sentence of the previous paragraph: Global Offensive is a hard and pure Counter Strike and the Classic Competitive mode is ready to accommodate your perfect aim, tactical team play, choice of weapons to buy at the beginning of the game studied at the table, the knowledge of every corner of the classic maps; everything you need for an uncompromising match, in short. Why should you be interested in this new iteration then? First of all for the excellent work done by Hidden Path, which has rebuilt the game from scratch, recalibrated different aspects of the gameplay, faithful to the spirit of the original, precise in all those uniqueness that allow Counter Strike to remain a cornerstone of the genre even today after many years. The graphic revamp is not surprising, but it helps to modernize the game. Then there are the new grenades, namely the Molotov, Incendiaria and Decoy, with the first two representing a very interesting addition to the game's rich and varied arsenal. The wall of flames that they cause, in fact, will prove to be nothing short of useful in trying to hinder the escape of the opponents, forcing them into dead ends where a bullet in your head will represent the only way out. But even if you are a player with thousands of hours of experience on the Counter Strike 1.6 servers, don't make the mistake of disdaining the three new modes included in the 10.99 euro payment requested by Counter Strike: Global Offensive. Arms Race is the simplest, and deploys two teams on one of two maps. At the beginning of the match everyone will have the same weapon (an MP9) and with each kill a different instrument of death will be placed in our hands until we reach the final weapon with which to carry out the kill which will decree the victory of the team and the end of the game, or the golden knife. This mode, which incorporates the same mechanics of the well-known mod Gun Game, is definitely fun as it guarantees a high pace, thanks to instant respawn, but at the same time it maintains some features of the Counter Strike gameplay, such as the specific ballistics of each weapon or the poor agility granted to the player. Plus it's a fun tool to practice with your entire arsenal; pity about the lack of additional maps, but for that we are sure that the community will work hard. Even more interesting is the Demolition mode, a sort of cross between the classic Counter Strike and the just illustrated Arms Race. In fact, you will find yourself in new and slightly smaller maps than the usual ones, where the terrorists will have to try to plant the bomb while the anti-terrorists will try to stop them or, if the bomb has been activated, to defuse it. The bombing site will be unique, however, and there is also no money as the weapons will be awarded in succession at the start of the match as a reward for each kill made. In case of multiple kills in the same round, the game will also reward us with a grenade. Active friendly fire and permanent death remain until the end of the current round, but given the brevity of these (only a couple of minutes), the pace is higher than in Classic mode. As much as purists might turn up their noses, Demolition proved to be the most successful mix of the new elements proposed by Counter Strike: Global Offensive, maintaining on the one hand the high level of complexity of the gun-play of the series, and on the other speeding up some mechanics to allow more adrenaline-pumping and fun matches. A great way to bring novices closer to the game and at the same time to ensure interesting and high-level games for veterans eager to get away from the more competitive servers for a while. There is also room for novices Users who have never had the opportunity to try Counter Strike or who have let themselves be intimidated until now will find Global Offensive a decidedly more open and user friendly title. It was indeed imA tutorial level has been implemented which with classic Valve humor guides the user through the rudiments of the particular gameplay of this FPS. Furthermore, before throwing himself into the servers and having his liver ruined by the countless and inevitable headshots that await him, the less experienced player can train offline with the bots, taking advantage of the customizable difficulty level. Finally, the Classic Light mode represents the last initiatory step before moving on to the more demanding matches. Here the general rules will be the same as in Competitive matches, so we will once again have Terrorists against Anti-Terrorists on traditional maps, with the former trying to plant the bomb and the latter trying to hinder them or, vice versa, there will be hostages to save by the police, while the opponents will try to stop them. Death will mean having to wait as a spectator until the end of the round, while each kill will guarantee additional money to the one guaranteed at each match start. Here, in a few seconds, we will be able to equip ourselves with weapons and equipment using the new radial menu, trying not to forget the Kevlar jacket and the kit to speed up the defusing of the bomb. The Light mode offers some facilitations, however, and guarantees fifty percent more money as a prize, the basic equipment of the two equipment just mentioned provided by default and the collisions between teammates deactivated. Source Engine Once again, Valve chooses its proprietary Source engine. Hidden Path has been able to exploit it competently, graced Global Offensive with a clean, light and free aesthetic appearance without graphic frills that would have risked annoying more long-standing users. At the same time we appreciated the new versions of the eight historical maps, very recognizable but at the same time rejuvenated. In particular, cs_italy stands out for the panorama, but we also really liked the two new dusts. Very few changes to the layout, with some details designed to improve the balance, while the main work of the developers concentrated on the new maps, reduced in size but really successful, even if some seemed to us to favor the free ~campsite~ too much. as a bank that has the bombing site really too close to the Terrorists' respawn point and at the same time, being a large safe, it offers too safe a shelter to defend the planted bomb. This, as well as other details that the community will surely highlight, will be worked out with Valve's typical post-launch support, as we expect new maps and content to arrive. However, it is already possible to play on community servers, freely customizable in every detail, including the game environment. Finally, let's mention a net-code that is all in all valid, especially considering that the title has just been launched, but not without failures and lag, failures that we hope will be eliminated shortly.", "date": "2012-08-29", "grade": "8.8"}
