Noire deserved an investigation by Detective Phelps, the protagonist of the game. From the controversial relationship with Rockstar, which according to some would have managed to save the project and bring it to the shops rather than letting it sink well before the seven years it took to materialize it, to the very harsh working conditions during the so-called ~crunch~, there are still many aspects of the story that appear unclear, in the face of a destiny that can very well serve as a warning for the current realities engaged in the videogame sector: sometimes it is not enough to create a successful product to save goat and cabbage. A bit like a rock icon who disappears at the peak of his career leaving an album to be released posthumously, Team Bondi has given us an experience, that of L.A. Noire, which makes its return today with a pleasant remaster in which the inevitable technical shortcomings of the original production are somehow masked by a boost in resolution, brought up to 4K on PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One X. All while the technology of facial animation still manages to amaze and fascinate, always keeping the level of acting very high and helping to create those atmospheres - noir, in fact - on which the game has built its success. So welcome back to Los Angeles in 1947. The Strange Case of Cole Phelps A former Marine with a dark past that will invariably come back to haunt him, the protagonist of L.A. Noire is Detective Cole Phelps, rising star of the Los Angeles Police Department, taut nerves and great intuition. During the campaign, enriched in this remaster by the addition of all the DLCs for a total of about thirty hours of gameplay, our task will be to gradually get assigned new cases to investigate, go punctually to the place on board the car of order with our partner and there explore the crime scene looking for clues. The vibration of the controller will signal the presence of evidence in the immediate vicinity, which once collected we will be able to examine using the analog sticks to rotate them and discover any engravings, brands or details useful for the investigation. After this initial phase, translated into notes on our precious notebook, we will be able to speak with any witnesses by conducting real interrogations. It is at this juncture that the facial animation technology used by Team Bondi makes the difference, revealing to us through looks and grimaces if a person is telling the truth or is hiding something from us. In the face of each answer provided, we will be able to decide to indulge the suspect, force his hand if we believe he is lying or even make precise accusations, which however must be supported by evidence. There are right or wrong paths during interrogations, and taking the first ones will allow us to obtain a higher score and earn bonuses such as intuition points, essential for speeding up certain practices, primarily the identification of evidence or the elimination of wrong reactions during interrogations. the talks. In short, a gentle and ~comprehensive~ progression, the one proposed by L.A. Noire, from the point of view of an experience that perhaps tends to repeat itself a little and lose its bite during the central phase of the campaign, but which then redeems itself in a big way in view of the finale. Playstation 4 trophies If we consider both the main campaign and the various DLCs integrated into the L.A. Noire, there are sixty-three Trophies contained in this remaster. Many of them are obtained simply by completing the various cases that are proposed to us in our growth path within the LAPD, while others revolve around an almost perfect conduct of interrogations. There is obviously no shortage of achievements related to exploration, between the distance traveled by car and the emergency calls we answered. Still charming The linearity in the progression of the game, with the cases that follow each other and each show a different side of Los Angeles in the immediate post-war period, is broken by the possibility of answering sudden calls during the various journeys and therefore dedicating oneself to the pursuit of robbers and scammers , or even to try their hand at firefights that reveal a solid and consistent combat system, which at the time of the original publication showed the clear signs of a strong proximity to the Grand Theft Auto experience. The same guidance system, which takes us from one side of the city to the other while our companion invariably fills us with chatter, in pure Rockstar style, making us commit all sorts of infractions if we have toor follow the dialogues through the subtitles (the game is spoken in English, for obvious reasons of correspondence to the facial animations), it turns out to be simple but pleasant, without problems related to the management of the view, although the limits come to the surface in this juncture production technicians. The increase in resolution (but not in the frame rate, blocked at 30 frames per second due to the fact that the numerous kinematics grafted into the normal gameplay sequences were created with that refresh rate in mind) certainly has the merit of rejuvenating the appearance of the scenarios and polygonal models, adding sharper textures to some surfaces and significantly improving the reflections on the bodies, but the geometries remain those of almost seven years ago and in particular the draw distance highlights a substantially less rich game world and detailed compared to the current open world, which often resorts to ~fogs~ and pop-ups to mask the engine's inability to render objects in the distance. THERE. In short, Noire feels all the weight of its years and in this sense the presence of the Photo Mode perhaps appears out of place, but in terms of atmosphere and direction it is still confirmed today as an excellent, peculiar and highly enjoyable product. Thanks also to the aforementioned dialogues in English, recited with great skill, and to a soundtrack that manages to best capture the spirit of those years and the style of the work.", "date": "2017-11-16", "grade": "8.0"}
