The theme is certainly current and artificial intelligences will not fail to put their mouths on it over the next few years, therefore in terms of scenographic assumptions, let's say, the title Ingame Studios' debut probably stands as a first step in the direction of a revival that will somehow once again monetize the nostalgia of the forty-year-olds. However, under this glamorous and sparkling patina, is there actually a project that has something concrete to say? We tell you everything in the Crime Boss: Rockay City review. Story: Hollywood-style gang warfare Crime Boss: Rockay City, Michael Madsen's Travis Baker during an intermission sequence The story of Crime Boss: Rockay City is that of a criminal empire that loses its points of reference, giving rise to a ruthless war between gangs for control of the territory. In this case, the protagonist is Travis Baker (Michael Madsen), a criminal determined to become the new boss of Rockay City who will soon discover how far from simple this undertaking is. Casey (Kim Basinger), as well as on the tips of Gloves (Danny Glover) and on the armed troops coordinated by Touchdown (Michael Rooker), Baker will in fact have to contend for the districts of the city with four other gang leaders (including Dollar Dragon, played by Danny Trejo, and Hielo, played by Vanilla Ice), as well as watching his back from the unstoppable Sheriff Norris (Chuck Norris). The use of all these stars will certainly have had a lot of impact on the budget of the game, but in our opinion it does not produce an adequate return on the narrative level: the interlude sequences in which the various characters interact with each other are rather static and not very engaging, with the only exception of those with Chuck Norris, who joke about the stereotype of the infallible policeman and can count on the presence of a ~comic sidekick~. Nothing to say about the individual interpretations, mind you: with the exception here too of Norris, who appears too lackadaisical in his banter, the whole cast did a great job, Madsen with his peculiar style and Rooker undoubtedly standing out thanks to his convincing portrayal of the exalted and crude hitman. Simply, the idea of starpower-soaked cutscenes that lend value to an inherently flawed product seems a bit old-fashioned to us and is perhaps less brilliant than the authors thought. Structure: organized crime, not heist game Crime Boss: Rockay City, the map with the territories of the city that we will have to conquer The start screen of Crime Boss: Rockay City allows you to access three different modes, net of the tutorial: Baker's War, i.e. the campaign that acts as the fulcrum for the entire experience and tells the path of the protagonist in his attempt to take control of the city; Crime Time, a sort of ~quick game~ where you can take part in short and random missions; and finally Urban Legends, a collection of six purely cooperative-based mini-campaigns. his life ~rewinds~ in a sort of sliding door that does not have a purely narrative function, but underlines a roguelite approach in which the death of the protagonist implies the inevitable game over and the obligation to start all over again. Crime Boss: Rockay City, team management The producers of Crime Boss: Rockay City are keen to underline that their game is not a simple heist game, but a game of organized crime, and from a structural point of view this translates into a strategic and managerial component in which we must keep in mind keep an eye on your finances, hire men to then upgrade and equip them, sell stolen goods on the black market, make agreements, ask for loans, buy luxury items, but above all conquer all the territories to win. Then, when you move on to real action the heist soul of the game appears, which alternates blows in full Payday style (complete with drills, bags, security systems, escape vehicles and police) with armed clashes with rival gangs for the conquest of new areas or the ddefense of those under our control. Should Baker end up killed in one of these missions, the element of permanent death will decree game over, but with one concession: by restarting the campaign we will be able to keep all the upgrades and experience level obtained up to that point. Gameplay: Same as Payday, but twelve years later Crime Boss: Rockay City, a firefight at night As mentioned, in terms of gameplay Crime Boss: Rockay City is clearly inspired by Payday: The Heist, but at the same time devoid of the complexity that characterized the most advanced hits of the Overkill Software series, as well as spoiled by major limitations in terms of intelligence artificial, both of your teammates and enemies. Let's proceed in order, though. The Rockay City reference map shows the areas under the control of the Baker gang and those run by their rivals, with a ~by the day~ progression that limits the number of actions you can perform based on the availability of men and money. There are therefore two activities with which we can try our hand: the firefights for the conquest or defense of the territory, which are basically team deathmatches within a small scenario, and the actual missions. Crime Boss: Rockay City, we defend the position while a drill opens a bank vault The latter serve to finance our criminal empire and stage a dozen different situations that are repeated cyclically: the robbery of a shopping centre, a jeweler's shop or a bank, the assault on an armored van, the recovery of valuable materials from a guarded warehouse or the elimination of rival lieutenants holed up in a construction site, boathouse or near a beach. After that, special tasks appear that mark the progression of the campaign, such as the recovery of a briefcase, the robbery of a train or a moored ship. There are generally various ways to deal with the hits, for example it is possible to opt for a stealth approach going to destroy or deactivate the security systems, order the guards to get down, tie them up or lead them away from prying eyes, break open locks and open back doors so that our comrades can access the building on duty without setting off the alarms ; or give a damn about everything, proceed with guns drawn, eliminate anyone who gets in our way but prepare to resist the onslaught of the police. Crime Boss: Rockay City, Michael Rooker's crude and insane Touchdown We are dealing with dynamics, it must be reiterated, identical to those of the Payday series, with also the forces of order who first try to stop us with neighborhood patrols, and then call into question the SWAT and gradually the armored units or even special agents with substantially above-average resistance; all while perhaps we are waiting for the drill (which can jam if we try to accelerate its functions incautiously) to open the safe with the most precious loot to then collect everything, fill the bags and reach the van that is waiting for us to escape. the gunplay seemed to us basically the same as that of the Starbreeze series, with very different mechanisms compared to the classic Call of Duty, short magazines and limited ammunition, a lot of sight swing, a certain difficulty in landing headshots (also due to of hitboxes not always precise) and always rather tough enemies, especially when the degree of alert (and therefore the difficulty) increases following a predominantly caciarona conduct. Crime Boss: Rockay City, an old-fashioned showdown for one of the campaign's extra missions We were talking about the complexity: the game does not dwell on the planning of the heists nor does it field stratified situations, everything is rather linear and simplified but at the same time the tendency to repeat becomes sensational after a few hours, at the umpteenth robbery in a jeweler's shop or in a bank that is always the same . Furthermore, artificial intelligence, or the lack of it, weighs a lot: both in the impossibility of giving orders to the companions and in their behavior sometimes spoiled by imperfections, and in the routines that manage the enemy units, unable to perceive our presence even if we run behind him for a point-blank rifle shot.Obviously the situation changes in a cooperative, where it is possible to organize with three friends: in this situation the experience of Crime Boss: Rockay City can return some satisfaction for a job brought ended cleanly and even a few laughs in front of the bugs that often accompany the most agitated phases of the action, with the auspicio that the post-launch support will smooth out these edges and above all add substance to the package. Technical realization: from the stars to... Crime Boss: Rockay City, the in-game graphics appear rather dated We said at the beginning of the sensational cast of actors hired for the interlude sequences of the game, which do not involve that much but to which very little can be reproached on a purely technical level, given that they make use of extremely detailed polygonal models and capable of representing the various actors in their grace period, for the umpteenth time with the exception of Chuck Norris who appears a bit fake, let's say so. But when you go to the actual graphics, the scenario changes and all those details and trendy color tones, which seem to come out of a Midjourney composition, give way to extremely generic and dated assets, just discreet animations, scenarios with some acute (and a good use of screen space reflection to embellish them), but rather limited on the plan of the extension, and finally a disappointing optimization. Crime Boss: Rockay City, Travis in conversation with his two advisers In fact, if in the first missions Crime Boss: Rockay City grants 60 fps even at 2160p and with all the settings on Ultra using an RTX 3070, provided you keep the DLSS on the ~balanced~ preset, as soon as the action gets more crowded and chaotic it becomes necessary to rush down to 1440p: a resolution that in the end becomes the natural size for the GPU belonging to the now extinct mid-range of NVIDIA, but which in this case is not justified by the graphic complexity of the game. instead of the audio, the Ingame Studios title does a good job, also here thanks to investments in interpreters and rights: the soundtrack makes use of a few but precious licensed pieces, integrating the rest with perhaps anonymous but functional music, while the dialogues of the various Madsen, Rooker and Glover (in English, but with Italian subtitles) are the masters, strongly characterizing the experience.", "date": "2023-03-28", "grade": "7.0"}
