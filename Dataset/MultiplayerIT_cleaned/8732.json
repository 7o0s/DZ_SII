The debut of thrillers in the gaming industry dates back to 1991 with an arcade coin-op signed by Konami which, more than twenty years later, is still remembered with pleasure among players who at the time lived through the golden era of arcades and which is now presented to us in digital form to download on our hard drives. But if even today The Simpsons seem not to feel the weight of the years at all, can the same be said for their first and historic videogame incarnation? El Barto, twenty years ago The Simpsons Arcade is presented to us in an absolutely faithful form to the original that many have had the pleasure of playing by spending mountains of 200 lire. It is a scrolling fighting game whose structure has many points in common with another historic Konami product of those years: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with which The Simpsons Arcade also shares the same graphics engine. The incipit of the plot, which leads us to shake hands in the streets of the most characteristic places in Springfield, is really simple and surreal even considering the animated series from which it draws inspiration. Under the direct order of the perfidious Mr. Burns, Waylon Smithers, improvised robber fleeing from a jewelry store with a huge diamond as booty, collides with the family of protagonists and little Maggie, mistaking the precious jewel for her inseparable pacifier, is kidnapped by Smithers, thus starting a chase to save the little girl along eight levels through as many famous locations already known in the animated series. The game gives us the opportunity to impersonate one of the four family members, alone or by facing the cooperative game (both online and locally). The gameplay reflects what were the typical coin-op mechanics of the early nineties, including a tendency to hunger for coins this time only virtual. The commands are extremely simple with a key used for jumping and one for the single standard attack form, in addition to this offensive resource it is possible to carry out a classic jump attack and one diagonally, plus some choral moves together with other players in case you are playing cooperatively. The four selectable characters differ from each other in the approach to the fight, albeit only marginally: Homer relies on his fists and is also the strongest in close attacks, Bart and Lisa respectively use a skateboard and a rope to jump while Marge does not abandon never his faithful vacuum cleaner and despite being the weakest character from an offensive point of view, he boasts attacks with a wider range. It must be said that, since there is no real structured and deep combat system, the game action translates from start to finish into a frenetic button smashing for its own sake that reaches the paradoxical during the badly balanced boss fights and by sprite collisions that aren't always clear and by attack patterns that sometimes force the player to take the hit without apparently having had a chance to dodge it. Poor is also the heterogeneity of the enemies, largely represented by henchmen in suits in the service of the master of the nuclear power plant, as well as the variety of weapons that we can collect during the levels: a slingshot, a hammer and a atomic bomb! There is no form of power-ups apart from certain foods that can heal some of the energy lost in battles. Xbox 360 goals Even the Simpsons offer the usual 12 goals for 200 points. Finishing the game once on normal difficulty will score 55 points. For the rest it will be necessary to complete the game with all four characters, on a difficult level and once even within 30 minutes, however certainly not an impossible undertaking. Excellent? Technically The Simpsons Arcade has remained faithful to the 1991 original, consequently not having been the subject of any graphic restyling to date it certainly cannot impress in this respect, in particular the animations suffer from comparison with other more illustrious contemporary fighting games it was only the option to apply a ~soft~ filter was applied which smooths out the original pixel ladders with results that were not exciting, so much so that we preferred to play the adventure in its original aspect. The eight settings, on the other hand, are a continuous reference to the events of the animated series and in the background it is not uncommon to meet characters who come faithfully to the distinctive traits defined by Matt Groening on TV. Once the game is completed, the possibility of playing the Japanese rom is unlocked, an interesting addition which however does not differ much from the normal American version except for the different location of some objects and the level of difficulty. Other unlockable extras are the possibility of listening to all the samples and music of the game (it must be said that the audio sector in particular would have benefited from a new remastered version), a very broad description of the genesis of the game's development and some cards of characters that can be encountered during the adventure. The game offers three different modes: one with infinite credits, one where we have 10 virtual coins available or 40 to share between all four players, plus there is a survival mode where you can play the game with only one life to resist As long as possible. What jars more than anything else is the very narrow longevity typical of coin-ops where it takes just half an hour on normal difficulty to tackle all eight levels.
