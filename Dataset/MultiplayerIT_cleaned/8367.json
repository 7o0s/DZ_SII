The concept is simple and is the age-old one that combines a sports license with a more or less structured videogame sauce, which may or may not enhance its taste to the test of the player's palate. At the stove is Milestone, who has extensive experience in preparing dishes based on two wheels, but occasionally settles back in his comfort zone without being able to offer something alternative and appetizing. Then there are times, fortunately not frequent, in which the Milanese chef wants to experiment but, concentrated in his daydreaming, makes a mistake in inserting a basic ingredient in the recipe. The customer finds himself dealing with a dish in which his intuitions are recognized, but which in some situations is difficult to swallow. As you will discover in the Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame 5 review, which from now on we will simply refer to as Monster Energy Supercross 5, that is exactly what happened in this case. The Career and the single player offer The rider creation phase of Monster Energy Supercross - The Official Videogame 5 There is no self-respecting racing game without a career mode and in fact, after creating your own avatar, even in Monster Energy Supercross 5 it is ready to wait for us. It is characterized by 3 championships or stages of increasing difficulty and depth, respectively called Futures, Rookie and Pro. Each one is characterized first of all by an increasing number of races and by the bike category, and the next one is unlocked once the podium in the one that anticipates it. Unlike the vast majority of rival motorsport games, as you progress through the competitions you also unlock new gameplay elements, such as sponsors and affiliations, or even rivals to challenge, new types of races and advanced training exercises as well as new upgrades to the skills of the pilot. Together they define an increasingly complete picture of the experience, even if unfortunately in practice they never really manage to influence the gameplay on the track. Going from Futures to Rookie, for example, the Rider Shape System is also unlocked which defines the shape condition of a rider according to the injuries that afflict him. Ailments can be cured with credits or by completing challenges in the compound, such as collecting scattered letters and making some style points with a few simple actions. The Monster Energy Supercross 5 offer remains more or less similar to that of its predecessor, which in turn collected part of the inheritance from the previous one, confirming a substantial stasis of the project on the content front. From the pilot to the track Grappling with Career Mode Monster Energy Supercross 5 struggles to fill the need for a renewed experience with the game modes, but still offers a not inconsiderable package of hours of gameplay. The growth of the character is developed on a skill release grid that improves the bending and speed parameters in the technical execution of curves, braking, whips and scrubs, which does not shine for variety but gives a small sense of growth of the pilot, outside of the techniques learned on the track. The evolution of Milestone games in the future of Unreal Engine had given hope that physics and driving games could merge to give a more sophisticated, believable and fun gameplay, but from that moment the improvements are less than we would have hoped, they are more than filings to a rather crude system. The pleasant gameplay ideas at the base of its first iteration return in this fifth chapter with the usual good expression of complexity, but without revolutions. The same goes for the problems, which are also present at the appeal. The interaction with the ground, the rendering of the tracks and the management of the pilot's weight work but AI, bugs, calibration of the difficulty and game settings sometimes negatively change the balance of fun and sometimes distort the complexity factor beyond the chosen settings. Previously they could be considered factors due to inexperience of development with the game engine, the interaction between logic and physics, or AI derived from machine-learning, now, years have passed, it becomes increasingly difficult to continue to consider them as such. Lots of technical problems under the handlebars A screenshot from photo mode Some races go smoothly showing the potential of the package, others are afflicted by the most disparate problems, and we will only review some of the experienced ones. After winning a series of qualifying with the first half against themDuring the race they improved by 10/15 seconds per lap becoming unbeatable and all without having touched any setting or setting of any kind. It has happened to find yourself in the midst of groups of opponents ready to crash to the ground at the same time due to the influence of too little permissive physics on the straight of a circuit, or to see them all compete with a perfect flow between groups of really complex jumps. There are ramps that, taken at a certain speed, crash the bike straight into the ground, even if you are keeping your weight backwards. Physics kicks in too aggressively when reckless opponents swoosh at supersonic speed at the player's head after a jump, levitating off of them or sending them flying straight through the air. In all of this there are only 3 rewinds available which are only partially recharged and only upon completion of a lap and in some tracks they prove not to be sufficient to resolve all situations in which the game puts you in a position to use them. There are also problems with the distribution of the times of the AI which has grooves between first and second place, and to scale in different points of the grid, such as the eighteenth which always defines the gap between the poor and the last ones. The actual difficulty of the AI you race against is heavily influenced by the structure of the circuit you face: in one race it can be easy to reach and maintain the first position, but in the next it can be hell to fight against the last one. By taking these problems into account in advance in the gaming experience, it is possible to limit their effects as much as possible, waiting for them to be resolved with a patch as soon as possible. Multiplayer and graphics An image from the Monster Energy Supercross Compound - The Official Videogame 5 Shifting the focus to multiplayer, the introduction of split-screen and a drop-in drop-out multiplayer mode with AI opponents, as a recent fad also seen in GRID Legends, are undoubtedly appreciated. The community factor is instead supported by the track editor, which returns for the occasion in the form we have known in the past and which allows players to create and share tracks with a simple but powerful tool. Graphic quality on PC with settings tuned upwards in the settings is decent, even if the textures of the ground are starting to feel the weight of the years. The glance is confirmed as pleasant thanks to the light effects that Unreal Engine can reproduce in a convincing way, but it is advisable to start a process of improvement on this front. In a nutshell, we advise you not to sink your gaze into the stands and surrounding elements. The compound offers a varied and colorful motorcycle playground, but with little graphic detail and the presence of fences and shrubs that are more resistant than the crash test walls they offer a sense of everything so to speak ~retro~. A small note should also be made to the sound, which between a coherent musical selection and a convincing reproposition of the sound of the engines offers some very repetitive and unnatural effects, such as a strange ~boing~ that is always the same when rubber and ground come into contact during the various jumps.", "date": "2022-03-16", "grade": "6.0"}
