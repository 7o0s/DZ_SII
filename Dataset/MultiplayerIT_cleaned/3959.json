A legitimate question, given that Alexey Pajitnov's masterpiece has been filmed countless times since its first release in 1984, often inappropriately and with unsatisfactory results. Mostly because an attempt was made to justify the publications by affecting the simplicity and immediacy of the original formula, which represents the essence of the perfect puzzle game. Therefore, if on the one hand there was some doubt in waiting for this Tetris Effect, on the other we perceived a concrete trust, if not even a certain enthusiasm, for the direction of the project by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, ~the one~ of Space Channel 5, Rez, Child of Eden and Lumines. And it is precisely from the marriage between the original Tetris and Lumines that Tetris Effect seems to have been born, in a cross between geometric blocks and music with a heavy case that, incredibly, works and convinces. Tetris with something extra It is immediately evident how Tetris Effect is a game that moves on the thin line between respect for the original and the desire to add a personal touch. However, what Mizuguchi managed to understand is exactly what we said at the beginning, namely that affecting the basic formula would have resulted in too high a risk. And on the other hand, the Japanese designer himself had already demonstrated with the aforementioned Lumines that he was perfectly capable of creating his ~own~ puzzle game, which was so successful that it too had become a small classic of the genre. So in Tetris Effect the work was done largely on the outline, on what accompanies the pure gameplay, and in this context Mizuguchi's team explored the most interesting ways that make the final product so pleasant. In fact, if the central part of the screen continues to offer the ~classic~ Tetris experience, with the tetrominoes that descend from above into a well and must be inserted in an optimal way to then cancel as many lines as possible, it is in all the rest of the TV area that unleashes the show. In fact, Tetris Effect offers about thirty skins, which in practice are thematic settings that are used to offer various types of visual effects during games, all perfectly to the rhythm of the music. So here is the desert and then the ocean, deep space, the city, the hot air balloons in flight, the volcano, in a combination of lights and colors that move and help to immerse the player even more deeply within that ~ mental trip~ that has always been Tetris. Each skin, which evolves as the game progresses, not only modifies the environment around the playing area, but also the appearance of the tetrominoes themselves, in a way similar to what happened in Lumines when switching from a level to another. If in the vast majority of cases this does nothing but bring with it a very pleasant aesthetic variety, on rare occasions we have found that certain chromatic choices resulted in less legibility of the game, a factor that is even more complicated to manage during the advanced levels with the falling speed of the elevated pieces. Furthermore, it must be considered that there is a subtle underlying contradiction in so much aesthetic abundance in a game that requires constant concentration on the flow of tetrominoes: in short, the risk is of being distracted by what is happening around or of not being able to fully appreciate the details. Technique and soundtrack Everything described so far would be useless if there were no music. On the other hand, Mizuguchi's curriculum itself demonstrates how the search for a mix between gameplay and sound has always been a staple of his work, and Tetris Effect is certainly no less. The soundtrack offers an extraordinary variety of songs, including pop, dance, fusion, ambient, jazz and so on. Of course, the quality of the tracks is not always on the same level, and above all such a multitude of genres can inevitably lead the tastes of the individual player to align more or less with the different situations, but what is surprising is how audiovisual research integrates so well with all its elements within the classic gameplay development. Music, beats and images become one with the descent of the tetrominoes in a sensory flow which is finally also transmitted through the controller, which activates its vibration accordingly. The very rhythm of the songs varies during the progression and this variation has repercussions on the speed of the falling of the pieces: this means that during a single level there can be peaks of difficulty that put the player on the ropes asking him for a greater effort, while the ear beats beat of hypnotic music and splinters of light are flying all aroundand and colors. A true, unique, engaging show. The optional support for PSVR in this sense allows you to enter further into this psychedelic journey which therefore becomes all-encompassing, however at the cost of an inevitable drop in image resolution which, on the contrary, with a PS4 Pro and a 4k HDR monitor, offers impeccable image clarity and fluidity at 60 fps. Modes and leaderboards As far as the structure is concerned, Tetris Effect is divided into two main modalities. The first is called Journey and develops through 27 levels divided into groups of 4-5: to overcome each of them you have to eliminate 36 lines, and in passing to the next one the same situation of the well will be maintained, in a continuity that therefore becomes more and more challenging. The only concession to the original Tetris gameplay formula is to be found in the Zone effect bar, which fills up progressively. Once full, a sort of temporary freezing of the scene can be activated which allows you to go beyond the natural limit of 4 lines erased at once. It goes without saying that through the correct management of this possibility you pass the faculty of achieving high scores. The Effect mode, on the other hand, contains a whole series of variations on the theme, a dozen in all, some already seen in the past and others unpublished and developed for the occasion. Among these, some will be more appreciated by those who intend to look for the competitive component, while others will appeal to those who prefer a more relaxed approach. In short, there really is something for everyone. However, the overall package of Tetris Effect lacks a multiplayer mode, both locally and in multiplayer, which would have given a further level of depth to the product. The challenge factor with human opponents is therefore resolved in the rankings on the scores, however stimulating to test one's skills and try to improve them. Finally, a consideration on the price, set at 39.99: an important figure for a title which, although well justified by the contents offered, directs Tetris Effect towards a target audience of enthusiasts, reducing its appeal somewhat for others. Perhaps ten euros less would have been the perfect amount.", "date": "2018-11-12", "grade": "8.8"}
