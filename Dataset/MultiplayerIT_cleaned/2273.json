{"name": "Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pitfall-the-mayan-adventure.html", "text": "A renewed gameplay In the game, an evil spirit of the ancient Maya civilization has kidnapped Harry Pitfall, the great protagonist of the two episodes of the series released at the time of the Atari 2600. In the role of his son, Harry Pitfall Jr, you will be called to defeat the evil spirit and free your beloved parent. Pitfall's gameplay is a mix of that seen in Super Nintendo games plus additional movement that adds to the variety. So from the usual stone-jumping, crocodile-head-hopping, climbing vines and dodging snakes and scorpions, you can now throw boomerangs, sling stones, jump off high peaks and bounce off springy cobwebs. The Achilles heel is in the graphics... The graphics of the Super Nintendo versions were characterized by the presence of highly detailed backdrops and excellent character animations. These visual elements remain and are improved in the Game Boy Advance edition, but they are seriously damaged by the too small screen size which prevents you from fully enjoying the good graphics of the game. The dark backdrops that lend themselves well to the look on a television do not obtain the same result on the Advance screen which, not even being backlit, ends up presenting gloomy backdrops with barely visible landscapes. The biggest problem arises precisely from the fact that most of the backdrops are made with dark colors and the enemies are made with very similar colors which creates a lot of confusion as they cannot be distinguished on the screen. The only clue to hitting an enemy in this way is to look carefully on the screen at that part of the color that moves with respect to all the rest. Another serious problem of Pitfall is represented by the horrific boss fights, which have already been encountered in the past. In all 2D games you have to fight by jumping, hitting and avoiding your opponent. Also in Pitfall the same thing happens but the reaction time to make a movement is illogical. For example: if you want to jump a jaguar to avoid its charge you will have to make the jump even before seeing the jaguar appear on the screen as the timeliness of the movement is too slow if done already when the animal appears. It's really an unbearable frustration to make so much effort to finish a level and get to the final boss and engage in an impractical and at the same time not very fun duel. Other problems concern sound effects that are of poor quality. In conclusion... Fans of the series will be able to appreciate Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure only from the point of view of replaying a classic video game from years past with nostalgia. Unfortunately, however, the defects remain and are not irrelevant so that the game is of little interest and unplayable from a gameplay point of view. In conclusion... Pros: Recommended only for patient people and fans of the series Cons: Very gloomy colors and very dark graphics Action sometimes confusing due to poor visibility Poor soundtrack The story of a classic Many gamers have feared that the games developed for the Game Boy Advance were only revisitations of the games released some time ago for the Super Nintendo, presenting only improved graphics as a novelty. Majesco has produced two games for Advance titled Earthworm Jim and Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure. Just the second, Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure received a less warm welcome from critics, as the latter was already reminiscent of a previous episode made in the nineties. Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure brings back all the problems of the first episode and in addition some new flaws that could surely have been avoided with a little more attention from the development team.", "date": "2002-01-15", "grade": null}
