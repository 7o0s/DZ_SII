The Nintendo franchise is practically a genre unto itself. There is almost nothing that resembles it and, if there is, it is only a pale imitation. The various Animal Crossings that have followed over the years have continuously built on the foundations laid by the first Dbutsu no Mori - it's the Japanese title - in 2001: despite this, every time we have to re-explain what Animal Crossing is and how it works even to new players, we feel very uncomfortable. Conveying its appeal is not easy; it makes you want to appeal to the sacred amendment of the Nintendo Difference and let fate do the rest. There is little to do: this is not an experience suitable for everyone. There will always be someone who will find it deeply ridiculous to spend time collecting fruit and shells for anthropomorphic animals that seem to come out of an episode of Melevisione. And there will always be someone else who will let themselves be conquered, someone who will find in that carefree, eccentric alternative world, so full of joy and color, a perfect balance that only Nintendo's alchemists could achieve. We dedicate this review to those who love to take flight on the wings of the imagination. The first steps Imagine that you have purchased a vacation package to reach a desert island where you can build a community of your own: here, the new Animal Crossing: New Horizons begins just like this. In the past we have moved to towns and cities, reaching them by train or bus, but this time we will fly. Your very first decisions will concern the initial shape of the island and the appearance of the inhabitant that will represent you in the game. The new editor includes a greater variety of particular signs than in the past, which should satisfy the most demanding players. The first thing you will discover, once you get off the ground, is that a large part of the island will be temporarily closed to you: rivers and gradients divide the map into several parts, preventing you from freely exploring the area. And basically, in the beginning, you will have to learn to live in your new home. The first few days are a gigantic tutorial and dear old Tom Nook will give you all the tools and will explain to you in detail how to settle in: be careful, because there are a lot of news even for old Animal Crossing players. One of them is the Nook Phone, a smartphone which, in essence, is an interface that you can call up with a key to access various apps or features such as the map of the island, the camera with which you can capture the best moments of your adventure, the model editor that you can then copy onto garments and so on, and so on. The most important app of all, however, is that of Miles, a new dynamic that in a certain sense upsets the nature of Animal Crossing, profoundly influencing the gameplay. To make you understand the importance of Miles, it will be better to tell you about our experience, also because talking about Animal Crossing: New Horizon with a sterile explanation of mechanics and new features would not only make little sense, but would be an insult to its carefree nature. Miles after miles We arrived at our destination on February 26th and the island still had a gray appearance from the winter we were leaving behind, the wind shaking the trees, fueling an atmosphere that was not exactly the most welcoming. Three of us got off the plane: we were there, Amleto and Cigliola. The two visitors who, together with us, bought Tom Nook's holiday package, immediately settled in and ran with us to set up the tents. In fact, this was the first step in our life on the island: we chose a cleared land next to a stream and a few meters from the beach, then we returned to the square to celebrate the start of our adventure together with Tom Nook, Mirco and Marco . Nook has also entrusted us with the very important task of baptizing the island which, after a long reflection, we have decided to call Portogatto. These first steps in Animal Crossing: New Horizons weren't much different than usual. We immediately started collecting shells and fruit to sell to the two little raccoons, together with the weeds scattered almost everywhere and which, for the first time in the series, can be pocketed. Nook then explained to us how to use the workbench in his tent: a simple and immediate interface that allows you to reuse the collected materials to build tools, furniture and decorations. With the twigs and stones collected we have therefore manufactured the most important tools for every self-respecting Animal Crossing inhabitant: a shovel, aa hatchet, a fishing rod, a net. Everything you need to go hunting for insects, fish and wood, grow new fruit trees, unearth fossils and hidden treasures. At this point, a common Animal Crossing immediately enters its fundamental collection and sale loop: the stars, the historical currency of the series, are still needed, even more than before, but there are also Miles that actually give meaning to our games . In fact, Nook explained to us the function of the Stellomat, a device where we can pay the accumulated stars and which also allows us to access the Nook Catalog, which records all the objects found in the game, but above all the Miles Catalogue. The Miles, which we have already mentioned, are accumulated by achieving certain objectives that the Nook Phone catalogs in the Nook's Miles app: most of these objectives are initially hidden and practically unlock themselves as we lead our life on the island . Imagine the classic achievements or Trophies, then multiply them progressively. For example, catching a fish rewards a certain number of Miles; then you'll have to draw ten, fifty and so on, each stage rewarding you with more and more Miles, and the same happens when you catch a butterfly or chop some wood, among other things. Each activity is a milestone that pays off in Miles and that pushes us to experiment, build and, more generally, play. Miles are used to buy new do-it-yourself schemes, new furniture and clothing - the catalog is progressively updated - but also and above all new features such as the tool wheel, which allows you to choose the tool to equip on the fly, the upgrades improve the various apps and new options to customize the inhabitant, for example hair and particular signs. Fortunately, the Miles Catalog also features a series of completely random, minor daily goals that you can continuously complete to earn new Miles: each goal you reach is immediately replaced by a new random goal, ensuring a constant flow of Miles. If you have already played at least one Animal Crossing previously, you can easily understand the importance of this novelty: Miles, in practice, continuously give us a purpose even on those days when there are no particular events or when we have already finished our round of daily activities. Improving the island We arrived in Portogatto that the island had three inhabitants, in addition to the Nooks and the operators of Dodo Airlines. At this point, any Animal Crossing would have basically left us to ourselves: it's no mystery that the first few days are always the most monotonous, mostly because there isn't a lot to do and resources run out at a certain point . That Nintendo wanted to distance itself from this philosophy can already be understood from the Miles, but there is also a kind of narrative that develops together with our island in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Mind you that we are not talking about a real plot, but about a series of primary objectives that give a logical sense to the progression. Tom Nook, in fact, intends to transform our Portogatto into a full-fledged community and for this reason he has entrusted us with some important tasks. One of the first, for example, was to build a museum in which to exhibit the fauna of the island which they continued to sell in exchange for little stars. At the same time, we had to collect a generous amount of materials for Marco and Mirco, so that they could build their workshop. From the museum to the shop, passing through the arrival of new inhabitants, Animal Crossing: New Horizons began to show its true face almost immediately, revealing a complicated game of joints that follows our progression without overwhelming us with information, capabilities and features. Watching the juicy Direct we feared that New Horizons could overdo it, mixing what was also experienced with the DIY episode Pocket Camp for mobile systems with the relaxed nature of a series that should do anything but become an objective role-playing game. Instead, despite having played every single Animal Crossing released over almost twenty years, the organicity and coherence with which Nintendo has developed the progression of our life on the island still amazed us. Every day was a discovery and slowly we began to learn completely new ways to bend the environment to our imagination. When Tom Nook taught us how to make a pole and a ladder, we finally found a way to jump over streams and climb hills, and that way we could explore the rest of the island and decide where to go.obstruct bridges and ramps. And that was just the beginning. We absolutely cannot and do not want to reveal the exact order in which we learned certain new schemes and transformed Portogatto into our little tourist paradise, but if it is true that on February 26th we were three inhabitants celebrating the beginning of a new life on the island , on March 14, ten of us gathered to inaugurate the opening of the boutique of the sisters Ago and Filo. While Portogatto, in recent weeks, has grown with us and our tent has become a nice little house with two rooms, a comfortable bed - which we built and, subsequently, recolored at will - and lots of knick-knacks here and there. At this point, Animal Crossing: New Horizons has officially entered that assembly line that we mentioned at the beginning, the loop of every self-respecting Animal Crossing, this time multiplied by the incredible customization freedom that offers us not only our home, but the whole island. Bridges, ramps, fences, pavements, and still plots of land to rent to earn a few more Miles that can't hurt, and many other ways to transform the scenery, not only by planting trees - literally moving them from one point to another, if we want! - but placing decorations and objects everywhere, without disturbing the revolutionary possibility of modifying the geography of the island practically at will. Today Portogatto sports a large lighthouse that lights up at night to guide imaginary sailors in the distance; to the east, on a hillock, we found space for an inviting hot spring which we surrounded with bamboo trees; to the north, on a cliff against which the waves regularly break, we have arranged a monolithic complex that looks very Stonehenge and that we were lucky enough to find in one of those packages hanging from the balloons that occasionally float above our heads. Now our goal has changed: improve the island, fill it with life, and get a certain singer to perform for our community. New horizons There are still so many things we would like to do and we still haven't had the slightest desire to spend at least an hour in Portogatto every day, especially in a moment as gloomy as the one we are experiencing in the reality of the national quarantine. We have not yet participated in any parties: February and March have been poor in events and we have just met some old acquaintances such as Gulliver and Spiriteo, we bought turnips on Sunday morning and Sahara carpets on Monday, as was done in almost all old Animal Crossings. We also met Fiorilio again, the hippy dog who in New Horizons lives on an island of his own where we can set up a real photographic set and indulge ourselves with the Nook Phone app. It is in fact possible to change islands temporarily and visit, for example, those of friends, but to find out how Animal Crossing: New Horizons is in multiplayer mode you will have to be patient a little longer, since Nintendo has absolutely forbidden us to connect the console to the Internet for the entire duration of the test. In short, our vote is based mainly on what New Horizons offers offline, also because not everyone wants or can afford a multiplayer mode which therefore becomes an added value. However, we visited the random islands almost every day, designed to broaden the horizons of solitary players. Just buy the special ticket at the Stellomat and show it to the Dodo Airlines operator: these procedural islands are used to collect more resources, especially if you have run out of them for the day, and perhaps to meet new animals that they might decide to move to your island. The random nature of these scenarios helps players who can't cooperate in multiplayer mode enrich their island with exotic fruits, rare collectibles and other little surprises. It's a kind of lottery that doesn't always pay off spending in Miles, but which can sometimes be a real jackpot: imagine ending up on a small island full of fruit that doesn't grow on your island - and which will therefore be worth much more when sold - or teeming with rare bugs that you can take to Blathers' museum or sell to the Nook twins. Don't worry: your inventory is destined to grow and Mirco and Marco have found a solution to do business even at night. Nintendo listened to us. In fact, if there is something that does not add up in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, it is the continuous, insistent need to accumulate stars. Series veterans will no doubt be used to saving up to pay off debts to Tom Nook or buy the coolest furniture and clothing.", "date": "2020-03-16", "grade": "9.5"}
