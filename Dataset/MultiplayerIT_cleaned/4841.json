{"name": "Everspace", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/183722-everspace-la-morte-e-solo-linizio.html", "text": "Everspace, also available on Xbox One in the Game Preview and Play Anywhere versions, features a spaceship pilot but it is not a simulator and does not try to emulate entire universes. Everspace is a space roguelike with intuitive gameplay and colorful graphics, a title that despite being procedurally generated is divided into limited areas and is content to field a few factions with rather simple behavior. The contour, however, is rich and also includes two upgrade systems, one that provides for the reset when we are forced to start over after having left our pens and one atypical for the genre, of a permanent nature and designed to gradually decrease the high initial difficulty . Odds Everspace combines roguelike structure, science fiction and fast and intuitive space combat Not just roguelikes A cross between space shooter and roguelike, Everspace is a title that asks us to go through a series of areas often full of enemies to be able to jump, using a portal, towards the next sector. To do this, as in a simulator, it is necessary to have enough fuel available and we can find it by eliminating enemies and diving into plasma fields. At the same time, with the aim of increasing our chances of keeping the only life available, lost which we have to start over, we have the task of exploring wrecks, recovering loot of all kinds, using them to improve our ship and survive fighting to the best of our ability. But skill is not enough in a title which, in addition to putting us in front of a demanding challenge, has no qualms about catching us unprepared. On a couple of occasions, narrowly safe but with life support compromised, we found ourselves sentenced to death for lack of resources needed to repair the ship and the slow, relentless agony was anything but pleasant. But persistence can reduce the unexpected. We are in fact talking about an atypical roguelike which, unlike most of its peers, has a slow but permanent progression system, based on perks, unlockable loadouts and a series of improvements to be found and installed on the ship that complete a decidedly rich picture of options. And that's a good thing since the gameplay, to the bone, is very simple. The action revolves around two primary weapons, missiles of various kinds, some consumable items, any boosts and thrusters that allow us to move more quickly even along the four axes in order to dodge enemy attacks. The classic key to activate the lock on an objective completes the heart of a title largely based on saving missiles and on the search for resources that allow us to trade and repair, or build, ship components and systems. A ship that despite the arcade nature of Everspace has specific gravity and is prone to inertia even though it is extremely easy to control even in the midst of combat. And it's extremely fast-paced combat that feels damn fun and intuitive, built in a way that allows us to pay full attention to movement and energy management. This, in fact, is necessary to make both the primary weapons and the afterburners work and it is essential to prevent it from running out, which happens very easily, in order not to remain helpless in the face of the enemy. And because of this, consumable items like Energy Injectors are a very useful resource. For the rest, once an area has been cleared of enemies and resources, it is sufficient to keep the bow towards a green icon, and not take damage, to activate the jump process towards the next area that separates us from the final objective. Far from boundless but complete with everything Although broken into medium-sized maps, the Everspace universe does not let us miss a fair variety thanks to black holes, mines, hordes of enemies and even fights with articulated bosses. In the midst of all this chaos things can get complicated, especially when motherships and suppressors enter the field and must be neutralized in order to leave a zone. When the opponents become too many, it is advisable to take advantage of the asteroids to protect the rear and perhaps wait for a second faction to enter the field, giving us a way to escape too numerous squadrons. But even when luck is on our side, it is not always easy to weigh anchor in time to save one's skin and this regardless of which of the three difficulty levels we have chosen, each of which, thanks to tons of modifiers, significantly changes the 'experience. In any case, the possibility of permanently upgrading the ship, by purchasing the perks between one restart and another, forputs you to unlock and upgrade effects that can make it easier to save your skin. They range from damage reduction to increasing the possibility of causing critical damage to the possibility of not taking damage by attempting a jump with low fuel. The perks are several and we can also count on the availability of three ships, two of which must be unlocked by spending large sums, which change in terms of strength and maneuverability. Once we have chosen the vessel to bet on, our efficiency grows constantly, but it is a slow process that does not eliminate the risk of frustration given the always high difficulty. The influence on the gameplay of the ship's systems is more clear and sudden, which can be built or collected from the debris of the enemies and can be upgraded. There are boosts with reload times such as the weapon override which increases the damage inflicted by weapons and there are also drones capable of giving us a big hand in combat. Evaluating which ones to install and which to remove is an important step given the impact on the style of play. Weapon boost makes us more dangerous while escape is easier by boosting shields, neutralizing incoming missiles or reducing damage taken. Furthermore, weapons are differentiated according to the damage inflicted on shields and hulls and vary considerably in rate of fire, type and effectiveness. Finally, drones can slow down enemies, fight, disturb and so on, adding further meat to the fire. If we consider that the latter are also used by enemies and that the space is full of turrets, traps, systems capable of preventing us from jumping, antennas to be sabotaged and so on, the dish becomes decidedly rich and includes, in addition to the crossroads that can lead us towards more or less dangerous areas, also first and third person views, support for virtual reality, Italian subtitles and a complete narrative component. Here and there there are sequences, descriptions of our artificial intelligence and dialogues which, in addition to fielding adequate dubbing, reveal new details about the universe and the protagonist, gradually revealing a story made up of war and tormented friendship. Heavenly wonders The final release of Everspace includes various refinements, adds a race that allows you to obtain special upgrades, completes the available arsenal and finally makes the protagonist three-dimensional. Three-dimensional so to speak since the interlude scenes are two-dimensional, but the depth is due to the pinch of history that undoubtedly facilitates identification. In addition to this, the trading stations are more credible and there is no shortage of further graphic refinements framed in a breathtaking picture by the excellent exploitation of the Unreal Engine 4 which is now even more optimized. The show, enhanced in the photographic mode and magnified by a respectable sound sector, is ensured by the splendid visuals that have already made Everspace quite famous. We're talking burning ship-style stuff off Orion's ramparts, massive explorable wrecks, and lightning storms that engulf entire asteroid fields. All featuring high detail including lots of lights, visible damage on ship, wrecks shrouded in huge space clouds, blurring from ship vibration, visible damage on ship, trading posts, huge vessels, convoys and debris left floating in the space after great battles. The interlude scenes are modest to say the least and the plot in terms of thickness also takes them from the descriptions, but in the game things go differently and the visual opulence translates into a fair variety of situations that helps us overcome the inevitable frustration due to the many sudden deaths. As the ship evolves the weight of contingencies decreases, but it takes several sessions for this to happen, as we are forced to suddenly start again by elite pilots, squadrons and large vessels that suddenly appear in a short distance and eliminate us in an instant . And it is precisely this flaw in the balance, one of the few elements that still does not fully convince in a game that, despite not having the depth of the great space exploration simulators and being satisfied with a decidedly simple gameplay, does almost everything it has to do in an excellent way . Sure, high lethality is part of the genre, but it can get annoying when it takes woe, consumables, systems, or player skill out of the way by becoming something unavoidable and highly random. On the other hand, the permanent evolutionary structure also admits a bit of ~farming~, using the merciless missiles immediately to kill quickly, collect money, increase finances withmpiing specific challenges, die and start again. The equipment is reset each time, but the talents, which include one that increases the credits found, radically change things, also revealing the threat levels of each jump point, and cushion the difficulty by combining with permanent improvements, glyphs obtained from the unprecedented breed of the ancients and schematic for the craft. Nonetheless, it takes many hours just to start making the first spaceship suitable for the challenge, reach the laboratory and really get to the heart of a game that is perhaps not perfectly balanced but fun, spectacular and long-lived enough to justify an all in all low price.", "date": "2017-05-29", "grade": "8.5"}
