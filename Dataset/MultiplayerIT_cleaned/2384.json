{"name": "X-MEN: Reign of Apocalypse", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/x-men-reign-of-apocalypse-2.html", "text": "MUTANT POWER Digital Eclipse made a scrolling beat'em up under license from Marvel. The X-Men that we will have the honor of being able to direct on the field are 4: Cyclops, Wolverine, Rogue, Storm. Each differs greatly in battle and it is soon discovered that they are not balanced against each other. There are two normal attacks, sockets, the ability to jump and make an attack, a combined move that draws on the character's energy and a bullet hit. An interesting feature is that of being able to carry a ~Furious Attack~: using a gauge meter that is charged by beating up the opponents, it is possible to inflict deadly damage with the mutant energy that is in us. The idea of visualizing the energy bar of someone who is beating up is always a welcome presence. Saving takes place automatically at the end of each cartridge game. However, it's not all rosy. In fact, the title is rather frustrating in the nerve center of every video game: playability. The movements are heavy and uncomfortable, sometimes it is impossible to make some moves, the structure of the GameBoyAdvance certainly does not help this situation. The graphics are pleasant and well done, especially in the backgrounds. Each internship is a well-characterized and refined location. The animations, sprites and frames should instead be reviewed, to obtain greater cleanliness and detail. The real strength of this work is the musical aspect: the soundtrack is among the best heard so far on GBA, so much so that the quality (in addition to the beauty of some pieces), will present new standards. The sound effects are average though. WE PLAY TOGETHER In multiplayer the game has unexpected merits. In Versus mode it is possible to beat up an acquaintance, choosing from the various X-Men equipment, but also those we faced during the canonical adventure mode. Even the arenas in which we can face each other can be unlocked by playing. The Co-Op option instead allows us to replay the adventure in two, collaborating towards the destruction of Apocalypse. The catch to all of this is that you'll need two GamePaks to access multiplayer... XEND extension The Digital Eclipse product is abundantly above the sufficiency, but the feeling you get when playing it is that of an embryonic project from a technical point of view, not yet fully mature. The efforts that have been made in the realization are evident, not stopping to exploit the hype of the mere license. The title, when compared with the recent Final Fight One, comes out defeated from all points of view, except for that very appeal, branded X-Men. Pleasant and well made game, but that will not satisfy the most demanding. PROS Great soundtrack Innovative elements in Multiplayer CONS Unsatisfactory gameplay Animations to review WHAT'S GOING ON? The X-Men were on missions to a distant world, but met a mishap in their return to the X-Mansion. Their Blackbird vehicle will not be in the areas known to them, but in a ruined land, ravaged by war. What happened? Who is the architect of this destruction? Soon the figure of Apocalypse emerges as an obscure proponent. It is necessary to find it, stop it and be able to re-enter the gate to return to the true original dimension.", "date": "2001-10-19", "grade": null}
