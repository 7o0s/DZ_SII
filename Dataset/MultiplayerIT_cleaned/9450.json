The SEGA product, released in 1993, in fact saw us playing the role of a cyborg who tried to escape from the colony in which he was relegated, and to do so he collected components around and plugged them in, in order to obtain the extra capabilities necessary to face the numerous opponents who would have barred his way. Here, never a combination was further from reality. The two robots protagonists of Spare Parts, Mar-T and Chip, go in search of components that can allow them to escape from the terrible planet on which they were ~downloaded~ like garbage, but the acquisition of new abilities is certainly less ~interesting~ compared to Cyborg Justice, and is still conditional on finding the spare parts needed to repair the sentient spaceship that will be able to take them away from there. There are certainly beat'em-up elements in the Electronic Arts title as in the SEGA one, indeed it can be said that the entire gameplay is based almost exclusively on the fights with the numerous alien creatures that infest the scenarios, but the quality of these clashes in terms of collision detection, variety of situations and simple fun it is so poor that even a comparison with a 1993 Mega Drive game would be out of place. But let's go in order... Lost Planet From the damaged spaceship, controlled by an artificial intelligence called ~Con-Rad~ (whose voice belongs to Simon Pegg, protagonist of the entertaining ~Shaun of the Dead~, in Italy ~Shaun of the Dead~), the two robots can access a teleporter that takes them to the various areas of the planet, each divided into a certain number of stages that can be completed with the ~minimum wage~ or explored in depth, perhaps later, to collect all the objects they contain. The single player mode does not include the presence of a second robot controlled by the AI, so playing alone we will find ourselves fighting the monstrous aliens, from the smallest to the largest, using only our personal resources. Mar-T and Chip have a rather rich repertoire of moves, made up of light and heavy combos, many attacks in flight and some special moves linked to extra components. Along the way it is in fact possible to find reinforced arms, a viewer useful for revealing any interactions with the locations, magnetic legs and other nice gadgets, all of which can be upgraded by spending the ~coins~ found around. Unfortunately, the problems we mentioned at the beginning manifest themselves clearly from the early stages of the game: the entire management of the three dimensions is somewhat questionable, and the level design only makes things worse, forcing us to jump almost blindly or to reach suspended objects whose position in space is far from clear. You move almost ~sliding~ from one floor to another, without the slightest sensation of the physicality of robots (which should also weigh enough), and very often this translates into extremely confusing gameplay, in which with double jumps you try to find the right path despite the many invisible barriers that further depress the scenarios, already short and intricate in themselves. Playstation 3 trophies Spare Parts allows us to unlock thirteen trophies. The only two silver trophies are obtained by simply completing the tutorial and collecting the first ~spare part~, while the remaining gold trophies are achieved by completing the individual stages, obtaining all power-ups, collecting one million credits and so on . He beats until he puffs EA Bright Light's enthusiasm can be felt through the numerous interactable objects scattered throughout the levels, which often ask to be destroyed with a charged shot to reveal some extra bonus. The point is that Spare Parts really lacks the foundations, and the proof comes as soon as you face an enemy. Collision detection is in fact very bad, very often you are convinced you are hitting an opponent and instead you are not, the sensation of impact typical of quality scrolling fighting games is completely missing, you ~slip~ here too, as in the exploratory phases, by pressing the keys like madmen hoping to score a few hits. Sometimes the alien creatures end up in strange corners of the scenario and you have to go and fish them out to kill them. The general ineffectiveness of the attacks soon convinces us to avoid strange key combinations, since it is possible to obtain the same effectby repeatedly pressing the Square button only. The grips are completely missing, but this is the least of the problems, because in multiplayer the game even gets worse: due to the lag, the collision detection is even less precise, and to this is added a senseless view management, which instead of following the movement of the single player (after all, it is still an online multiplayer, why set limits as if it were local?) it remains fixed on a single robot, forcing the other to always stay close to it. Finally, the technical realization fails in any way to raise the level of this new Electronic Arts production: the protagonist androids have an anonymous design, and even more anonymous are the aliens they fight with. The scenarios are mediocre both for their conformation and for the choice of colors, while the music seemed generally ~off topic~ compared to the action shown on the screen.", "date": "2011-02-25", "grade": "5.0"}
