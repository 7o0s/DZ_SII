{"name": "Okunoka", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/okunoka-recensione.html", "text": "After a handful of levels of Okunoka the first game that comes to mind is of course Super Meat Boy, however sprinkled with just enough Ikaruga to make the management of powers interesting. The concept is substantially identical to that of the Team Meat title, i.e. we are talking about an ultra-difficult platformer divided into more than a hundred small levels, in turn fragmented into various worlds, in which you die ... you die ... and you still die by ending up against obstacles, traps, enemies, falling into bottomless ravines or exiting the map directly. Let's imagine that the Caracal Games guys wouldn't be afraid to confess Okunoka's conceptual debt to Super Meat Boy and the like. Fortunately they managed to endow their work with a very marked personality, which allows them to overcome the inevitable confrontation unscathed. Ruthless gameplay Okunoka tells the story of the spirit world and the evil Os, who wants to turn all its inhabitants into machines, so as to form a real mechanical army. Opposing him is a spotless and fearless hero endowed with exceptional powers. Let's say that the powers are there, but we need to work a little on the rest, given that Ka, the protagonist, is a lazy and gluttonous being who spends his days sleeping and eating black souls. Despite sleep and hunger, Ka is able to make huge leaps. It can also solidify water, fire and electricity so as to create makeshift platforms to overcome the most insidious obstacles. Too bad that he can act on only one element at a time and has to constantly choose which one to keep in a solid state, often with only brief fractions of a second available. However his goal is always the same in each level: to reach a black soul, usually placed in the most impervious and dangerous area. Unfortunately Ka is not particularly resistant and it is enough for him to simply be grazed by a trap or an enemy to dematerialize and reappear at the beginning of the level. If you have played Super Meat Boy or any of its clones, you will not struggle to understand Okunoka's gameplay, made up of millimeter jumps, racing at breakneck speed, sequences of platforms to jump on and walls to climb. The further you go through the levels, the less breaks you can take between one leap and another, the faster you have to get with the controller to overcome dizzying sequences of dangers. Based on the time it takes to get to the end of a level, you receive a score that indicates your degree of skill. At the end of each world, however, you have to face one of the terrifying bosses, usually linked to challenges of extreme difficulty. It takes a few moments to finish a single level, but to get the best times there is much more to fight: you have to study them perfectly so as to be able to anticipate the jumps in your mind, before looking at the screen. The substance is that often you have to make many attempts to move forward, which is not a problem given the type of game. Note the care taken by the developers in introducing the different mechanics with very simple tutorial levels, which allow you to understand them immediately. It is an excellent, although not unprecedented, gimmick to accompany the user towards the real challenge and to break the pace of the game a bit, sometimes really punishing. The design of the levels is also interesting, built in such a way as to show an obvious path to follow, but also equipped with a series of shortcuts that can be traveled by the most skilled players, excellent for lovers of speed challenges. Excellent art direction Overall Okunoka works perfectly, even if in some cases a certain slipperiness of the controls can be perceived which can cause unjust deaths. In truth, the pace of the game is so fast that it is often difficult to notice and certainly does not spoil the gaming experience. In short, dying once more or once less in a title that plans to kill you thousands of times is not really a drama. How long does it all take, you are wondering? Difficult to say exactly, because a lot depends on the skill of the player. Completing all the levels is certainly not a walk in the park, but you get the most out of Okunoka by trying to break speed records, linked to online rankings that greatly increase the sense of challenge. In short, for the price it costs Okunoka offers a lot and does not make you regret the expense. The best part, however, we have left for the end, namely the masterful art direction. Caracal Games has done an excellent job not only from a technical point of view, but also from a stylistic point of view, outlining a colorful and convincing game world, characterized by very particular cartoon shapes and dto a general care that does not make you regret international productions. The characterization of the different worlds was also successful, all endowed with some peculiarities and often represented with simple but very effective solutions in rendering a certain atmosphere or a certain idea. The bosses also deserve applause, some really big and capable of creating situations as interesting as they are spectacular and new compared to what is the normal gameplay of the game, such as for example a mad race towards the top of a tower chased by a gigantic mechanical beast. Moreover, these are very difficult sections, often much more than the levels themselves, which bring the rate of curses per second to inhuman rhythms. In closing, we would like to inform you, even if we imagine that it is understood from the article, that Okunoka is not a game for the weak in spirit, but for those who want to put themselves to the test and are not afraid of having to repeat a single pattern over and over again. . In short, if you don't like difficult challenges, forget it.", "date": "2018-11-27", "grade": "8.5"}
