So simple that it was made in just 5 days, it is actually one of the most shining examples of products that also find great depth in their immediacy, although this may initially seem counterintuitive. Evidently considering the qualities of the iPhone suitable for conversion, the Semi Secret Software team has therefore decided to bring Canabalt to the App Store as well. The result? Exciting. Jump boy, jump We were talking about the simplicity of Canabalt, a factor that shines through in every aspect; simplicity, however, is not synonymous with poverty, and on the contrary, despite being based on such a basic concept, it can count on charm and personality that many other more complex titles can only dream of. There is no plot, there is no prologue to the events nor an introduction; immediately we find ourselves catapulted into the action, trying to make sense of the hasty and dramatic escape of the protagonist on the roofs of the buildings of a metropolis that is only stylized, sketchy, but equally suffocating and gloomy. The gameplay is really all wrapped up in one basic concept: jumping. In fact, the hero proceeds in his run independently, with a progressive speed that can only be partially affected by stumbling over the crates or objects scattered in the settings. The player's interaction is therefore limited to making the character jump, simply by touching any point on the screen; the higher the pressure, the longer the jump will be. Nonsense then? Far from it. First of all because each game is different from the other, for the random generation of the path which therefore prevents any predictability and repetitiveness of the action. Secondly, it must be considered the fact that jumping is not enough, but you have to do it well; behind each poorly calibrated trajectory there may be a crash against a wall, or a fall into the void, or even the impact with one of the fatal bombs dropped by unknown enemies. And as the speed increases it obviously becomes more difficult, convulsive and hasty. The goal therefore is simply to go as far as possible, surpassing one's own records; the only hint of an interface is revealed precisely in the indicator that tracks the distance traveled in meters. Canabalt is really all here; yet one game is enough to be sucked into the gameplay, which in addition to marrying perfectly with the experience of a few minutes (if not seconds) that best suits mobile gaming, manages to stimulate by pushing to play one game after another to improve your own records. A fundamental contribution is also given by the technical aspect, both for the graphic and sound components. If the former is in fact of rare elegance, with an almost monochromatic minimalism which however does not hide the irresistible cyberpunk atmosphere and the touches of class such as the animations and the flight of birds as the protagonist passes by, the soundtrack is a small masterpiece which makes it immediately justified the invitation, on the first screen, to use headphones to be able to fully enjoy them. Canabalt's defects can therefore basically be found in the absence of a global online ranking, which would have allowed one to compare one's performance with that of other users; and little consolation in this sense the integration with twitter to post your results. And moreover the price, currently at 2.39 euros, appears a bit too high in consideration of the standards offered by the App Store. The tested version is 1.0", "date": "2009-10-19", "grade": "8.6"}
