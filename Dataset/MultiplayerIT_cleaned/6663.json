In three solar systems, to be precise, each made up of at least fifteen planets and several moons, for a total of fifty levels and more: a decidedly abundant amount of content, especially if you consider that Final Horizon is included in the package of free titles from December for PlayStation Plus subscribers and, therefore, it can be downloaded for free in the PlayStation Vita version. We played Final Horizon on Sony's portable console, enjoying the precise and functional touch screen control system, the only difference from the PlayStation 4 counterpart. Final Horizon is a fun RTS, even if it doesn't add anything new to the genre In space no one can hear you fragging The story that connects the Final Horizon missions is essentially a pretext, and sees us assume the role of protectors of humanity sent into space to colonize various planets. The alien threat that we will have to fight is that of the Swarm: StarCraft has nothing to do with it - we want to hope that the guys from Eiconic Games wanted to pay homage to the Blizzard masterpiece - but the Final Horizon Swarm is a race of insect-like biomechanical creatures, and if Starship Troopers is coming to mind, we certainly can't blame you. The Swarm will gradually attack the colonies: the first missions are set in a virtual reality that serves as a tutorial and we must say that the game does a really good job of explaining with clarity and precision every mechanic of the gameplay or function of the interface, even if in reality the heart of the game is disarmingly simple. Using the touch screen or the sticks we will have to navigate the map and select the various installations to face the alien siege; initially we will have to limit ourselves to repairing turrets and generators, but soon we will also have to start choosing which weapons to build, where to do it and which ones, possibly, to upgrade. Each action consumes energy, which is why it is essential to strengthen and defend above all the generators that produce it, but then the considerations of real time strategy begin to appear when the enemies begin to attack us from every corner. Which emplacement to arm or upgrade? And in what order? The answers to these questions may seem obvious in the early stages of the game, but they will become more and more complicated as you unlock new missions and try to complete secondary objectives, also because enemies initially appear one type at a time , but then they begin to attack in different formations, forcing us to choose the most effective weapons against this or that species. PSVita trophies The thirty-seven Final Horizon trophies are divided into 19 bronze, 15 silver and 3 gold, headed by platinum. To unlock them you have to complete all the missions, of course, but also the secondary objectives. There are also more specific challenges: killing a certain number of enemies in particular ways, for example. The advanced missions of Final Horizon, in fact, urge the player to think dynamically and to risk resources and installations with risky and inevitable moves and strategies. At some point we will have to start destroying the generators to replace them with weapons, to avoid being overwhelmed, or we will have to repeatedly swap the various types of weapons depending on the type of enemy that is attacking. Despite the simplicity of the basic concept (the types of enemies are few and the maps are not particularly large) the developer has managed to mix the cards in order to mask the lack of variety, which is already evident after a few missions, thanks to the objectives secondary and to the randomness of some game sequences which, especially in the advanced stages, could be annoying, if not downright frustrating. From time to time you also come across some mission or power-up that offers an almost completely different structure, between practically shooter levels, taken from above, and smart bombs earned by killing enemies with a little skill. Once the campaign is one hundred percent completed, it is still possible to play in Score Challenge mode and set the parameters you want for each mission: our results will then be loaded into a special leaderboard. For those who want to further expand the offer, Eiconic Games has announced the publication of a DLC package, entitled Dark Galaxy, which adds some missions to the base game. From a technical point of view, Final Horizon certainly does not show off the potential of the hardware: the maps are decidedly sparse and the models pincredibly simple oligonal, but the interface is clean and does the job, and we have not registered any slowdowns or glitches even in the most frantic moments of the game, when explosions fill the screen. A small commendation, on the other hand, deserves the illustrations chosen to represent space and solar systems, spot on and decidedly atmospheric.", "date": "2014-12-22", "grade": "7.0"}
