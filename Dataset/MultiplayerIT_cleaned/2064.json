{"name": "The Simpson Road Rage", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-simpson-road-rage.html", "text": "Mr. Burns against everyone! A day like any other in the sunny town of Springfield. Homer is sitting comfortably in an armchair watching TV, Lisa is intent on practicing her saxophone, Bart is setting animal traps and Mr. Burns is grappling with a big deal, which will lead him to manage the city bus network, the Springfield Transit Corporation. Not satisfied with the atomic power plant, a source of great pain for the entire town, he decided to expand further by transforming harmless means of transport into mobile power plants and moreover by bringing the ticket price to 100 dollars. But as Neruda said ~El peblo unid jamas will be vencido~. To thwart this terrible atomic threat, the citizens of Springfield decide to offer an alternative service, all becoming taxi drivers dedicated to transporting people in need they meet on the streets. The goal is to buy back the Springfield Transit Corporation, at a cost of one million dollars, and restore peace and tranquility to cartoonish Springfield. The yellow world in a mini-DVD Let's face it frankly, the game has practically only one goal: to unlock the dozens and dozens of characters, scenarios, bonus cars drawn freely from the world of the Simpsons, all using a typical storyline of the Crazy Taxi saga. From the five initially selectable characters we will be able to have thirty, or all the yellow band that dominates in that of Springfield. Try to imagine the angelic Lisa driving an electric car or Krusty grappling with his clown car, Otto with his school bus, the bizarre Homer with his legendary pink car, the surly Willy riding his tractor and, last but not least in fundo, Bart as a space pilot and so on. Not only the cars and the characters, but also the game scenarios have been reproduced, more or less, faithfully. Initially we will only have access to the area called Evergreen Terrace, but certainly fans of the series will not be slow to recognize several characteristic buildings of the animated series: the elementary school, the church, the hospice-castle, the Krusty Burger or the Jet Market. In total we will have six scenarios available, all of which can be unlocked from the Progress screen, provided you have enough money from user transport. Among the other cartoonish locations I point out: the Nuclear Power Plant (faithfully reproduced, you can also admire the noxious gases that escape from the chimneys), Springfield Mountains, Dam, Entertainment District and City Center. Game mode As you have surely guessed from the previous paragraphs, we are faced with a Crazy Taxi set in Springfield. Our aim will be to use the taxi cars of the yellow individuals to transport passengers throughout the city with the consequent earning of money, useful for unlocking new cars, characters or scenarios. A fair longevity is ensured by the various initially selectable game options. The quintessential mode is Road Rage. After selecting one of the five characters initially available (Lisa, Bart, Homer, Marge and grandfather) and the internship (initially we will only have Evergreen Terrace) we are finally ready to catapult ourselves onto the dangerous streets of Springfield. Here we will be able to notice several other similarities with the Sega masterpiece. For example there will be a hand (this time yellow) to show us the right direction of travel and at the bottom left we will find the map of the city, very useful for orienting ourselves towards the destination area requested by the passenger. We will take care of making the dual carriageways even more dangerous, since along the way we will be able to dedicate ourselves to a systematic damage activity against Burns. In fact, by destroying the bus stops of the Springfield Transit Corporation we will get bonus time, indispensable, in many cases, in order not to lose the customer. A ~Practice~ mode cannot be missing in a racing game and obviously Simpson Road Rage did not miss it, renaming it Sunday Drive (Sunday Drive). You will be able to roam the city without worrying about the timer and discover all the places invented by the brilliant Matt Groening. The mission mode is very interesting and attractive. Without wanting to take away the taste of the surprise, I anticipate that in one of the ten missions we will have to impersonate Otto struggling with the exam to obtain a school bus driving license. We will not be asked to fasten our seat belts, respect speed limits and other various legalities, but we will have to knock down 15 lampposts along a driveway in a certain amount of time. Another mission will involve l'old grandfather intent on destroying twelve garbage cans (did he be out of his mind?). To complete the panorama of available options we find the ~Head to Head~ mode. It's a showdown that pits you and a friend against the daunting task of carrying a passenger to their destination despite enemy disturbances. Graphics and Sound In a game like this, based on a licence, the graphic aspect plays a fundamental, if not primary, role. The effort put into making the characters and scenarios is good but not great. In some cases we will find small discrepancies between the real character and the virtual player, as well as the number of textures used could have been higher. We are far from the heights reached in Crazy Taxi or Cel Damage with expressive and extremely detailed characters. Another small gap comes during the game session, in which the sensation of speed leaves something to be desired, all aggravated by very slight frame rate problems. Overall, the level design work achieves its purpose, which is to let us enter the Simpsons universe also thanks to the excellent sound accompaniments and the presence of the characters' typical phrases that will give a further touch of comedy to the game. To conclude.. A brand like Simpson will certainly not go unnoticed. The misadventures of the most ramshackle town in the world represent a too greedy and tempting pole of attraction for all fans of the comic and of the television series, to whom I warmly recommend buying the game. For the rest, the invitation is to wait for better racing games, which are not limited to inserting a license within a game structure drawn from other productions (read Crazy Taxi in this case). Pros: successful license guaranteed fun Cons: some repetitive graphic flaws in the long run A yellow invasion Years go by for everyone, yet there seems to be a lost American town that has continued, for a decade now, to give us hours and hours of good laughs thanks to its (mis)adventures. We see them on TV, we find them in the cinema, we read them in comics but now we will also be able to interact with each other thanks to the first appearance of the Simpsons on the GameCube. The game in question is The Simpson Road Rage already landed very recently on the PS2 and Xbox market. Will this license-based title be able to disprove the bad reputation surrounding this type of production? We will only find out by entering the magical world of Spriengfield.", "date": "2002-07-03", "grade": null}
