The complete series consists of five English-language episodes. For once, there are no spoilers. Tales From The Borderlands: Episode 1 - ZerO Sum comes out just one month after Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. The two games promote each other but, while we are sure that the game signed by 2K will last much longer, we are instead doubtful about the fate of this Telltale series. The introduction of the first episode is a long, almost never interactive narrative that introduces us to one of the two protagonists of the series, the white-collar Rhys, together with his sidekick, Vaughn. They are the typical duo of action stories, the first tall and reckless, destined for the spotlight, the second short and recalcitrant, eternally overshadowed by the deeds of the protagonists, although he sometimes proves to be the only one capable of saving the day. Rhys and Vaughn find themselves caught up in a western plot of betrayal, briefcases full of money and fabulous treasures. The most interesting aspect of the game is the choice of narrating the events by alternating the voices of the two protagonists, Rhys and Fiona, the latter introduced in the second part of the game, both hostages of a mysterious robotic samurai to whom they must each tell their own version of the facts. A mechanism similar to that of the first season of True Detective, which works well but would have been even more satisfying if it hadn't clearly made it clear when the narrator distorts the facts. Indeed, the embellishments of the ego are limited to a few circumscribed comic scenes. Nonetheless, first hearing the story from Rhys' point of view and then discovering Fiona's role adds yet another surprise to an already twisted tale. Finally, when Rhys and Fiona, tied like sausages, have finished disputing the facts, ZerO Sum embarks on an action-packed third act, in which all the supporting actors are present on the scene together with the charismatic ZerO (for the uninitiated, one of the playable characters of Borderlands 2) a sign that probably the original characters of the series will also make an appearance. Even if the second hour of the game is lively enough, the weak start and the all too typical cast of characters leave us with a few too many doubts. The fate of Tales From The Borderlands is at least as uncertain as that of Rhys and Fiona. Tales From The Borderlands fleshes out the world of Borderlands, but sometimes we regret the ~real~ game The other side of the coin Tales From The Borderlands tells two versions of the same story. Two protagonists, two personalities, two conflicting interests. But it also opposes two moments of interaction, the narrative and the action. When it comes to speaking and juggling dialogue, Telltale once again works its magic. At the end of the episode all the characters involved began to take shape and a few smiles escaped us willingly, even if not all the jokes hit the mark and some sequences stretch the story beyond what is necessary. The illusion of making meaningful decisions is still there, although during the long introduction it is difficult to get passionate about Rhys, and consequently even the choices lose their importance. Fortunately, as the story unfolds, there are various moments in which one feels that every decision, among the possible ones, has a different weight. Although the moments of interaction are numerous, the amount of time in which we only have to watch the film scrolling on the screen is however many and there is a bit of frustration. This is especially evident in the action sequences. The third part of the game is spectacular, with long exciting scenes, but the duration of the clashes and their pyrotechnic nature highlight the superficiality of the Quick Time Events. At the beginning, for example, we can summon a robot to help us and choose its armament. Any decision is as good as the other, it's just a matter of pressing a button at the right time, but everything has already been determined beforehand. The required skill is null. It can be argued that Telltales have been successfully adopting this approach for years but, in ZerO Sum, the disproportion between the automatic effects produced by our inputs and the humility of the task makes us feel more than ever trained monkeys playing with a fake push-button panel . It's a feeling that comes and goes, carried away by the adrenaline rush of stunts and twists and turns, but more mature players won't help but wince think of Dragon's Lair and old laserdiscs. Where the game excels is in the ability to perfectly recreate the original Borderlands setting. The style ironic and irreverent, mixed with a good dose of pulp, it makes us feel immediately at home, as well as the cynical and crazy characters, with their stories of survival and unbridled ambition. There are the Vaults, the masked dwarfs, wild rides that end up in a tangle of dust, blood and metal, as well as obviously the inevitable billboards that signal shops, absurd museums and new troubles. If you love Borderlands, you'll be happy to explore Pandora and converse with the characters that populate it, but when it comes to action, chances are that you, like us, will wonder why you're not playing the original instead of pressing buttons on command. Finally, there is an aspect of Tales From The Borderlands that still has time to improve, namely Rhys's special ability, which with his cybernetic eye can scan objects in the area around him. For now, this skill is only used to read fun factsheets about the game world, but we hope that in the next episodes it will offer some more articulated moments of interaction. Fiona, for her part, has money in her pocket. It can lose or gain some, and on one occasion spend it to purchase an object of aesthetic value. For now it doesn't seem like a great thing, and perhaps it was only inserted to place the legendary banknotes here and there with the yellow light beam that makes them stand out in the confusion of a world in disarray. In short, after a good two hours of play, the overall feeling is positive, but Tales From The Borderlands could also prove to be a simple filler that is easy to sell before the awaited Game of Thrones.", "date": "2014-11-27", "grade": "7.0"}
