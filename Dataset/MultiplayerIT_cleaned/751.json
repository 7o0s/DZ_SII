{"name": "X-Men Legends II: L'Era di Apocalisse", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/x-men-legends-ii-lera-di-apocalisse.html", "text": "Mutant RPG As in the case of the prequel, X-Men Legends II is more or less classified as a mix between a Japanese RPG and one with a clear Western influence, such as Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance or EverQuest: Champions of Norrath. The basic idea is extremely simple: as the narrative progresses, we will be entrusted with missions to complete, and to achieve our objectives we will have to cross areas obviously fraught with dangers. We could classify these areas as ~dungeons~, in the most ~rpg-istic~ sense of the term, but fortunately X-Men Legends II offers not only closed locations, but also open ones, such as forests and mountains, offering an abundant variety . The enemies will be scattered throughout the various maps, and to defeat them you will have to resort to the powers of our group of up to four mutants: the combat system in fact proves to be of a marked ~action~ mold, but relying on brute force without carefully planning the own moves will only lead to an inevitable Game Over. The most exciting feature, as well as strength, of X-Men Legends II is in fact the battle-system, extremely fun and well designed, linked to a mechanism of ~growth~ of the characters that takes full hands from the best exponents of the genre , allowing the player to distribute points at each Level Up to acquire new powers and special abilities or, perhaps, to raise the individual psycho-physical statistics of the various mutants. On the field, the player controls only one, while the effective AI moves the other three team members, although a simple button press is enough to switch manual control from one character to another: after a little practice , the player takes total control of his super-group, and it's easy to perform spectacular combinations of attacks and powers. However, tactics assume a fundamental role, it has been said, starting with the members you decide to send on a mission: some combinations of characters will in fact unlock special bonuses, an ingenious feature that rewards fans of the comic series who will easily guess which are the right combinations to take advantage of these extras. But that's not all: knowing the mutants you have is important, because if it is true that at least initially you find yourself making your way through the X-Men's opponents by unleashing the most devastating powers of our heroes (such as Cyclops' optical beams or the deadly attacks by Magneto), from mid-game onwards you have to start thinking like in a real RPG, assembling teams that are composed not only of ~damage dealers~, but also of ~tanks~ and ~healers~, characters responsible for absorbing damage and healing the group respectively. However, variety is not lacking in the choice of party: in fact, there are dozens of characters, many of whom will become available by advancing in the main-quest. If the agnostic players of the Marvel world will like the wide list of characters, the fans of the comic will be delighted to say the least: Cyclops, Wolverine, Tempesta, Magneto, Gambit, Rogue, the Iceman, Colossus, the Scarlet Witch, Bishop , Toad, the Juggernaut, Burning Sun and many, many more will be directly playable characters, and more will make an appearance, such as Angel, Sabertooth and Blink. A comic book game The promotion with full marks X-Men Legends II deserves it not only from the point of view of the gameplay, but also from the purely technical one. The graphic creation, in fact, is not only of high quality, but it is also decidedly original: Raven Software has in fact once again opted for a three-dimensional modeling accompanied by an excellent cel-shading to recreate the cartoonish feeling, but this time it has added a interesting detail, hatching the contours of the models with heavy black brushstrokes. The feeling of being in front of a moving Marvel comic is great, and the final result is excellent. The chromatic variety and the quality of the modeling are in turn a piece of a graphic mosaic also characterized by highly detailed and highly detailed settings, and above all by fluid and spectacular animations. Accompanying the whole is a repertoire of particle effects, lights and distortions that make every power a fireworks display. As far as the audio is concerned, however, the soundtrack is discreet: it does not particularly shine in quality, but it can be listened to, pressing the player at the right moment and giving rhythm to the fights, especially against the bosses. The dubbing deserves a separate discussion: the copy received by the editorial staff, in fact, was entirely in Spanish. If we really wanted to comment on this audio track, we'd have to do it crying, given that the Hispanic dubbingis pitiful to say the least, an element that combined with the, so to speak, ~bizarre~ adaptation of the various names (with a Nightcrawler called Ronzador Nocturno or a Wolverine who has become Lobnezo, and poor Blink renamed... Estello) makes it the truth is that the ludic experience in the language of Picasso is quite amusing. Tie-ins inspired by American comics are almost always failures: just think of the recent fighting game Rise of the Imperfects or the mediocre adventure launched on the occasion of the Fantastic Four film. Rarely has it been possible to play as a superhero without worrying about the quality of the product, as in the case of Spiderman 2, the more recent Ultimate Spiderman or, paradoxically, the two-dimensional fighting games made by the Japanese Capcom years ago. Yet, the first X-Men Legends had already hit the mark for the goodness of the realization, while this second episode repeats the success and quality of the prequel in every respect. More varied, more fun and with a truly engaging plot, full of more or less well-known characters, X-Men Legends II is also embellished with a revised and corrected battle-system, as well as a decidedly over the top technical realization. A must-buy for lovers of the Marvel mutant world, and highly recommended for those looking for a western-style RPG in this period overloaded with Japanese RPGs. Pros: Great technical realization Well thought out battle-system Dozens of X-Men to play Cons: Not particularly long-lived Combat system needs some practice There are no particular differences between the home versions of X-Men Legends II: only the X-Box version, supporting 720p, enjoys greater sharpness compared to the PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions. The latter, however, has slightly faster loading and greater fluidity. A separate discussion for the PSP edition of Legends II: the audiovisual realization is almost identical, but in the Sony handheld the clear black outline of the cel-shaded models is missing, resulting in a greater visual clarity at the expense of the cartoonish effect. The much longer uploads are understandable and limit of the hardware itself, therefore not considered a defect. Lovers of American comics will certainly know the word ~cross-over~: it indicates a temporary crossing of some events, mostly related to different serials, which occurs in particular and exemplary circumstances. Until a few years ago at Marvel it was customary to publish almost one cross-over a year, mainly crossing the ~mutant titles~, or the various comic series relating to the very famous X-Men and their universe; but among the cross-overs read in many years, none (well, maybe only ~Onslaught~...) has ever come close to the quality of the splendid ~Age of Apocalypse~ that ten years ago literally rocked the Marvel universe for a few months , giving its readers an unforgettable ~what if~ that still affects the regular newspapers today. It is therefore no coincidence that this second episode of X-Men Legends is subtitled precisely ~The Age of Apocalypse~ even if narratively it has absolutely nothing to do with that spectacular saga (and to tell the truth, it is an imaginative Italian translation of the original English title, ~Rise of Apocalypse~ or ~The Rise of Apocalypse~). As in the case of the first Legends, in fact, these X-Men and their enemies are not in ~continuity~ with the paper ones we read every month, and the title offers a bizarre mix of various series and various ~worlds~, amalgamating the regular universe with the Ultimate one (a comic series that, for the uninitiated, reproposes the history of the X-Men from the very beginning and in a more modern and original way). The result is pleasant, even if fans of the paper series will find it bizarre to see the Bishop of Xtreme X-Men alongside the very young Storm of Ultimate X-Men. The important thing is that it works... and it works: in this new adventure, the X-Men find themselves having to shed light on the kidnapping of some famous mutants, carried out by a terrible adversary, the very powerful and ultracentenary En Sabah Nuhr, known also as Apocalypse. To deal with the threat, the X-Men will have to team up with their archenemy Magneto and his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants...", "date": "2005-11-17", "grade": null}
