With Puzzle Agent, while remaining in the genre that saw them triumph, the Telltales shift the style of play towards that of one of the most popular series ever to appear on the Nintendo DS, Professor Layton, presenting a point and click that intersperses the dialogues with the characters to puzzles, hence the title, to be solved by discovering which logic governs them, in a somewhat different way from the normal stylistic features of the genre where, on average, the goal is to find out how to fit the numerous objects found in the scenario with the course of the adventure - or maybe how to avoid goats in ancient castles that many players still dream about at night. The player plays a slightly nerd federal agent, Nelson Tethers, who, instead of being destined for important or at least interesting investigations, finds himself catapulted into the middle of Minnesota to find out what lies behind the closure of an eraser factory in the charming town of Scoggins, whose inhabitants, curious coincidence, seem to show an innate passion for logical puzzles. Tethers, Nelson Tethers. Puzzle Agent is presented, exactly like Professor Layton, as a series of ~scenarios~, whether they are physical places or the illustration of the puzzles to be solved, masterfully drawn by hand and which therefore show a whole series of details and little things that they can be found in a three-dimensional image created on the computer, even if on the other hand the graphic subtleties of special effects and the like are obviously lacking, which, after all, would be absolutely irrelevant in a product of this kind. Furthermore, as a classic in a Telltale work, a perennial basic irony and comedy is distinguishable in everything, from the characterization of the characters through an atmosphere that varies from gothic to grotesque with an excellent ability to intersperse both aspects, right down to the general plot and puzzles themselves; pity however that, again from Telltale ~experience~, the English - the only language present - with which the various jokes or puns are written and prepared (including the name of the protagonist) are not exactly the school ones and also a good connoisseur of His Majesty's language may have various difficulties in understanding them thoroughly, a bit like what happens in Mel Brooks' films, which base 70% of their comic verve on the play on words. Strange to say, it is precisely in the same organization of the puzzles that the title begins to show cracks: the approximately 30 riddles that dot the adventure are several times a bit repetitive - just as the trick with which are obliged to solve them: usually someone tells us that if we don't help him he won't speak and here is the excuse for a good puzzle - and their difficulty, thanks to the many aids that can be requested and even the possibility of abandoning them if they prove too difficult , it is not even comparable to the real similar intelligence tests proposed by the benchmark on the Nintendo DS. Finally, we must add the low longevity, partly justified by the price, and the total absence of any reason to play the adventure again once it is finished.", "date": "2010-07-20", "grade": "6.0"}
