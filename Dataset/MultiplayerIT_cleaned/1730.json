{"name": "X-Men Next Dimension", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/x-men-next-dimension_c.html", "text": "An already old game The main problem with this title is that while introducing new elements it remains substantially similar to its predecessor released more than a year later, the whole concept therefore appears old when compared with the complexity of modern titles. If it is possible, some elements such as the control system and the artificial intelligence of the enemies have even been worsened, the same graphic sector denounces a sharp drop in quality when compared with the splendid predecessors. The plot, purely ancillary, sees the X Men and Magneto, bitter rivals, unite to avert the threat of Bastion who wants to eliminate all mutants without distinction. The modes present are the usual Arcade, Versus, Survival and Practice. To these is added the Story Mode, a fairly usual mode if it weren't for the way it was structured. In practice, the player must impersonate a certain character for a certain number of battles, after which he will be free to choose another from a small list of fighters and so on. The idea is certainly not structured in the best way: while varying the character, in fact, the sequence of CG interludes will be the same as well as the series of fighters to face. However, it is pleasing to note that at least something original has been proposed within a title that basically has very little originality. In the Arcade, on the other hand, you will be busy facing a series of characters as happens in all the other fighting games on the market. The number of characters increased to 20 plus 4 selectable secrets after beating the game. The other 2 modes need no explanation. On the battlefield Once you enter the arena, whichever mode you choose, you will find yourself facing opponents with a good amount of special moves and shots. The executable moves are divided into weak, medium and strong, while the supermoves require, as always, a certain key combination and filling via combo of three bars placed just below the energy bar. Each bar represents a different ~super~, the peculiarity lies in being able to load a specific bar to your liking depending on the need. The moves available are numerous, however the strange AI of your enemies will lead you to always perform the same combos since the opponents suffer from a syndrome that characterizes all the beat'em ups since Street Fighter 2: in badly balanced fighting games it often happens that the use of a few techniques is preferred to the combat studied, this is because the algorithm underlying the opponent's artificial intelligence belatedly realizes that the tactic adopted up to then must be changed quickly. Fortunately this defect is compensated by the level of difficulty, already quite high after the fourth or fifth fight. The aerial moves, criticized in the previous version, have been revised but in a negative way since, if they were too effective before, they now turn out to be counterproductive. The arenas, which take up the concept already expressed in Dead or Alive, are divided into sections that can only be reached in the case of an opponent's ~launch~ against a structure. This time, however, the sections themselves represent the various stages, thus reducing the number of settings available. The character control system, well studied in the previous episodes, turns out to be a bit awkward in this version, also due to some animations that are not perfectly done. Furthermore, the game seems to respond late to the commands given, resulting slow, which sometimes helps to limit the tactical element in favor of crazy tinkering with the keys. Overall, the whole game system knows what it has already been seen and the defects mentioned, although not too heavy in fact, certainly do not contribute to the final evaluation of the title. Final note for the loadings, really too long between one fight and the next, the vastness of the backdrops alone does not explain the waiting times so long when an older and more complex DoA2 managed to load the stages in half the time. ~For a better tomorrow~ Even graphically, Next Dimension certainly does not shine. The animations, despite being very well done, sometimes suffer from a certain clumsiness, while the polygonal models denote a mostly modest complexity. The backdrops are huge but not very complex, moreover the textures that cover them range from a sufficient value to the dull in the flooring of some stages. Despite this, the entire graphics sectorco still manages to give the feeling of being inside a comic. The very colorful graphics are suitable for the type of setting and the special effects, although not always up to par (see the strange effect that wraps the Gambit cards), manage to give the spectacularity required by the various evolutions and super moves. The audio sector is the least cared for. The sound effects are good but the speech is just okay. Among other things, the characters continue to obsessively repeat the same phrases at each fight, which is not annoying in the arcade mode but definitely out of place in Story Mode. To surround the whole of the decidedly anonymous musical pieces. Comment I have repeated it several times: X-Men: Next Dimension is an already old game from the start. Not that it's bad, mind you, but modern fighting games are quite another thing. It's sad to see a series that started well end up like this but evidently Paradox had very little desire to complete the project, or perhaps it let itself be tempted by the very popular custom today of hiding a not particularly brilliant game behind a famous license. The X-Men license has been exploited to package a product specially created for Super Mutants fans, I think the others will find an overall discreet product very unappetizing counting that there are games of the caliber of Virtua Fighter 4 and Tekken 4 around PROS: +Original Story Mode +Several selectable characters +High number of moves and special shots CONS: +Concept recycled from previous episodes +Graphically disappointing +Control system not flawless +Says already seen If there is one thing that has remained unchanged over the years in the world of video games, it is certainly the close kinship that binds them to comics: an inextinguishable source of inspiration that has generated a myriad of titles inspired by this or that character of printed paper. Without making a list, which is also impossible, it is enough to know that the only titles inspired by the Wolverine saga date back more than 10 years ago and evidently if they keep coming out it means that the charm of this series has not yet run out. Paradox Development knows it well, creator of the two Mutant Academy on PSOne, fighting games that have achieved a lot of success thanks to a valid mechanics and an extraordinary graphic sector. Today Paradox tries again with this Next Dimension, unfortunately the result is not what we all expected.", "date": "2003-03-10", "grade": null}
