Some of them had started to know it from the first images shown in 2002, so they had followed its evolution to find themselves in their hands a final version with a lot of cut material. Without letting themselves be demoralized, they began a work of data collection and information exchange that led them to accumulate a mountain of data on what appeared to be the original vision of the authors on the game. From there, it was a short step to starting work on Lost Alpha, fueled by the 2009 release of a 2004 build of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl filled with discarded materials. Born as a total conversion, Lost Alpha soon became a more ambitious project. Development stretched over years, well beyond the originally planned release date. In the meantime, the main series has had time to see the publication of two expansions and the announcement and failure of the official sequel, for reasons that are still not very clear. From the chaos following the failure of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 and GSC Game World, the only flame left to keep the hope of seeing the series return to the splendor it deserved was precisely the work of dez0wave, in the meantime grown again and promoted from total conversion to official stand-alone expansion. Unfortunately in the last few weeks everything has gone downhill. Slated for release at the end of 2014, Lost Alpha was released early on April 26, for free, due to a tester who released an old build on the pirate circuit, breaking the pact made with the rights holders of the series. The move was motivated by a desire to stop the spread of the old version. Of course, it angers to know that such a talented team will not receive any financial compensation for such an effort, which certainly deserved a commercial life. But remembering the popular adage that it's useless to cry over spilled milk, let's see why it would be absolutely crazy to pass up this game. Where to download S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Lost Alpha? S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Lost Alpha can be freely downloaded from its official page on ModDB: Link. The archive is divided into three parts (plus patches that are released quite regularly). If you prefer, there is also an official torrent, downloadable from here: Link. Some will find it more comfortable. Love for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. it only bears good fruit Starting Lost Alpha for the first time it seems to be faced with the old S.T.A.L.K.E.R., at least as far as the general feeling is concerned. It soon becomes clear that it is an illusion. Of course, the game system has remained the same in its general aspects and the graphics engine is the same, even if enormously improved in the lighting and atmospheric effects. Especially by activating the full dynamic lightning mode, indeed heavy enough to handle, some landscapes gain enormously in impact. The style is always that of the past, but honestly we don't remember an expansion that has improved the technical side up to these levels, making some sections worthy of those of a modern triple A title (think that the bullet holes on the corpses have been added , for one thing). The novelties of Lost Alpha, however, are not limited to cosmetic enrichment. After a few hours of play it is impossible not to realize how much this total conversion is bigger than the original title: immense maps, richer scenarios, many completely new zones, the old zones completely revised (apart from Yantar, however heavily modified, and the laboratory x16) new plots and sub-plots and so many other contents that one remains incredulous. There are so many that most of the paid official expansions pale in comparison (let's not talk about DLC... with those there is no comparison at all). Indeed, let's say better: the new contents of Lost Alpha can easily make the single player campaigns of most triple A titles pale. We are talking about hours (and hours) of extra gameplay compared to the already long-lived Shadow of Chernobyl. At this point the most mischievous will be dribbling their tongue on the question ~and the quality?~ Don't worry, Lost Alpha doesn't disappoint here either. Indeed, we do not hesitate to say that the remade maps are better than the originals in many respects. Meanwhile, the various factions are distributed in a more rational way and the sense of crowding that you could feel in the old maps has largely disappeared, furthermore each territory has been exploited better thanks to dedicated secondary quests and numerous secrets (really many) that go to enrich without distorting the culture of the series. Difficult to ask for more from a PRoduction of the genre. Is there currently a video game that there is no reason not to play? Yes this. The life of the stalker Ok, you may be thinking, everything is bigger and more refined, but in terms of game mechanics and gameplay? What changes compared to the past? Let's say that even from this point of view a really valuable job has been done. Meanwhile, you can collaborate more often with the other factions, even by teaming up in some missions. In addition, all weapons have been added and revised to be more realistic and in line with the scenario. The flashlight has remained, which requires consumable batteries to be used, while there are special areas for resting, or you can use a sleeping bag. There are new enemies and there's a new faction, the Sins, who have their own standalone mission chain written completely from scratch. There are new mutants and different species of mutants already seen in previous episodes. Much of the equipment has been overhauled to make the impact of individual items on gameplay more important. Let's say that, in general, a lot has been aimed at creating with Lost Alpha a title for hardcore players who love demanding challenges. Easy to notice at the first shooting against multiple enemies, very capable of killing us with a few bullets. However, the most of the clashes is obtained by raising the level of difficulty, because only in this way are you forced to develop greater tactics in the approaches to shootings. In reality, if you are particularly gifted it is possible to solve many situations with a more silent approach (it is also possible to drag the corpses, to show how versatile the system is). You will soon discover that the possibilities offered are so many and that overall Lost Alpha seems to be what Shadow of Chernobyl should have been and in part it was not, although it is still considered a masterpiece today. The Italian translation Like the game, the Italian translation project of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Lost Alpha has also suffered the setbacks of the early release. Thus the patch, which you can download from here: link, is to be considered only 70% complete, for the admission of the Leonardo Sassi team coordinator himself (it was impossible to complete the work with the minimum notice received for the release). Obviously the translation work is continuing apace and the Italian version will be updated in the coming months. In the meantime, you can start playing it, because in any case many text strings are already translated and it is not very difficult to go on with the adventure. Any flaws? Defects? Of course there are. Meanwhile, by admission of the development team itself, there are still several unsolved bugs. Reading on the various forums, some have experienced frequent crashes (also due to the graphics engine, which is not exactly a stability masterpiece by itself), while for others the game freezes for a few seconds, and then returns to running smooth as oil . Even the artificial intelligence shows some uncertainties, with the enemies that occasionally get stuck in the scenario. Bluntly put, it was pretty clear this was going to be the case ever since the early release was announced. The developers themselves have spoken of a version with still several problems to be solved through post-launch patches and, since there is no longer any economic support behind the project, given its overall size, it is already a miracle that there are only these bugs. In this case it shouldn't be a burden for the players to also be a beta tester, since you pay absolutely nothing to play S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Lost Alpha. For this we will keep the bugs in minimal consideration for the final comment, as well as we will not rage against some graphical uncertainties, mainly due to the recovery of the original models (we are still talking about a 2007 title). There's really nothing to complain about, trust me, and all the little glitches the game suffers from pale in comparison to its immense qualities. In fact we are talking about a commercial quality title that can be downloaded for free.", "date": "2014-05-06", "grade": "9.5"}
