And yet, the review of MLB The Show 21 can only open by taking note of an epochal turning point, which led the baseball simulation developed by SIE San Diego to break through the walls of the PlayStation universe to also reach the competition. In addition, owners of Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S can find MLB The Show 21 on Game Pass, thus making it particularly attractive on Microsoft platforms. Thus ends an exclusive that had lasted since the birth of this gaming franchise, dating back several fifteen years ago, thanks to which for so long baseball fans have been able to enjoy a title that has often met with public and critical acclaim. A choice dictated by the desire of the MLB league itself to increase the fan base of the official simulation, of course, but in any case epochal especially for baseball lovers linked to the Microsoft ecosystem, condemned for a long time to look at the competition with envy. Having made the premise, let us also remember that MLB The Show 21 marks the debut of the series on new generation consoles. So let's go and see what SIE San Diego has in store for us for this year's edition. The modalities: the stadium is mine and I create it for myself MLB The Show 21, stadium selection. Even if it is not a real game mode, browsing the menus of MLB The Show 21 we notice more than anything else the addition of the stadium editor. However, the long-requested feature is only available on next-generation consoles, leaving PlayStation 4 and Xbox One owners out of luck. Once inside, one can discover that it is not an addition put there so much to make up the numbers. The editor that we are facing is in fact very powerful, and allows you to indulge your imagination in creating realistic but also fun stadiums, given the possibility of adding elements such as a T-Rex among those placed at the edge of the field. The real modalities game of MLB The Show 21 remain the ones we know again this year, with a few additions here and there which, however, do not represent anything shocking. So we start from Road to the Show, the career mode that allows us to bring our unknown athlete to the top of fame. There is still a lot of work to be done in terms of narrative compared to other sports titles, despite the arrival of a podcast with variable content based on our performance on the diamond. If you have played the latest editions, you will also be familiar with March to October, mode season thanks to which it is possible to condense the duration of an entire championship into fewer hours of play, for the benefit of those who prefer to experience the most significant moments without taking too long to get to the postseason. Some minor additions do not particularly change what we have already seen previously. The same argument is also applicable to the Diamond Dynasty mode, practically the version of Ultimate Team with the club in hand. Compared to its football counterpart, the mode offered by MLB The Show still has the merit of requiring smaller investments in real money to be able to compete. The Franchise mode closes the circle, that is the one where we can control the fate of a team through several seasons, also worrying about the management aspects. The most relevant novelty in this case consists in a general renewal of the interface, accompanied by a series of information on what is expected to be the evolution of the team members in terms of performance. The gameplay: (almost) everything as always From the modes to the gameplay, for MLB The Show 21 the gist of the speech doesn't change that much. After a few minutes spent with the controller in hand, the sensation is in fact that of being completely at ease with a large part of the dynamics of this year's edition, even if of course there are some novelties. The most relevant is undoubtedly the so-called Pinpoint Pitching, a new type of throw through which you have to mimic the movements of the thrower with the right stick. A very particular addition, undoubtedly with a high learning curve, which however promises to offer moments of extreme satisfaction once its dynamics are properly learned. Those who don't want to get too tired to master Pinpoint Pitching can still choose to use one of the old throwing modes, still present among the selectable options. Thanks to a new set of animations, the dynamics with the ball in play seemed further refined compared to to the edition of a year ago. Especially whenthe trajectory of the ball involves the perimeter wall the players now seem more reactive in catching the ball, thus limiting awkward movements and errors due to them, causing moments of discomfort in which those who have the controller in hand cannot understand what they see on the screen. Practically nothing has changed as regards the batting phase: also in this case we have the possibility to choose among several types the one that best suits our idea of virtual baseball. At the initial launch MLB The Show 21 still allows you to choose your own style of play between three different types ranging from casual to competitive, with the possibility of defining a suggested level of difficulty together with any other selectable parameter that adjusts it dynamically according to based on our performance. Graphics and sound: generational leap in the middle MLB The Show 21, stage game. With the arrival of MLB The Show 21 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X | S, it is clear that a lot of attention was also paid to the technical sector of the game developed by SIE San Diego. In light of our tests we have to say that the generational leap we expected occurred halfway through. As for the graphics, seeing the matches in 4K resolution at sixty frames per second naturally allows us to appreciate everything even more, above all a greater level of general cleanliness which, through better management of the lights, manages to give an extra touch to the game realism. There are also new animations, which we have already talked about. We must not forget, however, that in terms of visual rendering, even the same MLB The Show 20 on the older generation was already among the top of the sports genre. To see a real jump, however, we will have to wait for next year, just as we will probably have to wait for MLB The Show 22 also to see a greater exploitation of the potential offered by the DualSense controller of PlayStation 5. The use of haptic feedback is in fact only mentioned. As for the sound, the commentary is quite similar to that of last year, thus falling within the aspects of the game on which a review by the developers is necessary.", "date": "2021-04-21", "grade": "8.0"}
