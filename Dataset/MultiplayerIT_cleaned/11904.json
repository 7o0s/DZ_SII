{"name": "Drawn to Life - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/drawn-to-life-recensione.html", "text": "The first consideration to make when talking about Drawn to Life is that it is a well-studied project: not only has it been conceived to make the most of the uniqueness of the DS, but it is also based on an almost universal desire of the players, i.e. that of modifying, embellishing or creating the protagonist of an adventure. Regardless of the result achieved, which we will discuss shortly, Drawn to Life is therefore a unique title, worthy of capturing the public's curiosity thanks to the innovations it brings. The player The 5th Cell game can be categorized as a platform, but it certainly does not make the classic mechanics of the genre its strong point. The context that hosts the adventure, despite being very simple, is well cared for both in terms of graphics and narrative. The player simultaneously plays the role of creator and savior of the world in which he operates, a particularly interesting combination that implicitly introduces him into the video game both as a character and as a person. The epic begins when the Raposas, a group of animals drawn in a kawaii style, inhabitants of a village that has now fallen into darkness, invoke the help of the creator of the world itself, for once interpreted by the player. In this role you won't be able to interact directly with the environment, but you will have the possibility to give life to characters able to do it for you: as a creator you won't be limited to this, because you will also have to draw some elements of the landscape (interactive and not ), but the first task is precisely to design a hero capable of helping the Raposas. Some of the strengths and weaknesses of Drawn to Life emerge immediately in this first phase: the tools for drawing, for example, are well cared for, they include brushes of various sizes, a rather vast amount of colours, the eraser, the bucket (as always used for uniformly fill limited spaces) and others. However, we realize just as quickly that the hero of the game cannot be drawn freely, but that it is mandatory to fill an already delimited space with lines and colors: the presence of fixed anatomical models was foreseeable, but it was also desirable that there were more of one. It is therefore allowed to give the shape you want to your hero, but at a playful level there is not the slightest difference between a spheroidal character and a humanoid one: the parts that interact with the environment are always the same, because the skeleton, although filled in a different way, it remains unchanged. The same procedure is repeated whenever it is necessary to draw a game element, whether it is a weapon or a platform: the aspect is arbitrary, the function is not. Although the intuition of Drawn to Life is intriguing, it is unable to profoundly influence the two levels in which it is reflected, namely the playful and the aesthetic one: in the first case the lines drawn do not represent a discriminating factor, in the second the customizable elements are too few in order to give a strong personal imprint to the scenario. Player The moment you take control of the hero, you enter the more usual and familiar environment of the 2d platformer. The play structures are totally canonical, derived from the most famous representatives of the genre; the only deviation from the archetypes that Drawn to Life allows itself lies in the need, to complete a stage, to find four objects within the path. Fans of platform games will remember that a similar playful program was present in Wario Land 4, in which it was enriched by a fleeting return to the starting point: if in the Nintendo game the dutiful collection of objects helped the deconstruction of the classic platform formula, by confusing the player and forcing him to mentally reconstruct an ideal path backwards, in Drawn to Life it simply serves to prolong the longevity of the level. Beyond the objectives and the items to collect (there are also superfluous ones), the 5th Cell title is all too scholastic and traditional in the composition of the stages: there is nothing that can really surprise you for its originality or quality, although the game design is not bad. In platformers the architecture of the levels is closely linked to the possibilities offered by the control system, and that of Drawn to Life does not excel in variety: the movement of the character is precise, but neither the intensity of the run nor the height of the jump, limits that preclude the game from making a qualitative leap. The levels are accessed from the Raposa village, which also hosts transition phases between one stage and another: these sections force the player to carry out extremely simple and not very stimulating tasks, they are certainly the least successfuland of production. The map of the country is rather small and lacking in detail, and exploration is made slightly frustrating by the control system, not designed for the top view that characterizes these parts. Fortunately, the stages in the village are short, so they don't undermine the experience guaranteed by the game. Drawn to Life is mainly aimed at a young audience, both for the aesthetics and for the classic mechanics, a little too obvious to entertain an old-time player for a long time: despite this, it is not a short or easy platformer, and passing over the somewhat simplistic design of the levels, also motivated by the original role of designer, can be enjoyed by anyone. raposa! The aesthetic of Drawn to Life has been carefully created, and the visual aspect, although it does not make the most of the graphical capabilities of the console, does not give rise to regrets. Characters and settings blend well, making the scenario cohesive: the only ones capable of ruining it, or embellishing it, will be you through your creations. It is good to remember what was said previously, namely that the player does not have the right to change the appearance of each element at will, but only that of some objects chosen by the game itself. The animations are up to the rest, and it's particularly fun to watch your drawing come to life: the protagonist's movements are not naturally harmonious like those of the other characters, but they are still appreciable considering that, by animating a single skeleton, the graphics had to guarantee the mobility of an almost infinite amount of forms. The music completes the experience by proposing pieces that manage to follow the graphic metamorphoses of the adventure, helping to insert the world of Raposa in a childish frame. Drawn to Life is a very original title, which gives you the possibility to draw the protagonist of the adventure and some elements of the scenario. However, the potential of this idea has not been fully exploited: the works of the players have no influence on the playful level and only marginally modify the aesthetics of the game. The platform mechanics on which the 5th Cell work is based are decidedly traditional, and could soon bore vintage players. It remains a title to be appreciated for its innovative drive, which offers an interesting experience both for drawing lovers and, above all, for children: we are sure that seeing one's sketches come to life can hide any defect in the eyes of a child. .. or anyone who feels like one. Pros: The protagonist can be drawn Cozy atmosphere Cons: Platform too traditional The drawings have little influence on both the game and the graphics", "date": "2007-10-24", "grade": null}
