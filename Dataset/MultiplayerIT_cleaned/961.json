Almost everyone who will read this article knows the reason for the success that the Timesplitters saga has always had: multiplayer. Things have changed? Don't worry, the game has always been devoted to the ~party game~ but now, in the era of Xbox Live and Sony's online service, all this cannot be limited to four players or to LAN parties, in fact it is not like this: Timesplitters Future Perfect was born for online play and exploits it massively, perhaps like no title released until now. The only exception is, unfortunately for Gamecube users, the one for the Nintendo console for which only the split screen is provided, a significant limitation for the EA title. We have therefore briefly listed the fundamental features that all lovers of the EA saga loudly demanded, and at this point we cannot avoid wondering if even the single player, often mistreated in previous versions, has undergone some positive influence. But let's not rush too much, let's take one step at a time. The single mode puts us in the shoes of Cortez, a tough guy, a tough guy, a kind of clone of Vin Diesel complete with ~Riddick~ goggles, who will be catapulted between various historical periods in search of the crystals of time. In fact, for the first time we will not pass from one character to another but we will always wear the dirty clothes assigned to us at the beginning of the game. The plot is the least original the developers could find, but in practice it is totally functional to what the coders were aiming for, namely the action. The entire title develops through thirteen levels and six/seven particularly frenetic hours, very satisfying at first but repetitive in the long run; we will travel in time from 1924 to the distant future, crossing various locations: a military base, a futuristic Martian planet, houses haunted by zombies and ghosts, you name it! The entire title develops through thirteen levels and six/seven particularly frenetic hours, very satisfying at first but repetitive in the long run single player?? Yes there is this too... Timespllitters Future Perfect also puts us in a position to interact with numerous non-player characters (npc) making us feel almost really on the battlefield; countless times we will find ourselves collaborating, protecting them, following them or using their fire as cover. Furthermore, we cannot overlook the aspect that has always characterized the saga and that is the irony that has always emerged through the weapons, the appearance of the characters and even the most imaginative locations. This is also the case in Future Perfect and jokes and funny situations appear around every corner, further enriched by a dubbing and a more than decent Italian localization. The level design is quite captivating even if obviously elementary. Very few stelth phases which, moreover, historically have little to do with the Timesplitters saga and which in fact seem to be inserted ~as a duty~, a lot of action but also zero innovation: there is not much to explore and very often, if not always, the way to go through is unique and does not allow for variations. In many areas, however, we will be able to interact with the scenario, giving us some moments of pure videogame enjoyment. To facilitate the extreme action, the commands could only be the canonical ones of the fps, like Halo, with the introduction of a possibly deselectable viewfinder that will allow us to switch from carnage to ~sniping~ in an instant. Unfortunately, the single-player experience lasts, as mentioned, very few hours, and in addition to being very repetitive at times, it is not supported by an adequate difficulty of the missions, making it much easier to finish than the previous two chapters. The A.I. of the villains on duty is discreet but nothing more. But don't be too upset by this evaluation, it is in the essence of Timesplitters to focus little on the single player experience. You will discover the real Future Perfect in the next paragraph. Multiplayer what a passion! The Free Radical title concentrates all its enormous potential in this area, thus trying to mask the obvious shortcomings and gaps of the single player mode. First of all, the Story mode that characterizes the single player can also be played in a cooperative, thus increasing the involvement and longevity of the game itself. Certainly nothing particularly exciting and new but still something more that many enthusiasts look for in the games to buy. The Arcade mode features offline multiplayer for up to four people in a fully customizable split screen. The EA product amazes for its vastness and care in this area: 16 maps to choose from, 13 modaldifferent ties with a dozen ~bots~ as opponents for each challenge. All this goodness becomes an excellent training to prepare for online challenges against stronger and more savvy opponents than artificial intelligence, which in the game will not spare forbidden shots but certainly does not shine for the routines implemented in it. The game modes are really very varied and apart from the classic Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag (here renamed to capture the bag) appear for the first time in a game ~The Assistant Monkeys~, a crazy mode in which the competitor finds himself in the last position in the standings and has some monkeys at his side who will help him get rid of his enemies. But the news certainly doesn't stop there, in the Reduction mode our physical size will depend on the killings we will be able to do... and if we don't behave like real killers we will risk becoming very small. The Vampire, on the other hand, foresees that the opponents must be killed in order to guarantee the minimum of lifeblood that allows us to continue playing. We conclude the roundup by mentioning the Virus mode in which we will play a kind of boyish cops and robbers and when we touch the enemies they will catch fire and as usual the last one to stay alive will be the winner. There's no denying these Free Radicals are imaginative, huh? For PlayStation 2 and Xbox offline modes can also be selected online, and that's where the real killer comes out of his shell! Multiplayer what a passion! Within the Challenges mode, however, we will find many mini-games to chase the minds, and by obtaining excellent scores we will be able to upload our result to Xbox Live and show it to the world. For PlayStation 2 and Xbox, let's remember not for Gamecube, all these modes can also be selected online, and that's where the real killer comes out of his shell. You can challenge 16 other players via Xbox Live while for Sony users this possibility is limited to 8 opponents at the same time. To play, like all EA games, you need to register on the servers of the American giant, in an instant, and then you can set off to conquer. Both versions, at least in our tests, performed well online while the only doubt that arose concerns the size of the maps, really huge and such as to affect the online game between a few opponents. These levels, you will be able to verify with your own eyes, in fact give the best from 6-7 players up. One of the possibilities offered by the game and of sure impact for the most passionate is the creation of maps, it is in fact possible to create the most diverse levels in a few minutes thanks to the excellent integrated editor. But it doesn't end there, in fact once the maps have been created we will be able to exchange them online via Xbox Live, a function that we imagine will become increasingly popular also in the next generation of consoles. Graphics and Sound In both versions the graphic aspect is definitely taken care of, even if the peaks reached by both consoles are not reached. The fact that the whole game runs at a constant 60 frames per second is certainly no small advantage, and which does nothing but emphasize the speed of the clashes and their frenzy. Of course, in our test we noticed some sporadic drops in the framerate, obviously in the most agitated situations and with different characters on the screen or in the presence of large explosions, but being so rare they do not affect the good work done by Free Radicals. As far as textures and polygonal models of characters are concerned, we can only be satisfied, even if we certainly are not in the presence of extremely well-finished models, and since there are more than 150 different ones, we would have liked more customization, perhaps with different animations, or textures which make one cry out for a technical miracle. Occasionally we have noticed on some surface a little of the much hated aliasing, some sin of youth that has not gone unnoticed by our vision. From an audio point of view, we can only be satisfied with the work done by the programmers, Dolby Digital in game is supported on Xbox while the GCN and PS2 versions have support for Dolby Pro Logic II. The music is quite pleasant and in the game it actually fades a bit, however emphasizing the salient phases of the battle. The sound effects are good. Comment We think we have said it all about this title: an excellent offline and online multiplayer, subdued solo mode and a decent graphics department. The reflection that arises spontaneously will not be very original but rather legitimate: in fact, we think that if Timesplitters Future Perfect had been released a few months ago it would probably have marked the online game in a very strong way, setting a qualitative standard mvery high. Instead, he now finds himself fighting, at least on Xbox, against Halo 2 defined by all as the best online game of this generation and certainly life will not be easy. However, we remain convinced that the EA title will be able to carve out a significant space for itself among fans, thanks to the countless modes present and the charge of humor and fun it brings with it. The version for the Nintendo console deserves a separate consideration, which can only be penalized by the lack of online play, certainly users of the big N will be able to make up for it with the split screen but certainly the impact of the Free Radical title will be different, remove therefore half a point to our final evaluation.Pros Multiplayer and online The map editor The technical sector Cons The mistreated single player A few technical defects here and there After a few years of absence, one of the best shooters ever comes back to visit us, one of those games capable of gluing us together for hours and hours in front of the screen during the much-loved multiplayer evenings. This feature has always been the trademark of Timesplitters, which, presenting itself in this new incarnation, promises to guarantee us many hours of entertainment.
