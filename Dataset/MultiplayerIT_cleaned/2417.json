{"name": "Triple Play Baseball", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/triple-play-baseball.html", "text": "Baseball what a passion! I don't know about you, but I've always liked baseball games since the very distant times of Champions Baseball, the legendary Sega coin-op with which I spent more than an afternoon in the arcade, of course I was one of the few who put the coin in the cabinet, but at the time it was one of the most realistic and complex games and that's why it caught my attention. But let's go back to our Triple Play by saying immediately that the innovations introduced are very few and probably do not justify the expense for those who already own the previous title, vice versa this is a title suitable for those who have never bought a game on this sport and want to get closer in a simple and immediate way. In short, to get straight to the point, I tell you that Triple play is a purely Arcade game with few really simulative aspects. I believe, and basically the EA title is perhaps a demonstration of this, that perhaps this is the last chapter of the series, for the simple fact that on the market it is possible to find a far superior product that responds to the title of High Heat Baseball (remember that the new title of the series called High Heat Baseball 2K2 is coming out). And in comparison to the other titles? Well actually there are none and the struggle boils down to the two mentioned above. Let's go for a Home Run From a technical point of view, the EA title presents significant aspects to others that are decidedly less pleasant. Meanwhile, the teams have been updated to the last season and the graphics present discreet player models, especially the facial expressions are very accurate and it is possible to easily recognize the best-known players. It is also possible to create your own player by choosing very precisely a lot of characteristics, such as skin color, hair length or weight. On the other hand, the rest leaves something to be desired with a good variety of stadiums, which however turn out to be rather crude as a realization. The sound would be excellent if it weren't for the poor (relative to the sentences that make it up) commentary, which after a while you feel like turning off. Remarkable is the control system, which changes significantly according to the peripheral used. So we will have a different system depending on whether we use the keyboard, the mouse or a joypad. In this respect, EA has done an excellent job that I fully agree with, on the other hand they could have been limited to a simple adaptation of a single control interface for all devices. As I said before, shadows and lights, and therefore I can't fail to underline the poor AI we have to deal with. The Arcade nature of the title also manifests itself when we perform some particular shots, such as the Triple Play as a particular Cheat mode is activated which allows us to improve the performance of our men. Some visual effects are downright bizarre, I happened to hear thunder when I did a Home Run!! When we embark on a league, unlike the other modes, it seems to us that we have a semblance of simulation and a greater depth. At the end of each game we would have credits available that we could spend to improve the characteristics of our players. I remind you that it is also possible to play in Multiplayer through the most popular network protocols, including TCP/IP which is used to create pleasant games via the Internet. Conclusions I repeat a concept already expressed in the review phase: Triple Play has perhaps reached the end of the line, EA must change something and must do it immediately, given that the competitor with whom it is measured beats it on all fields. So the natural place for a title like this is for those who have never played a baseball game or for those who are ~emotionally~ attached to this title. In short, EA has tried to differentiate the product, but I honestly don't know if the result is the right one. I don't know if EA's decision to focus almost all of its energy on X-Box has something to do with it, and therefore limits itself to making small restylings to its titles, we'll still see. In the meantime, I apologize, but I'm wanted on the diamond for a Home Run. 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 200 Erm no! Baseball!! Here we go again! EA gives us (ehmm, really doesn't give) another of its characteristic sports games from its vast production with a new chapter in one of the longest and most enduring sagas, that of Triple Play. As I wrote in the title, the first title dates back to (computer wise!) 1998, and since then every year there have been new refinements and improvements that have led to this Triple Play Baseball (strangely EA has abandoned the usual numbering). Anyway, let's unpack our game and install what in America is considered the favorite pastime of the cittaUS dini.", "date": "2001-08-20", "grade": null}
