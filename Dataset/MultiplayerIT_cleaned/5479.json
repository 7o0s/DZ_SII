Given the success of the Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm series and the decent experimentation of J-Stars Victory VS+, it was only a matter of time before Bandai Namco commissioned the creation of such a product based on a popular license like that of One Piece . And so here we are grappling with One Piece: Burning Blood, a title developed by Spike Chunsoft (those of J-Stars, in fact) in which we will be able to fight as Monkey D. Luffy, his fellow pirates and many other characters, from Portgas D. Ace to Whitebeard, passing through videogamely unpublished figures such as those of Akainu, Sengoku, Mihawk, Moria and others, engaged in one-on-one, three-on-three or even nine-on-nine battles. One Piece: Burning Blood represents a decent starting point for a series with great potential Let's shorten the distances If you are familiar with the various episodes of Ultimate Ninja Storm, the gameplay of One Piece: Burning Blood should not take you completely off guard, although the differences with the series developed by CyberConnect2 appear quite evident right from the start. The pace of the game is in fact slower, with the opponents tending to always lengthen the distances (you will often see them fleeing away) to gain an unfair advantage if they have attacks from afar. Trying to get close to be able to score some combos will expose us to their blows, in a coming and going that often becomes quite frustrating and exposes the enormous limits of the game in terms of balance. The tactic can in fact be replicated on the contrary, when we play the role of a warrior equipped with the ability to shoot beams or fireballs towards the enemy, while the simple execution of combined attacks near an opponent who is getting up can give life to real exploits useful for ending matches quickly and painlessly. A real pity, because on paper the available maneuvers are many and quite varied between standard shots, extra abilities (which can be activated by holding down the R1 backbone), special moves (by holding down the L1 backbone) and various breakers, thought to break the defense of others and to limit the damage when you are the victim of a combo, calling another member of the team into the field to give us support (which naturally limits our options when we fight alone). There are therefore many approaches to combat that we can put into practice, but very few that prove to be effective; especially in the final stages of the campaign episodes, when the enemies can literally kill us with two shots and the curses fly very high. In such situations, the only possibility is to dodge the opponent's lunge at the last second and place a simple combo, trying to raise the fury indicator to enter rage mode, which will make our blows stronger, for then maybe score a spectacular special by pressing the right stick on its own axis. Fortunately, things change when we face a human opponent: the online multiplayer works very well, without any latency problems, and has the merit of emphasizing the strengths of this production, namely the large number of warriors and the repertoire available to each of them. In short, if you plan to buy Burning Blood also and above all to have fun with friends, take this aspect into consideration. Supreme War! Given the rich roster, made up of forty-two characters plus about sixty support, it would have been reasonable to expect from One Piece: Burning Blood a lasting single player campaign capable of embracing different narrative arcs of Eiichiro Oda's manga. Unfortunately, the main mode of the game, Supreme War, is instead based only on the saga of the same name, which sees Luffy determined to save his brother Ace from the gallows, facing together with a group of impromptu allies the strongest warriors of the Navy, above all the very powerful (as aesthetically anonymous) Akainu. The storyline is seen from four different angles (Luffy, Whitebeard, Akainu and Ace) for as many episodes, each divided into a variable number of chapters which also include optional missions. You therefore often find yourself checking different characters, familiarize yourselfndo with their repertoire of moves and their peculiarities, trying from time to time to find the square to successfully complete the fights and watch the cutscenes that carry the plot forward. We generally don't appreciate it when a game alternates between good and bad characters, for the simple reason that the involvement created by certain events, such as the death of an ally, should be used to create the necessary emphasis to move forward and tear apart the author of the gesture, rather than letting us check it from the perspective of an opposite point of view. This is even more true in Burning Blood, given that the parallel episodes provide a complete picture of the Supreme War and its clashes, but at the same time they end up reproposing and recycling a large number of animated sequences. The biggest problem, however, is the brevity of the campaign: it took us just four hours to complete the four episodes, including optional missions. Considering that the account includes the many attempts made to defeat the most difficult opponents, it goes without saying that by proceeding smoothly, the story could be completed in less time. Playstation 4 trophies One Piece: Burning Blood includes fifty Trophies, which must be unlocked by completing the various episodes of the single player campaign, progressing in the Wanted VS mode, obtaining all the main and support characters, as well as performing certain maneuvers a certain number of times. Battleship The short campaign represents a serious problem for One Piece: Burning Blood, even if the developers have tried to fix it by introducing a fairly rich side dish, with some interesting implications. In addition to the competitive multiplayer locally or online, which we talked about above, and the Free Battle, it is in fact possible to try your hand at the missions of the Wanted VS mode, in which we will play the role of real bounty hunters grappling with different teams to be defeated after creating a team of characters, and above all with the Pirate Flag mode, which will see us join one of the available factions (which can be freely created by users) and fight for that flag, moving from one island to another and facing its guardians, who can be controlled by the CPU or by human players. A screen will show us at any time the situation of our faction compared to the others, in a very simple but captivating social perspective. In terms of technical implementation, the game boasts solid performance, which shows the side to some drop in frame rate only during the most agitated situations, while the design of the characters takes great advantage of cel shading and is therefore faithful to the counterparts of the anime. There are some visual solutions that actually refer more to the manga and that didn't seem very spot on in such a different and dynamic context (see the shadows on the characters' eyes during some scenes), but it's probably a matter of taste. Burning Blood can give spectacular sequences, although in the end it doesn't exploit who knows how the PlayStation 4 hardware, in particular by reducing the scenarios to large practically empty spaces, with interactions for their own sake and always a side dish of pirates and marines same in the background. There is also a bit of fan service (see Boa Hancock's dress, which rips as it takes damage), while the sound sector has disappointed us in terms of management: during the campaign it often happens that during a fight there is someone in the background who speaks continuously, strictly in Japanese (with subtitles in Italian), but on the tenth attempt to defeat a specific opponent it can get really cloying.", "date": "2016-05-31", "grade": "6.5"}
