Although this decision has given rise to products of undoubted depth and quality, and despite having proved to be economically absolutely successful in the face of the 6 million downloads achieved and recently celebrated, there was a lack in the French label's catalog of an authentic exclusive to be clearly associated with the Apple platform. But with Modern Combat: Sandstorm, the music has finally changed Call of Duty who? It is well known, among the many advantages of Gameloft, originality certainly does not figure, and also on this occasion the source of inspiration is quite clear and must be sought in the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series by Activision. We are therefore talking about a fps set in the present day, and with settings in an unspecified area of the Middle East; the plot, far from innovative, puts the player in the role of a soldier employed in the Sandstorm mission, with the aim of eliminating a new potentially more than threatening terrorist cell. Fortunately, it is where it is needed, that is in playability, that Modern Combat: Sandstorm proves to have the right cards. Let's say right away that it's a real fps, without reverential fears or cloying simplifications; the main control system is based on a virtual stick on the left with which to move your character, while the right thumb can move the gaze simply by dragging anywhere on the screen. It is in all probability the best solution achievable on a system without physical keys for this kind of games: although not precise and responsive as with a real pad (without bothering the mouse and keyboard), it proves to be able to fulfill the purpose by allowing fluid movements, complete with lateral strafe and rapid changes of direction. Other icons intelligently placed in ~strategic~ areas of the screen allow you to crouch or stand up, throw grenades, reload and switch weapons between the 2 that you can carry at the same time, switch to precision view with scope and - of course - shoot. Of course among all these virtual commands it sometimes happens to touch a key by mistake, but nothing frustrating or irreparable. Some further actions then appear in conjunction with certain steps, such as placing explosive charges and things like that. The intelligent and not too intrusive aim assistance also compensates for the unavoidable reduced accuracy of the touch screen. The variety of the arsenal is guaranteed since practically nothing is missing: rifles, machine guns, sniper weapons, rocket launchers and so on, as well as fixed positions that you can take control of. From a purely playful point of view, therefore, Modern Combat: Sandstorm is a success; the programmers have been able to circumvent most of the hardware's limitations thus offering a title that is conventional, but fun and engaging in practically every situation. The level design is linear and leaves no room for particular quality peaks, but in any case it does its duty without giving way to too many criticisms. But it is above all the graphic component that amazes, even taking into account that it is a title built around the capabilities of the iPhone 3G, and not the more recent and powerful 3GS: the polygonal complexity of the settings is excellent, as is the fluidity of the action and the frame rate. Even the textures, albeit with some ups and downs, are excellent in terms of variety and - considering the hardware - also in terms of quality, and the same can be said for the effects of smoke and explosions. The 10 levels also guarantee a high turnover of settings, which include cities, hospitals, laboratories, port areas, sewers and so on. The sound is also of good quality, both in the songs and in the effects, even if with regard to the latter the shouts of the enemies, often repeated to the bitter end, annoy a bit. Sorry for the absence of any multiplayer mode, but it seems that a future update is intended to fill this gap too. The tested version is 1.0.7", "date": "2009-09-07", "grade": "9.0"}
