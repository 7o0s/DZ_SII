{"name": "Magic Vs. Metal", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/magic-vs-metal-recensione.html", "text": "The concept behind Foursaken Media's new mobile game is a bit of a ~sharks against dinosaurs~ thing, which projects us into a now deserted post-apocalyptic world, in which two factions furiously clash for control of what remains of the planet's resources: on one side the Magi, creatures linked to magic; on the other the Mecha, powerful robots armed to the teeth. Using two different layouts that substantially change the experience, making it more similar to a real-time strategy game or a third-person shooter, we will be able to control one or the faction and freely change the selected unit as we carry out increasingly complex missions, in which the imperative is to resist the enemy onslaught and defend your base. An attractive formula on paper, but does it work properly in practice? We reveal it to you in the Magic Vs. Metal review. Structure: between magic and technology Magic Vs. Metal, our Colossus targets enemies from a distance with his cannon Magic Vs. Metal (or Magia Vs Metal, or even Magic against Metal, depending on whether you download it from the App Store or Google Play) includes a substantial single player compartment in which we will be able to choose whether to take the side of the Magi or the Mecha, with two distinct and separate progressions, and control three different units on each side. On the one hand we will have the Enchantress, the Necromancer and the Berserker, respectively a ranged warrior, a summoner and an unstoppable tank; on the other, the Nova, the Technomancer and the Colossus, classes that have the same characteristics as their ~magical~ counterparts but in the form of fearsome metal fighters who, instead of casting spells, shoot missiles, bullets and laser beams. The first missions of the campaign are trivial, but it is obviously a gimmick to introduce us very gradually to the mechanics of the Foursaken Media title, which after a first series of completed tasks gets into gear and fully reveals its tower defense nature , catapulting us into large-scale clashes that become really challenging and exciting. To be able to overcome them unscathed we will have to use the accumulated resources to buy upgrades related to our unit, support troops, main weapon and base: a mechanism which at a certain point inevitably brings pay-to-win dynamics into play, even if in reality the free-to-play model adopted for the occasion seemed honest and rather permissive to us, at least in the first hours. Gameplay: action or strategy? Magic Vs. Metal, one of the Magi fighters assaults the metal minions with his spells As mentioned, Magic Vs. Metal allows you to choose between two layouts that change the gameplay a lot. In fact, playing with the screen in portrait mode, therefore with the device vertically, a single finger is used to indicate to our fighter where to go and possibly who to attack, while the view provides an overview of the battlefield that is not very easy to read. Frankly this option seemed to us much less valid than the landscape mode, with the device horizontally, which transforms the experience into a solid mix between third-person shooter and RTS, with the possibility of directly piloting our character thanks to a double stick virtual, complete with automatic fire when we frame an enemy in the viewfinder but a cooldown system that rationalizes the ability to attack. Magic Vs. Metal, the activation of support units moves the camera up to allow us to see the whole battlefield With increasingly numerous and difficult hostile troops coming towards us in an attempt to destroy our base, we will find ourselves not only opening fire (or casting spells) to defend the position, but also taking advantage of the action points that progressively recharge to field support units of various kinds, such as turrets, automatons, drones and various types of special shots or grenades in the case of the Mecha. The alternation of these offensive options consolidates the combat system, making it quite multifaceted and interesting, even in simplicity of the short corridor in which the two factions battle it out. In fact, there are specials that can turn the tide of the battle, for example the one that allows you to duplicate some support units for a few seconds, and that we can equip instead of other maneuvers deemed less useful. Technical realization: a curious mix Magic Vs. Metal, our Colossus has arrived in front of the enemy base: tower offense? There's no doubt that the idea behind Magic Vs. Metal is a bit crazy, but technically and artistically the game supports it strongly, evenhe here with a clear superiority of the third-person mode compared to the pure strategic one. In fact, if the hordes of minions that are thrown at us have a confused and mixed design, some characters stand out and the general quality remains high, especially by activating the ultra graphic preset and 60 fps. This system, so bizarre yet fascinating in its own way, is supported by a soundtrack finally able to stand out, thanks not only to a set of convincing effects, which enhance the fury of the battle well, but also to cinematic-style music that adds epicness to the sequences, while becoming repetitive at a certain point .", "date": "2022-12-17", "grade": "8.0"}
