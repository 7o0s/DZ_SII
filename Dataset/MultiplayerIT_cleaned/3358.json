The review of the latest CI Games effort can only start from the last two chapters of the IO Interactive series from which it takes up a large number of ideas, starting from the entire game structure. In short, we are very far from the previous Sniper Ghost Warriors. Basically we play the role of a Predator, a sniper who is part of a group of specialized mercenaries who must eliminate some targets hidden in the territories of an imaginary Siberia, part of a political fiction scenario in which the Russians no longer completely control the area. Each target represents a contract that, if fulfilled, will net us a large amount of money, which can be spent on upgrading equipment. As in the last two Hitman, each contract requires us to visit large open maps in which to find a way to approach the intended target. In the meantime we can also achieve a series of secondary objectives, whether they are part of the contract or completely unrelated to it, such as bounties to hunt, objects to find, plans to destroy and so on, which will also earn us a certain amount of money. The main target is generally a very important individual to kill, the way to do it is up to us to choose. Gameplay: Approaches to missions The approaches allowed by Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts to achieve the objectives are essentially three: play as snipers, then look for stakeout points, clean up the outposts from enemies from a distance as much as possible (or silently eliminate the patrols scattered around the maps) without giving into the 'eye, then proceed calmly to our destination in case there is anything left to do. The second, more complicated approach is the completely stealthy one, linked to a secondary objective that asks you to avoid making victims, apart from the target. It makes a lot of money, but requires an excellent knowledge of the maps and, possibly, the use of advanced equipment. In reality, it is still possible to kill someone, perhaps by interrogating or executing them after being discovered, but in this way the money is given up. The third approach is guns blazing, which frankly we have never used because it is antithetical to the scenario. Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts provides us with many weapons, including sniper rifles, machine guns, shotguns, grenades, mines and so on, but some of them are more or less useful depending on the chosen approach. For example, we played entire maps using only the sniper rifle (basically you play a sniper and playing as if you were in Call of Duty seemed absurd to us), while we resorted to the advanced equipment at our disposal numerous times , in particular to the supplied mask which, when activated, allows to obtain a series of invaluable information. Basically it is a viewer that highlights some points of interest on the map. At the beginning it has a limited scope and limits itself to indicating the interactive objects and ledges that we can hold on to and which give rise to short sequences of parkour in the style of Assassin's Creed. Between the missions, however, it is possible to spend the money accumulated to unlock other features, so that it can be used, for example, to identify nearby enemies, or to view mines and traps. The mask isn't the only gadget our hard-earned cash can be spent on. In total there are four categories with specific skills, all related to the approaches described above. We therefore have the possibility of improving our uniform, for example to make us more camouflaged, or we can make weapons more stable. The money can also be spent on buying extra weapons. Sniper rifle The core of the whole experience offered by Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts are the different sniper rifles available, the use of which deserves to be treated separately. Basically these are the classic long-range weapons that impose a staid rhythm on the entire gameplay. In Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts you spend a lot of time looking for the perfect ambush points on the targets, then observing the various targets from afar trying to identify all the forces at their disposal, then establishing the order in which to eliminate them, so as not to trigger alarms or call for reinforcements. Sniper rifles have different characteristics, such as the range of the weapon, the zoom ability of the scope, stability and others, which, combined with the various types of bullets, make the act of shooting the consequence of a series of choices interesting and not just a gesto mechanical. Furthermore, having to consider the distance to the target and the direction and strength of the wind before pulling the trigger, makes single kills little challenges every time. Particular feats of skill, such as being able to hit enemies on the head, are underlined by killcams, which reminded us a bit of those of the Sniper Elite series, albeit less brutal. Artificial intelligence The biggest problem of Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts is the artificial intelligence of the enemies, which reacts extremely slowly to any threat. Incidentally: if you decide to buy the game, immediately select the third (of three) difficulty level, because the first two offer a really poor challenge. The problem is not only that the enemies struggle to notice our presence, but also their reaction, which is not adequate to the threat. For example, we have repeatedly been caught clearing areas from a distance. One would think that opponents under attack by a sniper are looking for adequate cover, perhaps by entering the available buildings, or trying to flush out the threat. Unfortunately, our adversaries often go behind cover that cover little, they almost never venture out in search of us and generally put up little resistance, limiting themselves to launching drones to look for us... drones that run out or are destroyed by our shots, without no one blinks an eye, or blocked by some mysterious force of nature, read bug. To make things easier, the alert time also takes care of it, which lasts very little: when you are discovered, just look for shelter and wait for a few seconds for everything to calm down and for the enemies it will be as if no one had ever shot at them. Fortunately things get more complicated if you choose a more stealthy approach and if you play on the maximum difficulty level, which effectively mitigates the reported deficiencies. In short, the challenge in a certain sense must be built, extricating oneself from the choices that make the game accessible to everyone. Graphics From a technical point of view, Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts is a good title, obviously in relation to its production level (it was developed by a team of thirty-five people). Don't expect miracles, but the CryEngine has been exploited well to create very beautiful landscapes, whether they are snowy, urban or green areas. Instead, the interiors are anonymous and generic (after all, we are talking about military outposts and bases... one could not expect much more) while weapons and enemies are well modeled, as are the vehicles (tanks, helicopters, motorcycles and others, unfortunately not usable). The aforementioned killcams are spectacular and brutal, with the screen starting to rotate and the slow motion that underlines the path of the bullet to the enemy's head. Sure, they have something fetishistic, but basically we're talking about a military-themed game, so it's not bad. The activation effect of the mask is also interesting, with the various points of interest being underlined in a harmonious and not at all annoying way, always resulting clear. And in terms of cleanliness and stability? Honestly, our test was plagued by a few too many crashes, but the hope is that problems like this will be solved with the classic first-day patch or with immediate post-launch updates. In the meantime, it is right to point out the problem, being however aware that over time it could easily return. After all, we have seen worse from this point of view. Finally, speaking of replayability, consider that the maps must be played several times if you want to bring home all the objectives. Difficult to talk about longevity, given that having tried the maps at least twice, it is difficult to give precise timing. Let's say that, all inclusive, it can last even more than fifteen hours. However, a lot depends on how you play it. Considering that it is sold at a more than reasonable price ( 29.99) you can stay with it.", "date": "2019-11-21", "grade": "7.8"}
