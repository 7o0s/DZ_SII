{"name": "Fantasia portatile", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/72278-littlebigplanet-fantasia-portatile.html", "text": "Tested version: PSPT Sometimes it happens that the portable reductions of more or less famous games end up keeping only the title of the original product, without however sharing its qualities. This is not the case with LittleBigPlanet, which on PSP is still the platformer / editor that conquered so many people on PlayStation 3. We find our little Sackboy again (even smaller than usual, of course!), we move him using the analog stick of the portable console Sony and we realize that not only the feeling of the game has remained unchanged, but that some of the problems that afflicted the jewel of Media Molecule in its original incarnation have even been resolved. The stages still have two distinct depth planes, but moving from one to the other has become much simpler and more intuitive, just by acting on the analog stick. Since the PSP does not have an accelerometer, our Sackboy's mood must be changed by pressing the four directions of the d-pad (to obtain a happy, sad, angry or fearful appearance), which prevents us from walking around as if there were the cat died when maybe we play lying on the sofa, holding the controller vertically. It must also be said that never as in this case has the implementation of moods been purely accessory given the lack of online multiplayer, which on PS3 offered controversial experiences depending on the quality of the connection (also producing episodes on the edge of reality as far as regards the lag) and that the developers could not keep in this version for technical reasons. It takes beastly physics While it's true that LittleBigPlanet is one of those titles that you either love or hate, it's impossible to ignore the huge amount of ideas that form its backbone or that merely serve as a nice side dish. Firstly, the phase played does not correspond to what could be defined as a classic platformer, given the cumbersome presence of a physical environment that determines the behavior of all objects on the screen, including Sackboy. Perhaps it will make you turn up your nose to see that the management of the jump has not changed by an iota, therefore you have to make a long or short press of the X button to obtain a different result. The problem is that even on PSP, jumping while close to any object becomes very difficult and quickly turns into frustration when we have to perform the maneuver in the shortest possible time. To move better, our Sackboy must therefore avoid getting too close to the things around him, and this is a rule that must be learned immediately to enjoy the many advantages of the game. Exploration is once again a strongly encouraged factor, so much so that any stage hardly reveals all its secrets on the first ~round~ and requires repeated attempts, as well as perhaps the acquisition of new stickers to be used as ~switches~ to access this or that hidden area. The puzzles are many, all different and generally based on different assumptions: this is a bit of the flagship of LBP, one of the aspects that most make us reflect on the passion and commitment lavished during development. Around the small big world Speaking of passion and commitment, one cannot fail to mention the presence of thirty completely new stages, specially designed for the PSP version of the game. The former, as per tradition, almost take on the contours of a tutorial but quickly give way to more complex and multifaceted situations, with a level of challenge that rises especially when you have to collide with a boss. For example, in the levels with an ~oriental~ background we find ourselves facing a huge fire-breathing dragon, and we can only stop its advance by hitting its mouth using a cannon that shoots corks. The trajectory of the bullets, however, is far from predictable and the cannon oscillates continuously, so to hit the target you need to calculate times and distances very well. As in the PlayStation 3 version, the stages are divided into ~thematic areas~ and do not share the same structure, on the contrary, the search for ever-changing situations, capable of maintaining a certain variety of the action, is clearly noticeable. In the event that our Sackboy ends up in an area from which it is impossible to get out, we can call the faithful Popit and make the character ~burst~ to start over from the last checkpoint. It is clear that this is just one of the many things that the Popit allows us to do: we can at any time collect stickers around, move them to solve puzzles or for a simple whim, as well as access an editor for customizing the Sackboy that enriches man mfull of new elements (the numerous ~bubbles~ that we collect around the stages are for something, right?) and it amazes for the speed of loading as well as for the practicality of the interface. The whole world is country LittleBigPlanet for PSP does not give up the very important level editor, which indeed comes in dazzling form and offers all the possibilities that distinguish the original editor for PlayStation 3. The interface used for building the stages has not changed one iota, therefore it is simple and immediate: it only takes a few minutes to be operational, and in any case the dear old voice guide will follow us with observations and suggestions. Going from a modest achievement to a small design masterpiece will only be a matter of practice and commitment. Our creations are saved on Memory Stick and are placed visually in the craters of a small moon that orbits between the stages and the starting station of our Sackboy, which can also be customized as desired (but not like on PS3). The game allows us to upload the levels we've created to PSN, as well as download those made available by the large community of PSP owners: the download is quick and this feature guarantees hours and hours of extra gameplay. Crazy stuffed toy Translating the LBP graphics onto the PSP screen must not have been an easy undertaking, on the contrary it was probably a real challenge for the guys at Studio Cambridge, who also from this point of view have shown great respect for the work of Media Molecule. Although having to give up most of the light effects, the definition of the textures and an exaggerated number of polygons, in fact, the game stands as one of the most visually convincing products that have been seen on the PlayStation Portable. The discussion certainly revolves around the bizarre and particular graphic style, the choice of colors and the characteristics of the likeable protagonist, therefore it is true that having redesigned all the stages it was possible to adapt their contours to the characteristics of the machine. It is also true, however, that moving a certain number of objects within such a well-kept physical environment, managing the ~stickers~ in such a casual way, masking as much as possible the proverbial low definition of the textures on the PSP and maintaining in any case an always fluid and stable frame rate is no small thing. For that, hats off. And the sound? Also in that case we tried to keep the similarities with the PlayStation 3 version as much as possible, with a series of catchy and original songs (perhaps a little repetitive from time to time) that surround the usual, excellent interpretation by Alberto Olivero in the role of narrator.", "date": "2009-11-20", "grade": "8.5"}
