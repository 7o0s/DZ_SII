{"name": "FIFA Manager 09 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-manager-09-recensione.html", "text": "Italy is a wonderful country, isn't it? A country in which everyone, without distinction, at least once every two years rediscovers technical commissioners. The passion for football, in these parts, is a bit like religion: everyone lives it as they want. There are those who break their knee ligaments on a concrete pitch to emulate their idols, those who limit themselves to exalting themselves in front of the television... perhaps with the joypad in hand, for a choral action that resulted in a goal to see and review in slow motion. Well, that of the gamer who is passionate about football is a bizarre and widespread species: calm and calm people who explode in unpronounceable epithets if they score a goal on the break. It is clear that there are different levels of persistence in this sense, and it is precisely to satisfy the irreducible that products such as FIFA Manager were born, managerial ones that allow us to play the role of the coach of any team to understand what it feels like to make the decisions that matter... and pay the consequences. when starting a new career you will be asked what role exactly you want to fill The coach in the ball FIFA Manager 09 offers a single game mode, which however can be customized in various ways and at various levels to literally transform it into a more or less substantial and detailed experience. In order to put the player at ease, the developers have included the possibility of uploading one's own photo (in BMP format, large 160x160 pixels) instead of the default ones, as well as completely replacing the original soundtrack with a music album by to our liking: just load some MP3s into the appropriate folder so that the songs of our favorite group can make the atmosphere more relaxed and friendly. In fact, if you are a beginner in the world of football management, the myriad of options present could even scare you: you will not have to simply deal with team training and formation to be put on the field on Sunday; rather, you will have to move on various levels and deal with an almost infinite series of variables and situations that may require your intervention. It is no coincidence that when starting a new career you will be asked which role exactly you want to cover: a ~simple~ coach or something more? Do you want to take care of managing a club and the national team at the same time? Do you want to be the one to observe the young players of spring to identify any talents to bring to the first team? Do you want to negotiate contracts directly? Do you take care of sponsorships and merchandising? Manage the relationship with the fans and hire the most suitable personnel for the various tasks (masseur, doctor, lawyer...)? Establish the budget to be allocated to the various sectors and possibly expand the sports facilities available to the club? You can really do all these things... without forgetting your personal profile, perhaps inserting family photos and taking care of relations with the press and with your employer. ~Mr. President, would you like to play a round of golf?~ Holly trains by shooting the lines... Once the team we want to train has been selected and our range of action determined, we will start with a short pre-season phase in which we retire, friendlies are played and we can get a first idea of what works and what should be better modified. The seasonal objectives are also established, which clearly change according to the club's coat of arms: if we sit on the bench of a big one, we will necessarily have to aim for the Scudetto and the final stages of the Champions League; if, on the other hand, we train a small team, perhaps from Serie B, it will already be a lot to reach mid-table by the end of the championship. Our promises, here, will be accepted by the players and fans with more or less enthusiasm: if we shoot them big we will perhaps be able to enjoy a euphoric environment for some time, only to see our convictions collapse if things go wrong. The psychological component in FIFA Manager 09 plays a very important role, there is no doubt: if a member of the team ~rows against~ in some way, perhaps by making controversial statements to the press, the whole locker room will be affected and the result will be seen then on the pitch, perhaps in a delicate phase of the season. In certain cases we will be able to intervene, for example by imposing fines or other types of punishment, but in general we will have to try to maintain a good dialogue with the kids, encouraging them even individually and giving a break to whoever comes to ask. So many variables and we haven't gotten to analyzing training management yet, huh? Luckily we won't have to controlcheck all these parameters every time: the game control panel will inform us periodically, through reports in the form of emails, of situations that require our attention. The same interface will allow us to have a detailed overview of the team: the starting line-up, the form applied, the reserves and all the extra information concerning the players (injuries, fatigue, call-ups for the various national teams...). Making changes is extremely simple: the form can be changed ~on the fly~, by dragging the indicators to move positions, and in the same way players can be replaced and the bench filled. It is also possible to adjust the strategy for each individual element of the team, determining (among other things) the hardness of the interventions, the type of movement without the ball and the general approach to the match. Reverse shot We have fine-tuned the team down to the smallest detail, promised rich prizes and cotillions to the center forward and spurred the defense on to keep out even a breath of wind. But how will all this be translated into concrete results? Also in this case we can decide: to know only the final result of the match, to see it updated as if we were watching a Teletext page, to follow the main actions through a mere text description or to enjoy the match in 3D. Let's say right away that the last option is the most valid, from all points of view: only by seeing the players in action will we be able to understand how they behave and how much they make, replace them if necessary and apply real-time changes to the module and strategy. What's more, FIFA Manager 09 also allows us to participate in the action in first person, controlling one of our players in a very similar way to what happens for ~normal~ FIFA (control via joypad is also supported, by the way). Given the modest minimum requirements of the EA Sports manager, it is clear that we cannot expect graphics to match the latest football games released for PC and consoles, however the visual rendering (at maximum resolution, with effects activated and a little antialiasing) is anything but contemptible, so much so that to obtain a certain fluidity it is still necessary to have at least a mid-range video card. If you choose to limit yourself to being a spectator, you can control the scrolling speed of the action in various ways: increasing it all the time, viewing only the most important actions or slowing it down automatically when players are close to the penalty area. Once the game has started, unfortunately, it is not possible in any way to finish it on the fly: going out, the result is recalculated and there is the risk of having bitter surprises. Technical realization The polygonal models of the players are typical of FIFA: the resemblance to the real counterparts is often rather limited, in particular as regards the proportions (see the image with Vieira, Stankovic and Cambiasso together), and some flaws can be noted in the shots closer together. However, it must be said that great strides have been made on the animation front, and the ~curtains~ seen after the goals or when the game ends are particularly surprising, with the players slapping each other on the back and they walk away as a group as if they possess some kind of alien-style collective consciousness. Also a small novelty is the presence of shots ~from below~, which in a rather unprecedented way show the sky above the stadium and perhaps an urban cross-section of the city that hosts it. The only drawback, albeit negligible, is the two-dimensional audience. As far as the sound is concerned, as mentioned, it is possible to replace the music with MP3s of one's liking: an idea that is anything but bad, given the general flatness of the songs present. The commentary is much improved compared to the 2008 edition, and this year was entrusted to Fabio Caressa and Beppe Bergomi. However, one cannot be enthusiastic about it: the quality of the samples fluctuates, as well as the volume of the individual sentences pronounced by the commentators, so much so that at times it seems like listening to a weird collage. The variety of observations is generally good, but the degree of participation and enthusiasm on Bergomi's side is at an all-time low: often there is the clear impression that he is reading a piece of paper that he did not write in his own hand, they are so convoluted and ~ fake~ certain interventions. The game includes the inevitable editor, quite powerful and complete, to create players, teams, competitions and even stadiums from scratch. FIFA Manager 09 presents itself as a very well-finished and complete product, certainly better than the 2008 edition. It is possible to gprepare the team in every aspect, literally, and at the same time we are given the ability to determine the degree of realism and depth of experience: do we want to limit ourselves to training or do we want to be able to have our say on contracts, training, about the spring, about the staff? The possibilities are practically endless, and in fact satisfy the most demanding players as well as those most eager to try what is the great novelty of the EA Sports product, or rather the 3D simulation with the possibility of participating directly in the action. The interface is well done and has the advantage of always being easily readable, even if perhaps it could have been made a little more ~agile~ and less distracting. The 3D simulation is currently the best that the genre can offer, drawing heavily from FIFA as regards models and animations. It's probably no coincidence that FIFA Manager's improvements have come hand in hand with those of Electronic Arts' ~standard~ football series, the fact is that this year the battle for dominance within the football management genre will be really fought .
