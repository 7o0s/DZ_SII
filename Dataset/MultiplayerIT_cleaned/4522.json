Unable to write, he decides to accept assignments from a mysterious criminal boss who asks him to enter six books, as a biblionaut, to recover powerful and mysterious objects. The narrative premises underlying the latest DO MY BEST video game, published by tinyBuild on old and new generation PlayStation and Xbox platforms and PC (the latter is the version we tested), are fascinating to say the least, and hold up admirably the adventure for its entire duration. Framed in the genre of narrative adventure, The Bookwalker: Thief of Tales, however, also presents turn-based combat, in the long run all too simple and not unforgettable, and proves to be somewhat repetitive in the construction of objects and in the ways in which the scenarios are explored, all different from each other. Despite these defects, overall, it is an excellent product and capable of keeping the player's attention high until the end, for all the approximately six hours necessary to complete Etienne's bookish odyssey. We tell you about the adventures of the biblionaut Etienne Quist in our review of The Bookwalker: Thief of Tales. Six novels, six different worlds To undertake each assignment, Etienne will have to open a suitcase that he will find outside the door of his apartment We were saying that the writer Etienne Quist is unable to continue his brilliant literary career due to the handcuffs imposed on him by the editorial police: throughout the story, we will discover more about Etienne and his crime, but unfortunately the general context of the fantasy world in which The Bookwalker: Thief of Tales is set is never fully clarified. And it's a shame, because the little that can be seen of the narrative frame of the adventure seems really very interesting: it seems to be a dystopian and totalitarian world, in which the writers are endowed with powers beyond any imagination, and the limit between reality and fiction can be blurred until it disappears. The revocation of the writer's license implies the removal from the trade of Etienne's books. Desperate, the protagonist would like to at least get rid of the cumbersome handcuffs that prevent him from writing: that's why he accepts the dangerous assignments that will lead him in six different novels, flanked by Roderick, a mysterious helper enclosed in a small cage. Roderick can be used to get advice on how to proceed, should the player ever find himself in difficulty: however, overall the exploration and solving of the puzzles in The Bookwalker: Thief of Tales prove to be a rather linear and well-structured enterprise from a logical point of view, and there is no need for extra advice. The downside is that, after a few hours, the plots of DO MY BEST are clearly visible and a certain sense of repetitiveness occurs. The alternation of scenarios, however, manages to keep the player on his toes, with an excellent pace (each book can be completed in about an hour) and with a fair differentiation between the situations presented. There are some real naiveties: in some cases, Etienne knows things he shouldn't (yet) know, because he hasn't interacted with a certain object or learned the information from a character present in the scenario; moreover, a simple question could question the very foundations of the adventure: why on earth Etienne Quiest doesn't read in advance the books that are delivered to him, in such a way as to be aware of the developments of the adventure and the risks he will find inside of the various novels? Apart from these perplexities, the plot presents some fascinating ideas and a pleasant and surprising final twist, but some characters - first of all the enigmatic Amanda - would perhaps have deserved further study. On and off pages In the real world you have a first-person perspective, and you can find essential items to continue the adventures within the six novels Etienne's adventures are played out in the alternation between reality and fiction. For example, in the introductory setting (of which a demo is available), the novel ~One Drop of Infinity~ by Jonathan Bowers, there are crumbling walls that could be knocked down with a well-aimed sledgehammer. The protagonist therefore has the idea of asking the neighbor to lend him the necessary tool: he returns to Etienne's squalid condominium, goes and knocks on the door of the aforementioned neighbor, obtains the club and plunges inside again of the book, thus managing to solve cThe problem of the wall is not the hard way. It is a very interesting mechanic, even if exploited in few occasions (about once for each book explored). For the rest, the various ~rooms~ of which each setting is composed are explored in succession - represented in an isometric perspective - and one is amazed by the artistic mastery of DO MY BEST, capable of enclosing the spirit of each in magnificent dioramas represented novel. Prisons, deserts, power plants and schools of magic in decay are all well characterized and full of life, making it very pleasant to explore in search of key objects and components to build crowbars, lock picks and bolt cutters, in such a way as to be able to solve puzzles (generally pretty simple) and find extra items to help us in combat. Unfortunately, the aforementioned tools tend to repeat themselves, just as the solutions to be adopted to continue are repeated, but the all in all reduced duration of The Bookwalker: Thief of Tales allows you not to excessively accuse a sense of boredom that could have occurred in a few hours in more adventurous. Fortunately, it is the very alternation of scenarios that dominates, thanks to interesting dialogues with the characters present in the six novels explored by the biblionaut. The dialogues are, in principle, interesting and well written, and the novels re-read famous myths and literary worlds in an often interesting and stimulating way The weak point of the play structure created by DO MY BEST are undoubtedly the fights. Divided into rounds, the indication of the move that it will carry out in the next round is visible above each enemy: this gives excellent strategic possibilities, but simplifies the approach to the clashes too much. The idea of unlocking skills after the ~resolution~ of each book is excellent; unfortunately, however, the clashes are all too simplified and repetitive, devoid of flashes and played on the alternation of moves depending on the availability (and the relative expenditure) of living ink, an essential resource for every good biblionaut. You initially have only three moves: Squarcio, a powerful attack aimed at a single enemy, Assimilate, a weak attack that however allows you to absorb a large amount of ink from the opponent, and, finally, Stun, a move with a high consumption of ink that allows you to block the next action of all enemies. Overall, the fights are too simple, and the design of the enemies fails to stand out in the context of the work. If the artistic direction has peaks of excellence in the visual sector, the same cannot be said for the sound: The Bookwalker: Thief of Tales offers an accompaniment that is certainly functional, but far from unforgettable, and we found the soundtrack too resigned and in the background. We recommend using headphones to better experience the sound effects, often rather soft and non-intrusive, which ~color~ the gaming experience. The dubbing of the dialogues is absent, while there is a translation of the same in Italian: net of some slips and ingenuity, we found it of fair quality. We point out an impeccable technical sector: no bugs, system crashes or glitches have marred our adventure, which went as smooth as oil.", "date": "2023-06-21", "grade": "7.5"}
