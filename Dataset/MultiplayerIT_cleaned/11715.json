{"name": "Blades & Magic", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/blades-magic.html", "text": "Developed on the basis of the renowned Abyss Engine, Blades & Magic presents itself as an RPG equipped with all the trappings of the case: turn-based combat, city exploration, buying and selling of weapons and items, experience points and so on. But the main reason of interest in Fishlabs production (and for which many enthusiasts have been waiting for it for a long time) lies in its apparently dazzling 3D graphics, in fact the exclusive prerogative of the most powerful terminals. And even in this case, Blades & Magic does not prove to be particularly generous in the provision of polygons, relegating them only to the combat phases and to the cutscenes that occasionally intervene to illustrate the plot that forms the background to the action. The most substantial part of the playful experience, i.e. the exploration of the map, is instead proposed through a simple 2D bird's eye view: most of the time is therefore spent within a section that is graphically quite dull and not very exciting also from a playful point of view. In fact, one moves through pre-established points, and interactions with the scenario (for example visiting a city or scouring a dungeon) are liquidated through very banal menus. Not exactly the best for an RPG as ambitious as Blades & Magic, which however recovers some ground during the fights: Here the graphic opulence is there: the characters on the screen enjoy a good number of polygons and a fair level of definition, and the animations are noteworthy. Even from a gameplay point of view, things improve compared to the situation described a few lines above: the turn-based system has been created with due care, with the user who can easily choose between the classic possibilities of physical or magical attack and the use of an object. Too bad that the fights represent an all in all minimal percentage of the entire adventure, which otherwise turns out to be rather lacking in emotions, also the victim of a certainly not original storyline and an English translation that leaves much to be desired. PRO Full-bodied adventure Fun fights Great 3D graphics... AGAINST ...but only on some mobile phones Bare-bone exploration Not particularly compelling", "date": "2007-12-20", "grade": "S.V."}
