{"name": "Ms. Splosion Man", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/91259-ms-splosion-man-questa-ragazza-e-una-bomba.html", "text": "Twisted Pixel is a small independent American team, made up of about ten people and founded in 2006; despite such a short career behind them and with evidently limited resources, the group has managed to make itself known and impose its own personal and rather unique style, achieved through a handful of games distributed on digital delivery channels. The Maw, 'Splosion Man and Comic Jumper are certainly imperfect products, but at the same time with great quality and made with enormous passion. While waiting for the retail debut with that The Gunstringer which promises to take full advantage of the Kinect peripheral, Twisted Pixel has chosen to devote itself to the creation of a sequel for the first time, with nothing short of explosive results. Who says woman says damage Ms. Splosion Man is in fact predictably the sequel to 'Splosion Man, a puzzle/platformer dated 2009 which met with great success among critics and the public. The plot is very light and purely sideline: just as the capture of the protagonist of the first chapter was being celebrated in the Big Science laboratories, a small accident caused by the reckless and relapsing scientists gives life to the new shocking pink heroine. Aesthetic differences aside, Ms. Splosion Man behaves and controls exactly like her companion; the left analog stick delegated to the movements, and the pressure of a key to cause the explosion which is a fundamental element of the gameplay. A maximum of three explosions can be performed in a row, after which it is necessary to recharge by walking normally, sliding on a wall or thanks to special explosive barrels. A very simple and immediate system, which however must not mislead; because Ms. Splosion Man is a difficult game, destined to test even those who have several years of experience behind it with the pad in hand. We must not be deceived by the first stages, intended to introduce the elements of the gameplay in a rather bland way; soon things get complicated, and the trial and error component becomes customary. Dying several times, even dozens, before being able to overcome a passage is the inevitable fate of anyone who tries his hand at the latest Twisted Pixel effort; also in this aspect there is absolute continuity with the previous chapter, but possibly with a further step upwards. As a result it's pretty obvious that Ms. Splosion Man is a frustrating game. At this point of the reading, if what has just been described does not seem to meet your videogame tastes, our advice is to forget any purchase hypothesis; beyond the numerical vote at the bottom of the page, it must be very clear that the title of the American team is destined not to accept compromises: either you love it or you hate it, and more simply you can deal with it or not. And in fact, if instead the constant and continuous challenge is a concept that tickles you, and if you are willing to spit blood in order to reach the final goal, you will probably find a sort of wonderful ecstasy in Ms. Splosion Man. Because Twisted Pixel's work is truly an excellent product, undoubtedly among the best that have appeared on XBLA in recent months. The sense of gratification and achievement at the end of each level is truly tangible and concrete, and worth every single drop of sweat poured. Xbox 360 goals The ~cruelty~ of Ms. Splosion Man is also expressed in the objectives, with the usual 200 points available; a slice, roughly half of them, can be reached quite easily by progressing until the end of the adventure. But the other half requires tests of skill and patience that only the most heroic virtuosi of the pad will be able to achieve, including replaying levels in the almost impossible ~hardcore~ mode. Kapow! The reason for the success of Ms. Splosion Man is fundamentally linked to the level design, whose goodness in fact constitutes the main evolution compared to the predecessor; tackling the 50 stages (+ another 50 for the multiplayer, completely different) is equivalent to taking a roller coaster ride with continuous accelerations, changes of pace, jumps, explosions, and so on. But in addition to the pace, it is precisely how the stages have been studied that denotes the quality of the American team in this respect; while relying on a fairly limited number of elements, these are continuously shaped and mixed, offering a variety such as to always keep the interest in the game very high as well as the desire to face the next level, even if perhaps you have just come out exhausted from the previous one. And the alternation between purely action sections that require reflexes and millimeter precision, with other slower and more reflective ones, linked to puzzles, is also appreciableenvironmental switches based on switches that require the use of gray matter. For those who do not find the simple gratification of reaching the finish line sufficient, there is also the possibility of repeating the levels to improve one's times by comparing the performance with the ghost of the previous attempt; or, again, download the ghosts of the best online players to get to the top of the leaderboard. And then there's the multiplayer, which isn't the usual addition just to lengthen the broth; here we are talking about a separate mode practically of equal dignity compared to the single component, with 50 exclusive levels specially created to be faced by up to 4 players, locally or online, and with decidedly intriguing cooperative gameplay solutions. As for the technical component, Ms. Splosion Man is a very pleasant game to watch, provided of course that you appreciate the artistic style that unites the Twisted Pixel titles. Without a doubt there is more variety than in the first episode, as well as the detail and quantity of elements on screen; in reality the only negative aspect we have encountered is linked to the color palette, which on some occasions does not offer a sufficient visual detachment between backgrounds and protagonist reaching the limit situations of making the latter lose sight of for a few fatal moments. Nothing too serious actually, but maybe something more could have been done to avoid the problem. The sound, on the other hand, is caricatural and amusing, above all for the continuous crazy chatter of Ms. Splosion Man, who never misses an opportunity to hum songs and say nonsense in the most total disregard.", "date": "2011-07-21", "grade": "8.8"}
