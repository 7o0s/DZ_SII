{"name": "VirtuaVerse", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/virtuaverse-recensione.html", "text": "The VirtuaVerse review allows us to gladly return once again to the cyberpunk imaginary, a few weeks after getting acquainted with Cloudpunk. As we said then, even if everyone's eyes are focused on Cyberpunk 2077 there is always plenty of space to satisfy lovers of neon and cities perpetually wet by rain. Especially if a graphic adventure of those intending to pay homage to the golden times of this genre that has gone out of fashion arrives to occupy it. In fact, Theta Division's effort presents itself as a point and click adventure entirely inspired by those of the era in which Monkey Island and its ilk were all the rage. been forgotten, indeed there are many nostalgics who would make false cards to see titles like those churned out over two decades ago by LucasArts come back into vogue. It is precisely the thrust of nostalgia combined with an evident passion for information technology that characterizes the setting of VirtuaVerse, seasoned with a dose of cyberpunk sauce. After spending more than ten hours between the AVR and the real world, here's our verdict. The plot: a man disconnected and left in the lurch VirtuaVerse takes us to a future not far from now, in which an artificial intelligence called Xenon has managed to get the better of all its other similar ones, binding the existence of the entire society to itself. Thanks to a chip implanted under the skin, people can in fact live perpetually connected to virtual reality as in a kind of Matrix, from which there are now few individuals who choose to marginalize themselves in order to continue living in the real world. One of these is Nathan, the protagonist of the game we know on the occasion of a rude awakening. In addition to realizing that his girlfriend Jay seems to have disappeared into thin air, Nathan gets out of bed and breaks the AVR glasses needed to connect to the aforementioned virtual reality, thus remaining confined outside the network. His first steps awake will therefore be dictated by the need to repair the technological device, subsequently trying to understand what happened to Jay and why she secretly disappeared. Together with Nathan we will realize that behind all this lies more than than we could imagine, taking us to the edge of the world to try to save other human beings after having to deal with bloody rival hacker groups, virtual beings similar to gods and many elements related to the world of information technology and its culture. A mix that in terms of setting works especially in the initial stages, thanks to the work done by Vittorio D'Amore (aka Master Boot Record), Alessio Cosenza (Elder0010) and Ralph Meidl (Valenberg), the three people who hide behind the name Theta Division. After a few hours we must say that the thrust of VirtuaVerse fades a bit, in particular after having put the player in front of some serious events caused by Nathan, to which, however, the people around him inexplicably seem not to give particular weight. Furthermore, over time the change of setting leads cyberpunk to be set aside a bit, even if technology and information technology continue to be the driving force between hardware cemeteries and DDoS attacks to be launched. As Amiga lovers, our favorite moment was the one in which Nathan finds himself operating a ~Lorraine 500~, but there are so many references to the past with which to tinker, including some puzzles to be solved using ASCII characters.First to move on to the gameplay, a little note on the characters. Let's start with the protagonist, in whom we must say that we had a hard time fully identifying ourselves, perhaps due to the choice to always portray him with a hood raised over his head without ever showing us his face. In general, the feeling is that in terms of characterization, perhaps a little more could have been done. Alternating between serious and joking tones, VirtuaVerse works above all in the second case, that is when it takes itself less seriously: we can say that we laughed heartily during some exchanges between Nathan and the other individuals with whom he is forced to deal . The gameplay: old school, even too much? The gameplay of VirtuaVerse is exactly what you can expect from an old point and click graphic adventure, in which you move the protagonist around the screen thanks to a cross-shaped mouse cursor. The other elements concern the inevitable inventory and a kind of electronic diary in which Nathan keeps track of his current objective. After a few minutes spent wandering between Nathan's apartment and the city, one realizes that VirtuaVerseit's really very challenging, to the point that those less used to banging their heads for long minutes on a puzzle could even give up under the blows of frustration. While I am among those who appreciate the ~hard~ nature of the old school honored by VirtuaVerse, we must say that in some cases the complexity of the puzzles has left us a bit perplexed. In the first place, the logic of some solutions seemed to us at times really far from what we had come to think up to that moment, thanks to a certain freedom of collection of objects and of movement between places which leads the player to an inevitable backtracking to succeed to move forward. Secondly, on the contrary, we happened to already know how to move forward, unfortunately before Nathan even knew it. The problem was related to a failure to display a particular object, as a result of which the protagonist ~understood~ how to use an element of the surrounding environment. Too bad the object was quite hidden, thus forcing us to recurring pixel hunting also in other phases during the adventure. Compared to the past, it is obviously now possible to go and look for guides already present on the Internet, but before approaching this game it is still good to keep in mind what you are getting into. The idea of being able to switch from the real world to the one shown by the viewer We particularly liked AVR, above all for its function which is not an end in itself but which in some cases proves to be necessary to solve the enigma before us. The advice we give you is to be very careful about Nathan's descriptive passages or what is said by the characters, since they often and willingly offer details to refer to in order to be able to continue. Graphics and sound: pixel art and music at the top Just as the gameplay is linked to the old school of graphic adventures, also from a technical point of view VirtuaVerse is linked to the past of this genre. The pixel art settings are really full of details to admire, making the whole gaming experience a joy for the eyes of those who have been orphaned by LucasArts adventures. The same goes for the cleanliness with which VirtuaVerse presents itself: during the whole adventure we did not encounter a single bug, also confirming from this point of view the commitment made by Theta Division to set up a game as refined as possible. the same enthusiasm with which the graphics are welcomed can also be dedicated to the soundtrack created by Master Boot Record, in the company of which we find ourselves spending all the time spent with VirtuaVerse. The chiptune melodies contribute perfectly to taking us back about thirty years, when the demos (in VirtuaVerse we also find them!) ran on our Amiga 500 marveling us with their special effects. Finally, we point out a perfect translation into Italian, which makes the gaming experience even for those who don't know the English language.", "date": "2020-05-26", "grade": "7.8"}
