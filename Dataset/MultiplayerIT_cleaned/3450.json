{"name": "Indivisible", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/indivisible-nostra-recensione.html", "text": "We've sung Lab Zero Games' praises extensively before; on the other hand, when the very first title created by your software house is a pearl of the caliber of Skullgirls, every other project of yours automatically appears on the radar of fans, ready to be stripped and evaluated. A lot of attention is undoubtedly a good thing in the very populous world of independent developers, for heaven's sake, but at the same time having many lights pointed at you means having to meet growing expectations, to confirm your talent and maintain a stable fanbase. Even among the smaller teams, therefore, many tend to stabilize, perhaps focusing on genres in which they are particularly well versed or projects closely related to their most successful brands... Lab Zero, on the other hand, have consciously chosen to overturn everything, and to throw themselves into a video game that is enormously more ambitious than their first child: a strange creature named Indivisible whose review you are reading. If you feel the need to quantify how far these skilled programmers have raised the bar, consider that when we talk about Indivisible we are going to describe a curious mix between metroidvania, pure platformer and JRPG, which also dares to mix combat mechanics taken in largely from that classic Valkyrie Profile. In short, not exactly an easy-to-conceive job, in order to complete which Lab Zero first had to rely on Kickstarter (with considerable success, however) and later on the support of 505 Games (a particularly skilled publisher when it comes to finding promising projects of this type). We, therefore, were more curious than ever to analyze this possible leap in quality, in the hope of seeing a confirmation of all the talents already fielded with Skullgirls. Fortunately, this confirmation has arrived, albeit accompanied by some ingenuity that demonstrate how the Californian house still needs to mature a little before really reaching its zenith. The palace of the mind The narrative premise of Indivisible initially seems trivial, however it immediately takes a rather strange turn, from which the writers have managed to come up with a storyline good enough to support the experience until the end. Oh God, we are certainly not in front of a masterpiece of writing and extravagance, but if nothing else - perhaps also in the awareness of having based themselves on some too much recycled clichs in RPGs - these guys have decided not to take themselves too seriously, peppering their game of humor, and focusing more on the characterization of the characters and their interactions than on the unfolding of the plot itself. Excellent choice, also because of the vibrant world that surrounds the events, and a mixture of quotationism and absurdity that adds flavor to everything. We particularly appreciated the protagonist, Ajna, due to the excellent management of her character growth, and for the writers' ability to make the most of her nature as a sixteen-year-old messy suddenly at the center of apocalyptic events. Also because the young woman almost immediately finds herself with a dead father and a burned village, only to later discover that she has the ability to ~trap~ people in her mind and rematerialize them in the event of battle. Not exactly an easy situation to handle, especially when the first victim of this curious power is your father's killer... From there the main campaign flows with a decent pace, and leads the young woman to create a sort of ~inner world club~ populated by colorful characters to say the least. And let's be clear, not all who transfer into Ajna's mind are perfectly characterized, but the work done on each one is still exceptional, as the skills of the artists of Lab Zero shine through more than ever from their incredible uniqueness. That wasn't enough, the absurd superpower of your young alter ego represents a perfect justification for the entire system on which the title is based, since, as written in the introduction, Indivisible recovers part of the mechanics of Valkyrie Profile - where each character of his team was tied to a single button on the pad - and he reworks them according to a more distinctly action gameplay, where a myriad of different warriors manage to coexist. And when we talk about ~myriad~ we mean that in this game there are over twenty playable characters, some of them completely optional. More mixed gameplay than ever before The main gem of Indivisible's moneyed hybrid chest is the combat system, in fact, which initially appears simplistic, but does not take long to show its many ramifications. The basics taken from Valkyriein fact, they initially allow you to perform a few attacks, which however increase over time and development, and are divided into three different moves available to each character (linked to the button they belong to within the group, and to the position of the directional stick). Once the maximum number of four fighters active at the same time has been reached, therefore, we are talking about twelve different moves that can be used against the various enemies. Of course, most are attacks that launch into the air or multiple blows, yet the Lab Zero wanted to give mechanical variety to every single choice, and waiting for you you will find fighters equipped with very specific techniques (some skilled in aerial combos, others capable of charging their own series of strikes with certain moves, and so on), supports specialized in healing or control of the terrain, and companions equipped with extremely powerful magic. Furthermore, in the case of magic, the game does not offer a menu like that of classic jrpg, but an energy bar called Iddhi Bar, which grows to offer each warrior some sort of ~super~, which can be loaded with a single piece of indicator or up to three. Based on the amount of Iddhi power used, a different effect is therefore obtained based on the character, which can be the simple enhancement of a finishing move, a large area cure, or even a spell capable of blocking enemy attacks for a while . In practice, after a few hours the synergies between Ajna and her companions become complex and the system takes off, reaching more than a few peaks also by virtue of a passable diversification of enemy skills. To all this is added a defensive system borrowed from fighting games - which allows you to perform perfect regenerating parries or dodge annoying holds, and is closely related to the consumption and obtaining of Iddhi - and we assure you that it is enough to give the pays off to many of the stocks on the market right now. When it comes to gameplay, Lab Zero can already count on a respectable historian, little else to say. Myopia of the third eye You will therefore understand our disappointment, once the game is completed, in finding that the major problems of Indivisible are linked precisely to the internal mathematics once a certain phase of the campaign has been reached, and to some heavy structural naiveties. The main designer is in fact Mike Zaimont, also known as Mike Z, and a more than well-known character in the competitive fighting game scene: from a similar frame list patient we expected a textbook level of balancing of the characters and a general design of impeccable battles, instead the title, even with all its qualities always in full view, undergoes a sort of ~break~ of the systems around two thirds of the adventure, due to an excessive strengthening of one's own group of ramshackle heroes at the expense of the enemies , which makes any confrontation trivial. Ok, the evolution of one's characters is not particularly quick and fast, and is largely based on an affinity datum between Ajna and the various fighters which improves the power of the attacks based on the experience gained (besides this it is possible to upgrade attack and defense in a sensitive way by finding stones called Ringsels hidden throughout the levels, but not very difficult to discover with a bit of healthy exploration); however, once you have obtained a valid number of these improvements and passed a specific event, all the enemies of the game will melt in a few seconds under your blows, completely canceling all the previously necessary tactics to defend themselves, bypass their resistances (divided only in magic absorption and physical damage decrease, but present), or even just break their defense. At that point the level of challenge will depend exclusively on the platform phases, which also reach considerable levels of brutality in certain points, due to a myriad of mechanics - from the Ducktales pogo stick to the ability to move in the air in multiple directions - to they are linked, and of a level design of increasing complexity, where sometimes understanding how to advance is almost a puzzle. Dyes and smudges By this we don't mean that the game becomes shoddy towards the end, and we underline this strongly: however, such balance jolts and sudden twists in design go together with some tedious backtracking, deriving from the obligation to shoot properly for all the maps even when your exploratory skills are limited and there are no valid shortcuts (you risk losing entire characters if you don't), and overall they demonstrate a certain inexperience in handling the genre, as well as a clear bit of haste in completingend stages of the game. There is no need to despair, because the team has already confirmed the arrival of a patch to rebalance the battles and warriors (some are markedly stronger than others), and we are convinced that they will be able to rebalance a large part of the situation, but the structural deficiencies linked to the excesses of the platform phases and to exploration they remain, and undermine the rhythm of a production which, with a little more criterion, would really have been a small masterpiece. On the other hand, we have no notes to make on the technical/artistic aspect of the project: Lab Zero, as I have already repeated ad infinitum, are masters of animation, and have given life to splendid two-dimensional characters, who move beautifully on the sharp backgrounds in 3D game. Then the choice to give these backgrounds a watercolor look that recalls that of certain jrpg known as the Tales of, and which goes well with the moving drawings and transitions in battle, was apt. On PC, in particular, Indivisible seemed to us well optimized and devoid of particular bugs, apart from the possibility of interrupting certain battles by making the enemies end up in chasms present on the playing field, clearly unintentional (also because the opponents do not die in that way, they simply come out of the battle state, and sometimes float in the void). Longevity is also good, given that we finished the campaign in over twenty hours, and that many will certainly take over thirty to reveal every secret of the game.", "date": "2019-10-07", "grade": "8.2"}
