{"name": "L'originalit al potere", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-path-recensione.html", "text": "At first you don't know what to do. You look at the boundary between the paved road and the dirt road and wonder the meaning of the writing that appeared on the screen. Stay on the trail? Let's try. Failure. It was obvious that it would end like this. Prohibitions must be violated, otherwise fairy tales will stop teaching. We look at what is around us. Ahead is the aforementioned path, while behind us is a city barely visible through the haze, and all around is a forest that looks bleak and menacing. The little girl chosen in the selection screen gestures, maybe we left her alone too long? All that remains is to enter the woods, leaving the path. At the beginning the forest is confusing and terrifying, thanks also to the superimposition of images on the screen that scratch perception, as in a contemporary work of art, trying to stimulate automatic mental associations rather than rational thoughts. We don't know where we're going and we let ourselves be carried away by the sounds, which evidently have no claim to realism, as if they came from a magic flute. After we run through the woods for a while, losing track of space and time, we see a light in the distance. We head in that direction. A playground in such a gloomy place? We explore it and try to get the little girl to interact with the elements that make it up. We actually don't even know what we're looking for, but that's not a problem. We are aware that we are faced with a mystery, but not in the traditional sense of the term. There's no way to penetrate it by shooting or using objects, there's no handhold that helps us understand. It almost seems to be in a non-place, a mental space rather than a physical one. No one tells us what to do, and we press on, in the throes of mounting anguish. What are we looking for? Kidnapped by unawareness Trying out the possible interactions we meet the wolf (after all, the main source of inspiration is Little Red Riding Hood). The wolf has a different shape depending on the chosen protagonist. A filmed sequence starts and the protagonist finds herself on the ground, in the rain, in front of her grandmother's house. It appears destroyed, with the bad weather underlining its state of mind, but one can only make it advance towards the entrance. Once inside the house, the point of view switches from the third to the first person, in a subjective sequence in which the player only has to press forward to navigate the rooms. There is nothing to do but observe the space in which we find ourselves, a dream space that has nothing objective about it. Magritte and some texts from the avant-gardes of the early 1900s come to mind. Are we inside memories? Maybe. At the end of the chapter (six in all, plus the epilogue) we find ourselves faced with a strange spectacle: a summary screen of what has been done in the game. You win if you get caught by the wolf. The initial impression is that of a clash with the context, but on reflection we are led to consider it a metalinguistic declaration: you are still inside a video game, read it as such and do not try to give in to the temptation to ennoble it by considering it something else, otherwise you would only hurt him. If desired, we can read the possibility of collecting the flowers scattered around the wood in the same way, like new Pac-Mans. Difficulty of criticism Talking about The Path is difficult because at one point there is a tree planted in a bed; how do you bend to language the sense of a tree planted in a bed (read this sentence in the broadest possible sense, please)? That is, the attempt can be made, but something gigantic would come out that we cannot afford. The main problem we have to face here is understanding how to judge it, but it's difficult because the work of Tale of Tales escapes in more than one sense the tools commonly used to evaluate a video game or, better, it doesn't care. It is not for nothing that during development there were no pompous press releases about some very advanced feature of the graphics engine and, just to give another example, it was always presented as ~a short horror game~. So even on longevity we are not there, in the sense that we are used to reading about ~long and engaging gaming experiences~ or ~more than a thousand hours of gameplay~. The word ~short~ used by some developers is new to the specialized press; at most we insiders use it when we find ourselves in hand what, according to press releases, was supposed to be an ~intense experience~ and which turned out to be just a trivial walk of four or five hours. With The Path we cannot play with contrast or assonance with the promessse initials, because precise promises have not been made. Indeed, the Tale of Tales aimed to explain the reasons for certain choices, rather than to self-celebrate the work they have done. The question therefore remains open: how to judge it? The issues addressed are different from those typical of video games, there are no good or bad, but there is only experience as such and growth, which includes sex, dreams and all the other elements that characterize human life. Furthermore there is getting lost, or the need to get lost in order to find (and accept) one's self. But these are inferred themes, given that there is no explanation to that effect. The Path lends itself to multiple readings and it is in this sense that it adapts to the player, leaving him great interpretative freedom. Setting limits would be wrong because they would risk limiting emotional involvement, drying up the overall experience. Comment We would have liked to give The Path a 10, as a mere provocation. But in the end we preferred to leave this judgment incomplete because The Path can only be understood and loved if one chooses to abandon a whole series of prejudices that have accumulated for years in the conception of the video game itself. It is not easily definable because its strong point is content, so if you are looking for hormonal fun it is better to look elsewhere. It is a highly experimental title and, as such, requires the right mental predisposition to be appreciated and experienced. It is not just a matter of taste, mind you, but above all of personal culture. This is why it makes little sense to give him a definite and definitive vote. It's the most ~beautiful~ video game ever made, but at the same time it's the least fun because it's also difficult to understand how to consider it a video game. The Path is different and it makes us proud of this, it does not pretend to join anything and does not ask for comparisons because it wants to represent a starting point, perhaps without a sequel, but still something new.Pro The forest The tree planted in the bed, of course Grandmother Against The wolf The path The flowers PC - System Requirements Minimum requirements Processor: Intel Pentium 4 2.0 GHz or equivalent RAM: 1GB Video Card: A recent Geforce or Radeon x6xxx with 256MB (does not support integrated graphics chips) DirectX: 9.0c or higher Hard Drive: 500MB Sound card: DirectX 9.0c compatible Test Configuration Processor: Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 RAM: 4 GB Video Card: GeForce 8800 GT Operating System: Windows Vista", "date": "2009-04-03", "grade": null}
