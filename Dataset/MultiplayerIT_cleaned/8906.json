Call of Duty represents the exception that proves the rule, from this point of view: born thanks to the work of Infinity Ward, the series has also passed without problems into the hands of Treyarch, who also assumed the responsibility of translating it on Wii since the third episode. It was December 2006 and Call of Duty 3 was part of the launch line-up of the Nintendo console. Among the various prerogatives of the game was that of demonstrating how precise and immediate the motion detection control system applied to the FPS genre could be: the Wii-mote had the task of managing the view (and therefore the viewfinder) through the integrated infrared pointer, while the Nunchuk analog stick was assigned to the movement of the character. Both controllers, however, were called upon to perform the necessary gestures during certain quick time events, an experiment that proved to be unfortunate due to the well-known difficulties with recognizing movements in depth. Beyond these problems and a technical sector strongly limited by the hardware, the experiment could be said to be successful and over the years has produced episodes of ever-increasing quality, capable of proposing the numbers and features of the modes also on Wii online, which has always been the workhorse of the Activision franchise. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 therefore comes to confirm the goodness of what has been done so far, although presenting itself in a confused way from a narrative point of view, given that Wii owners have never played Modern Warfare 2 and the story resumes its events directly. For a good part of the approximately six hours that make up the single player campaign we will play the role of Yuri, a former Spetsnaz determined to find and eliminate the Russian terrorist Vladimir Makarov, dividing ourselves between shootings, alternative sections aboard helicopters or in water, and more Still. The ~cinematic~ direction of the game once again plays a fundamental role, catapulting us into truly spectacular and engaging situations, but at the same time limiting our freedom to move differently from what is foreseen by the plot. With fins, rifle and goggles Last year the Wii version of Black Ops had introduced for the first time the possibility of selecting a traditional control system for the game instead of the Wii-mote / Nunchuk combination, which we mentioned at the beginning and which has always characterized strong way, all FPS developed for the Nintendo console. Modern Warfare 3 retains this feature and therefore allows us to set aside the infrared pointing in place of a more classic approach, holding the albeit mediocre Classic Controller and choosing from a series of layouts to find the configuration that best suits our needs. The one that comes close to the feeling obtainable on Xbox 360 and PS3 is the ~N0M4D Tactical~ configuration, the only one that allows us to aim and shoot with the equipped weapon by pressing the L and R backbones. Since the analog sticks of the Classic Controller cannot be pressed on their axis, you have to activate running by pressing the B button (the same one used to jump) and use the dagger by pressing the X button. This clearly makes it necessary to assign the weapon selection to the d-pad (by pressing down ): not really a practical solution when you're in the middle of a close-quarters firefight, but you can get used to it. The support and precision of the joypad certainly make the gaming experience less ~physical~ and engaging, but the approach to firefights in Modern Warfare 3, which prefers medium-long distances, in our opinion does not go very well with the use of the Wii-mote, which also needs to be adjusted well so as not to run into the annoying ~blocks~ of the viewfinder that occur when we point the controller towards the edges of the screen. So let's say that the experience can be enjoyed both ways, and that both fanatics of infrared pointing and traditionalists will find themselves at ease. Are you serious, bro? Although less brilliant than that of Black Ops, the single player campaign reserves great emotions and can be played from start to finish, without ever pausing and indeed always proposing fast and frenetic action. However, it does not represent, by itself, the core of the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 offer. The game is in fact equipped with an interesting survival mode that represents a variation on the zombie theme, with a series of missions that can be played in online cooperative multiplayer together with another person, where you are at allIt is within different scenarios and you have to resist numerous waves of terrorists who want to kill us. As in zombie mode, you only start with a pistol and you can buy new weapons and ammunition as you take out enemies, but the strategic element of reinforcing barriers is missing. Sure, the fact that the opponents don't kill us instantly with a touch makes the experience much more edifying, and in general the missions are fun, especially if we face them together with a friend and equip ourselves with a compatible headset for the voice chat. The highlight however comes with the competitive online multiplayer, the best yet seen on Wii (not that you see that often, really) with its nineteen different modes, including classic deathmatches, team deathmatches and ~capture the flag~ , but also novelties such as ~kill confirmed~ (in which you have to collect the medals of your victims to score points) as well as all the ~veteran~ versions for greater attention to realism and a higher degree of challenge. The leveling of the weapons is also introduced at the same time as that of the character for the unlocking of new accessories, sights and so on, while the support for the Call of Duty Elite service, reserved for the ~major~ versions of the game, is missing. The entire structure of the online sector is well done, with quick matchmaking, shortcuts to solve the age-old problem of ~friend codes~ (really an anachronistic solution, already in 2006...) and add ~allies~ to your list, generally little lag (but it depends on the quality of the players' connection) and even the possibility of downloading patches and updates to optimize the experience. The picture is completed by the best combination of graphics and sound seen so far in an episode of Call of Duty for Wii: the locations are very detailed, some even surprising (see the urban scenarios), and the frame rate remains stable (25-30 fps) while never guaranteeing the ideal fluidity for motion detection controls, i.e. 60 fps.", "date": "2011-11-28", "grade": "8.0"}
