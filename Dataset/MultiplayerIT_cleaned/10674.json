But first could you ask those things out there to stop harassing my secretary?~ the psychiatrist asked the new master of the underworld, pointing out the servants left in the waiting room. ~Of course, I'll do it now. Do I have to take off my armor?~ answered the dark lord trying to hide a human voice and trying to limit the puffs of smoke emitted from his mouth ~It's not necessary, you can keep it. Go ahead.~ minions are still the core of the game; without them our anti-hero would be lost ~Well, mine was a difficult childhood. In short, I spent my days in a dark tower, in the midst of the lava and blood with which the carpets of chick feathers were soaked, sewn with filaments of child muscles (smaller , more tender, said uncle Sauron before losing his voice and becoming a voyeur), looked after by stupid servants, while my father was always away from home spreading death and destruction and gathering women to take to the bed.My mother was very jealous, but she didn't say anything for fear of being fried by a spell.When dad was torn to pieces and used to fertilize the fields, mom took me to a mountain town where there is snow all year round and where we were not welcomed at all I don't know why, but the other inhabitants were frightened by my glittering red eyes and by the pleasure I took in throwing my playmates into the ravines, to hear the sound of bones crashing against the rocks. Then one day the servants came looking for me, made me absolute lord, gave me a gigantic weapon and took me to the underworld, where I established my residence, which would need a more efficient ventilation system, but on the other hand the heating is very performing. Ahem, let's not beat around the bush. My sixteenth wife, a pacifist elf with rather provocative shapes, told me I'm too aggressive and that I can't spend my days setting fire to farms with farmers inside. I just married her and after the death of the fifteenth I made foil not to electrocute more wives during the first year of marriage, so here I am...~ The problem is that they grow up Overlord II starts from where the first chapter ended and continues the story of the lineage of the lords of evil by smoothing out many of the defects of the predecessor. The first tutorial sequence puts us in the role of a child Overlord who must be able to ruin the party in his village with the help of minions and a peppery little girl. Offered as a sacrifice to an occupying army, he will have to manage to escape and reach the underworld to begin his career as lord of evil. Minions are still the core of the game; without them our anti-hero would be lost. There are four types, all with different powers and useful in specific situations: do you need to get through a burning gate? You must use the red minions immune to fire. Is there a magic pool blocking you from reaching an area? Blue minions can pass through it without suffering its ill effects, and so on. Many will be happy to know that the response of the Overlord's thugs is more precise than in the past, although some uncertainties remain, especially in the most chaotic situations in which there is no shortage of misunderstandings of the inputs. In general, however, the step forward is noticeable and can only please since we are talking about one of the biggest flaws of the first chapter. Servants yes, but without any dignity But we were talking about the crew. Their number depends on the energy balls collected (they are found by slaughtering innocent creatures... oh well, the lord of evil is the lord of evil), while their strength depends on various factors, such as the experience accumulated in combat or the stolen equipment after killing enemies or after destroying some scenery elements. If desired, it is possible to make them grow in power directly in hell, by spending one of the precious stones that are found from time to time together with a little money. But let's talk about hell. In addition to the tower where the first Overlord resided, Hell is full of things to do. In addition to the aforementioned upgrading of the servants, it is also possible to build new weapons and armor, resurrect the fallen in battle, improve the infrastructure, manage spells, buy pieces of furniture (after welcoming a girl into the house) and so on. The throne deserves a separate discussion because it allows you to check the progress of the Overlord's missions and give audience to the inhabitants of his estates. Why do it? Simple: to get information and missions, as well as to see nice skits. loves and ispells The game mechanics are similar to those of the predecessor; in attack the Overlord has a melee weapon and some powerful and decidedly useful magic, as well as servants, of course. The first magic available is lightning that causes damage and allows you to light fireworks and the like, later you get powers that, for example, allow you to dominate the minds of humans, to take control of a minion or even to use one as a shield or as a source of energy recharge. All spells have different uses and are usually well integrated with other gameplay elements. Unlike in the past, the start of the game is less difficult and the energy and magic bars are not drained at lightning speed. Even the level design is smarter and less dispersive, so as to make the understanding of the game mechanics gradual. Despite the observation just made, it cannot be said that the beginning is boring, given that the situations to be faced are very varied, spectacular and keep a lot of people busy. Overlord II manages to keep the interest high throughout the adventure. Its secrets are the variety of situations and enemies, the graphics are not excellent, but capable of giving highly spectacular moments (such as the level in which you have to melt a sheet of ice to free a ship) and, above all, the cynical humor that it pervades it. Unlike in the first episode, making morally reprehensible decisions has no negative effects. Thus, for example, one can give one's wife to a citizen to amuse him a little (he is the lord of evil, not a care bear) without the risk of penalizing repercussions. Hours spent in front of the mirror We have already mentioned the technical part, but let's resume the discussion briefly. Overlord II is very nice to see, despite some uncertainty, and manages to convince above all thanks to an excellent use of colors and the design of the characters, all rather grotesque. Take the elves for example: the developers have caricatured their main features (the slender build and the love of nature), making them a kind of group of effeminate ecologists. Probably greater care in the animations of the interlude sequences would have made the characterization work of the Codemasters creatives even more convincing, given that they are the weakest part of the title, with evident out of sync (probably due to the Italian dubbing) and some movement a little too clumsy. Of all the models, the most beautiful is certainly that of the Overlord who manages to express all the wickedness necessary for a true lord of evil, thanks to a great wealth of details. The soundtrack is also well cared for, with spot-on music and a good range of sound effects that enrich the gaming experience.", "date": "2009-06-26", "grade": "8.3"}
