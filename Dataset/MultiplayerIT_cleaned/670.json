An excellent example of this is the series developed by Turborilla, which with the first episode has exceeded 50 million downloads and is determined to reiterate its success. As you are about to read in the Mad Skills Motocross 3 review, we are talking about a formula that has practically given everything it could give, yet it somehow manages to always maintain a pinch of freshness between the facets of a system that can focus more on the acrobatic component and the unlikely scenarios of Trials or remain adherent to traditional physics and tracks. Gameplay Mad Skills Motocross 3, a race sequence Mad Skills Motocross 3 keeps the mechanics simple and immediate: one button to accelerate, one to brake and two arrows that are used to push the bike forward or backward. There are few variations on the theme and the fulcrum is all here: depending on the route we will have to try to keep both wheels on the ground for as long as possible, so as to exploit the traction and power of our vehicle in order to cross the finish line for first. Closing the short races of the career mode in the first three places represents the minimum condition necessary to proceed towards the next challenge, but in reality there are optional objectives that revolve around the acrobatic maneuvers (perform forward or backward rotations, wheelies , stay in the air for a certain number of seconds, etc.) which allow you to get extra rewards useful for progression. Mad Skills Motocross 3, the upgrade screen And this is where the proverbial donkey falls, because the freemium model adopted for Mad Skills Motocross 3 makes its weight felt right from the end of the first of the eight available championships, proposing rather long waits for the unlocking of upgrades using virtual currency and therefore pushing us to resort to the precious one, the gold coins, which however wear out quickly and are not recharged with as much diligence. The need is obviously to monetize with the weekly Pro Pass and the various paid packages, which become almost mandatory when you want to unlock the new bikes in order to be competitive in the races. Replaying the challenges already overcome allows you to collect the necessary money little by little, but we would have preferred to come across the microtransactions after a few hours, not right away. Contents Mad Skills Motocross 3, landing is essential to go faster. It is obviously a pity that the Turborilla guys have chosen this path, since the career offers enough content for a softer approach. As mentioned, in fact, we will be able to compete in eight different settings, with various qualifying races and finally the actual tournament, which however takes place within a few tracks, to be tried and tried again in an attempt to climb the times classification of completion by comparing ourselves with other users in asynchronous mode. The aspect related to upgrades and customizations is also quite rich and complete, with the bike that can be improved in various aspects, modified on an aesthetic level and naturally replaced with a more handsome. However, we have already talked about how this aspect of the experience has been handled poorly in terms of elasticity. Technical realization Looking at the original Mad Skills Motocross and this new episode, the technical differences appear really clear, but it's also normal since exactly ten years have passed since the debut of the franchise on iOS and Android>. The game's graphics mix a relatively realistic style for the riders and bikes with more essential, almost cartoonish solutions for the scenarios, which boast a good variety of colors and landscapes. The physics engine, the real core of the experience, has also been It is substantially improved and provides solid references when balancing the wheels on bumps or at the end of a jump. The touch controls are unfortunately customizable only in terms of positioning, with somewhat small icons, while the rock-style musical accompaniment seemed quite generic to us.", "date": "2021-06-03", "grade": "6.8"}
