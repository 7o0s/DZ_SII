{"name": "Successi da cantare", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/73452-lips-number-one-hits-successi-da-cantare.html", "text": "From the expert Japanese developers INiS (who knows Karaoke better than them?) comes the expansion of LIPS, a singing game suitable for the whole family that also lends itself well to entertaining during any party at home with friends. Lips: Number One Hits, this is the name of the game, contains 40 new songs in the original version, is sold alone or with microphones and is compatible with the first chapter released last year. In fact, whoever bought it will also see the latter's songs appear on the screen and the possibility of using them simply by changing discs, on the fly, without turning off the console. The tracks present range a bit between all the popular pop genres: Hip Hop with 2Pac, LL Cool J, Akon, Rihanna's RnB, One Republic and Kanye West, Lily Allen's Pop, Black Eyed Peas and Fergie, the Brit-Pop of Coldplay (Viva la Vida is the official soundtrack), the 80s of the Pet Shop Boys, Tears for Fears, Roxette. In short, there is something for all tastes. Most of the songs downloaded from Xbox Live in the first LIPS are compatible with this sequel and are displayed directly on the main menu where the songs are chosen. The entire graphic sector, the design and setting of the menus has been improved and made aesthetically functional and more appealing. From the selection page it is now possible to see the whole list of available songs at the same time, whether they are part of the disc or the first LIPS, also displaying the songs downloaded and those available, separated further down. Lips: Number One Hits also has a multiplayer component based on scores and rankings (perfectly integrated with those of friends on Xbox Live) as the intonation of the voice, if accurate, assigns a certain score to whoever is singing. The system that regulates this mechanism is quite accurate and effective. The same cannot be said of the reverberation that the voice generates in television speakers: audio delay always generates a slight echo that could disorient the rhythm or intonation. From the settings it is possible to adjust this ~delay~ trying to improve the response, but the defect never disappears completely. For the whole family Who doesn't sing, in Lips: Number One Hits, doesn't stand by and watch. It is possible to keep time by waving the microphone (this also suffers from a decided delay in response as happened in the first episode), press keys on the connected joypads to generate noises, audience effects, drums or drums. This second chapter of LIPS, as regards options and methods, follows in all respects the first, of which it is more than a natural expansion. There is of course the classic single player, duet, challenge, pass the mic for group play. There is no real career mode, the game is all about having fun singing together in front of the TV. It is again possible to import your own songs from an Mp3 player, CD or from the console's Hard Disk, obviously without expecting to see the words also displayed. One of the (few) new features is support for Xbox 360 Avatars, who now dance, jump and laugh on the screen while singing, adding liveliness and further cheer. Despite the title (Number One Hits), the quality of the songs, although heterogeneous and by top-level artists, is not excellent: for example, from the Pet Shop Boys one would expect a Let's Go West or It's a Sin, rather than You Are Always on My Mind that far fewer people know about. And apart from some actual hits (Disturbia, Viva la Vida, Just Dance), however, there seems to be a lack of ~great classics~ that can be sung by everyone, which do not touch the unattainable singing chords of Rihanna, Scissor Sisters or Lady Gaga. A warning: the game is not backwards compatible with LIPS in a non-Italian version, therefore those who own an English or foreign copy will not be able to view the latter's songs in the Number One Hits menus.", "date": "2010-01-05", "grade": null}
