{"name": "Asphalt 3: Street Rules 3D", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/asphalt-3-street-rules-3d.html", "text": "Yes, because although the name Asphalt may not be new even to DS and PSP owners, it was born on mobile phones; and therefore the third episode made its appearance on mobile phones both in a ~normal~ version and in one specially designed for high-end terminals and characterized by the use of three dimensions, or polygons. And it is precisely the latter that we are going to talk about; certainly for a car racing game there isn't much background to tell, and in fact Gameloft didn't want to waste time creating stories or characters. The game structure of the main mode, called arcade, puts the player in front of a series of locations, 7 to be precise, theater of competitions; each of them is in turn divided into 4 events, which in addition to offering the normal races in which whoever arrives first wins, add a bit of variety with challenges centered on the destruction of a certain number of cars (at burnout to be clear) or on the money collection. And money is a fundamental aspect of Asphalt, both because it is by earning it that the subsequent races are unlocked, and since they offer the possibility of enhancing one's car by modifying as many as 16 aspects, both aesthetic and mechanical and therefore of performance. A bit like Need for Speed to be clear, and in fact Asphalt seems to be inspired in a marked way by the Electronic Arts production, see for example for the presence of the police, or more generally for the style that unites the products in question. We mentioned the cars, 9 in all officially licensed, but it is also possible to choose to ride one of the 3 motorcycles available, even if in reality the differences in the driving model are very few. The graphic component, the fulcrum of this 3d edition, brings with it many lights and some shadows; as regards the former, it is undoubtedly appreciable to see the progress that mobile games are making from a technical point of view, with a good frame rate, defined and clean textures, discrete polygonal complexity and pleasant light effects. On the other hand, one cannot help but underline the extremely marked pop-up of the trackside elements, which appear just a few meters in front of one's car. The sound is very disappointing, with little intriguing music and almost completely absent sound effects. As far as the actual game is concerned, if it is true that restricted to the field of mobile phones Asphalt 3 is undoubtedly among the top of the category, instead making a more general analysis it is impossible not to judge the Gameloft production a little unrefined . The poor artificial intelligence of the opponents, the uselessness of the traffic (since with a boost of turbo you can wipe out any car, even on a motorcycle) and the driving model that is all too arcadey make the races a bit all the same , and closer to solo racing than authentic last corner competition.
