Gameplay, narrative and level design of Eidos Montreal's baby are all of the highest level, but on the other hand it is a product clearly conceived as a transitional chapter, with a sudden and unsatisfactory ending capable of ruining the experience for many. We have praised it on our pages - appreciating the many improvements to the systems and the brilliant use of a sci-fi setting of rare power - yet we understand the criticisms, with the exception of the doubts of some players convinced that the team would release the ~ true~ final in the form of DLC, which we immediately pointed out as excessive. Just as it was conceived within the saga, in fact, Mankind Divided is practically forced to act as a bridge in the modern epic born from the brilliant minds of Ion Storm, and it can hardly be concluded with an expansion, however massive it may be . The Eidos Montreal, for their part, have only confirmed our theory by giving life to another DLC detached from the main story, a sort of prequel called A Criminal Past, which takes place before the events of Mankind Divided. The protagonist? Again Adam Jensen, this time in the role of infiltrator in a maximum security prison for augmented, all in order to contact an Interpol undercover agent in possession of important information on some terrorist attacks. Very simple on paper, a pity that things are never so linear in the world of Deus Ex, and that even among the prisoners Adam will have his work cut out to achieve his goal with all the bionic limbs in place. We played A Criminal Past, the new Mankind Divided DLC. What do we think? Labyrinth prison There isn't much to say in terms of gameplay regarding this DLC, on the contrary, the developers wanted to give the player the possibility of respecting the chronology of events, giving up the special power-ups of Mankind Divided in favor of a more limited. Opting for ~normal~ upgrades will not ruin the experience anyway, because the strength of A Criminal Past lies entirely in the level design and in the management of the main quest. The DLC is practically a concentrate of all the main strengths of the base game: it has a complex map full of secrets and alternative routes, it leaves the player considerable freedom of action and avoids driving him excessively, allowing him to reason with his brain for the duration of the adventure. After all, from the beginning we realize how the new area is not designed for newcomers to the series, with cameras everywhere, aggressive and numerous guards, and far from obvious approaches to solving the various tasks. To put things straight: think of a map of complexity and danger comparable to that of the Palisade Bank of the primary campaign, insert into it secondary quests, hot zones and non-player characters full of things to say, and be sure to place here and there are some brilliant ideas to overcome truly difficult moments undisturbed; here's A Criminal Past. Seen like this, in short, it is a section of the highest level, which goes well with the rest of the game's missions and offers a lot of fun to those who have already appreciated the original title. It is then, from another point of view, also an interesting narrative experiment, because the events are told in the form of flashbacks during a session of Adam by his psychologist Delara (when Adam dies, in fact, Delara resumes him with a ~really tell me how she's gone,~ as if he's lying to her), and there's no shortage of interesting twists and ramifications as it unfolds. For heaven's sake, don't expect something sensational; it is not designed to blow your brains out, nor to innovate already consolidated systems... but it remains a more than worthy addition to the title, and therefore does its dirty duty very well. Finally, for the duration, we are talking about three, maximum four hours; timing that we have learned to expect from additions of this type.", "date": "2017-03-15", "grade": null}
