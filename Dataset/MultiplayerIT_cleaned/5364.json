Above all, doing it while avoiding the huge advances of the plot is an epic undertaking. We will try to succeed, but in some cases we will necessarily have to make references to the story to make people understand what we are talking about. Muv-Luv also has sequences drawn in a chibi style If you already know the ge visual novel trilogy you will know why, while others are warned. Muv-Luv is published for the first time on PC on CD-Rom, in an eroge version, i.e. with adult content. It was 2003 and the success was such that in 2006, after a DVD re-release of the first version, the all-ages edition was made, which also had a port for Xbox 360 in 2011. However, until the publication on Steam took place as of July 2016, the only way to play it in English was to purchase the 2004 PC DVD edition and install an amateur translation patch made by the Amaterasu group. Fortunately, it is now accessible to everyone, even if the new edition could have been better edited. We will see why later. On the initial screen you are asked to choose between one of the two episodes that make up the adventure: Extra and Unlimited. Our advice, if you decide to buy it, is to start from Extra and then proceed with Unlimited. The third episode, Alternative, must be purchased separately and concludes the very strange trilogy. Alternative is not yet available on Steam, but when it is, avoid using it without having first concluded the other two, because you would lose many references and, above all, you would not be able to understand the peculiar composition of the entire work. We reviewed the first two episodes of Muv-Luv with their very intricate story. Discover them! Extra The episode ~Extra~ tells the story of Shirogane Takeru, the character whose point of view is embraced for the entire trilogy, and his relationship with a group of girls who will do anything to seduce him, starting with his friend Kagami Sumika, a sunny little girl with whom Takeru has a splendid but somewhat conflicting relationship. The episode ~Extra~ makes Muv-Luv look like a romantic visual novel There is also a video game with mechs in the middle, but you don't have direct control of the robots After a introductory chapter dedicated to the two, the troubles begin: Takeru finds himself in bed with Mitsurugi Meiya, a young heiress who wants to marry him at all costs. From here a whole series of funny and embarrassing situations will start, which will become more and more intricate as we get to know the other characters, almost all attending Takeru and Sumika's school. Extra is a very long and decidedly articulated episode, in which twenty different endings can be reached depending on the choices made. In reality, the interactions during the adventure are very limited and only require you to make decisions to advance the story. Will we eat the lunch Sumika brought us or Meiya's? Are we going to walk home or are we going to drop off one of the girls? Nothing exceptionally busy, in short, and nothing strange for a visual novel. However, Extra has a unique feature compared to the other two episodes: it is completely autonomous. In what sense? Well, reading it you experience a story with light tones, sometimes a little superficial, but still self-contained. Of course, there are references to Unlimited and Alternative, but they can only be understood after having tried the latter (for example the video game with mech fights). In short, you get to conclude it thinking that you are faced with a simple erotic visual novel transformed into a romantic story (a patch to restore the sex scenes seems to be in the works, but nothing is known about it yet). Surely it is a big production for the genre, given the very high number of animations, the countless poses of the characters and the duration of more than thirty hours. The fact remains that after finishing extra it is really difficult to say what is exceptional about Muv-Luv, to the point of having prompted fans to put it on a pedestal together with sacred monsters such as Clannad or Grinsia. Unlimited Shirogane Takeru wakes up very late amazed that neither Sumika nor Meiya woke him up. Worried, he leaves his house and discovers that the city he lives in is in ruins. Believing he's in a dream, he decides to let himself go and joins a military group who recruit him to drive a mech (technically a Senjutsuhokousentouki, but we'll never say that word again). Some references to the erotic contents of the 2003 edition have remained. More than a few hints. Apparently the planet Earth is at war against an alien race called BETA, which in 2001 had already massacred more than a billion people. Selfyou are incredulous of the developments of the Muv-Luv story, you are in the right spirit to understand Takeru's state of mind at the beginning of Unlimited. What happened to the world of him, the one we met in Extra? What happened to Sumika, who will only appear in flashbacks throughout the episode? Why did a story of school love flow into a story of war against aliens with unexpected developments? But above all, why don't some of the Extra characters recognize him and have completely different lives than those of the previous episode? It is with Unlimited that the Muv-Luv trilogy blossoms and is completely transformed, revealing itself to be much deeper than it seemed with Extra: the situations become more dramatic, the tones tighten up, the characters become deeper and reveal unthinkable facets. Extra remains in the background, always present, as if to contrast with the new story. We can't reveal the various twists and turns, but in the end it's really hard to sum up and understand which is the dream and which is the reality. However, to have a complete vision of the situation, you must also read Alternative, the often mentioned third episode, hoping that Degica will launch it soon (we won't talk about it here, obviously). Technical Problems As we mentioned, Muv-Luv is a very rich visual novel in terms of quantity and quality of drawings, as well as animations. There are so many of them and, when the action is not animated, the developers have proved masters in using static elements to give a strong sense of movement to the scene, for example by changing the position of the characters on the screen, or quickly alternating between them the poses to create very lively situations. Extra/Unlimited: many characters in common, completely different stories, even in tone The backdrops are very beautiful, shame about the scaling Obviously the technical and artistic values of Muv-Luv are also present in the Steam version, but the adaptation is overall mediocre and in many ways questionable. What was very annoying was the choice to reproportion the images. It must be said that those who are not familiar with how visual novels work have often complained about the 4:3 aspect ratio, used by many classic titles. Naturally who speaks to simply give air to the mouth does not remember that in the past years 4:3 was the standard of monitors and, above all, does not understand that if a 2D image was drawn with those proportions, the only ways to adapt it to proportions different, for example 16:9, are to cut it or distort it. For Muv-Luv Degica has chosen the worst solution, that of cutting. Thus, to meet those who cannot bear to see black bars on the screen, we find ourselves a visual novel with the backdrops cut with an axe, especially in the upper part. In some cases, when characters are spread across the entire screen (such as when there are five of them at once), the cuts extend to them as well. The faces are always clearly visible, fortunately, but sometimes there are cuts to the ends of the hair that are not exactly pleasant. Always to meet modernity, it was decided to enlarge some images. Graphics Handbook, page 2: What happens when we stretch a bitmap image too much? Well done: we fill it with jagged lines. Here we are only interested in reporting that the result is not exactly beautiful and, above all, that we have not obtained a quality such as to make it preferable to the original one. Luckily the voice acting remained intact, so we can hear the original Japanese voices while reading the English lyrics. Were it not for the adaptation work, Muv-Luv would be considered a small masterpiece among visual novels.", "date": "2016-08-06", "grade": "8.5"}
