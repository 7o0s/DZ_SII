{"name": "Una saga da ridere", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/111420-divinity-anthology-una-saga-da-ridere.html", "text": "When we talk about electronic role-playing games for solitary players, which aren't strange stuff forbidden to minors, we usually make the mistake of cutting the genre with an ax into just two sections, namely the western-style role-playing game and the Japanese one. In reality, in each of the two macro-systems there are dozens of different streams that are difficult to reconcile with the only general view one has of them. Wanting to make another division, always clear but more representative (go ahead to start the music of the magical world of Quark), we could take the western role-playing game and distinguish at least two schools: the European and the American one, with the second heralding a more sweetened vision, in a certain sense popular national, and the other closer to the traditional naked and raw role-playing game. The Divinity series by Larian Studios, of which the fourth episode, Divinity: Original Sin, is under construction, has attempted to reconcile the sub-genre that most of all has simplified role-playing games, shifting the focus from the plot and the background to the compulsive collection of objects, i.e. action RPGs, with the addition of more complex mechanics closer to the tastes of players who have always seen the excessive trivialization brought about by the advent of Diablo badly. The first breaking factor, which applies to all chapters, is the underlying irony that permeates situations and dialogues. Some of the more common themes of the fantasy tale are picked up and pilloried on screen (though not as blatantly as in inXile's Bard's Tale). The final effect is quite irreverent, even if in general the epic nature is always maintained with original gimmicks, for example the possibility of transforming into dragons in Divinity 2: Ego Draconis. Much loved in Germany, Divinity have always struggled a little more outside the borders of Merkel's nation: on the one hand they have never been technically at the top, on the other, having always preferred substance to form, in many cases they have ended up alienating players due to some unwelcome angularities. At the same time some exclusive qualities have found many fans willing to forgive some flaws for what is still one of the most interesting fantasy series still alive on the videogame scene. If you are among the curious who would like to try it, you will be happy to know of the release of this Divinity Anthology, which collects Divine Divinity, Beyond Divinity and Divinity II: Developer's Cut in a single, decidedly cheap package. Divine and Beyond Ironic right from the title, Divine Divinity, the progenitor of the series, was released for the first time in 2002. Although the isometric graphics no longer make much of an impression (actually it didn't even then), many of its winning features are still perfectly enjoyable . As already mentioned, Larian Studios successfully tried to mix the mechanics of Diablo II with those of Baldur's Gate, inserting into the game the tactical pause and a greater attention to the RPG foundations. Even the game world was much larger and more varied than that of the Blizzard title, which however had a better online experience. We are talking about dozens of hours of gameplay to explore all corners of the four immense maps and interact with more than one hundred and fifty characters with a detailed background. Not a little, if you think that we are talking about a debut title from a then unknown team. The success of Divine Divinity had an obvious consequence: there was a need to immediately give fans a new title to play. The result was the spin-off Beyond Divinity. Looking back today, it's not a bad game. It is simply too similar to its predecessor (at the time there was less tolerance for copycat sequels) to which it didn't add much, but from which it also took all the most important qualities: a huge game world for a main quest that unfolded along dozens of hours of gameplay, that basic irony that was so much appreciated, with the new gimmick of the two polar opposite characters who have to live together in the same body and a decidedly more articulated role-playing system compared to the other action RPGs. After Beyond Divinity Larian Studios immediately set to work on the real sequel to Divine Divinity. Several years passed, but Divinity II: Ego Draconis finally arrived. The dragon's ego Divinity II: Developer's Cut collects Divinty II: Ego Draconi and its expansion, Flames of Vengeance, making them a single game and adding extras such as video material and various commentaries to watch in peace. We are faced with a fully 3D world with huge maps to explore and dozens of quests to perform. The controls are more like those of an Oblivion, but the depth is still what it used to be, as well as the underlying irony. Having lost the idea of forced coexistence between two characters, Larian Studios has decided to exploit its new engine to try to do something more than the classic role-playing game: the protagonist can transform into a dragon, after about half of the adventure, and fly around the maps looking for places inaccessible on foot. Furthermore, the player comes into possession of a real fortress in which he can devote himself to crafting, training in the various arts and can give orders to some servants to go and find raw materials. The amount of content in Divinity II: Ego Dragonis alone is worth the price of admission, but the addition of Flames of Vengeance expands the offer even more. The expansion ends the story and is set all within a city, apart from a few sorties outside in dragon form. Here too there are hilarious quests to tackle, such as that of wizards transformed into food that can be eaten or released, and there is no shortage of puzzles to solve and secrets to unearth. In general we can say that it is a high quality product that alone is worth collecting and that should be greatly re-evaluated. Especially the sequences with the dragon deserve a second chance. One of the elements we liked the most concerns the narration: although, as already mentioned, the title does not give up the irony that distinguishes the series, some moments are highly dramatic and create the right pathos that pushes us to continue.", "date": "2012-12-04", "grade": "8.8"}
