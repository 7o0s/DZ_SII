{"name": "Links 2004", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/links-2004.html", "text": "Par, Birdie and Bogey Like any self-respecting sports title, Links 2004 opens with the possibility of creating a virtual golfer by choosing from a whole series of customization possibilities. Models of male and female gamers, with the possibility of selecting even some professionals who have granted their names to Microsoft, alternate in a range of possibilities that is reasonable even if not stunning. The choice, which proves to be fundamental when starting, is that of one of the difficulty levels among the three available. There are essentially two differences: the first is the shot power indicator bar, which at the easiest level also indicates the recommended power dosage, and which disappears at the highest level, leaving the player with the task of regulating the shot power following the swing of the club; the second consists of the line that indicates the probable trajectory of the ball towards the hole, once on the green, which becomes thinner and shorter from level to level, making it more difficult to make shots. The problem is that once the difficulty level has been chosen, this can no longer be changed and also once you get to the last tournaments of the career mode (five levels each made up of skill competitions, a tournament and a championship) and the last challenges (various tests of skill in the various shots, distributed over four levels of difficulty to unlock ever better equipment), one remains anchored to the choice made at the beginning, feeling limited the real sensation of evolution of our alter ego. Therefore, anyone who wants to try another level of difficulty is forced to start from scratch with another character. This can be improved by spending the dollars won in the different tournaments on the purchase of the various skill points. The decision not to allow the passage from one difficulty to another was probably dictated by the desire to prevent the acquisition of dozens of skill points at an easy level, creating perfect athletes, and then going on to compete online against players who instead work your way up, collecting dollars and skills in the more advanced difficulties. The feeling remains that a reasonable middle ground could have been opted for, giving the possibility of obtaining further bonuses to those who play at the highest levels. Like a knife in butter... That's the feeling you get when you play Links 2004, that you are introduced to the game of golf easily, but firmly. The controls are simple and intuitive, with the left lever you control the swing of the club, you activate the wireframe grid to analyze the green, and you move the camera once you press A and have passed to the shot close to where you want to direct the shot. With the right lever you rotate the shot and zoom, with the analog pad you move the pointer with which you choose where to direct the shot. With X, once on the green, the mobile camera is activated which shows us the path from the ball to the hole, finally with B, the various special shots that can be made are chosen. The use of these, as well as the basic shots, is explained by the tutorial and by the various tips that are gradually dispensed during the game. The problem is that Links 2004 is not one of the games chosen by Microsoft for localization in Italian and those who don't speak English might find themselves a little taken aback. However, given the thoughtful and reflective nature of this discipline, anyone who wants to get into the game, with a little effort, will find no difficulty and will have enough to play for a long time, given the many tournaments and challenges available. The only limit is the ability to play on nine fields, four available from the start and five unlockable, shortening the longevity of the game. Obviously, over the months there will be new ones to download via Live, but those who don't have the opportunity to use them should carefully evaluate this aspect. Better alive than dead The approach chosen by Microsoft for this Links 2004 proves to be the real trump card once connected to Xbox Live. The implementation of the service is certainly not at the levels of Project Gotham Racing 2 and, also given the nature of a golf game and the relative length of the rounds, reaching your friends on the net is not always easy, but once that happens fun is guaranteed. The games can be customized in every element, from the number of players, up to a maximum of four, to the rules to follow, to the different types of game. The clearest distinction is made by choosing fast play dosve players simultaneously execute their shots with the possibility of keeping an eye on the moves of the opponents, thanks to the colored trails of their balls that stand out in the sky, making for a nice feeling of real competition. Otherwise, you can decide to follow the dictates of a real golf game by waiting the turn of the others, observing them and perhaps learning their tricks and techniques. The fear of waiting for the endless decisions of overly meticulous opponents is dispelled by a timer that inexorably allows one and a half minutes to take one's turn under penalty of a penalty to be paid dearly at the end of the race. It should be noted that the choice to inexorably channel the golfer created in the difficulty level, which was selected at the beginning of the game, unfortunately also has repercussions on Live, where it will not be possible to go and challenge the players in the other difficulty levels, once acquired sufficient mastery. Graphics and sound What can I say except that it was reasonable to expect more from such a title. The player models are decidedly well done, with good animations and a render kissed by very precise self shading, but, given the only 30 fps and the nature of the title which certainly does not ask the hardware for impossible calculations, what appears on the video it is appreciated, but not surprising. The different courses are well modeled and sufficiently detailed, but the atmospheric effects don't push the machine properly and seeing the raindrops passing through the golfers without any result, for example, is negatively affecting. The audience in 2D, then, is really perplexing, given that the camera often insists on it with a touch of superfluous masochism, making the graphics sector attest to a good, but not exciting result. A different matter must be made with regard to the audio, which, apart from sound effects, is really little. The music is present only in the replays, in the menus and is the usual American rock from a radio spot; the match commentary, all in English of course, is even annoying in the long run. The real life saver is the ability to listen to your own soundtracks saved on the hard disk. Comment Something has changed over the years and where Links on PC has always been the reference series for all golf simulations, in its Xbox incarnation, Microsoft has chosen a very soft and accessible approach. The result is a good golf game capable of giving a lot to anyone, from beginners to enthusiasts, but with a couple of contradictions: there is no localization in Italian, which for beginners could be an obstacle and for true enthusiasts the only nine tracks available might be a bit short considering what Tiger Woods from EA has to offer. However, the perspective changes radically once we consider the online game, which gives Links 2004 a long and enjoyable life with the surprise of revealing itself as one of the best titles on Xbox Live and XSN, at least on par with the best games released in this period . Pros: A simple and complete access to golf Good graphics Excellent on Xbox Live Cons: Only nine courses Lack of localization in Italian There was a period in the life of Personal Computers, which were beginning to assert themselves as plausible gaming platforms to the detriment of the dying Amiga and consoles in crisis, in which some titles marked the path for updates to be made at the hardware level to stay ahead of the game. step with the times. One of these was certainly Microsoft's Links, the first golf game to use scans from real photographs for the elements of the backdrops and for the player sprites, with the obvious limitations of the graphics cards of those years. Many enthusiasts updated their PCs to be able to properly run the different episodes of the series, which inexorably came out on store shelves year after year. Links now arrives on Xbox, the graphics are completely three-dimensional, starting to play is a little easier and, above all, for the first time it is possible to play a golf game online on a console.", "date": "2003-12-13", "grade": null}
