{"name": "Pilgrims", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pilgrims-recensione.html", "text": "In this review of another member of the rich Apple Arcade catalog we talk about Pilgrims, the latest work of the Amanita Design team, already the author of highly appreciated adventures such as Machinarium, Botanicula and the Samorost trilogy. This time the developers get involved with a product that differs from the previous ones both in stylistic terms and in terms of gameplay, which focuses on the great variety of interactions that can be made between protagonists rather than on the actual duration and complexity of the puzzles. secondary characters and objects. So let's find out what it is and if it can confirm the quality standards to which the Czech study has accustomed us. Point and paper adventure It cannot be said that Pilgrims has a real plot: the game opens with a funny introduction in which five characters (a bandit, a priest, a wayfarer, an old woman and a demon) are seen sitting at a table playing playing cards and drinking beer, exchanging jokes in the incomprehensible gibberish combined with balloons containing symbols which is the only means of communication of the title. The scene then fades away and we see a tent in the middle of a wood from which the mustachioed traveler emerges, who in fact will prove to be the main protagonist of the adventure: without many explanations or tutorials, Pilgrims makes the user understand that his purpose is to explore the different scenarios present on the map, interacting with other characters, collecting objects and solving the puzzles that are presented. In short, nothing conceptually new, but it is the original shape used by Amanita Design that makes Pilgrims something as different as it is pleasant. Each location occupies only the space of one screen, and in this small portion it contains all the agents necessary for the gameplay, whether these are objects to be obtained by tapping on them or characters or elements with which to interact. This is made possible by a curious interface consisting of a deck of cards that occupies the lower part of the display and which illustrates the protagonists and inventory components available to resolve the situation. Basically, having arrived in a scenario, you must first draw the card relating to the character you intend to use (the other four funny figures of the introduction can in fact be combined with the initial wanderer), bearing in mind that each of them has different abilities and can elicit mixed reactions in the surrounding environment. An object must then be selected for the hero of the moment to handle and then get comfortable and observe what comes out of this combination. The gameplay of Pilgrims is really all here, but the beauty lies in two factors: first of all, each protagonist uses the equipment in his own way, for example the old woman could use a broom to sweep the ground while the bandit would not hesitate to use it to beat her at the head of the unfortunate person on duty. Then there is the pleasure of trying even absurd combinations, partly to have fun with the hilarious reactions of the characters on the screen, partly because Pilgrims does not offer unique solutions to its puzzles, and rather pushes the user to experiment by offering 45 objectives which are unlocked by performing certain actions. Entering a bear's den, obtaining a bottle of liqueur from an innkeeper, gaining the trust of a grumpy merchant are some of the examples of situations that Amanita Design has set up to leave players free to decide how to proceed, for an adventure which turns out to be decidedly short and not particularly demanding, but which pushes us to retrace our steps with other games to try new ways and unlock further objectives. Obviously not everyone who downloads Pilgrims will aim for 100% completion, and for these there is no doubt that the title will represent impromptu fun that they will probably end up abandoning after the first run. However, the excellent artistic values of the production remain universally appreciable, with an enchanting graphic that seems to be handmade and a perfectly fitting soundtrack by Floex, already author of the music for Machinarium and Samorost 3.", "date": "2019-10-14", "grade": "8.0"}
