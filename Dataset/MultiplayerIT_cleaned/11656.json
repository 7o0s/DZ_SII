You are organizing an appointment with a recently known person, after a few messages you decide to go to the mall to spend some time together. Everything goes well, until a television with legs and a huge flip phone decide to attack you. Luckily, your partner can transform into a sword and, together, slay enemies. A typical summer Thursday? Well, maybe not for everyone, but certainly for Boyfriend Dungeon. In a unique mix between dating simulators and dungeon crawlers, Boyfriend Dungeon wants to make us incredible lovers and first-rate swordsmen. Let's find out in our review whether the game from Kitfox Games, which is available on PC, Xbox (also on Game Pass) and Nintendo Switch, has been able to convince us. Welcome to Verona Beach Verona Beach is the setting for Boyfriend Dungeon The story of Boyfriend Dungeon opens when our character (customizable by pronouns, appearance and clothing) arrives in Verona Beach, a young and warm seaside city. Our cousin, conspiring with our mother, invited us and offered us a small apartment for the whole summer. Their goal is to push us out of our shell and make us meet new people. So far so good, except that in the world of Boyfriend Dungeon people are divided into two categories: those who know how to transform themselves into a talking weapon and those who are not able to do so. We are part of the second. One of our first dates though is a master swordsman, who teaches us how to fight. At this point, we are sent inside an abandoned shopping center, a real dungeon in which monsters appear, but which are generated starting from our deepest fears. In essence, the dungeons are a session with the therapist, with more fighting, less words and with the difference that they allow us to earn some money instead of spending it. Structure from Dating Sim Weapon-humans are the best lovers in Boyfriend Dungeon The structure of Boyfriend Dungeon is immediately very clear. Our lovers are all human weapons and our goal is always the same: go down into the dungeon, defeat as many enemies as possible, strengthen the bond with the weapon and, when you have enough Love Points, organize an appointment at the end of which the weapon will level up, thus unlocking a new skill useful in combat. The appointments follow the classic canons of dating simulators. Each sequence allows us to discover something more about our partner, who will tell us about his past, between dysfunctional father-son relationships, a life as a reckless artist who has gone too far, and the difficulties of university life. The various partners all have their own style, from the dapper businessman to the blue-haired Korean pop star, and best of all are introduced with a well-crafted weapon-to-human animated sequence. they are peaks but there are no chasms either: Boyfriend Dungeon won't shake your soul with its characters' stories, but the dates counterbalance the fight sequences, striking a good balance between ignorant action and light-hearted storytelling. During the appointments we will be able to choose what to say to our partners, thanks to various multiple choices. Boyfriend Dungeon, also for the sake of gameplay, does not allow you to ~fail~ appointments and does not give narrative crossroads that allow us to carry on one relationship rather than another. The relationships in the game (not all of them necessarily amorous, by the way) can advance in parallel, independently, without worries of any kind: the entire Verona Beach is polyamorous and pansexual, in a way that is not very credible but certainly useful for simplifying the narrative component of the game. This also means that only one game will be enough to see all the story arcs included in the game and you won't need a guide to understand how to unlock certain sequences. Boyfriend Dungeon, even in its more playful components as we will see shortly, is very streamlined and fast. In fact, we needed just over five hours to bring our favorite weapon to the maximum level and thus unlock the game ending. After that, in another couple of hours we maxed out the other weapons and completed practically all the extras available (ie the creation of clothes and other items from the materials collected in the dungeons). Dungeon Crawler fights In Boyfriend Dungeon you fight against various creatures As mentioned, however, Boyfriend Dungeon is not only relationships, but also fights. In order to unlock the next appointment it is first necessary to obtain Love Points with theweapon of our choice: these are obtained by exploring dungeons. The combat system is typical of action Dungeon Crawlers with an isometric view. The character has a light attack, a heavy one (simple combos can be done), a dodge and a limited-use special move of our choice (fireball, proximity bomb, spell to put enemies to sleep...) . The fights are very simple: most of the time we'll be hitting repeating keys as quickly as possible, with just a few dodges here and there. The monsters attack us in a basic way, in a mix of shots from near and far: their power lies in the number, certainly not in the depth of the moveset. Boyfriend Dungeon is not a technical game and does not require great precision and skill in executing shots. Valeria is the only female character in Boyfriend Dungeon It must be said that our character is initially weak and the power of the enemies increases very quickly from floor to floor, but the same can be said about us. Based on the number of floors completed, enemies defeated and treasures found, we will get experience points that will make us level up. Other than Hit Points, there are no stats, but leveling up means you do more damage. Boyfriend Dungeon is not sparing of PE and in a few explorations we will become so powerful as to tear almost all enemies to pieces in a few hits. The action flows carefree, a bit repetitive for sure, but the game is so fast that you won't get bored, above all thanks to the fact that each human-weapon has its own moveset and uniqueness (electric beams that hit multiple enemies, status such as bleeding or paralysis, parrying...), which make the fights slightly different every time. Dungeon arenas are not without their flaws. The various combat areas are simple square or rectangular spaces, with no interaction possibilities for environmental attacks or zones to be exploited to gain advantages in combat. Also, they repeat very quickly. Then there are places dedicated to ~romantic~ events, spaces designed to talk to your partner (an ice rink, a games room, a concert stage and so on). Each character interacts with it according to their own personality and tastes and we earn Love Points and a free cure. Unfortunately, however, these areas are few and each weapon has only one dialogue: we will find the same places several times, re-reading the same sentences. Overall, the dungeons needed more variety. There are various types of weapons in Boyfriend Dungeon The same can be said of the bosses. In the whole game we will have to deal with five bosses: the first two, unfortunately, are the same repeated creature. Overall, the bosses are cheesy both in terms of design and challenge. Our character becomes powerful so quickly that he can destroy bosses in seconds. The final enemy, in particular, is divided into various phases and many of these are annihilated by our attacks so quickly as to prevent them from performing even a single move. The combat is therefore not equal to the ~real~ dungeon crawlers, but allows you to distract yourself a little lightly between one narrative sequence and the next. Boyfriend Dungeon isn't a pure dating simulator and it isn't a pure dungeon crawler: it's a mix that finds a strange but pleasant balance, aiming for light-heartedness. We are talking about a simple and shallow game (it must be said that it deals with topics such as stalking, but does not use dramatic tones and does not depict provocative scenes), but - if you have always thought of playing a dating simulator and were afraid of getting bored in front of hours read-only - Boyfriend Dungeon is a great solution. It's a pity that in stylistic terms the care placed on the characters is not equaled by that placed on the dungeons and enemies. There are two dungeons in the game: a shopping mall and a nightclub. The rooms are practically all identical and the enemies are a jumble of technological objects (telephones, televisions, flying VHS) and other random things (cocktail glasses, giant mouths, big monstrous hands): considering that they represent our character's fears, yes it could have dared with some more particular design. Finally, the soundtrack is pleasant, even if it has few tracks.", "date": "2021-08-22", "grade": "6.8"}
