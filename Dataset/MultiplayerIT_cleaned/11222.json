{"name": "Faraday Protocol: la recensione di un affascinante puzzle game in prima persona tutto italiano", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/faraday-protocol-recensione.html", "text": "Architect Raug Zeekon is a curious fellow, an interstellar archaeologist exploring ancient alien ruins for a highly evolved race. Hence his indomitable confidence, which is however put to the test when he arrives in a strange place, a complex of pyramids enclosed within an energy barrier from which one cannot escape, except by solving a series of puzzles designed to select the candidates for a mysterious project. This is the brief background to a title developed by the Brescia-based studio Red Koi Box, author of a first-person puzzle game that refers to the cornerstones of the genre by asking the player to escape from a futuristic installation controlled by an enigmatic artificial intelligence. But despite being indebted to the titles that preceded it, it takes its own path, in style and mechanics, the main protagonists of the game and, inevitably, of the Faraday Protocol review. The gameplay, almost all puzzle with a pinch of action Strange pyramids, Egyptian statues and sci-fi technologies blend into the setting of Faraday Protocol Faraday Protocol, also available for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X | S and Nintendo Switch, does not play its game in terms of narrative dimension. There is certainly no lack of a plot to glue the 30 puzzles divided into 6 chapters that represent its structure and, it must be said, the suggestion of being observed by an artificial intelligence, called IRIS, is important for creating a pinch of tension in a title without enemies to face, but it is secondary to the raw gameplay that represents almost the entire experience, with the exception of the final sequence. Speaking of game mechanics, the formula, such as the plot that pits a fugitive against an AI, refers to the great classics of the genre, allowing us to use two different types of energy. In this case, however, the first form of energy, red in colour, is used to power while the second, blue, is necessary to make connections, bringing the power up to mechanisms or puzzles to activate them or alter their functioning. A couple of rooms are enough to become familiar with dynamics that are quite simple at the root, only to become more complicated as the challenge gradually increases. In this regard, the alien tool that is granted to us to dispose of these energies, called Bia-Tool, allows you to keep and shoot only one orb of energy, red or blue, at a time, while to overcome the more complex puzzles you need several orbs of red energy and several of blue energy, to be used in the right sequence and in the right rooms of a puzzle. We are therefore forced to take advantage of totems that allow you to temporarily deposit an energy globe and others that allow you to convert a blue one into a red one, trying to find the right combination to overcome the puzzle and move on to the next one. However, other variables must be added to this. The mechanisms to be activated can in fact be other puzzles based on sequences of symbols or lights, necessary to open a door or activate an elevator. Also there are bridges of light, red and blue, which can only be crossed when the Bia-Tool contains the energy type of the same color. Lastly, the same thing applies to the jumping platforms which, together with the timed snap platforms, are part of the platform dynamics of the title, barely sketched and not particularly difficult, but still useful for giving a little variety to the experience. In the Faraday Protocol, red energy provides power while blue energy makes contacts to bring energy to doors and mechanisms In fact, many puzzles recycle similar dynamics and end up being all too easy to understand, excluding the inevitable moment of initial loss, or repetitive. The difficulty, in many cases, lies only in exploring, understanding how the puzzle works and having the patience to complete sequences which, once understood, are nothing short of self-evident. Other puzzles, on the other hand, are well thought out and offer greater satisfaction, even if the degree of challenge is never particularly high. In this regard, we would not have disdained a greater exploitation of physics or a pinch of action, in the style of the never surpassed Portal, but we must admit that Faraday Protocol sets the mind in motion without being frustrating and offers about ten hours of pleasant gameplay, commensurate with the price of 19.99 euros, not counting the 18 collectible statuettes often hidden very well. The technical sector: between art deco and science fiction The Faraday Protocol puzzles also include a vertical dimension made up of elevators and piasjumping platforms The appeal of the Faraday Protocol setting is undeniable, despite the limited polygon count and not-so-refined implementation of reflections. In fact, these only involve the lights that fall directly into the player's view and this setting creates some anomalies. But when everything works they enhance an imaginary that by merging art deco, Egyptian-style ruins and lasers recalls in part The Talos Principle, to remain in the field of puzzle games, and in part Stargate, perhaps also used as inspiration. The short plot, in fact, speaks of interstellar travel, ancient races and genetic mysteries, also leaving us a choice, at the end, to give further meaning to the only true narrative sequence of the game. Nonetheless, the dialogues, which fill the space between the puzzles and break up an ambient music that is content to be functional to the atmosphere, can count on good dubbing, unfortunately all in English despite the Italian origin of the development team. The male voice, to be honest, does not have a perfect pronunciation, but the female one, the one that gives life to the artificial intelligence IRIS, works great and represents a fundamental element for a modest title but which, net of some ingenuity and of savings, knows how to entertain. The puzzles also extend outside the pyramids, where lights and reflections make the Faraday Protocol atmosphere even more suggestive Of course, to enjoy it it is necessary to endure an introduction outdoors made in an approximate way, the rare but tangible risk of getting stuck in some levels and the aforementioned anomalies in the reflections which, however, are overabundant and when they work they offer suggestive glimpses. Note, among other things, a good implementation of NVIDIA DLSS technology, obviously in the PC version and bound to NVIDIA GeForce RTX cards, despite the modest size of the project. Not that upscaling based on artificial intelligence is necessary, considering that we are talking about a title that runs without any compromises even on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970, but it is useful considering the possibility of playing at high framerates even on mobile GPUs such as NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 and 3050 Ti.", "date": "2021-09-09", "grade": "7.5"}
