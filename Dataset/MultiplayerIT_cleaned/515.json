{"name": "Tetris DS", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tetris-ds-2.html", "text": "A genius named Pajitnov It is truly incredible to be faced with such an old game, indeed even archaeological given the pace of technological progress, and to find oneself literally caged by its charm and playability. And the beauty is that Tetris has been re-proposed on a regular basis on practically every gaming system, obtaining the same result on every occasion for expert and non-experienced players. For this DS version, Nintendo has not limited itself to proposing the original, but rather has included a series of additions and variations on the theme capable of refreshing a mechanic that has never felt the weight of the years. Standard mode, as the name suggests, is actually the more classic mode; you have to fit the blocks and eliminate rows to go to the next level. While the actual game takes place on the lower screen, the upper one is populated by Nintendo characters, one for each different mode, such as Samus, Mario, Yoshi and Link who move around the settings of their respective games. Compared to the original, this DS edition has been enriched in mechanics, or rather some aspects have been included capable of making life easier for the player. First of all, it is possible to activate a ~shadow~ that indicates where the piece will fall, then allowing it to be immediately transported to its destination by pressing the cross upwards. Also, once you reach the bottom, the block doesn't immediately attach to the ones below, but can be rotated with the A and B keys and in many cases moved to different areas. Finally, with the back keys it is possible to hold a block to use it later, so as to plan your strategy in a better way. The Pressing mode is certainly among the most successful of the ~alternative~ ones. In summary, the two challengers find themselves having to eliminate lines within the same single rectangle of play; one builds up, the other down. The ultimate goal is to push the opponent to the edge of the screen. The Touch mode, as the name suggests, is instead framed around the particular capabilities of the console; in front of a tower of blocks, the aim is to move them with the stylus to form lines and then eliminate them all. The Puzzle mode, on the other hand, is a more puzzle-oriented variation; faced with a screen of pre-established blocks, it is necessary to choose a block from a pre-established series together with its orientation. All this for at least 3 consecutive blocks, with the aim of eliminating all the lines present; the levels of this mode are 200, thus ensuring excellent longevity. The Missions mode brings the game closer to the original mechanics, however requiring you to perform precise actions such as, for example, eliminating a precise number of lines or performing the same action with a given block. The difficulty is increased by an increasingly tighter time limit. Finally, the Space mode represents the most daring experiment, since the aim is to build a kind of single large meteorite with the blocks falling from above, to then explode. In general, although all the different variations of the theme are undoubtedly less valid than the main mode, the commitment of the programmers in trying to offer an overall package that was not a simple copy-and-paste of a 20-year-old game should certainly be commended . Online! Where Tetris DS finds its most exhilarating and entertaining expression is undoubtedly in multiplayer. In local mode, up to 10 people can take part in challenges to the last block to Standard, Pressing or Missions, even with a single copy of the game that can be shared with other players. There is also the connection via Wi-Fi Connection, extremely improved compared to the embryonic version present in Mario Kart thanks to wider possibilities for managing one's friends list. In this case the modes are only Standard with 2 or 4 players and Pressing. From a technical point of view there is not much to say, and it would be difficult to actually think otherwise from the point of view of a game like Tetris. Nonetheless, the Nintendo style has been really well implemented both in terms of graphics, with the various modes each associated with a famous series of the great N, and for the sound with unmistakable songs for every fan of the Kyoto house. Comment Tetris DS represents an excellent version of Pajitnov's classic, capable of keeping its feeling intact and even introducing some innovations that are actually well implemented within the original mechanics. Also interesting are the different modes present, more or less successful variations on the theme all in all capable of arousing interest in the player, without however mai outshine the major version. The multiplayer mode is also excellent, both locally and on Wi-Fi Connection. Ultimately, Tetris DS is a game to which very few criticisms can be made, and which could only leave absolute purists indifferent or those who really are fed up with Tetris. Pros Excellent reissue of a classic Interesting new mechanics Excellent multiplayer modes Cons Some variations on the theme not very successful Might disappoint purists It's Tetris, stay away from those who can't take it anymore The expansion of the video game market in the last 10 years has led more and more people to get to know the world of electronic entertainment; as a result, the most commercially successful titles have become truly popular, in some cases transcending the playful reality to affect other sectors as well. More generally, talking about video games is no longer a nerd's thing, and rather represents a topic on which we can discuss with an increasing number of people. But there is a game, released long before the boom in the sector, which has really entered popular culture, becoming famous and known even to the laymen of this world. More than Pong, probably more than Pac-Man, not to mention recent phenomena like Tomb Raider and Resident Evil just to name a few. We are obviously talking about Tetris, an absolute masterpiece of game design which reached its best expression with that version for Game Boy released in 1989, and which represented a killer app of absolute importance for the Nintendo portable. Today, 17 years later, history repeats itself. Again Tetris, still on a handheld from the big N, still a success.", "date": "2006-05-02", "grade": null}
