{"name": "Anacapri: The Dream - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/anacapri-the-dream-recensione.html", "text": "Indiana Jones on Capri In Anacapri: The Dream, we play Nico N, a famous scholar of antiquity called to Anacapri by the local authorities to investigate a mysterious object, the Obsidian Disc, of which various legends speak but which no one has ever been able to find. Local archaeologists are groping in the dark, while even criminals are focusing their efforts on the search for the Disc, which according to beliefs would give a power as strong as the misfortune it would bring to its owner: this is how the authorities therefore intend to find the object before other bad guys. Without going any further so as not to spoil the gaming experience, we can say that the S&G Software production enjoys an engaging plot, which will keep the player glued to the monitor for a very appreciable amount of hours in terms of longevity, arriving between reality and dream possibility to experience 2 different endings. Thus begins our adventure in Anacapri, where we will find ourselves moving through really existing alleys and small squares, according to the classic canons of first-person graphic adventure, that is, clicking in the sensitive areas of the screen which will thus allow us to take a certain direction or interact with an object on the screen. At our disposal also an inventory, which is also clearly classical, in which we will be able to examine, use and combine the objects at our disposal. The puzzles of Anacapri  The Dream stand at medium levels, even if a little more effort is needed for some of them, but if we really don't have to figure them out, a solution is available dedicated precisely to the puzzles judged more difficult by the developers . Among the nicest puzzles we find that of the ATM (we will have to find the code of a card in our possession to obtain the local currency, the Caprino) and the fun game of broom, also typically summer. Capri is born The peculiarity of this game lies, as mentioned several times, in the ~graphics section~, essentially made up of photographs taken on the places where the adventure takes place, with an almost obsessive attention to detail: if, for example, we find ourselves having to cross walk an alley where perhaps there is nothing relevant to the continuation of the game, we will still have the opportunity to walk as if we were really there, that is, crossing the entire street almost as if we were doing it step by step. Not surprisingly, in addition to the adventure itself, there is also a walk mode, thanks to which you can appreciate the wonders of Capri without having to play the game: for this reason, the advice is in any case to take advantage of this opportunity after having finished the game, as - as the developers warn - it is possible to run into advances that inevitably end up ruining the pleasure of discovering the whole plot. Even the characters in the game are nothing more than really existing people, photographed, whose movements resemble a sort of photo story. As a small evolution compared to Un Tranquillo Weekend a Capri, we find some animations, for example those introduced for water and fire, placed quite credibly on the background photos. As far as the audio is concerned, there is a soundtrack suitable enough to maintain the aura of mystery that surrounds us in the adventure, while the dubbing goes on and off: sometimes the impression is in fact that it is a little too marked the Neapolitan-Caprese accent in some figures, even if it must be said that it could still have been done on purpose to slightly mock the classic aristocratic tone of some person existing in reality. Comment A production like Anacapri  The Dream obviously cannot compete with titles on the world stage, based on huge investments. It is clearly an independent production, placed at the upper limit of the amateur, but which finds its beauty precisely in its simplicity: without any kind of frills, the player is directly projected into the mystery surrounding Capri and the Obsidian Disc, taken both from the plot, both from the splendid views that the game itself provides during our wanderings to try to solve the mystery. If you are still in the city suffering from the heat, this summer graphic adventure is for you, halfway between gaming and tourism, as it will put you in a position to appreciate the splendid places that have made the island of Capri is a popular destination for travelers from all over the world.

After A Quiet Weekend in Capri, S&G Software (whose name comes from the initials of Silvio and Gey Savarese, two university professors with a passion for video games) is once again making headlines with Anacapri: The Dream, this time set in the other half of the blue island. Produced by Adventure's Planet, the game is presented as a Myst-style first-person graphic adventure, however characterized by the presence of photos actually taken in Anacapri to act as the graphics: no 2D or 3D therefore, only and simply photographs of real places existing ones, obviously minimally retouched to allow the game's imaginative plot to develop.", "date": "2007-08-07", "grade": null}
