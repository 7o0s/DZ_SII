The Roll7 title, although it has been acclaimed by anyone who has tried it, is certainly not among the most talked about games of the year. Too bad, because it deserves much greater consideration, as demonstrated by the second and last DLC released in recent days, which takes us in search of the lost city of Radlantis. Find out if we could find it in the OlliOlli World: Finding the Flowzone review, the perfect corollary to an excellent experience. Gusts of wind The gusts of wind mechanic has succeeded and makes OlliOlli World: Finding the Flowzone a must have experience As already happened with Void Riders, the previous DLC, the new levels of Finding the Flowzone also require a minimum of knowledge of the world of OlliOlli World to be found. Nothing dramatic or too complex, but consider that it is a content that is located about halfway through the story of the base game and that must be searched for in the old levels, following very simple indications. The events narrated take place immediately after those of Void Raiders and see the protagonist joined by the Radmospheric Three, eccentric explorers in search of Radlantis, who must first recover the lost pieces of the map that allows you to reach it, scattered in the Flowzone from one of their rival. As easily understood, the narrative part of the DLC is very light, surreal at the right point so as not to clash with the rest of the game. Don't misunderstand, because it's very well written and it's nice to read the jokes of the various characters, but ultimately it's just an excuse to try your hand at the new courses, set in the clouds and designed for players looking for new challenges. Of course, there are also some new cosmetic items to customize the character, which form a good outline to the experience, but in general the focus is on the new levels, seventeen in total for about four hours of gameplay, characterized by the introduction of a unedited, that of the Windzones, i.e. the gusts of wind that lift the character vertically and force the player to make abrupt and often sudden maneuvers, altering the classic gameplay and adding a new level of complexity that will certainly be appreciated by veterans. So here we are grappling with longer combos while we perform stunts for the skies of Radlandia, caught in the network of levels with an intricate design, but always respectful of the player and of what is the vision of OlliOlli World, of which Finding the Flowzone represents almost a 'natural appendix, which does not appear forced in any way and which, on the contrary, enriches the gameplay in a very intelligent and dynamic way. The best expansion? OlliOlli World: Finding the Flowzone doesn't last very long, but what it offers is remarkable The gusts of wind lift us into the sky, make us change direction, allow us to reach hidden areas with great intelligence and, above all, give us the opportunity to dust off all the skills developed by playing, in a context different from the classic one, by levels fast and spectacular, difficult to finish but harbingers of great satisfaction, to the point that we can define them among the best of OlliOlli World, if not really the best ever. In certain moments for rhythm and speed they reminded us of the best Sonic, that of some 2D chapters. For the rest, the game is the same, that is, the graphic style remains unchanged and the attention to detail is always stratospheric. After all, a DLC is not intended to revolutionize, but to expand. So if the starting point is excellent, it is likely that the expansion is too. At least it's unlikely that it will spoil anything. At best it may be superfluous. Having said that, the only flaw of OlliOlli World: Finding the Flowzone, if we want to consider it as such, is the relative brevity, however compensated by the time it takes to really master all the levels and by the beauty of the new game dynamics. The bottom line is that if you liked OlliOlli World, you simply have to play this DLC which, together with Void Riders, completes the experience, making it even better than it already was.", "date": "2022-11-09", "grade": null}
