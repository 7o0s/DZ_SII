Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Do you think you have talent in the field of music? Can you sing, can you play any instruments and write songs? Well, then make a homemade demo with some songs and start sending it around to record companies, but keep in mind that no one will ever answer you. The reason is obvious: the Italian record market has almost completely disappeared, they only sell the usual suspects, so the labels no longer have anyone to go and discover young talents because they don't have the budget to be able to promote them. Better to bet on the winners of a talent show, who have a good fan base and are therefore already known. But don't be discouraged, you can try contests. There are many, from local to national, but even there the rules are quite clear: those who have certain knowledge or those who are already famous (the veterans of the aforementioned talent shows) go ahead, but above all they are automatically excluded from the final stages those who have passed a certain age (generally twenty-five years). Also consider that the skimming in these areas is so strong that ~one in a thousand makes it~; or even less, at the end of the day. So what's left? Of course, the so-called ~artistic producers~, those who know a lot about the market, know the directors of the record companies and can act as a bridge. You just have to make a professional demo in their studios (price: from three thousand euros upwards) and then they'll organize listening sessions with those who count. Only that probably won't lead to anything either. But how, they were so sure! In the meantime years will have passed and maybe even the desire to continue on that path. Long life for aspiring musicians, huh? Unless they are the protagonists of Band Stars, the new casual game produced by Halfbrick Studios and developed by Six Foot Kid. Quite evidently inspired by the Kairosoft simulations, the game sees us form a band, write hits (initially self-produced), grow the elements of the group and gradually obtain higher positions in the charts and greater popularity. Band Stars starts from a very interesting idea, but doesn't develop it adequately and in the end disappoints My band plays cock The mechanics on which the gameplay of Band Stars is based are quite simple. At the beginning we are asked to select some characters on the basis of their musical preferences and abilities, and with them a starting formation is created which can then be enriched by further elements by organizing auditions. When all the members of the group are in the rehearsal room (a scenario visualized in ~three quarters~ just like in the most famous Kairosoft titles), you have to choose a combination of musical genre and theme (for example ~pop~ and ~love~, or ~ dance~ and ~party~, to mention the classic ones), after which we start with the writing of the song, the recording of the tracks and the mixing. The first and last operation must be performed by a single individual, possibly gifted for creativity and precision, while recording is a team effort and everyone can contribute according to their characteristics. At this juncture, the ~inspiration~ points can be used to perform a solo and multiply the final score of the piece, even if their quantity is limited and you have to wait some time for them to recharge, or make an in-app purchase . Once all these practices have been completed, the song is released and debuts in the charts, in a more or less high position depending on the assumptions. With the money earned from sales and royalties, you can buy new tools (which improve the various scores), pay ~experiences~ to individual group members to improve them, or get ~leisure~ tools that allow musicians to recover part of their energy, an element that works through well-tested methods and characteristics of the freemium model. The problem with Band Stars is that it doesn't go beyond this: the incipit is interesting and some original ideas, but the interaction that is required of the player is typical of management-type casual games, therefore very scarce. This translates into a very limited experience, in which all you do is complete the objectives that are reported to us from time to time (do thiscombination, play this type of song with this instrument, perform a workout for dude or dude, etc.), without even being able to count on a technical sector capable of standing out. Not even on the sound front, terribly anonymous.", "date": "2013-12-07", "grade": "6.0"}
