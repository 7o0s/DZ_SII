The work done by Purple Lamp seems to have come out of the manual of the perfect tie-in of the first decade of the 2000s, proposing action to platforms with assorted skills, transformations and variables as one might expect from the more classic tradition of Nickelodeon licensed games. And it's not a bad thing at all, on the contrary: also considering the scarcity of new titles of this type on the market (at least among productions of a certain thickness), we welcome this new SpongeBob adventure with open arms, if only to immerse ourselves again in Bikini Bottom, which is always a pleasure. After an unusually long hiatus between 2015 and 2020, we've all seen a significant amount of SpongeBob-related projects coming together in the gaming arena, among which the genre of titles is emerging by Purple Lamp, which after SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated continues on its way leaving the general structure substantially unchanged but adding a lot of originality in this new The Cosmic Shake. On the other hand, while the previous one was a sort of remake, in this case we are faced with something new and the developers were able to indulge themselves in inserting some new game mechanics and building a new and crazy story to stage. SpongeBob in the Jelly Multiverse SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, a scene from the medieval world In the first few minutes, the dynamic duo made up of SpongeBob and Patrick find themselves able to even upset the space-time fabric, causing lacerations towards new dimensions, just to give an idea of the madness of this story. On the other hand, if siren tears are made available to our two heroes capable of granting any wish, the destruction of the dimensional continuum is practically the least we can expect, and in fact it happens. During a Bikini Bottom fair, the two friends stumble upon Madame Kassandra's stall of ancient magical objects, and are immediately fascinated by a strange, shiny bottle. The very unenthusiastic shopkeeper does not seem to give much weight to the discovery, saying (with little conviction) that it is a substance capable of making wishes come true, creating soap bubbles. SpongeBob and Patrick seize the opportunity with their usual enthusiasm and begin to make wishes and create burst balloons. Unfortunately, they realize too late that the object belongs to the god Neptune and that it really works, if the person using it is pure in heart, precisely like the protagonist with the square underpants. What follows is a cataclysm that rips apart the reality of Bikini Bottom leaving the country in ruins and creating a series of alternate dimensions in which the various wishes expressed have been fulfilled, connected by portals to the standard reality. And, as if that weren't enough, in all this Patrick finds himself transformed into a balloon, by the way. SpongeBob's mission, to try to put things right, is to explore the various worlds by completing their respective missions, which usually involve various platform sessions, clashes with mysterious enemies and even final battles against various bosses. Last but not least, everything is also done by wearing various flamboyant alternative costumes for our hero, ~kindly~ provided by Madame Kassandra at the price of cosmic jelly and gold doubloons. Action and platforms Spongebob in the prehistoric world, with themed suit As for the gameplay, SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake follows the classic canons of the 3D action platform in a rather faithful way, so much so that it seems to come directly from the first decade of the 2000s. The mechanics are what you would expect from a title of the genre: it's about jumping, fighting using some attack or evasive movements and interacting with characters and elements of the scenario in different situations. Although the fundamental base can only be derivative and rather far from the best examples of platform games, the madness of SpongeBob's world comes to the rescue by staging a truly remarkable variety of settings and situations, to tell the truth excellently exploited also from the Purple Lamp team, who have been able to build some rather interesting levels. Each of the seven explorable worlds is characterized by a dominant theme (the far west, cinema, pirates and so on) which influences the graphic representationica but also some specific elements of the gameplay. Spongebob's progression is grafted into these strange contexts, who finds himself learning new skills and exploiting them in different contexts, but also taking them with him to other worlds and thus progressively expanding the possibilities of movement, interaction and exploration. SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake sees us engaged in the reconstruction of Bikini Bottom The license for the seahorse or the flying kick capable of breaking through walls and jumping higher are therefore also useful for reaching new points in the scenario and the construction of the levels is generally quite complex and captivating, presenting alternative routes and secrets to discover. Combat with enemies is perhaps the least successful element of the package, but this too replicates the classic style of the genre a bit, since it works as a glue between the parts and as a condition for increasing the level of challenge to be integrated into the phase platform. Finally, a very convincing element is given by the amount of events and variations of mechanics that we can find within the different worlds. Also following the various steps of the narrative, SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake transforms the gameplay several times for a few minutes (racing on bizarre vehicles, platforming with 2D structure, scrolling beat 'em up and so on). All this, combined with boss fights, manages to guarantee a remarkable assortment. Old style SpongeBob and Patrick in the Halloween-style dimension Based on a cartoon of this magnitude, the graphic characterization does not have to invent much, already being able to count on highly recognizable and charismatic characters and settings. The game does an excellent job of reproducing typical stories and situations of the series in an interactive form, also thanks to an excellent writing between the script and dialogues (in English, subtitled in Italian). The premise then allowed Purple Lamp to indulge itself, proposing 7 different settings with specific themes, which made a considerable variety natural in terms of atmospheres, scenarios and even game mechanics, considering the specific elements of each mission. The result is a platformer that encourages progressive exploration of each of its parts, at least from the point of view of the story and the discovery of new content. As for the actual action, the problems that often emerge in 3D platformers are revealed of not exactly excellent caliber: the precision in the control system is definitely not at the level of the best Nintendo productions, to give a simple and perhaps even a little unfair example. SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, a ~kung fu movie~-style race across the rooftops The addition of the double jump and the glide also serve to allow a certain margin of error to the movements which can become difficult, also because the framing often does not offer the best vision and needs to be constantly corrected. On Nintendo Switch, beyond a not exactly remarkable resolution, there is also a certain inconsistency in the performances, which seem to fluctuate around 30 fps with a few too many drops, but these are defects that are especially noticeable with the console connected to the TV, while they become much less incisive in portability. The interlude sequences are accurate and pleasant, in line with the cartoon even if reproduced in 3D, while the soundtrack is appropriately calibrated on the different settings that we find ourselves going through. For those who are used to following the series on TV and are fond of the voices of the Italian version, the lack of speech in our language can be heavy and it is a pity, especially considering that there are numerous languages from various geographical areas but not the Italian.", "date": "2023-01-30", "grade": "7.0"}
