Born from the fervent mind of Chris Sawyer, the man to whom we also owe the splendid Transport Tycoon, the Rollercoaster Tycoon series has literally made the history of old-fashioned management. After a whole series of commercial vicissitudes that we are not here to tell you to avoid boring you, the brand ended up in the hands of Frontier Development which, just a year ago, thought it well to exploit it to bring the fourth official chapter to the tablet and smartphone market. A sequel that sifted freely in the free to play with unfortunate mechanics that decreed a resounding and devastating failure. Evidently back on milder advice and having spent enough time licking his wounds, the developer has therefore decided to surprisingly publish a faithful and accurate port of Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 by distributing it exclusively on the iOS platforms. No free to play, in app purchases or unlockable content but the entire original game that can be purchased for just under 5. While we greatly appreciate the total change of course that goes completely in favor of the players, we don't feel like fully promoting the project and now we will try to explain why. Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 arrives on iOS in all its glory but also with a few flaws too many Once upon a time, this is how it was played Let's start immediately by saying that Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, already on its own, was not the most appreciated chapter where the first two episodes are still considered great classics today. The reasons are many: it was the first exponent of the series not to be drawn and designed by Chris Sawyer who hid this time behind the simple supervisory role; it was also the first chapter to adopt a completely 3D graphics engine, completely abandoning the isometric view and the very colorful cartoon art style; it also made the management of the shops and all the rides much deeper, but also more complicated. The conversion therefore transfers all the positive and negative characteristics of this chapter to the present day, offering iPhone and iPad owners the opportunity to experience the original contents of this playground management simulator. To explain the gameplay very briefly, in Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 the player will not only have to physically build the various attractions, the paths, the shops, all the structures necessary for the correct functioning of the park and the elements to beautify the scenario. He will then have to manage everything with great care by hiring staff, modifying the functioning of the rides and kiosks to keep the happiness of the guests and obviously the profits of the entire activity under control, also managing the budget for the search for novelties to be installed in the park. the request and collection of loans and the launch of advertising campaigns so as to keep the flow of visitors under control. The simulation is extremely deep and complex and certainly not suitable for the typical smartphone and tablet player who will instead have to devote time and patience to managing his amusement park before seeing the fruits of his meticulous work blossom. The title basically offers two game modes: a campaign with the original eighteen scenarios of the PC version and a sandbox called unlimited play. In the first case, these are pre-built parks that are given to the player with specific objectives to be achieved usually in a limited amount of time. For example, we will have to reach a certain value of the structure, or have a certain number of guests or, again, not let happiness fall below a certain value. There will be scenarios where we maybe have to build only water attractions or maybe we have to renovate all the attractions and so on. Not all scenarios will be available from the start, but those available can still be played in any order you want while the more advanced ones will have to be unlocked by completing the previous ones. Furthermore, by completing the most difficult objectives of each scenario, we will also unlock special routes of the most profitable rides (especially roller coasters). The unlimited mode instead allows you to face a free game without any type of constraint, not even monetary, and it is the best way to study the game mechanics properly and perhaps dedicate yourself to the design of very elaborate tracks without warning the player.eso of the objectives to complete. The first problem of this conversion lurks precisely on the first element just described: Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 offers a tutorial that defining antediluvian is an understatement and which is based entirely on videos that can be viewed via a link to YouTube. Yes, you read that right: there is a menu dedicated to training and understanding the basic mechanics but it only serves as a shortcut to the YouTube app. And the thing takes on an even more surreal contour when you consider that the game does not require any type of online connection to work as it is a completely single player experience. Woe to having big fingers! Going into the details of the gameplay and after having accumulated a few dozen hours on the game, one realizes that, concretely, Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 has nothing really criticizable in terms of gameplay and simulation quality. There is truly everything you can expect from a hardcore PC production with an attention to detail that can be truly satisfying when you feel in control of the situation and fully understand all the various menus and variables to keep under control. There is a lot of freedom on every single element of your playground and there is no shortage of weather conditions and day/night cycle with even a handful of themes to choose from the embellishments of your scenery to emulate the world's most famous amusement parks with the various ~zones~. The problems actually all reside in the interface and more generally in the quality of this adaptation to the touch control system and the screens of the iPhone and iPad. In fact, if on the one hand it must be recognized that in terms of managing the 3D camera the use of the fingers works perfectly with intuitive and very reactive movement, rotation and zoom, everything concerning the management of the on-screen interface leaves much to be desired . First of all, several buttons are far too small to be easily touched with the finger and it will very often happen that you press a button or select an element when instead you wanted to touch the one immediately nearby. With all that goes with it when in trash mode. Among other things, it is not clear why some buttons of the main interface, such as the one relating to guest satisfaction, are not clickable as a shortcut to the internal screens. But what will make you perform millions of bad words, generating an enormous amount of frustration, is the touch management of the construction of the paths that concern both the roads, the rows and the paths, and the tracks of the roller coasters and other attractions with free itineraries especially when you have to take into account variable heights. The interface, in these situations, is really not very intuitive and forces the player to continually go back to correct path errors. And unfortunately this cumbersomeness will lead you in the very short term to prefer the pre-built courses every time you have to install a new roller coaster, eliminating an element of great value from the game, and in the medium and long term to dampen your desire to embark on elaborate and embellishments of the paths able to make your playgrounds aesthetically more varied and attractive. From a purely technical point of view, Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 is in all respects identical to its original release for PC: therefore all the game elements are pleasant and well defined with the exception of the visitors who show super deformed connotations that are rather ugly to see, obviously thanks to the reduced polygonal mass. On our iPad mini 2 testing then, we have detected significant slowdowns in the game progressing in the game probably due to the increase in complexity of the scenarios as they fill up with elements. There are some minimal graphical settings that can be used to lighten the complexity of what is shown on the screen but the results are barely perceptible. Finally, the game is completely localized in Italian, apart from the infamous tutorials described above.", "date": "2015-08-21", "grade": "7.5"}
