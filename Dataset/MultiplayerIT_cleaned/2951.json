The narrative canvas that binds the action is the most banal and direct: we ended up on an alien planet and we must be able to survive from level to level until we find an escape route. All this translates into a frenetic third-person shooter, designed mainly to be played in cooperatives, but also usable alone, focused on collecting power-ups and on continuous shooting at enemies that appear at random points in the scenario and who never stop torment ourselves until we have managed to activate a teleporter, we have defeated the boss of the level and we have managed to jump to the next one, where the formula repeats itself unchanged. What the player has to do is basically kill the hostile creatures to accumulate the money needed to open the various containers scattered around the maps, some of which elements are procedurally generated (objects, starting position), where you can find the much coveted upgrades. The latter give the most disparate effects and are cumulative. For example, they can increase our rate of fire, or give us a protective barrier after each kill, or give us a double jump and so on. Upon reaching certain objectives, new classes of survivors are unlocked, all of which can be selected at the start of the game, and alien artifacts are obtained which, when selected, modify the games themselves. shootings In general, Risk of Rain 2 has a very fast pace and, regardless of the selected class, all you do is shoot wildly against enemies trying to take out as many of them as possible in the shortest possible time, so as not to grow too much the difficulty of the waves (there is an active timer in each level that indicates what level of difficulty we are at and how much is left to unlock the next one). Their enemies are of many different types and range from giant insects that attack us emerging from the ground, to the soldiers of an alien race of anthropomorphic lizards capable of using weapons, up to large robots or alien creatures as imposing as they are powerful, which inhabit the advanced levels. Of course there are also the bosses: very large enemies with a huge health bar, which offer an additional challenge to the player, especially since they must be fought while dodging the attacks of all the other aliens. If we want, this is precisely the problem of the Hopoo Games title: it does not give a moment's respite, but does not even guarantee variations in the action. You shoot, shoot and shoot, without having to do anything else from start to finish, whatever hero you are using and whatever enemy we are facing. The bosses themselves, despite having their own attack patterns, provide little in the way of variety of action. The important thing is not to break the cycle of killing and collecting items, which is essential to get to the end. Unfortunately in this way even the shootings are impoverished. The enemies are generally very resistant, but the feedback from our hits that hit are weak, almost insignificant and transform the battles into a kind of race to consume the opponents' energy. Even the fact that you don't know where they come from makes the gameplay problematic, because in fact you can never develop a real tactic and you have to constantly improvise, hoping to be lucky in collecting objects. In some ways it's even good, since we're talking about a roguelike, but it's inevitable that after a few hours of playing the monotony of everything can be tiring. Furthermore, since it is practically impossible to avoid all attacks, we often end up lying without knowing exactly how and without having been able to do anything to avoid it, just because perhaps enemies have appeared behind us without warning. The situation is different if you have friends available to play, since the company increases the chaos and makes everything more sensible, making accidental deaths lose their heaviness. But as we know, friends make Dangerous Streets fun too, so it's difficult to count them among the game features. Graphics From a technical point of view, Risk of Rain 2 shows its nature as an independent production without shyness. Cleverly the developers didn't bet on a muscle test with their first 3D production (Risk of Rain was a pixel art game), but chose a stylemore sober and easily readable graphic, which allows for very high fluidity even on systems that are not exactly the most recent. Of course, the level of detail is very low and, despite the presence of several biomes, the overall impact is not helped by the fact that the maps do not seem to have a strong design behind them that has also thought of them from a scenographic point of view. Be that as it may, given the type of game you can be satisfied. After all, it's not a studio like Hopoo Games that you want to be amazed at.", "date": "2020-08-19", "grade": "7.0"}
