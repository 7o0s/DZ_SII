{"name": "Madden NFL 09 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/madden-nfl-09-recensione_a.html", "text": "There has been talk on several occasions of what the Wii ~promises~ were, of the degree of involvement it should have offered due to the particularity of its controllers; involvement often disregarded, in favor of mediocre solutions both from a technical and gameplay point of view. Within such a ~difficult~ scenario, Electronic Arts was not intimidated: it continued undaunted to do its best to bring the various sports series to the Nintendo console and to do it in the best way. Without proposing a mandatory match between the movement of the controller and what happens on the screen, but looking for the best possible compromise between that type of approach and classic gameplay. As far as Madden NFL is concerned, this forward-thinking policy has resulted in three excellent episodes, which on balance represent probably the best sports series available for Wii. All Play! Madden NFL 09 for Wii shows off the ~All-Play~ suffix, which characterizes some of the latest EA Sports products. It is a system which, in the intentions of the developers, allows practically anyone to play: the setting of the controls and the precision required to perform the various actions change according to our degree of experience, and in this specific case it is even possible play using only the Wii-mote, reducing our interventions to the minimum wage and watching the team take on the rest of the work automatically. Less ~casual~ users, or perhaps those who already know Madden NFL, can of course connect the Nunchuck and directly control the movement of the players, scrolling from one to another thanks to the A button and taking advantage of all the advanced this episode of the series. The control system has not changed compared to the 2007 and 2008 editions, so we will be able to run using the analog stick and holding down the B trigger, with the A button which in that case is used to perform unmarked rotations (be careful not to do too many, however ) and the inclination of the controllers to determine any ~dodge~. The passes are carried out through the usual movement of the Wii-mote, and the new ~Call Your Shot~ system can be used: by pressing the A button before a down, we will be able to use the controller to select the player receiving the pass, then draw on the screen the trajectory of his run... a bit like in the Wii version of PES2008, but with the action paused and not in real time. To receive passes in flight, we will have to move the Wii-mote and Nunchuck towards each other at the same time: it is an apparently simple action, but which often fails due to the limitations of the controllers in detecting vertical movement . No problem, however, for tackles: once our player has gotten close enough to the ball carrier, we will have to push the controller forward to block him on the ground, a maneuver that manages to express an excellent sensation of ~impact~. The last of the ~live~ actions that must be performed concerns the set piece, with the Wii-mote that must be moved rapidly upwards to give power to the shot. Both in the defensive and offensive phase we will have complete control of the team, and we will be able to select a strategy (by pointing the Wii-mote on the screen) by fishing among those recommended by John Madden himself, among the numerous basic movements or in the entire repertoire that American football provides. The setting of the controls and the precision required to perform the various actions vary according to our degree of experience. The cheer counts In football as in soccer, the players who score points can produce rather particular celebrations. When we carry out spectacular and productive actions, Madden NFL 09 allows us to try our hand at this curious practice: by shaking the controllers like obsessed people, we will see the player dance and fidget on the screen, and depending on the enthusiasm of our movements, his physical characteristics will be ~pumped up~ for a certain period of time. Adrenaline also counts in video games, apparently! Game mode For this 2009 edition, EA Sports has decided to re-propose all the modes already present previously, modifying some of them (the ~2-on-2~ has become the ~5-on-5~) and making online multiplayer available again. Once the game has started, therefore, we will be able to try our hand at a quick game with random parameters, get familiar with the controls and game actions in a simple and complete tutorial, access the ~Franchise~ or ~Superstar~ modes or challenge a friend online or a stranger, inside ofranked or free matches. The online works very well: you can create your own account, to have access to all the possibilities offered, or enter as a guest and play without waiting. We haven't noticed any lag or other problems, as happens in other Wii games, although it is clear that such a product will see us mostly dealing with American users. Unfortunately there is no possibility of communicating with our opponent, as the developers have not even opposed a series of preset phrases due to the lack of special hardware tools (voice chat). The side modes, including the aforementioned ~5-on-5~ and the simple ~party games~, allow us to play together with friends but exclusively in a local context: if you own more than one Wii-mote / Nunchuck pair , it's time to try. Technical realization If there's one thing that Electronic Arts has taught us, it's never to expect revolutions in the technical aspect of its sports series. A rule that is not denied even in this case: the construction of the field and the polygonal models of the players are those of the previous editions of Madden NFL, as well as the animations that have practically not changed. However, we must recognize the work that has been done to optimize the graphics engine: the actions always take place in a fluid way, without uncertainties or drops in the frame rate, and the interior of the stadium is quite populated and full of details. It is a pity that the audience in the stands are visually represented by two-dimensional and monochrome silhouettes, but to expect anything more would have been misplaced. The interface is excellent as usual, with the pointing system of the Wii-mote that is exploited in the best possible way, alongside the possibility of selecting the various items also with the analog stick of the Nunchuck. The sound sector is typical of EA Sports products: signed soundtrack, with a good number of lively and good quality songs, accompanied by realistic effects and a commentary that is anything but dense. Comment As could be expected, Madden NFL 09 stands as the usual ~more of the same~, which does nothing but add some new features to an already solid structure. The introduction of the ~All-Play~ system is certainly interesting if we want to extend the possibility of playing with the Wii to the whole family, and it has been organized in such a way as to be completely customizable, so we will be able to adjust all the parameters according to the experience of game we want to achieve. The controls work very well, apart from a couple of unfortunate solutions, and the players respond to our inputs with great promptness and precision. The revival of the same modes present in the 2007 and 2008 editions is a bit disappointing, but the presence of a really excellent and rather complete online multiplayer cannot but please. The ~Call Your Shot~ option then adds great depth to the games, giving us some truly spectacular action and greatly increasing the degree of involvement in the action. If you like American football and own a Wii, then Madden NFL 09 is unlikely to disappoint you. Pros Addictive and thick gameplay Technically well done Great online multiplayer Cons Only for football fans Weight modes haven't changed one iota Motion detection not always perfect", "date": "2008-09-04", "grade": null}
