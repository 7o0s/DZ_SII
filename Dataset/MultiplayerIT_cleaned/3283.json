First of all because even before this review of Galakrond's Awakening it managed to give a breath of fresh air to the title on the market since 2014, after a previous year which, on the other hand, had struggled to be appreciated with its even and odd decks. Secondly, because the so-called Team 5 has set up the project of giving a game like Hearthstone a story as well. With the first expansion called The Rise of Shadows, the developers have in fact kicked off the plan of the Legion of M.A.L.E. and its heroes, followed by the response of the League of Explorers with the next expansion Saviors of Uldum. In December we then saw Descent of Dragons, the final part of the implementation of Rafaam's evil plan to awaken the proto-dragon Galakrond, to whom The Awakening of Galakrond is obviously dedicated. A particularly important adventure, because in addition to concluding the narrative arc of the Year of the Dragon it also brings with it a list of new cards straight into the meta, thus dusting off the habit of a few years ago. After spending some time in the company of the first part of Galakrond's Awakening, it's time to express our opinion. Fighting on the Frost Coast In the first episode of this new adventure we find Legion of M.A.L.E. and League of Explorers busy fighting on the cold waters of Northrend. Just as there are two factions in the game, the adventure is divided into as many parts. The first of them, the one relating to the Legion of M.A.L.E., can be played for free even by those who have not purchased the adventure. But before tackling the cost issue, let's briefly see what awaits us in this initial package. The dungeon run-style setting to which we had been accustomed from the last adventures gives way to a kind of return to the past, in which with pre-established decks we are called to face the bosses that one or the other faction puts us against . Thus we go from Ser Pinnus to Reno Jackson, engaged on several occasions against his nemesis Dr. Boom. Between kidnappings, mechanical hooks, special powers and winged creatures, compared to the basic version of the game we find some particular aspects to animate the various clashes, for what we have seen in this first chapter always quite funny and never excessively long. The difficulty level is affordable for all six bosses that we go to fight, with the possibility of facing them again later in heroic mode, which however does not give reward cards but only backs. The novelties introduced by The Awakening of Galakrond in the meta are in fact unlocked as the main adventure is completed, therefore without the need to resort to particular decks to overcome the heroic challenge as happened in some cases in the past, forcing in the most extreme cases even the players to specially craft one or more cards to win the fight. Eleven new cards, waiting for the rest By completing the two parts of Combat on the Cold Coast, eleven cards can be unlocked to be used in both wild and standard formats, to then arrive with the weekly releases of the other episodes to the total of thirty-five expected. Without having the complete list available for building decks, it is unfortunately difficult to say right now if they will all be able to find their own space in the meta, even if there are decks that have already welcomed the new alternatives offered by Blizzard from the very first hours. The most used card at the moment seems to be the Shadow Sculptor, thanks to which the assassin can draw a number of cards equal to those played up to that moment in the turn. A kind of return for the Miracle Rogue, a deck particularly loved by many some time ago. Good application also for the Official Adventurer, through which you can get a coin if you check a mission, and for Fresh Tracks, a twin magic dedicated to the hunter to give +2/+2 to a beast. The cost of Eye of the Storm equal to ten mana instead gives us some doubts about this card dedicated to the shaman, with which to summon three 5/6 elementals equipped with provocation. With Air Raid the paladin gains a good two-mana twin spell, to summon as many silver hand recruits with provocation: still little to bring the good Uther to the top of the players' preferences, even if as we said on the occasion of Descent of Dragons there is some potential for the Pure Paladin. Do I buy or don't I buy? The question that every Hearthstone player will be asking himself at this point is the one concerning whether or not to buy this adventure. About a meand a half hours after the arrival of the latest expansion, for which we have all more or less already invested a sum, Blizzard asks us to put our hands on the purse strings again to buy the individual chapters of Galakrond's Awakening at the price of 6.99 euros (or 700 game gold), or all in one solution for 19.99 euros. Considering what will be the permanence in rotation of the cards together with those of the other expansions, if you are a regular Hearthstone player the purchase is to be considered almost obligatory: obviously much better all together, saving a quarter of the total. The good thing is that unlike the expansions with adventure cards, the amount spent is that and that remains, without the need to go and buy envelopes after envelopes to win a particular card or get the amount of dust necessary to create it. Net of purely economic considerations, as a product in itself The Awakening of Galakrond does not represent any revolution, especially if Hearthstone has become boring by now. If, on the other hand, like many, you still enjoy playing the Blizzard card game, you will still have a handful of hours to spend relaxing outside the ladder.", "date": "2020-01-27", "grade": null}
