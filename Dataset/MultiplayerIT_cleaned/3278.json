{"name": "Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/paranormasight-the-seven-mysteries-of-honjo-recensione.html", "text": "Honjo, the setting of this game, is the southern area of the modern city of Sumida, district of Tokyo, and is today a densely populated area in the huge Japanese megalopolis, between well-kept residential neighborhoods and cutting-edge infrastructure, but it is not always been like this. In ancient times, this area was essentially a swamp until systematic construction began in the mid-Edo period, starting with the great Ryogoku Bridge that connected the central part of Edo to the still wild area. The reclamation involved the construction of numerous canals, which were progressively buried to make room for further buildings and roads, until the original aspect of a marsh full of water and vegetation was completely lost. However, something remained: that idea of a region located on the border between the city and the mysteries of the forest, the dark, stagnant and unhealthy waters that host mysterious and obscure creatures have stimulated stories of spirits and curses over the centuries, remaining imprinted in the common imagination and evolving into urban legends that they persist to the present day. These are the basis of the strange adventure built by Square Enix that we examine in the review of Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo. The Seven Mysteries of Honjo (which often become ten or even more, depending on the versions told by word of mouth) are a collection of the most widespread legends that circulate about the area in question, each connected to a specific curse and intertwined in constitute another fascinating mystery: the Ritual of the Resurrection. The interactive story develops in a choral manner, following different points of view of various characters, all involved in some way with the Seven Mysteries and in the research of the Ritual, victims or perpetrators of a ruthless struggle between the bearers of the curses. ~How far would you go to bring someone back to life?~ It is a sort of motto that Paranormasight presents, and although it may seem like a not too original premise, it finds unexpected developments in a game that turns out to be able to surprise and involve even beyond expectations. Cursed tales Paranormasight features several charismatic characters Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo is in all respects a visual novel, with some adventure elements that concern the interaction with objects of the scenario and characters as well as decisions to be made to influence the course of the story. This one takes place during a darker night than others, around the 80s of the last century: various characters find themselves in possession of the curses related to the mysteries of Honjo and involved in the search for the Ritual of Resurrection. They are very different people, each driven by the desire to find someone lost forever but who, under certain conditions, could return: there is a mother who is not resigned to the death of her son, a student who wants to see clearly the apparent suicide of a friend, an ordinary employee who falls in love with a girl devoted to occultism and gets involved in a disturbing situation, a detective specialized in paranormal cases who investigates the murder of a colleague. All of these are faced with the possibility of bringing someone back from the dead, but to do so they are forced to kill for power through the collection of ~soul dregs~, in an all-out clash between curse bearers. The events follow different story arcs connected, arranged along a real ~map of history~ with crossroads and plots, which allows you to retry even single episodes and experiment with different solutions, in order to find new outlets for the story. We can switch from one protagonist to another, in some cases forcedly because the advancement of a narrative line also unlocks the others, or to try different choices and see the consequences also on parallel and cross stories. Paranormasight has some downright creepy moments What amazes, in Paranormasight, is the quality of the narration: setting up a game on urban legends may seem like a trivial choice, but the authors here have managed to build interesting scenarios around it for each individual character, who manage to involve us in reading without never a drop in pace. It is true that the horror tone is diluted by the general aspect and by the structure of the game itself, but some topics covered and some choices that we find ourselves making can remain quite impressed. In this regard, it should be noted that the game has no spoken dialogues and the texts are exclusively in English or Japanese, which could be an obstacle to use. narrationand interactive Paranormasight presents a ~Story Chart~ which outlines the progress of events, signaling any crossroads The ~gameplay~ focuses on the 360-degree exploration of static screens, moving a cursor that allows you to interact with the objects and characters present in the various settings that form the background to the individual episodes of the stories. It is a basic interaction which on the other hand does not develop into a large amount of puzzles, to tell the truth: basically it is a question of finding the object or character that advances the story, mainly through the dialogues which are the real load-bearing element of the entire game structure. Although there is a sort of inventory and the characters can carry some objects, the possibility of acting on the scenarios is limited, only triggering descriptions and thoughts on the part of the protagonist about his surroundings, leaving the moments of ~ action~ itself. Above all, this concerns the choice of topics to discuss, the answers to give and in general the attitude to adopt with others, which can determine important consequences in the development of the story. Considering that the direct clash between the ~bearers of the curse~ is a central element of Paranormasight, the most intense moments are undoubtedly those concerning the choice of whether or not to use curses, because these can lead to the death of the characters and therefore to situations of capital importance in the development of the plot. In Paranormasight there are many references to the typical occultism of the 80s When the protagonists come into possession of the various stones of power, they obtain a specific ability linked to each of the seven mysteries of Honjo, which allows you to kill the interlocutor once certain conditions are met (make sure that he turns his back on us, that he lies to us , listening to music for a certain period of time and other special requests). The most interesting mechanics of the game is therefore the fact of putting the interlocutor in the ideal situation to be able to suffer our curse, at the same time also trying to guess what the opponent's power is and avoid falling into his trap. These situations also involve some of the best puzzles in the game, which unfortunately are also quite rare. In a few seconds we find ourselves deciding how to act and, in some cases, the solution to the puzzle that saves us from certain death is not easy to glimpse at first glance: certain moments are genuinely surprising, as they force us to think outside the box of a ordinary adventure. Too bad that these phases are so infrequent and tend to be concentrated in the first part of the game which is much more rhythmic, although perhaps less interesting on the narrative front than the later ones. A special atmosphere Some situations of Paranormasight closely recall the tradition of horror manga Given its purely narrative nature, Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo closely recalls the manga tradition, presenting itself as a sort of interactive Japanese graphic novel. The 2D graphics mix realistic representations of the scenarios, which refer to real settings in the Sumida area, with characters drawn in a more stylized way, but characterized in a remarkable way. All this contributes to creating a particular atmosphere that pervades the game, capable of strongly characterizing this experience, even beyond the many Japanese horror films on the market. Beyond the quality of the writing and the construction of the various characters, what emerges in Paranormasight is its ability to merge the metaphysical with the everyday and ancient mythology with the modern, in a syncretism that is typical of Japanese culture and found here a great expression. Not surprisingly, the creative director is Gen Kobayashi, who has already explored similar themes in The World Ends with You. The choice of setting the events in the 80s helps to build this situation, reflecting a typical element of the Shwa period in Japan: also playing on the tendency to occultism that emerged in this period, the contrast between an era that is all projected towards the future and certain folk traditions that continue to survive, latent but deeply rooted, becomes even more evident. Tokyo thus finds itself built on foundations that recall obscure local traditions, which can emerge in a disturbing way in a quiet metropolitan night, fueled by the obsessions of ordinary people. All this is not just a digression but is an integral part of the Paranormasight experience, which has almost documentary elements: the game prompts us to often consult asort of compendium that collects information on settings and characters, absorbing us in an enormous amount of detail ranging from the classic legends of feudal Japan to historical and cultural descriptions of the places we explore, which blend perfectly with the reconstructions of the biographies of the characters and of the news events in which they are protagonists.", "date": "2023-03-09", "grade": "8.5"}
