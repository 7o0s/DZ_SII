Released quietly on Desura, this generator of jumping on the chair owes everything, including the sudden arrival on Steam, to the coarse screams of some tube celebrities, who have in a certain sense magnified its underlying banality (often it is enough to combine banality with stupidity to get a winning product). From this point of view Scott Cawthon, the developer, was truly brilliant, managing to give the general public what they want without getting bogged down in refinements and without looking for who knows what elaborate horror formula. In reality, in retrospect it is possible to make some reasoning about the game, but the starting point is still disarmingly simple. The sequel does nothing to complicate the bread, to put it to Samuele Bersani, and limits itself to re-proposing the original mechanics with some changes which we will discuss shortly. The game is always the same: in the role of Jeremy Fitzgerald, a fresh employee on the night shift at Freddy Fazbear Pizza, a classic American fast food restaurant with animatronic puppets used to entertain the children, you have to control the place for six nights, avoiding getting killed by animatronics themselves, possessed by who knows what evil force. There are several theories around the possession of animatronics, even these can be found on YouTube, with the good Cawthon who took good care of giving a complete explanation on the matter (is there really a need?), limiting himself to providing some elements of the past of the local, including a rather macabre story which, however, does not resolve all the doubts. However Fitzgerald, like Mike Schmidt before him (the protagonist of the first episode), is not very interested in the story of the Freddy Fazbear Pizza, as much as not being taken by surprise by the evil puppets who can attack him passing through three passages (two lateral, one front). To do this he has to go around the CCTV cameras to monitor their movements, using a flashlight to illuminate them and wearing an animatronic mask to fool them (in the first chapter you had to close the security door to keep them out). Of course, you should avoid running out of electricity. Under penalty of certain death. Who knows if the salary is adequate for the risk That's all? Yes, that's all. There isn't much else in Five Nights at Freddy's 2, which basically requires you to switch from one camera to another obsessively, turning on the lights as needed, without exaggerating, despite the continuous mounting of tension due to increasingly frequent disturbing noises and as the music grows. Compared to the first chapter there are more animatrons, but the gameplay itself has remained identical, including the presence of recordings on the answering machine which serve to give some information on the mysteries surrounding the place and to increase the sense of unease. If you want, having to wear the mask instead of locking yourself in the security room vaguely increases the tension, because it allows the animatronics to get closer, but at the same time it impoverishes the narrative texture, making them lose some credibility. In fact, to deceive such ruthless creatures for six nights with such a low-grade trick gives them an inopportune trait of obtuseness. For the rest, the jumps on the chair are still there, guaranteed by the creatures that jump on us from the dark without anything being able to stop them at that point, just as there is the underlying repetitiveness, fortunately dampened by the short duration of the entire game experience, which is finished in less than three hours, despite the extra day added by the developer and some unlockable extras that will make completionists happy. We reviewed Five Nights at Freddy's 2 and found it scary in more ways than one Some technical details From a technological point of view, the chapter of the end of 2014 remained identical to the chapter of the beginning of 2014 (yes, both chapters were published during this year), with the resolution fixed at 1024x768 which cannot be configured. Put simply, you get what you get, including a distorted image to fit screens with side-to-side ratios other than 4:3. Speaking of details, let's say that a fair amount of work has been done on the animatronics, with those of the first chapter revised in harmony with the facts narrated in the past, and the new ones particularly disturbing (we especially liked the boy with the balloon, but let's imagine that everyone has their own animatron of nightmares). However, the various areas of the venue do not stand out for who knows what qualitative improvement. Indeed, some are quite poor, despite the details that serve to develop theories about the background of the game. Anyway it goeshaving said that this is a small production, sold at a very low price (7.99 euros), so it doesn't make much sense to ask too much more, even if the resolution problem can be annoying and can cause some instability. On the other hand, the excellent work done on the interface should be commended. Sure, Five Nights at Freddy's 2 doesn't have who knows how many features, since the player only has to turn on the lights, navigate between the cameras and don the mask. The fact remains that the various commands have been distributed in an intelligent way and that the interface never gets in the way of gameplay, making it perfect for the intended purpose.", "date": "2014-11-24", "grade": "5.5"}
