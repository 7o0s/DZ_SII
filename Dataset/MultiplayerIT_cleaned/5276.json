You believe that the great classics have already said everything they could say, but then you discover that there is always something new and interesting about them. Just like the adventures of the Bard, the story of the yellow sphere with the mouth born looking at a pizza can be told in many ways, enhancing a fast-paced and old school gameplay that mixes incredible reflexes, colorful levels and electronic music. For those who thought they had seen everything with Pac-Man Championship Edition and had had a second dose with the DX version, the time has come to think again, because this second chapter, albeit with some flaws, pushes the game towards new and interesting territories which lead to the roots of the very concept of ~video game~. The perfect title to take a break from the modern concept of ~video game~. Pac-Man Championship Edition II is the game you need to get away from today's headlines! Phantom Revolution The basic concepts of Pac-Man Championship Edition II are those of any arcade game: score points, score more than others, survive as long as possible. Each level involves having to eat a certain number of pills before unlocking the fruit that will take us to the next stage; to succeed in the shortest possible time it is important to immediately identify the perfect trajectory that will allow us to chew all the chewable without retracing our steps and without ever crossing the path of the hated ghosts, even if touching them will not immediately mean certain death. Well yes, don't make that face, sometimes it is necessary to renew and Pac-Man Championship Edition II does it by modifying a pillar on which the entire structure of the game is based, but fortunately without sin of treason. In fact, we will be able to collide with a ghost three times before it gets angry like the landlord of a defaulting tenant and starts chasing us to eliminate us. Fortunately the fury lasts a few seconds, after which the ghost resumes its journey. Depending on the level of difficulty we will have one or more ghosts who get angry, while the others are simply mobile barriers to bounce against with the sole purpose of making us lose the only truly great resource of the game: time. Both playing in the Score mode and in the Adventure mode we will have to pay close attention to the stopwatch, given that in the first case we will only have five minutes to score the maximum possible score, while in the second we will be asked to bring up the coveted fruit so as to complete the assigned mission. Spooky train In Pac-Man Championship Edition II the sleeping ghosts are back, i.e. ghosts positioned around the map that wake up only if we pass by them and that queue up with one of the main ghosts creating a real little train which, in some cases, will make the game something of a hybrid between Pac-Man and Snake. Compared to the past, the sleeping ghosts will be positioned in areas of the map that will allow us to guess the perfect path to take both to wake them all up and to eat all the balls. Being able to create a train of ghosts long enough is essential in terms of scoring, because when the pill that allows us to eat ghosts appears on the map, the longer the train is, the higher the score we will be able to get. But be careful, even in this case there is a small variation: the train of ghosts can only be eaten starting from the head, otherwise we will be bounced back. We will therefore have to intuit its path and anticipate its moves. To help us there will be a line along the labyrinth that will show the obligatory path of the ghosts. In the simpler levels, where there is only one ghost to act as a ~snake~ it will obviously be easier, but when we face four of them it will be decidedly more complex to imagine their trajectories, but the score we will be able to collect will also be greater. Boss jumps Bouncing on ghosts isn't the only license that the game has over the original: in fact, if we eat all the balls in a level, we'll be rewarded with a bomb that will allow us to return to the center of the map at any time, right in front of the fruit or pill that we will have to collect. This is also where there is a niche where we can hide to avoid any threats. Other innovations introduced in this chapter concern the level design of the labyrinths, which alternates claustrophobic environments in which we will have ghosts always on our heels, open spaces and teleportation stations that will allow us to move quickly around the map. Ah, just to spice things up againmore interesting, when the difficulty increases, the fruit and the large pills will not stay still in place, but will run away, which will lead us to risk our skin in unpleasant collisions or lose further precious time. The main game modes, as already mentioned, are two. The first, Score, will ask us to get a maximum of points within five minutes, so it will be essential to immediately understand which is the ideal path, never stop and create the longest ghost trains. Score is the classic ~one more and that's enough~ mode, in which enough tends to never arrive and one quickly falls into a sort of competitive trance made up of wide-eyed eyes, half-open mouth and a level of attention worthy of a cobra. Although the positioning of the balls almost always makes it very easy to understand the direction to take, limiting the player's choice, the very fast gameplay will immediately give us a hard time. In fact, Pac-Man will almost immediately reach very high speeds that will require control skills and a dose of reflexes worthy of an arcade champion, in a rewarding and frustrating race for the perfect race. The pace of Adventure is quite different, which will ask us to get stars to unlock the end-of-level boss and move on to the next section. To get the stars we will first have to decide whether to play in Easy, Difficult or Pro mode, which respectively will give one, two or three stars, and then overcome a certain number of levels in sequence in which we will have very few seconds to eat all the balls or eliminate ghosts. Our efforts will be rewarded with a sort of final battle in which the substance does not fundamentally change, except that in the end we will be rewarded with a sequence in which we will devour a huge ghost. To be honest, a few more novelties would not have hurt and there is a lack of an ~infinite~ mode in which to spend hours and hours navigating the fluorescent labyrinths, cradled by the obsessive rhythms of the soundtrack, but if you are looking for a pure title, of frills and full of rhythm you will not be disappointed.", "date": "2016-09-26", "grade": "9.0"}
