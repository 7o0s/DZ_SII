{"name": "The Ascent", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-ascent-recensione.html", "text": "Let's face it clearly: since the first videos The Ascent had given us incredibly positive vibes. It will be the so damn cyberpunk setting, his desire to combine the action RPG with the twin stick shooter, and also a series of stylistic choices that had convinced everyone. Unfortunately we can't tell you that the amalgam is the best, anchored as it is to some design choices that we found really anachronistic - or simply risky, see it as you see fit. Let's be clear, it's not a bad title. It lets itself be played and also gives more than one satisfaction, but in the review of The Ascent you will see that when you stop shooting all the limits of a young and inexperienced team are revealed. The hard life in Arcology That The Ascent took full advantage of cyberpunk literature and cinema was clear to us right away. In this sense, the boys of Neon Giant, during their school years, must have been extraordinary serial copiers. The clever ones, capable of combining the reluctance to create something new with the ability to add those few details capable of giving value and originality to the task carried out by others. What has just been said turns into a well thought out and structured imagery, both stylistically and in terms of building the game world and its policies. Alongside this damned positive aspect, however, there is a really too basic level of writing. In this specific case it is not a matter of budget, exploited more than admirably in all directions, but precisely the lack of attention to the script. The world, as mentioned, is the classic one of the cyberpunk dystopia. The greenery is almost totally extinct, the cities develop in gigantic vertical agglomerations and social differences are the basis of daily life. In short, a slightly more extreme 2021, we might say. On the other hand, cyberpunk is the result of other times, of a technological and cultural revolution almost in its infancy, which looked with curiosity and fear to the future that we ourselves are living. Our story develops in this panorama, that of a worker of The Ascent, the company that holds not only the ownership of the entire structure in which we live, but also of the individuals themselves, children of an interplanetary revolution that has brought different alien races to coexist more or less peacefully on the planet where the game is set. Life is therefore cheap, it is difficult to go around certain not to end up killed by the hand of anyone you meet and weapons are the order of the day. In the midst of this splendid mental and physical idyll, a series of events is upsetting the balance of power and it will be up to us to discover the truth behind it all. The main quest therefore winds through various tasks of fairly similar complexity and duration, putting the player in front of a fairly classic structure. You will be asked to accomplish an objective, collect your assignment and head to the designated area to complete it. Nothing new under the sun, functional, but certainly far from original. During the scarce fifteen hours needed to close the main story - assuming you run and don't worry too much about the money spent on fast travel, as well as the side quests and painstaking management of the inventory - you will hardly startle for what happens on the screen or to empathize with a silent and inconsistent protagonist. It is clear that the Neon Giant guys have focused on something else, but it is equally disheartening to see how so much beauty and so much narrative potential has been left there on the sidelines, almost ignored. I'm a twin stick shooter The soul of The Ascent, the most playfully interesting and cared for, is that of a twin stick shooter, as we have already had the opportunity to say on several occasions. It is precisely when you put your hand to the analogs to move and aim that you feel the feeling of some Housemarque productions again (to stay in the recent past), even if you never manage to reach those heights of frenzy and taste for every situation and every generated kill. From the first moments the game will put you in a position to grasp the basics, as well as some peculiarities. What must be kept in mind in The Ascent is that it is in all respects an action RPG, complete with stats and improvements. This leads him to have to deal with a strategic substrate and study of the various situations that should require some attention. We'll talk about everything that's wrong shortly, but let's focus on the shooting in the meantime. The Ascent is fun, needless to go around too much. When you take up a weapon and start the dance, it's difficult to stopboredom, managing the raids with the help of the left analog for movement and the right for aiming. The peculiarities of this system appear with the passing of the minutes and hours, or when you discover the possibility of crouching or shooting by changing aim from high to low, thus being able to hit enemies with the torso covered, but also having to manage those races shorter in stature, requiring the classic aim. Add to this the active skills and there are some for all tastes. Energy punches, the creation of clones capable of acting as decoys, shields that slow enemy projectiles, damage absorbers to recharge life points and various other options that allow you to modify your arsenal and the approach to battles. To use these gadgets it is necessary to expend energy which recharges over time and which is directly dependent on the relative characteristic in the growth of our alter ego. Shooting is therefore a pleasure, even if everything does not always work splendidly, if in addition the level design does not help to avoid collision problems and even if the skating of the character on the ground is sometimes really extreme and annoying. Instead, it is when the role-playing aspect and the navigability of maps and menus come into play that one really turns up one's nose. But (unfortunately) they are also something else It's really a shame to have to see the problems of The Ascent. The writer is always careful to also put the production aspects on the plate, giving the benefit of the doubt and the ~conditional~ to those who try to take a chance and maybe do it with the debut title. Even a couple of months ago with Biomutant, or at the end of last year with Immortals Fenyx Rising we found ourselves in this condition. However, today it is difficult to close our eyes to some important problems in the management of the role-playing sector. This turns into very unintuitive menus, even ugly from an aesthetic point of view, in which to always pay attention to a thousand parameters in the choice of weapons and armor which then, in practice, change very little in the economy of the system. The Ascent, like all twin stick shooters, is a frenetic game in which you often die, but you do it by mistake in positioning, for lack of knowledge of the threat or for an unfortunate collision, certainly not for having chosen boots that run a fraction of a second faster than normal. Even with regard to vendors The Ascent does not give joy, many, too many and often useless. You will hardly find really interesting items for sale from them and most of the time you will visit them only and exclusively to sell your duplicates and make useful credits to spam fast travel like there is no tomorrow. This is unfortunately the design nightmare of the game . The poor navigability of the menus also and above all affects the map and its mini version always present in the upper right corner. Opening the context menu will present you with a very unclear situation, with dozens of non-interactable reference points and a map that is difficult to decipher. If this were not enough, the management of objectives is also inexplicable. Instead of allowing you to instantly track and see a destination, you need to exit the menu and use a button dedicated to the classic GPS on the ground which, not happy, appears for such a short time that you will be forced to call it up constantly. Of course you could also use the on-screen minimap, too bad it's totally ~mute~ and functions as a sort of sonar. This problem, which will be able to lead you to exhaustion on more than one occasion, then approaches a further incomprehensible design choice: that of the management of fast journeys. As we have already told you, The Ascent map is divided into macro areas, these are connected to each other by an elevator that takes you from the slums to the highest and richest floors. The GPS on the ground will always tell you the distance relative to the next change of areas and never to the actual objective, which you will necessarily have to go and find out through the menu - assuming you have the patience and luck to find it. The distances are often sidereal, also thanks to an extraordinary stylistically level design, which tells the social division in a very successful way, but which is far from functional to the gameplay and which is not helped even by fast travel. Let us try to explain ourselves: consider having to go from a hypothetical first floor to the fifth. You haven't unlocked the area you're going to yet, but you've already found the closest metro station or you know you can reach it using the comfortable taxis that can be called at any time. Open the context menu ofhowever, fast travel does not show you the map, but only a list of destinations among dozens and dozens of possibilities. On top of that, you don't even have an indicator next to the destination to choose from, because you haven't unlocked it yet and the game isn't smart enough to show you the closest one. At that point you spend your money on a taxi ride only to discover shortly afterwards that your target, which you thought was 500m away, is actually a couple of kilometers away after changing areas. Unforgivable and evidently the result of a little thorough testing and quality control phase. Very little would be enough, and we trust that it will be done, to solve a lot of what does not work. And that's why we're so sorry, because The Ascent has so much potential and is often lost in a glass of water. Technique and style We have said it and we repeat it, The Ascent is a stylistic jewel. It doesn't scare for polygonal counts or animations, but the ability to recreate this extraordinary cyberpunk imagery is certainly among the best we've ever seen. You breathe Blade Runner, Johnny Mnemonic and Act of Strength at every step and this is nothing but a pleasure for all fans of the genre. If you add to this the possibility of experiencing it all in a coop together with another couple of friends, there's really something to rejoice about. least of all for the performances. At present it is still impossible for us to better test ray tracing with Direct X12 and even having a very powerful RTX 3080 under the hood, the game is not always very fluid, sometimes getting lost in a few clicks and in a general not exciting heaviness.", "date": "2021-07-29", "grade": "7.5"}
