{"name": "Riviera: The Promised Land", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/riviera-the-promised-land.html", "text": "The Promised Land Once upon a time, the world was divided between Asgard, realm of the gods, and Utgard, realm of demons. A war took place between the two kingdoms, the Ragnarok, and in the most dramatic moment the gods themselves gave up their lives to give birth to the Grim Angels: brandishing the supernatural Diviner weapons, these beings brought Asgard to victory, destroying the demons and sealing their kingdom, which from that moment took the name of Riviera. A thousand years later, new demons have begun to appear near the portal that leads to Riviera, convincing the Seven Magi, heirs of the gods, that a new war is upon us. However, without the gods Asgard would not be able to face a new conflict, and for this reason the Magi decide to summon the Grim Angels again, so that they can start the process known as Retribution, through which Riviera can be destroyed, and the threat of Ragnarok averted. Ein, the protagonist of our story, is a Grim Angel who has mysteriously given up his wings to wield his Diviner Ehinerjar; Ledah, on the other hand, is her icy companion, armed with the Diviner Lorelai. But just during their mission, just before crossing the threshold of Riviera, the two Grim Angels are separated, and Ein, deprived of his memories, finds himself right in Riviera: here he will meet the spirits he was supposed to destroy, like the sweet Lina and Fia, and will find out what are the true, and not exactly noble, intentions of the Seven Magi. At that point, Ein will have to choose: fulfill his duty as a Grim Angel and destroy Riviera, or fight against his own nature to defend the Promised Land? Anomalies The plot of Riviera, while recounting the atavistic struggle between Good and Evil, is full of interesting ideas, splendid twists and turns and characters of great tenderness and sympathy. The placid and all-Japanese appearance of these heroes and their adversaries hides a plot that is anything but sunny and light. To enrich the complex narrative plot, there is the game system itself, which is deeply and totally intertwined with it: the plot of Riviera would not exist without the game, and vice versa. Basically, the player in the Riviera has no ~physical~ freedom of movement. You don't have complete control over Ein's sprite, and you can't roam around every map or screen. Ein moves alone together with his group of companions, and the only thing the player can do is press the directional pad following the instructions on the screen. In one room, for example, pressing ~left~ will take Ein and his party back to the next screen. Pressing ~right~ or ~up~ will advance instead. This is how you explore Riviera, and this is how you interact with this world: by simply pressing a key, you will move from Move Mode to Look Mode: the first is as described above, while in the second mode you can press the arrow keys to interact with certain elements of the environment. Pressing ~left~ will perhaps examine a statue, while pressing ~right~ will open a chest. However, these actions require the spending of special ~Trigger Points~, which are obtained by defeating enemies in pre-established battles that will occur in certain screens, or perhaps in special cases: the better you fight, the more Trigger Points you get, and the more actions we can perform . Not to mention that many interactions with the environment will involve simple mini-games based on the player's reflexes, opening a chest may activate a poisonous trap and to avoid it the pressure of a certain key sequence will be required in a period of time, and so saying. These ~events~, reminiscent of the QTE of Shen Mue or the more recent Resident Evil 4, liven up the action and keep the player constantly glued to the screen, without ever getting bored. Anomalies With Riviera, Atlus has indulged itself, proposing a very original title that could be a mine, in the years to come, for the imagination of RPG developers... If the backbone of the game already seems particularly original and bizarre to you, wait until you find out how to fight on the Riviera. Our team in combat will be composed of up to three characters, and before facing the enemies we will be forced to choose four objects, which in fact will be our offensive and defensive tools during the fight: each object after a certain number of times will be used, it will wear out and be lost, so the choice of equipment requires some strategic consideration. What's really interesting, however, is the fact that each item changes its function depending on who uses it. Let's take Ein's Diviner, Ehinerjar: any character in the party will only be able to pull ita on the head of his opponents, causing some damage, but only in Ein's hand will his weapon be able to unleash its true power, allowing him to attack enemies more directly. On the other hand, Ein is able to use staves to strike his opponents, while Fia, using them, will cast healing spells. Each character, therefore, represents a potential and very important strategic variable within a conflict, depending on the items that are selected at the beginning. And that's not all: by using a certain object several times (perhaps in training battles accessible at any time of the game, and during which the items will not be consumed) some characters will learn spectacular special attacks, which can be performed by consuming a special bar, called Overdrive Gauge. Some of these secret shots, the devastating and pyrotechnic EXL (or EXecution Level Skills), can be used at any time, wasting the entire Overdrive Gauge, and the more this is full, the more powerful the damage or effect will be, but the Gauge will shatter making additional Overdrive or EXL Skills inaccessible. Through the learning of Overdrive or EXL Skills, and therefore the repeated use of certain items, the canonical level-up of our characters will take place: every time a new special shot is learned, their psycho-physical attributes will in fact increase, as in the most classic of RPGs. Ergo, once you find a new item, it is advisable to spend some time in training mode to increase the power of each party member who can use it. But what does all this have to do with the story of Riviera, with the progress of the narrative? Simply, every fight, every interaction with the environment, will be commented by our group with dialogues and jokes that are always different and spot on, which will often force the player to choose between different answers, which will increase or decrease his confidence with the maidens that the accompany you in the adventure, creating variations that will even affect the ending of the game. One therefore has the impression of being playing a real ~novel~, full of dialogues and jokes, with extremely well-characterized characters, where the opening of each treasure chest is not only an end in itself and the item that will be found inside. A mammoth script for which Atlus deserves real applause, having managed to give us even among the funniest skits ever seen in a serious RPG. Sights and sounds from the Promised Land The character design is certainly striking from the first moments of the game. Each dialogue is accompanied by large-scale artwork, often portraying a different expression of the corresponding character, to underline their mood. The characters and hostile creatures have the stylized and at the same time soft trait already seen in Disgaea, with a remarkably ~childish~ imprint that above all makes the protagonists of a unique visual sympathy. The artworks that portray the most epic and decisive scenes in history certainly deserve an honorable mention, and which can be freely and completely admired through a simple menu. The same attention to detail and visual rendering can be seen in the creation of the backdrops and each screen that represents the world of Riviera, small works of art that only suffer from excessive repetitiveness in the various dungeons: in a corridor, it happens go through up to three or four identical screens, which in fact give an idea of its length (complete with self-critical comments from the characters themselves). The size of the various sprites and their detail are also generous, as well as the essential but fluid and imaginative animations, while the spectacularization of special attacks and spells is a bit disappointing, which do not exploit the graphic potential of the Game Boy Advance even a bit. they gave away the beautiful spells and summons in Golden Sun and Kingdom Hearts. The exceptional soundtrack deserves a separate mention, composed of a multitude of excellently orchestrated songs and generated in an exemplary manner by the historically weak audio player of the Nintendo handheld. The musical variety of Riviera, which offers beautifully rhythmic and catchy songs such as the battle themes, is combined with a large use of digitized speech, which accompanies the battles and the execution of the most powerful special attacks, further making an extremely well-finished and very valid title spectacular in this respect. Good job. Probably the swan song of this generation of RPGs for GBA, Riviera is a very original product full of surprises, which certainly won't disappoint fans of the genre or those who perhaps want to embark on something new. Interactive novel, with a remarkable plot and iingenious playful artifices, Riviera is the RPG with which Atlus gives yet another and perhaps definitive proof of its eclecticism and genius. In the approximately thirty hours of gameplay necessary to complete it, it will be impossible not to become attached to the numerous characters who will appear on the scene, and their dialogues and the many narrative sequences could even be tiring, if it weren't for the strategic and fun fights, which perhaps they are too long. The desired linearity combined with the lack of total freedom in movement and action could make someone turn up their noses, but once taken in the right light, Riviera proves to be an inevitable title in the collection of every connoisseur of the genre. Pros: Original and surprising Excellent plot Soundtrack and character design at the top Cons: Amount of dialogues at times excessive Graphically the GBA can do better Excessive linearity may not please everyone In recent years it has been rare to stumble upon an RPG that could be defined as innovative, both from a playful and artistic point of view. The fashions launched by software houses such as SquareEnix have been absorbed and reworked in countless variations, but the salient features now tend to repeat themselves with an obsessive frequency, so much so that the concept of ~JRPG~ is now associated with elements such as random clashes or the frenetic level-up, on the one hand, and the ~dark~ plot with depressed and psychologically complex characters, on the other. Atlus has taken care of changing the cards on the table, and just looking back on the last few years it is clear how it was this softco that offered something truly new. Just think of the stylized and placid design developed with Disgaea or La Pucelle, or the complex playful mechanics of these games, which have practically relaunched the strategic vein on PS2. And again, a few months ago it was the turn of Stella Deus, a successful experiment in which the old and the new merge in an exemplary way. With Riviera, Atlus has indulged itself, proposing a very original title that could be a mine, in the years to come, for the imagination of RPG developers...", "date": "2005-09-07", "grade": null}
