Let's start with the game modes, which are four: Capture the Flag: the classic capture the flag. Enter the enemy base, steal the banner and lovingly bring it to your base. One Flag CTF: variation: there is only one flag and it is located in the center of the arena. To score a point you have to take it and take it to the enemy base (and not yours as written in a thousand other reviews, who knows why). Overload: instead of flags there are ~totems~, one for each team of course. You will have to destroy the enemy one, remembering that this acquires 15 hit points every second. Harvester: Have you tried the Head Hunters mod? The same thing: you have to kill your opponents, collect their skulls in the center of the arena and take them to the enemy base. Perhaps the funniest mode for frenzy. Instead of entering character classes like in the classic CTF, in Team Arena you can choose pseudo-classes every time you enter the game thanks to some runes. You can only choose one at a time: Doubler: Doubles the power of your weapons. If you think it can be used in combination with quad damage... especially useful in Overload mode. Guard: As soon as you take the rune your health and armor will jump to 200 points. Furthermore, the first one will be constantly regenerated. Scout: Increases your speed and that of your weapons. But you won't be able to wear armor. Ammo-Regen: Slowly reloads weapons to the default level for each one. It is still possible to stay dry, because it is rather slow. It also increases the rate of fire. And the new items? Kamikaze: the name says it all: by collecting this little object you will become stray bombs. Spectacular graphic effect. Invulnerability: if you activate this item you will be ~frozen~ in your position for about fifteen seconds, and you can download all your arsenal without having to worry about being hit. Proximity mines excluded. Finally the new weapons. New so to speak... Nailgun: a kind of shotgun loaded with nails. The squad is frighteningly large and the loading long. Prox Launcher: The ideal weapon to cover escape in narrow corridors. Fire proximity mines that stick to walls and explode when an enemy gets too close. Chaingun: already seen in Quake 2, consumes more than Carmack's Ferraris and hurts a lot Then there are 20 maps, most of them new, plus the old ones revisited for the new game modes and slightly expanded. The judgment on the levels is mixed: some are decidedly well made, some are too similar, others were made to test the PCs they will use on the international orbiting station (did you know that it has finally been inaugurated?). I think the most worthy of mention are Vortex Portal, Scorn Forge and The Capture Chamber, very frenetic even without too many players. The three land maps are impressive to look at, but honestly playing Tribes without the jetpack is not the best of life. Moreover, the weapons of Quake 3 do not lend themselves much to very long distances. On the other hand, the railgun with the zoom is an excellent paliative of the sniper rifle, and together with the Ammo-Regen rune it allows an excellent defensive action. In the end, these three maps are the most innovative aspect (for Quake III, not for games in general, of course), but it will take some time to decide the success; certainly to have fun you need to be really many, and at that point speed problems could seriously compromise the excited phases. It must be said that the average level of detail of the maps is very high, especially if we consider that the maps for team games are generally ~lighter~ than those designed for deathmatch. Generally speaking, I haven't had the frame rate drop problems seen in the demo, but at maximum detail even a first generation Geforce DDR struggles, and I think the problem can be attributed to the excessive use of very complex shaders, which require a large work by the graphics card. Some memory is saved by the presence of only two new models, one male and one female, with an important number of heads (I think twenty-five) to choose from. It can be seen that at the time of the creation of these models there must have already been a tide (technicalism) between Paul Steed and the rest of the Id, because to describe the way in which they are animated I should use terms that are not very suitable for a young audience (remember that Paul Steed was fired soon after Carmack announced work on Doom 3). Some tweaks have also been given to the AI of the bots, who have been educated to the new game modes. The results can be summed up in a greater team cohesion if it is in a confined space (at least this was my impression), but over long distances there is no bot that holds. It is possible to issue a series of predefined commands rather quickly, via a drop-down menu, a welcome improvement compared to the previous solution. ~It fails to speak and then it seems alive~: perhaps they also thought of this with the ID, so another novelty concerning bots is that they have acquired the voice, which you can hear in a series of annoying phrases, such as ~My mother shoot better~. This also happens, but fortunately it is possible to disable the vocal cords of the beloved AI. The work done on the UI (user interface, practically the menus that allow you to launch maps, change settings, etc.) is remarkable, which allows you to see recorded videos whenever a map is selected, and is more complete than usual; and on the HUD, which contains all the necessary information (and there is a lot) while remaining very readable. It is advisable to use the ~restricted~ version to gain a few frames and some visibility. Summing up Quake III: Team Arena is beautiful. Nice to look at, fun to play (not for long probably). The singleplayer is more useless than in his dad, but at least you can get familiar with the maps, which are often very articulated (but the indications scattered everywhere are excellent signs). Quake III: Team Arena is bad. Ugly because it marks the turning point of a philosophy. The software house that was the first to outline the guidelines for a new relationship with the community of its users has taken a sensational step backwards. Probably, as happens for some musical groups when they reach the peak of their success, so Id has not been able to defend itself from the business mentality, and this title is nothing more than the perfect result of a marketing study. The class of those who have been making video games for ten years is all there, but the impulsive, stubborn and above all independent soul (both from the market and from the fashions dictated by the buzz of the mass) that has marked some of the stages of software development, well , sorry: there isn't. Buy it with your eyes closed, but don't expect a new revolution. Let's hope well for Doom 3... Prologue from an old grumbler While working on Quake 3, John ~3d~ Carmack said clearly in an interview: ~Actually in Q3A there is nothing new, we just took everything done up to now and improved it thanks to new technologies~ . Anyone who has tried the game at least once knows what the result is: a gameplay that is nothing short of ~raw~, in which speed is the absolute master; pointed out by detractors as the game of non-thought and instead exalted by supporters as the definitive multiplayer experience (an adjective now withdrawn in the videogame field). As usual, the positions have radicalized over time, and the search for defects and merits has somewhat overshadowed the simple desire to have fun. Whether or not Quake 3 has established new parameters is all in all not very interesting, what I want to focus on is the relatively low grip that the game has had on the mod developer community. Unlike its predecessor, in fact, few complete and successful mods have been seen to date. Surely there is Rocket Arena, certainly there will be Urban Terror (perhaps when Counter-Strike has retired due to age limits), Classic CTF and the excellent Q3 Fortress; the appointment Tribal CTF and the eagerly awaited Bid for Power should not be missed. But Quake 3 came out now 15 months ago! The reason? Surely one of the main ones is the difficulty of working with the code of the latest Id engine. Regardless of the intrinsic difficulty in learning a new technology, the initial comments of the old guard developers were clear: the first sdk was almost useless , for the lack of comments, support etc. And at Id, the software house that bears the flag of the community of enthusiasts and which has built its fortune precisely on this relationship with the players, what action do they take? The mod is made at home. And then they charge for it. Nice thought, isn't it?", "date": "2001-04-27", "grade": null}
