Black Thorn is a Mission Pack, which apart from new weapons and a new Multiplayer mode, adds nothing new to the classic Rouge Spear, so I refer you to our previous Covert Ops Essentials Review for details on the game. For the most ardent fans, I list the new weapons: Pistols: FN Five-Seven, SIG P-228, Steyr SPP. Machine guns: Beretta M12, FN P90, Steyr TMP Assault rifles: FAMAS G2, FN-FAL, FN-FNC, Gallil ARM .233 Sniper rifles: Valnet M82 and Sig SSG3000 Machine guns: M60 Who does not know Rainbow Six! What we have to evaluate is another aspect. Rainbow Six is famous for its excellent Mods management, and in fact on the net it is possible to find a huge amount of add-ons for this title for free, so what we ask ourselves is what should push us to open the wallet and buy this Mission Pack? Let's find out together. More terrorism! The story behind Black Thorn is the usual or almost the same. A secret organization is trying to revive all the terrorist activities of recent years, and to succeed in their intent they also need to eliminate one of their greatest enemies: the Rainbow Six. The original levels are, as usual, outstanding and present real challenges for even the most seasoned players. The maps that make up the Single Player are nine and to these we add the six new maps for the Multiplayer. Speaking of Multiplayer, there is something new here. More terrorism! The ~Lone Wolf~ mode, already available in Single Player, has been introduced, also for network matches. For the few who don't know, the aim of the game is that a single player must reach another point on the map. Easy ? Ummm not really since all the other players chasing him. Intriguing right? Rainbow Six forever Well we can already sum up. Black Thorn hasn't undergone radical changes, the graphics engine is the same as it was three years ago, which in the computer age are centuries old and therefore there are also all those small defects that could have gone unnoticed at the time, but which now make you twist a little the nose. Rainbow Six forever Furthermore, the price of the game is high also because it is not sold as an Add-On, but as a complete game in its own right (it does not require any other previous title). The merits are there, first of all the beautiful levels of the Single Player missions, and a gameplay, which despite the weight of the years remains exceptional. Do you remember the initial question if it weren't better to direct us directly to Ghost Recon? Well as I was able to say in the review, Ghost Recon and R6 are two substantially different titles and therefore lovers of the latter may prefer this Mission Pack. Swan song? A new chapter in the very long Rainbow Six series, called Black Thorn, has been available in stores for a few days. I remind you that Ghost Recon has just been released, the new and acclaimed latest title from Red Storm and therefore, given the almost simultaneous releases, we also need to understand how Black Thorn not only represents an attempt to still exploit a huge success like the one in Rainbow Six. In any case, let's not waste any more time and open the classic package that contains the usual manual in Italian.", "date": "2001-12-06", "grade": null}
