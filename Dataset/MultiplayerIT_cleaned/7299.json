So here is the debut on the App Store Galcon Legends, a title that takes up the mechanics of the original released in 2009 and offers them in a broader context, characterized by a technical sector redesigned for the occasion, more incisive in terms of colors and design albeit mediocre in the interface (made with standard characters and horrible boxes), but above all by a single player campaign consisting of twenty-three missions. Each of them can be tackled according to the criteria belonging to ten levels of difficulty, which are ~suggested~ to us by the game as we progress through the story, in which we control a sort of space collector who has to recover due credits and who for this part in the conquest of entire solar systems. The game timidly tries to focus on the narrative, through text sequences which, however, are sincerely boring and uninteresting, accompanied by aesthetic elements which, as mentioned before, represent the weakest side of the production. In short, it is better to skip the dialogues straight away and devote yourself to strategic maneuvers, these are tested and in many ways exciting. If you enjoyed the original Galcon, this new episode will keep you entertained Matter of numbers The gameplay of Galcon Legends, as mentioned, proposes the same mechanics seen in the 2008 episode. On the screen we have a series of planets to conquer, each bearing a number that represents the number of ships in its defense. To acquire them and add them to our ~fleet~, we will therefore have to move the units from the planets that we already control towards the targets, thus trying to counter the maneuvers of the opponent on duty, who will do the exact same thing. In the lower right part of the display it is possible to decide whether to limit the ships in our possession to 25%, 50%, 75% or send them in full, while the actions are performed based on the touches on the touch screen: first touch a our planet and then an ~empty~ one, or one managed by the enemy, implies sending units in that direction, while a double tap helps us select all the planets that belong to our ~federation~ and manage their ships accordingly. The possibility of accessing as many as ten difficulty levels is in fact an interesting progression system and a valid mechanism for the replayability of a campaign which, in fact, faced at the minimum of the challenge, runs out rather quickly. The problem is that, however, there is a complete lack of contour to this offer, and above all there are no significant changes compared to what was seen in the first Galcon. If in that case it was a must to recognize freshness and courage to the production signed by Phil Hassey, the same cannot be said of this ~more of the same~, while waiting for the work on the real second chapter to be completed, financed as mentioned on Kickstarter and certainly a harbinger of elements of interest.", "date": "2014-02-20", "grade": "7.3"}
