{"name": "Worms 3D", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/worms-3d-2.html", "text": "A bit of history For those unfamiliar with the game, it is worth remembering its basic structure. Worms involves the clash between two or more teams of cute and warlike little worms armed to the teeth, on colorful computer-generated maps. In turn, the members of the teams, using the weapons already supplied or collected from the ground, aiming well and calculating the trajectory, must try to eliminate the opponents by resetting their hit points or by hurling them into the sea (in fact, worms cannot swim). In addition to the fun inherent in the act of eliminating every single member of the opposing team, Worms 3D enjoys a really fun cartoon-style setting and a set of weapons so demented as to border on absurdity. And anyone who knows a ~sacred grenade~ (pictured below), an ~old lady bomb~ or a ~supersheep~ knows what we're talking about. 31 First impact The first impact with Worms3D comes from the menus. The tradition consolidated over the years has at least not changed the structure of the game in any way, much less the game modes. All the classic game options and schemes are still present. Through the Configurations menu you start immediately with creating your own customized team of worms. We can choose the name of the components (up to a maximum of six), the set of items to be attributed to the team (and there are a lot of them, all different and hilarious), the flag of recognition and the type of tomb that will be positioned on the place where our warriors will fall in battle. An item in the menu indicates the presence of the ~Worm-o-pedia~, a real virtual encyclopedia in which to find all the information on the game and above all on the weapons supplied. For many of these, in fact, a review is necessary before tackling the game, in order not to run the risk of wasting ammunition and useful rounds due to our inability to govern them. The main menu shows us the different game modes. The classic single game will take us to a randomly generated map in which to challenge an enemy team controlled by artificial intelligence. The multiplayer mode, on the other hand, provides for the game via the internet, LAN and obviously the well-established multi-player mode on the same computer. This is made possible by the turn-based game structure, which is the basis of the game concept of all Worms. The campaign offers the player the opportunity to measure their skills along a series of themed missions, in which to deal with different situations, really well constructed and implemented. In single games, as usual, each level parameter is customizable, and a random map generator will build the map models in real time under the player's eyes. By combining the terrain sets, the quantity of scenic objects on the map and structures such as bridges and islets it will be possible to obtain an almost infinite number of results, in order to make each game unique and unrepeatable. Other characteristics of the level, such as the presence of special weapons and the various settings relating to the resistance of the worms and the reactions of the latter to the blows received, can be set from the menu or can be randomly generated by a nice slot machine, called Wormpot, which randomly combines those settings. The new dress... Once you get to the actual game, you immediately collide with reality. Worms has totally changed its face, and the 3D setting initially leaves you a little disoriented. First of all, the management of the camera immediately appears not very immediate. The movements and rotations that it performs confuse the novice player a lot. The selected worm can move around the map using the arrow keys, make leaps and pike jumps. The right mouse button brings up the weapon selection menu, which is similar to its ancestors. Once the weapon has been selected, pressing the key assigned to the viewfinder switches the third-person view to the first-person view which allows you to aim much more accurately and certainly more effectively. Inevitably, those who have not had the good taste to spend a few minutes training with the tutorial offered by the game will immediately notice how difficult it is to hit the target. This is largely due to the three-dimensional structure of the map. Now the parameters to be taken into consideration to hit the targets are many and more complex. The direction of the wind combined with the three cardinalities make the pointing system very complex. Despite this, after a couple of games wasted, things inevitablyyou improve, having acquired some rudiments of control of the characters. The movements, initially too awkward to complete a mission, quickly become more fluid and effective, until it becomes intuitive and simple to even double jump from one suspended platform to another. New weapons and... The weapons supplied, which have always been a strong point and a real explosive fun bomb for the whole series, have not lost their polish in recent years and with the new graphic design we rediscover the ancient glories and truly brilliant innovations. Banana bombs, old ladies and crazed cows, flying sheep, machine guns, hand grenades and anything else you can think of from the classic and demented Worms weapons are still at the mercy of the cute pink worms. The new powerful and absolutely ingenious weapons will gradually become available by completing the various missions. Getting a little carried away you will find that flying a Super Sheep is still as fun as you remembered. The addition of an exhilarating soundtrack and the confirmation of that cartoon style that has become the symbol of the saga once again pay homage to this bold attempt to renew a PC classic like Worms. Indeed, the control of worms turns out to be a bit of the cross of the title, and it is not clear whether the fault is to be attributed solely to the management of the camera, which in fact is neither immediate nor docile. On the other hand, by combining the three different views available, first person for aiming, third person for movements and the aerial one for the overall strategic vision of the map, things improve to the point of being able to tame the situation effectively . The recommendation not to throw in the towel on the first attempt, which will most likely go up in smoke, is a must. Final comment The temptation, finally, would be to wonder if this title is up to its predecessors. Indeed there was a gamble, since Worms could easily enjoy the fame of a well-defined pastime game which it had become in recent years through the versions that many of us have known. It seems equally fair to ask, however, what is really the right path to take when we arrive, as in the case of the creation of Team 17, faced with what could be defined as a dead end. In fact, the two-dimensional graphics, by now accepted as the standard of the saga, no longer presented many ideas, unless one wanted to attempt a revolution in the game he conceived which, in addition to appearing risky, would have seemed senseless. 3D, as already happened to Lemmings of Psygnosis, seems to be the only way out for the development of this genre of games. For now let's enjoy this novelty, hoping not to be disappointed, thus recalling the glories of the past. If this were the case, it would be fair to ask what the market really expects from this kind of stock. In conclusion, this new Worms is worth a try. It may also be that someone does not like the three-dimensional graphics as much as the control system. Our advice is to jump in, as the game hasn't lost the charisma of the saga and the contagious sympathy at all. Pros: Fun and irreverent as always Numerous weapons, including many absolutely new and all the old glories Hilarious soundtrack Cons: Camera control system not immediate Sometimes awkward movements Difficult to aim Here we are now, the thing had been announced for some time. Worms, the king of time-wasting, fun and irreverent games, which has been delighting players from all over the world for years, has taken the plunge and adopted a totally new look. The temptation to abandon the usual 2D graphics, a tradition consolidated over the years through the numerous versions released on the market, has also infected Team 17, the game developer. It matters little whether the choice was dictated by market needs, or to attempt a path that would open up new development prospects for a title which, despite its immortal freshness, had long since reached a static maturity. The fact is that Worms has totally changed, and presents itself to the public, after years of revisions of the classic product, with a completely new dress ready to be judged by critics who are increasingly hungry for new things that are slow to arrive.", "date": "2004-01-02", "grade": null}
