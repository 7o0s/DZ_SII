These are basically illustrated stories, which can sometimes have some form of interactivity, while others simply rely on text and images to tell their story. The latter is the case of Love at First Sight in which the player is only required to press a key to scroll through the texts and, of course, read them (the laziest can also set the automatic advance). There are no choices to make, nor interfaces to manage appointments or school and work activities. There is only the love story between a Cyclops girl, Sachi, and a boy older than her, Mamoru, who will challenge prejudices and misunderstandings to stay together. Don't be too surprised by Sachi's appearance, since in the world of visual novels the use of oddities like this is quite frequent. Just think of the pigeons of Hatoful Boyfriend or the cat girls of Nekopara to have two more examples of what we are saying. It should also be said that the girl's gigantic eye, which makes her so alien to the other characters, is instrumental to the type of story, given that we are talking about teenage loves that revolve around Sachi's initial difficulty in opening up and integrating with the normal . How many times has it happened to you (or still happens, why not) to feel rejected because you are different? It happens to feel like monsters among the normals, especially when it is the latter who make diversity weigh, making it discriminatory. Particularly heavy are those situations in which the refusal is linked to falling in love, i.e. when one feels a transport that is not reciprocated for another person. Nothing new, given that these are situations that have been perpetuated since the dawn of time, but for this very reason there is no era in which art hasn't somehow tried to represent them, even if only to bring a little comfort turning into a mirror of a suffering which, however distant it may appear in adulthood, can be an almost unbearable burden in youth. Let's rediscover teenage love with the review of Love at First Sight, a visual novel for PC At first sight We don't want to reveal more of the plot of Love at First Sight because being a purely narrative title we would spoil much or everything it has to offer. However, it was important to clarify who it is aimed at and what kind of story you will find in it, so as not to run into misunderstandings. Coming to more practical matters, we would like to reiterate what has already been partially specified: it is a visual novel without any form of interaction and with a not exactly exciting duration, given that we are talking about a couple of hours to reach the conclusion. The only narrative technique used to slightly break the linearity of the story, divided into four acts, is the assumption of different points of view in the narration of some events. Nothing too complicated, given that everything is guided in this case too, but it is right to note it also because we are talking about some of the most intense moments of the love affair. In terms of drawings, expect manga-style characters, but with less rounded features than the typical ones. The style of the game is expressed above all in the coloring, much more impressionistic than the most famous Japanese visual novels have accustomed us to, but in truth you never see images that radically break with tradition. The soundtrack is also on the same level, with several intense and well-played songs, which however never go beyond the level of excellent accompaniment. The extras section, on the other hand, is very rich, with drawings, production sketches, authors' comments and other material that will make fans of the genre happy.", "date": "2015-06-25", "grade": "7.0"}
