However, Apotheon aims to visually characterize this theme in a strong way, taking inspiration from the ancient Greek ceramics of Exekias, who loved to represent the protagonists of mythology through black figures, to offer us an original and fascinating graphic style. The protagonist of the game is Nikandreos, a brave warrior who agrees to challenge Zeus and the gods of Olympus in order to restore peace and serenity to his lands, tormented by the consequences of abandonment by the gods: the oceans give no fish, the sky it is sunny, the fields have become parched and conflicts are raging in the streets. Thus begins an adventure that will take him to visit ten different settings with a view to climbing the mythological mountain, facing many opponents to obtain a series of objects that can give him the power to oppose Zeus. Visually original, Apotheon is a solid action platformer with some shadows Are you a god? Let's start right from the peculiar graphic style adopted by Alientrap for Apotheon, inspired by the classical Greek majolica. There is no doubt that the impact is strong and that this solution has been well adapted to all the various contexts, from the scenarios to the characters, but it is impossible not to notice how the developers have taken advantage of this to try to mask some glaring shortcomings. In fact, Nikandreos, the inhabitants he comes across and all his enemies boast puppet animations, with a movement of joints that perhaps in the ideas of the authors should have offered a better yield, but which in practice appears rather ugly to see. In fact, entire portions of connection for the movements are missing, and the characters, for example, ~imprint~ themselves on a platform trying to climb over it, or are thrown away by the shock wave of a powerful blow, revealing in this situation an absence of ~weight ~ and consistency that is felt also and above all during the fights. The latter have a certain variety on their side, also thanks to an RPG-style approach that sees each weapon possessing different characteristics and its own resistance to blows (it breaks after a certain amount), as well as inflicting more or less damage depending on the part of the body hit, also making reference to a bar that regulates the vigor of the attacks launched. The protagonist of the game can wield swords, daggers, spears of different sizes, axes, hammers or his bare fists, holding a shield or a torch in the other arm (where it may be useful), but there are four categories available and by acting on the directional cross it is possible to scroll through them dynamically, selecting the tool we prefer for each clash. Thus we pass from weapons for close combat, which can also be thrown, to those for shots from a distance: javelins, stones and throwing knives, bows with various types of arrows; and then, again, explosives, traps and some types of elixir, from the one for the simple restoration of health to the one that makes us invisible for a few seconds, or momentarily enhances our attacks. In short, there is great substance, undoubtedly the result of the desire to give the game a strong personality, but the many ideas put on the field sometimes seem to stumble over their own legs when it comes to their realization. In the case of fights, in fact, we have questionable collision management, with incredible ~smooth~ collisions that occur when we don't impact the enemies exactly with the tip of the weapon, which makes it particularly cumbersome to fight using axes and hammers. The adversaries, then, generally tend to move away when we try to reach them, giving rise to tragicomic pursuits and making everything particularly ~slippery~ and chaotic, especially when we have to defend ourselves from several opponents, with the parry valid only for one side and therefore leaving us discovered behind. The choice to assign attack and lock to the triggers contributes to making the situation worse at first, even if this type of layout makes sense when you realize that the same weapons can be launched with the back buttons. Of course, solving some spectacular bosses (see Poseidon) by exploiting the very limits of the combat system, or by sticking to the enemy to avoid his blows, inevitably ends up diminishing the positive aspects of the production. Which, unlike what one might think, are many. Guacamelee in Greek sauce Apotheon is a metroidvania-style action platformer, which due to the type of map and level design uused is very reminiscent of the excellent Guacamelee! by DrinkBox Studios. The development of the scenarios, with things to find and interact with, without too much dead time and with some interesting secrets to discover by experimenting, undoubtedly represents the most valuable part of the production, despite the heaviness of a narrative that fails to involve , thanks to the lack of an Italian translation and dialogues that we would have preferred more synthetic. However, we were talking about the level design, which even manages to surprise in some moments, asking us to solve environmental puzzles that often consist of activating a lever, finding a key or activating a device that must be hit with an arrow , perhaps respecting a particular timing or even aiming blindly, upwards, for the shot to land at the desired point. There is a sensational moment from this point of view, in which one is asked to shoot an arrow towards an area of the scenario that cannot be seen, except by activating the overlay map and thus following the progress of the arrow itself. Well, these are really pearls that two-dimensional gaming is still able to offer, but in the case of Apotheon we are amazed by the contrast between the goodness of some aspects of the experience and the limits we have described previously. If the developers had tried to replicate a combat system like that of the aforementioned Guacamelee!, in fact, we would be talking about a very different product. Because there's really no reason to complain about the rest: the enemies are many and well differentiated, each with precise patterns of attack and movement (even if all this is debased by the ~slipperiness~ we mentioned), as mentioned, there are very interesting solutions regarding the level design and also the bosses are very beautiful, challenging and different from the usual.", "date": "2015-02-04", "grade": "8.0"}
