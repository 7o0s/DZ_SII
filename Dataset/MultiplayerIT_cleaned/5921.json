So here is the latest Need for Speed, devoid of any subtitles, further evidence of its being the ~zero point~ from which to restart one of the most famous and long-lived brands in the history of video games. We had already had a close encounter with Electronic Arts' new racing game in the past and our opinion had been a narrow promotion. Will the final version have convinced us? Let's find out together. Need for Speed presents itself all new after a pause for reflection: here is our review! Five by five The history of the game, between previews and tested is now well known. Need for Speed tells the story of a stranger who race after race will become the most recognizable driver in the underground scene of Ventura Bay, a fictional version of Los Angeles. At his side there will be five characters, three men and two women, who correspond to five ~souls~ of the game. These guys are the alter egos of real characters who revolve around the world of racing (and who have marginal parts because, so we were told, they are not great actors). If our performances are impressive enough we will attract their attention, we will be able to challenge them and transform ourselves into the new legends. The narration is entrusted to clips of footage (dubbed into Italian) that intersperse the races and tell us about our climb to success. Initially they are quite trivial and even annoying, but over time it is inevitable to become passionate about this story made up of people who greet each other with the fist, love plots, crowded clubs and the different personalities of Spike, Manu, Amy, Robyn and Travis. In fact, unlocking the next cutscene was undoubtedly one of the reasons that prompted us to play more. Five is the magic number of Need for Speed, this is because the developers have identified five fundamental aspects that have always characterized the game: speed, style, tuning, crew and outlaws. And it will be precisely these components that will influence the reputation of our character, or rather his level. By increasing the reputation we will in fact be able to unlock better parts for our car and face the most difficult challenges of the game, but also obtain the necessary parts to make it the most tacky thing on four wheels in the city. If we touch 100 km/h in just a few seconds we will receive tuning points, making a perfect curve while drifting will increase the style points, touching 300 km/h the speed points will increase, racing together with our friends will increase the crew aspect, smashing lampposts, escaping by the police or ramming passersby will increase the outlaw score. Accumulating points is very easy and by doing these or other things together, multipliers will be activated which will make everything even easier. In the course of history we will also come across five types of events which will obviously each be dedicated to one of these aspects and in which we will only be able to participate by answering the many (too many) phone calls from our friends. A word with Craig Sullivan During the review we were also able to have a chat with Craig Sullivan, creative director of the game, here's what he told us. Can you explain better how the difficulty is managed in the game? The AI fits some elements, but there is still a difficulty curve tied to the progress of the story. There are times when the cars slow down or speed up, but calling this a ~rubber band~ makes it seem like a cheap gimmick. I've played games that don't have an AI that fits and they tend not to be fun because sometimes you're too fast for your opponents or too slow. So yes, the level scales according to the car, the performance, the event, but there is also a difficulty that progressively increases and takes the player on more complex tracks or to fight against tighter times and higher scores. Why did you choose to set the game from dusk to dawn? There are different lightings in the game and some areas are darker, while others are near dawn, so we still have some variety. Setting the game during the day would have spoiled the atmosphere; we could have done that, but since Ventura Bay is like Los Angeles we would have had to put in much, much more traffic to make it realistic. Even the fans of the game wanted something more ~Underground~ and therefore we have satisfied them. With lights on in the nightAnd Need for Speed is characterized by a purely nocturnal setting. A choice dictated by the desire to concentrate on the world of clandestine racing and the ~Tuning Culture~ which prefers the spotlights of a workshop and the neon signs in the sunlight. The result is a double-edged sword: on the one hand we have perfect reflections, wet surfaces, fluorescent lights that are reflected on the bodywork and splashes of rain that crash on the windshield, enhancing the Frostbyte Engine, on the other it is inevitable that a world experienced from sunset at dawn after a while everything appears the same. Sure, there are more hilly areas and city neighborhoods, there are wide highways and tight bends, but after a few hours of play the setting ceases to amaze. To make this weakness even more evident is the fact that the game map is not very large and in the long run the races will always take place more or less along the same roads, for more or less long stretches, everything will depend on the difficulty. In fact, the events can be easy, medium or difficult, however this will only have a relatively small effect on the skill of our opponents while it will mainly affect the composition of the track, the maximum time in which we will have to travel it or the score to be achieved with drifts. And if there's one thing that Need for Speed does very well, and God forbid, it's the sensation of speed. Variety may not be his forte, but when the race begins and we drift into a cold neon-lit tunnel, music blasting in our ears and the pursuers screaming their engines behind us, it's impossible not to get excited. The driving model is perfect for having fun throwing a million euro car to the limit, nailing it and letting it slide in a gentle drift along a hairpin bend, in this respect Ghost Games has done an excellent job, it must be admitted. Finally, don't worry about the damages, they are exclusively aesthetic and only really strong impacts (like a frontal) force you to stop and start again. Elastic AI As far as artificial intelligence is concerned, however, the question is more complex. In fact, the game is calibrated to always guarantee a certain level of challenge, so it will be very difficult to escape your opponents, but also very easy to reach them, due to the so-called ~rubber bands~. In fact, the cars almost always seem linked together with an elastic band that prevents excessive detachment, a feature already present in other games of the series (or in Super Mario Kart), but which perhaps it would be time to abandon to concentrate on a greater balancing of the missions. Because of this stylistic choice, it will very often happen that we overtake almost stationary cars which then inexplicably overtake us with ease, only to then mysteriously be caught up near the finish line. This phenomenon is particularly evident in the initial parts of the game, when our car is usually stronger than that of the opponents, but tends to fade when we reach the halfway point. At that point all the matches will tend to be demanding and the slightest mistake will be enough to see the possibility of dribbling the opponents fade. We wrote ~usually~ because we happened to make a sensational front end in the middle of the race and still manage to beat an opponent at the wheel of a Porsche that looked like a rocket in the early stages of the race. How do you want to run tonight? Even if there are five friends, the events that are proposed to us are all quite similar. In the case of speed we will have to race against the clock or against other drivers, in the case of drifting beat the score of the opponents or a pre-set number. If desired, drifting also has two other variables: in one it will not be enough to drift, but we will also have to be in the lead of the race, so as to increase the score with the multiplier, in the other, called ~drift train~, the points will be counted only if we remain close to opponents, which makes this mode particularly frustrating. Due to the aforementioned elastic effect of artificial intelligence, in fact, it may happen that we have to wait for particularly slow cars which we will then find ourselves chasing without being able to reach them, with consequent disasters from the point of view of the score. Beyond this fragmentation, the game does not offer particular variety in terms of things to do, even if achievement lovers will have fun looking for three types of collectible elements: panoramic places, places to do wheel skids and improvements for the car. The monotony is accentuated by the nocturnal setting and by the general equivalence of automotive performance, so much so that in the end, as we already said, the real mThe key that pushes you to continue in the game is to find out where the story is going, the longevity of which should not exceed ten hours in any case. Wanting the most ~peppery~ part of the game is that relating to the outlaws and the possibility of playing cat and mouse with the police. From this point of view, however, the general stupidity of the artificial intelligence that governs the agents doesn't encourage much to engage in chases in the initial part, which is a pity because whoever resists the boredom of the first clashes will then find himself faced with dozens of cars, block and studded strips that will make life difficult for him. Obviously there is also an online part that will allow us to run with our friends and participate in their events, increasing the final score. If we wish, we can also take part in races that are further along in history than where we are currently playing. Need for Speed is an ~always online~ title, which means that we will necessarily have to be connected to the Internet to play, this because, even if our friends are not there, we will still see other random players joining our session. We can challenge them or we can ignore them but, trust us, we will certainly find them in the boxes at the wrong time. A car is forever In theory, cars should take care of making things more varied, but also from this point of view the situation brings with it lights and shadows. According to the developers, any car in the game, even a '74 Volvo, can reach peak horsepower once all content has been unlocked. This means that, basically, we could only use one car for the whole game without ever being pushed to change it, beyond simple aesthetic taste. In the test of facts, fortunately this statement turns out to be only half true. If it's true that cars all have a bit of performance in the end, there are however vehicles that grow faster than others, which leads to changing cars halfway through the game, perhaps when the initial one turns out to be not very powerful and we don't want to.~ farm~ reputation to unlock the new pieces. Furthermore, some races can only be unlocked by cars with a certain power or special cars which will therefore become part of our garage, equipped with only five places. At our disposal there are rear-wheel drive, front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive cars, this further differentiates the possible driving styles which in the end are channeled towards two main choices: racing set-up or drift. Thanks to some simple indicators we will in fact be able to choose whether we prefer a car glued to the road or a more skidding drive, adapting the settings to the race from time to time. In addition to tuning, which will allow us to significantly improve the car's performance, there is also the whole part linked to aesthetics with spoilers, side skirts, exhausts and alloy wheels up to the customization of the car's livery with dozens of different stickers to make it truly unique and recognizable.", "date": "2015-11-03", "grade": "7.8"}
