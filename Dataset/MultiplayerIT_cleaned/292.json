{"name": "Mario Golf: Super Rush", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mario-golf-super-rush-recensione.html", "text": "A few days ago we retraced the history of this saga: summarizing what interests us for our review of Mario Golf: Super Rush, this series returns after seven years, and on home consoles (hybrid, but still home consoles) even after seventeen, precisely since the days of GameCube. The developer is still Camelot Software Planning, better known as Camelot, in collaboration with the internal Nintendo EPD 2 team. The group that developed it is the same as Mario Tennis Aces, which dates back to 2018. The new Mario Golf not only shares the team with the game of tennis, but also the visual coordinates and, in general, aesthetics. It is the first and not the last time that we will propose this comparison during our article: for the moment, let's limit ourselves to writing that the two sportsmen for Nintendo Switch, unlike in the past, have tried to make the look more realistic and less masculine . It is always a question of achieving a balance between these two dimensions, but if in the old episodes the inhabitants of the Mushroom Kingdom appeared with their usual clothing, both in Mario Tennis Aces and in Mario Golf: Super Rush they have themed clothes. With some respectable exceptions like Yoshi, who always walks around naked. In our opinion, this is the right choice, because in this way, despite the playful form of the characters, the sporting context is immediately evident. The same graphic interface, more sober and formal than in the past, is taken from Mario Tennis Aces. In general, the visuals are pleasant, if not impressive, and the title runs at a constant 60fps. The similarities don't end there. We will analyze the result shortly, but the two titles, as an approach, are really brothers. Mario Tennis Aces, reasoning on the real mechanics of the sport represented, tried to translate them into the video game in an exaggerated way: what does tennis look like, more than any other genre? To a fighting game. And so Camelot and Nintendo have decided to enrich the usual mechanics with typical features of the genre. The same thing happened with Mario Golf: Super Rush: what is the goal of golf? Hole before your opponents. For this reason, a mode has been included in which, between one shot and another, you have to run faster than the others to reach your ball, and thus launch the next shot. Mario Tennis Aces many had criticized the single-player adventure: this because it was more like a long tutorial than a real adventure. Mindful of past glories, in which Camelot titles - on portable consoles - had authentic role-playing game contaminations, some users were left dumbfounded. The Adventure mode also returns to Mario Golf: Super Rush: we will discover the details together later in the review, reminding you that the game will be available from June 25, 2021. Basic mechanics Mario Golf: Super Rush: The shot bar has some new features. For decades, the dominant mechanics of golf video games, details and exceptions aside, have always been the same: you choose your club, you take a look at the wind and the map, you orient the direction of your shot, you select the desired power at the inside a dynamic bar and, immediately afterwards, an attempt is made to stop a second indicator as close as possible to the previous one, so as to obtain a precise shot. We were very surprised that Mario Golf: Super Rush doesn't use the same setting, to the point where we wondered for hours if we understood the game. Instead, unless we are very wrong, it is exactly like this: the recent Camelot project does not have the second indicator. Simply put, accuracy is given by the intensity of the shot (above or below the safety threshold), and by the innate ability of the selected character. In fact, once the power of the shot has been selected, before the second bar reaches the strength bar (a matter of a few moments), you ~only~ need to tilt the control stick in order to give the ball the desired effect. No second clicks. The main consequence of this setting is that there are fewer ~miss~ shots; to be honest, it must be said that the accuracy bar, in previous golf games, was a real obstacle mainly at the beginning of the experience. Nintendo and Camelot, by removing this element, have simplified life for novices, only taking away some depth from experienced players. Depth that however remains unchanged in the reading of the wind direction, of the rebounds, of the effects to be given to the sphere: lateral, upwards or downwards, in a more or less gradual way. Some characters can even give more than one direction, based on experience and the map: you can give a first effect to the right, perhaps to avoid a rock, and the next two to the leftstra, so - for example - to avoid a bunker and approach the green. Mario Golf: Super Rush: setting up a Special Shot. It is very important, in order to obtain good results, to learn how to read the map (from above) and the rangefinder (which measures the depth and inclination of the terrain) well, to then intersect these parameters with the wind direction and the ~roll ~, or the portion of the field that will cover the ball once it hits the ground. To become good players it is also necessary to master topspin and backspin: the former pushes forward at the end of the ball roll, the latter stops it more quickly. They are not difficult to perform - just block the power bar by clicking A twice, or B twice - but understanding and imagining the consequences is far from obvious. Maraio Golf: Super Rush: Luigi's Special Shot, which uses the Ice Flower. The accuracy indicator appears only in the more advanced stages, or in the use of certain clubs, or in the execution of a particularly complex lob: even in these circumstances, however, it is separated from the main bar. You have to stop a circular marker, which moves rather quickly, so that it coincides with the end of the club. It is, we repeat, a very rare event: you shouldn't face the Adventure, perhaps you wouldn't even come across it. To these shots are added the Special Shots, available only once the energy bar has been charged: they are more powerful and deeper shots than usual, which stop at the exact point of landing, the impact of which is capable of damaging the positioned balls nearby. We'll talk more about this when we cover the characters in the game. Speed Golf and Battle Golf Mario Golf: Super Rush: A shot in Speed Golf. To the canonical game modes, that is Free Golf and Solitary Challenge (where you can improve your scores and measure the skill level achieved), in Mario Golf: Super Rush two alternative and very creative specialties are added. The most publicized, and the one most present in the Adventure, is Speed Golf. As we said previously, Mario Tennis Aces founded the depth of its dynamics through a mix between the mechanics of tennis and those typical of a fighting game. Mario Golf: Super Rush tries to achieve the same result by merging golf and action games. In Speed Golf, once the shot has started, you have to run faster than the other players, dosing a fatigue indicator, so as to reach the ball just thrown as soon as possible. You can jump, and you can make shots that consume a large part of the fatigue bar: in the latter cases, by impacting your opponents, you manage to disorient and slow them down. A Mario Kart-style trail effect has also been added. Mario Golf: Super Rush: A Golf Battle stage. Speed Golf is an original and very fun mode; however, unlike Mario Tennis Aces, we suspect it won't replace the traditional one. For two very simple reasons. The first is that, in golf video games, the ~slowness~ of the real sport is already reduced through the elimination of walking from one post to another. The second reason lies in the very quality of these phases, which are fun but not as clean or well integrated as the fighting game mechanics in tennis. It will remain a very valuable mode, but probably an alternative to the main one. The most catalysing effect of Speed Golf does not lie so much in racing, but in haste, and consequently in the pressure, which is given to the execution of the shot. Battaglia Golf is an evolution of Speed Golf, but even further away from the original sport. As the name suggests, it resembles the Mario Kart mode of the same name. Basically you have to complete the many holes in the arena - a single arena, each course has several - before the competitors: all while also being able to hit bombs, so as to damage the opposing balls. A more traditional variant foresees that a single hole is reached before the others, after which another one appears (whoever completes three first wins); another places them all right from the start, so that everyone can choose the route they deem most suitable for their characteristics. Paths and characters Mario Golf: Super Rush: A course on Bowser's Volcano. There are currently six courses available in Mario Golf: Super Rush, each containing eighteen holes. Unlike in certain previous chapters, although some extravagant obstacles have been inserted, the courses are quite classic. They range from beginner holes, where you can practice without too many oddities, to Bowser's Volcano, where you will find towers, lava, unbelievable meadowslti, greens full of ups and downs. Valle del Lago, with its gusts of wind, is perhaps the route we preferred: a perfect blend of realism and Marian elements. In our opinion, the most difficult is not Bowser's course, but the Stormy Woods (surprising homage to Breath of the Wild), very difficult holes dominated by restless clouds, which at any moment could throw a bolt of lightning and make you lose one turn. The starting characters, excluding the Mii that can be imported from the Adventure, are sixteen. All coming from the Mario universe: no massive Super Smash Bros. Ultimate-style crossovers (obviously), but not even minimal ones like in Mario Kart 8. As we said at the beginning, each character, with the exception of exceptions such as Boo or Yoshi, is dressed as a golfer . We not only appreciated the decision, but also the execution: if Mario has impeccable clothes, Wario exhibits questionable lozenge trousers, and a horrifying cowboy hat. Waluigi looks like something out of The Godfather, and Bowser out of a Teutonic rave. The values that determine the characteristics of the characters are Power, Endurance, Speed, Control and Spin: the second and third are only important in Speed Golf and Battaglia Golf. Of course, golfers differ greatly from one another, but not as much as tennis. Mario Golf: Super Rush: some of the characters from the game, with the addition of a Mii. One aspect to take into consideration, especially in multiplayer challenges, lies in the consequences of the Special Shot: given that the basic mechanics are the same for everyone, the impact on the ground causes different effects. The character we used the most, Baby Bowser, envelops the ground next to him in smoke, hiding the position - on the map - of the flag from his opponents. Others transform the contenders' spheres into eggs or stars, so as to make their rolling irregular; still others move other people's balls more violently. The number of courses - while not low - is still not comparable to Mario Golf: World Tour; in the coming months things should change, through the arrival of free DLC. We had a small preview of it at E3, where we saw an appetizer of a Super Mario Odyssey themed setting: a welcome addition, given that the recent Nintendo 3D platformer is mentioned less than we thought, except thanks to the golfer Pauline. Given the sobriety of the initial routes, which we personally appreciated a lot, it is reasonable to expect less traditional, more bizarre and grotesque additions, with more unexpected events. Adventure Mario Golf: Super Rush: the beginning of the adventure, where you must necessarily control a Mii. Here we are at one of the topics that will most interest some readers, especially those who had enjoyed the single-player mode of the old portable Mario Golf. We anticipate it immediately: the Adventure of Mario Golf: Super Rush is more substantial and demanding than that of Mario Tennis Aces, but it is not comparable to those of the old Mario Golf. RPG dynamics are essentially absent. No rivalry with other emerging golfers (if not Boo and Plakkoopa, present only at the beginning), no apprenticeships and internal challenges up to challenging the protagonists; even the shops are not very present and, above all, the purchase of upgrades is rather obvious and guided. Mario Golf: Super Rush: One of the Adventure challenges. Judging this mode in relation to your expectations, or the results achieved in the past, would be wrong: the Adventure of Mario Golf: Speed Rush is long and demanding (around ten hours, including failures), fun, and at the end of the same you will be discreet players, but excellent golfers. In addition to the sporting challenges, there are areas, however simple, that act as the glue between one competition and another: sections where you can talk to the inhabitants and shopkeepers, and where you could find unexpected mentors. The Adventure gives a narrative context to the individual paths (we point out the Zeldian quotes from Boschi Tempestosi), and proposes challenges of various entities. Traditional, speed golf (above all), cross-country golf. It is ultimately a well-made and pleasant mode, long enough, which should not be compared to the Game Boy titles, of which it was the main backbone. The only real criticism we feel lies in the low-budget aspect of certain transition areas, graphically less well-maintained than golf courses. Motion Control and Multiplayer Mario Golf: Super Rush - the game's precise motion controls. Every time you start a path, you can select whether to use traditional controls or motion controls.
