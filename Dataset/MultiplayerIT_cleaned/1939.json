{"name": "Prisoner of War", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/prisoner-of-war_a.html", "text": "The war is not over yet Lewis Stone is a brave young US Air Force captain. During a reconnaissance mission, his plane is shot down by enemy anti-aircraft fire and he, after being captured, is taken to a prison camp waiting to be transferred to the far more fearsome ~Stalag Luft~ camp. Your task will be to escape from this prison and later from the other camps in which you will end up a prisoner. In the game there are three prison camps: the first which will essentially serve to make you understand the gameplay, then the Stalag Luft and finally the Colditz castle. These last two, in which you will end up prisoners several times, were made to almost completely reflect the real counterparts, an almost obligatory design choice given the fame and myth that accompanies these two places where many Allied soldiers and officers ended up prisoners . The game is structured in a series of submissions to be completed in succession, which will have the ultimate goal of making you escape and gaining your freedom. Therefore POW does not have an open structure and apparently it is rather linear, in reality each submission can be completed in several ways and moreover nothing will prevent you from exploring the field as and when you deem it appropriate. Between one escape attempt and another, you will learn of a secret project concerning a new type of weapon that could shift the balance in favor of the Axis, for this reason it will be necessary not only to gain freedom but also to try to sabotage such project. An intriguing diversion that makes the plot that forms the background to the game even more substantial, increasing curiosity and the desire to continue. Mission Impossible: Escape from Colditz Through a third person view you will move inside the prison camps. In open spaces you can freely control the camera using the right analog stick, vice versa in closed environments (canteen, dormitories, offices, etc.) you will switch to a fixed camera view. At any time it will be possible to use a first person view, with which you will not be able to move, but only look around. Two basic tools are displayed on the game screen: a clock and a map that doubles as a radar. The purpose of the clock is to signal, with mobile notches of different colours, the duration of the field activity currently in progress and the time at which the next one will begin. In fact, in every prison camp, daily life will be marked by predetermined activities that will take place in precise areas and which it will be necessary to respect to avoid ending up in solitary confinement. In particular, it will be mandatory to show up for the two daily roll calls while the other activities can be circumvented but it will be necessary to avoid being discovered in the wrong place at the wrong time. Ending up in solitary confinement will result in the loss of all the objects you are wearing at that moment and the accumulated credits. In fact, during your travels you can bring with you up to a maximum of 5 pocket objects and only one in hand, for example a crowbar. All the recovered objects can be stored in the hiding place inside the shack where you will sleep and can be collected and taken with you at any time. The map, which updates according to the areas explored, will be useful during your travels as it dynamically indicates the position of enemy soldiers and also because the visual cone of each soldier will be graphically represented on it (as seen in Commandos), to be kept in mind to evade the surveillance of the guards. A note of merit certainly goes to the artificial intelligence of the guards, who, despite following predetermined routes, become suspicious at the slightest noise and have excellent eyesight which logically increases during the day. An alerted guard becomes a random variable, he will move quickly in search of the cause of his suspicion and therefore you will always have little time to gain a new safe position. The techniques to elude the guards are many: sneaking along the walls, or crouching or crawling, distracting them through a noise that can be obtained by throwing a stone or banging on the wall, convincing a prisoner to distract a guard and finally wearing a uniform German, if you ever find one. The interaction with the non-player characters will be another fundamental element for the game, in fact the dialogue with the other prisoners allows youwill try to steal information of vital importance and above all to acquire new missions to complete. The technical realization Prisoner of war is a cross-platform game and is not designed to take full advantage of the hardware capabilities of the Xbox. To be clear, the version examined is practically identical to the PS2 version from a graphic point of view. A more than satisfactory modeling of the game environments is contrasted by the mediocrity of the textures used, the poor video cleanliness and the absence of graphic effects such as multitexturing and bump-mupping, which the Micorsoft console can afford without too many worries. The animations of the main and non-player characters are good, while the use of a ~screen relative~ (or ~push~) type movement system causes problems in controlling the character during shot changes. The sound sector can boast normal effects and perhaps a little too repetitive music which, however, dynamically adapts to the type of situation faced. COMMENT Prisoner of war is the classic game which, although based on an original and fascinating idea, fails to stand as a masterpiece because it is tarnished by a not excellent technical realization and by a control system that presents some uncertainty. If you are a fan of adventure games, in which to emerge victorious you will have to use only your brain and forget about brute force, then you cannot miss this game. Pros: - Good playability, even if undermined by some uncertainties related to the management of the cameras. - Definitely long-lived, also due to the not low level of difficulty. Cons: - Technically too similar to the PS2 version, it doesn't take advantage of the capabilities of the Xbox. - Sound and music without infamy, but without praise. Codemasters has repeatedly had the merit and the courage to have produced games based on an original concept and it is sufficient to mention Operation Flashpoint to confirm this statement, a game which, among other things, will soon be released for Xbox as well. Prisoner of war leverages an innovative concept: set during the Second World War, your task will be to escape from a German prison camp. Wide Games, the software house that developed it, inspired by successful films such as ~The Great Escape~ and ~Escape to Victory~, has created a stealth game that can be defined as a Metal Gear Solid set in the 40s.", "date": "2002-11-13", "grade": null}
