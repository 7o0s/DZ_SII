Words, the latter, uttered by Ubisoft, who with Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X. 2 therefore tries to skip the steps that separate a barely discrete product from a million seller. We can immediately say that, unfortunately, the goal has not been achieved in the slightest. The plot of H.A.W.X. 2, following the most recent traditions, sees us initially control Colonel David Crenshaw, protagonist of the debut episode, and then alternate in the role of American major Alex Hunter, British lieutenant Colin Munro and Russian captain Dimitri Sokov. During an exercise, a group of terrorists hits a US military base hard, capturing Crenshaw, and this action kicks off an escalation that involves multiple fronts, in a series of missions of various kinds that culminate with the classic face final face. We therefore move from the theme of the privatization of war, dealt with with relative effectiveness in the first H.A.W.X., to a story that is in many ways more traditional, certainly in the Tom Clancy style. During the missions we will clearly find ourselves flying an airplane and fighting in the skies, associating the clashes with a series of ~technical~ maneuvers such as the take-off and landing phases (carried out both from the ground and aboard an aircraft carrier), as well as refueling in flight. The variation on the theme is represented by the ~tactical~ phases, in which we control the powerful weapons of a bomber that moves at very high altitudes. In this situation, using the powerful infrared telephoto lens of our station, we will have to communicate with agents on the ground and cover their backs, place detection sensors to mark targets and finally dedicate ourselves to some healthy destruction using heavy machine guns, missiles and bombs . Beyond the three different points of view offered by the story, discovering that these ~tactical~ sections are the most relevant novelty introduced by the developers was a bit disappointing. Mind you, in their small way they perform the task of making the action more varied, but in themselves they are a bit boring and lacking in bite. On/Off Much better to dart through the skies at supersonic speed, which we will be called to do on several occasions throughout the game. The first episode of H.A.W.X. very gradually introduced the so-called ~OFF mode~, i.e. an alternative control system which, assisted by a third-person ~lateral~ view of the aircraft, allowed us to carry out maneuvers as far as possible, especially useful during combat more challenging. We expected an optimization of this feature which instead, somewhat surprisingly, was inserted immediately and almost silently, simply placing itself as an alternative to the normal controls and without emphasizing its effectiveness, also and above all in narrative terms. For the rest, we can pilot our fighter by selecting the view between first and third person, manage yaw and speed, operate the weapons and even resort to missiles with an unprecedented automatic search mechanism, which we will then be able to follow in their journey through a spectacular direct view. The use of weapons in some circumstances appears simplistic (see the missiles), in others terribly cumbersome (the machine gun), while the presence of flares for the most risky situations does not add the hoped depth to dogfights, which are mostly resolved in classic sequence of sudden turns and speed changes to lock-on. Finally, the scenarios do not perform their task effectively: too often we find ourselves flying over desolate deserts, without any element that could influence the action, and when instead we move between mountains or fixed locations, the sense of speed leaves us very to desire. There is therefore the clear sensation of being faced with an all too static flight simulator, which does not sufficiently emphasize accelerations nor manage to propose particularly exciting situations. In addition to the story mode, it is possible to try single missions, take a free flight to enjoy the scenery, try the ~survival~ mode full of combat or face a series of special missions. There is also online multiplayer for ranked and unranked matches, with two teams of four players battling it out in a location of your choice. Strangely, during our tests we have not been able to find players available to test this mode as well. The eye from the sky Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X. 2 makes use of the technologyGeoEye to make the landscapes better, and in fact from this point of view it is difficult to criticize the Ubisoft product: the scenarios appear very realistic, even if the level of interaction that is now expected from a flight simulator is missing, although arcade styled. We tried to fly close to the ocean without the water reacting in any way to our passage, for example, and this lack ultimately reflects a bit the general situation of the game, in relation to the technical implementation. In fact, we move between ups and downs, with the polygonal models of the planes that are too little detailed to give back who knows what sensation of realism, and also react timidly to light sources. The few ~active~ buildings that can be seen in the scenarios are very simple and made with an unconvincing color palette. On the other hand, as already mentioned, the quality of the landscapes sometimes reaches peaks of excellence, benefiting among other things from the tessellation (running the game in DirectX 11 mode) which is clearly visible from some of the photos we have captured. On our test setup, H.A.W.X. 2 performed remarkably well, hovering between 30 and 60 fps during the actual action at 1680 x 1050 pixel resolution and with all effects maxed out. The only drawback: during certain phases (see the sequences prior to take-off, in which you see a cross-section of the air base) the frame rate inexplicably drops below 20 frames per second. Hopefully there will be a patch to fix this. Finally, the sound sector seemed to us to be of good quality: the music is excellent, very ~cinematographic~ and suited to the context, while the Italian dubbing is well done.", "date": "2010-12-01", "grade": "7.0"}
