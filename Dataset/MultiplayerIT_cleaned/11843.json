{"name": "Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare.html", "text": "It has been known for some time that COD4 was an extremely promising title: the previous episodes have always been characterized by great quality, and the change of setting has brought with it an incredible technical enhancement, which places the Activision product at the top of the action genre. It is probably also for this reason that the creation of the mobile version has been entrusted to a capable developer like Glu, which boasts an important catalog, also made up of surprising titles from a technical point of view (see Shadowalker or Alpha Wing 2). Unfortunately in the case of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, the Californian company has opted for solutions that are anything but revolutionary, offering us a strategic action game that remains average for games of the genre. But let's go in order... The start screen allows us to start a new game or to continue from the last level reached, and of course the action is based on a series of missions that need to be completed from time to time. To succeed in the enterprise, we will be able to count on a team of soldiers who accompany our character and imitate their behavior, especially when it comes to eliminating enemies. The weapons at our disposal range from the service machine gun to the precision one, from grenades to explosive charges, passing through the ever-present bazooka. Once we have opponents within range, we will be able to shoot them by pressing the FIRE button (or the 5 key on the numeric pad) and we will see their energy bar go down as the shots hit. Of course, the opposite also applies, so it is advisable to attack only after having found a shelter from which to lean while the enemies are busy reloading their weapons. Then there are weapons, such as the sniper rifle, which do not require eye contact: by pressing the 0 key, we will activate a type of view in the form of a crosshair and it will be enough to bring it to the target to eliminate it with a single shot, provided there are no obstacles between him and our character. This is not an original solution, as it has already been used in other games of the same genre. The level of artificial intelligence is average: the enemies do nothing but shoot us without bothering to find shelter or possibly escape, and our companions follow a similar philosophy, remaining victims of attacks when they are brought from a position advantaged. Most likely it is a choice capable of allowing the maximum diffusion of COD4, the fact is that the technical realization of the game is decidedly lower than expected, especially if you think about what Glu has managed to do lately. The settings boast a discreet detail, but often end up repeating themselves in the elements and consequently the various stages are not very different from each other, also due to the colors used. The characters don't boast an exceptional design, but more than anything else they have mediocre animation, made up of very few frames. As for the sound, we have some good quality music but effects that are anything but realistic. The control system is classic, with the joystick to move our soldier, the FIRE button (or 5) to fire the main weapon and the lower buttons in the numeric pad for alternative weapons. The inputs are quickly received by the game, which for the genre it belongs to does not suffer even in the presence of uncomfortable or slow joysticks to operate. Pros: A good number of missions Proven game mechanics Quite funny Against: Technically just average Not original at all We expected better from Glu", "date": "2007-11-12", "grade": "9.4"}
