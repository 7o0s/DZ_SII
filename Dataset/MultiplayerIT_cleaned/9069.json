The original Angry Birds, despite having been joined by a series of spin-offs and promotional chapters, can now count on a much higher quantity of levels than the original one, while Pocket God is probably the game that has seen the most updates since its launch. However, there are those who implement a different strategy, and rather than milking their cow completely, they decide to replace it as soon as it begins to give less milk. This is the case of the British development team HotGen, which a few months after the release of the highly successful To-Fu: The Trials of Chi, decided to publish a new episode called simply To-Fu 2. Never a title, however, it was so inappropriate. But is it a real sequel? Considering that the entire structure of the game rested entirely on the design of the levels, the position of the traps and the objects to collect, the original To-Fu lent itself very well to welcome tons of new updates, with new scenarios to broaden the experience and offer the player new challenges. This is why from a direct sequel released in such a short distance one would have expected big news that would justify a separate purchase rather than a simple DLC. Yet To-Fu 2 looks exactly like a stand-alone extension of the first chapter, limiting itself to proposing a large number of unpublished levels and some insignificant novelties in the gameplay. Right from the start, those who have played The Trials of Chi will have a strong sense of deja-vu, with a game menu that, despite being more refined and cleaner than before, offers the same and identical options. The idea behind the game is the same as in the first chapter: unable to walk, the little protagonist made of tofu must be slingshot from one surface to another with a finger, trying to overcome obstacles and bounce towards a fortune cookie placed at the other end of the stage. Again, each level can be replayed multiple times in order to complete it by collecting all the Chi Orbs or reaching the end in the fewest moves, which adds a fair amount of longevity to the game and makes some scenarios pleasantly difficult. In To-Fu 2 all the traps already seen in The Trials of Chi are re-proposed, but alongside the usual quills, the usual laser beams and the usual sharp blades make their appearance platforms on which it is possible to bounce only once and wooden beams to be destroyed by striking them with force. In this regard, To-Fu has been equipped with a new ability: by keeping it extended for a few seconds before throwing it, it is possible to collect energy and throw it forward at high speed, which on the one hand allows you to pass the axes just mentioned, on the other to overcome particular puzzles that require a particular speed of movement. However, it is a minor addition, exploited so little and badly that in certain levels it even ends up weighing down the gameplay, while the defects of the original remain unchanged, with the impossibility of moving the camera away and a structure based perhaps too much on trial and error. As if that weren't enough, a considerable part of the 100 proposed levels is much less unpublished than the developers want to believe, recycling some puzzle designs already seen in the first chapter in a very little veiled way. Let me be clear, there is some news underneath: the dojo, which in The Trials of Chi was a simple room in which to make the protagonist bounce for no reason, now allows you to customize To-Fu with some gadgets, such as alien antennas or hachimaki of different colors: not much stuff here either, since the funniest embellishments, as well as the personalized backdrops for the dojo, must be purchased separately. Instead, the Time Trial option is welcome, in which to collect the largest number of Chi spheres in the time limit, but this too, as well as all the other innovations introduced by To-Fu 2, would have made a better impression in an update of the first episode rather than in a whole new chapter.
