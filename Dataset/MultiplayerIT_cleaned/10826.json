{"name": "Codename: Panzers - Cold War - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/codename-panzers-cold-war-recensione.html", "text": "Codename: Panzers - Cold War, the third installment of a good series of real-time strategy games, starts from a fictional-historical assumption, hypothesizing an open-field clash between Stalinist Russia and capitalist America, which broke out due to a military accident . For most of the missions that make up the four acts of the main campaign, we'll be called upon to lead NATO troops, while some of the final missions will put us in command of the Soviet army. The aim of the game, on each map, is to achieve some objectives specified from time to time, which can be summarized as: advance, destroy, capture and at least defend. As you may have understood, in most cases it is required to clean up some strategic areas of the map to take control of them, so as to receive support of various types. For example, by capturing a heliport you get the possibility of receiving additional troops, accessible by spending the accumulated prestige points. Usually the map initially sees us in command of a small group of men and vehicles, with the aim of conquering the various points of interest. There are rare cases in which this rule is avoided. The user interface is very simple, with the core of the troop management controls at the bottom right and the other buttons intelligently scattered throughout the various areas of the hud. The developers have implemented all the improvements that the real-time strategy genre has enjoyed over the years, so there is no shortage of groupings, quick selection of conquered structures and so on. Nothing new, actually, but you'll be happy to know that no complications of any kind have been introduced and that from this point of view we are dealing with a wise and shrewd work. Agile and beautiful The agile interface corresponds to equally streamlined gameplay, with the player called to advance in a systematic way, sometimes a little mechanical, towards the objectives. The first maps are obviously simpler, while things get complicated with the advanced levels, where the enemy resistance becomes more nourished. One piece of advice we can give you is to play at least at the third difficulty level (out of four), if you want the campaign to last a little longer, otherwise you will reluctantly discover that it takes just a few hours to finish it, given the relative brevity of many maps and the general weakness of enemies. In fact Codename: Panzers - Cold War is quite easy compared to average. There are tougher moments, but generally you manage to overcome any obstacle on the second attempt. This is because, in essence, the CPU moves the troops with extremely rigid pre-established tactics, not adapting to the unfolding of events and not reacting immediately to the player's requests. Therefore, it often happens to witness uncoordinated attacks by the opposing forces, ineffective even against minimal defenses, because the tactical elaboration has been null. In reality, not even a lot of strategic competence is required from the player because, at least in single player, to win it is often enough to advance slowly, always making sure to bring the strongest troops with you. This is not always the case but, especially in the first maps, the sense of being on a ~walk~ looms dramatically on several occasions. Fortunately, things improve in advanced missions (let's say from the end of the second act onwards), in which Cold War gives its best and in which it manages to commit just enough. Life is just a walking squared shadow To get the most out of the game you have to aim for multiplayer, the main mode. Here too, the path of conservation was chosen, that is, the developers have decided to carry out their task and have not tried to put half a toe beyond what has already been seen elsewhere. Having said that, it is undeniable that, although lacking in originality, Cold War's multiplayer is excellent and very balanced and it is certainly the mode that can give more life to the overall gaming experience. From a technical point of view the game shines in the middle. If it is true that all the elements of the map are destructible and that the setting reacts realistically to the various inputs of the battles, with cannon shots breaking the facades of the buildings and tanks that knock down turrets with their tracks, it is also true that there that's a price to pay in terms of performance. With the test computer we were able to play decently at high (not maximum) details but we found some rather annoying framerate drops, especially in the most agitated situations. Moreover, if at maximum quality the details of the game world are really beautiful and cared for, going down even one level of detail you notice frankly avoidable distortions, such as the terrible shadowsand squared (open an image to realize what we are describing) that are not exactly beautiful to look at. On the other hand, the three-dimensional models are generally well cared for and animated, even if a certain overall lack of units should be noted. From the sound point of view there is not much to report: the music is a pleasant accompaniment, but does not go beyond the typical rhetoric of the military genre, while the soundtrack is overall very rich in sound effects, which well describe what happens on the screen: from the explosions of shots fired, to collapsing buildings, to the sound of crawlers breaking through a fence. Comment The greatest price that Codename: Panzers - Cold War pays is that it is released simultaneously with sacred monsters that obscure it in more than one sense. For the rest, it is a solid and well-crafted real-time strategy game which, while not offering anything new compared to the competition and the previous chapters of the series, deserves to be taken into consideration, at least for the multiplayer mode.Pro Excellent multiplayer mode Great interface Expertly crafted...
