{"name": "Ninja Gaiden Sigma - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ninja-gaiden-sigma-recensione.html", "text": "At the time of the first release Ninja Gaiden was considered one of the graphically best titles ever to appear on the Xbox, and in the transition to PlayStation 3 it could not fail to undergo a restyling to keep up with the times and take advantage of the greater technical capabilities of the Sony console. Sigma therefore offers a graphics engine that always ~runs~ at 60 frames per second and supports all resolutions up to 1080p, with a rather satisfying result on high definition televisions. The improvements are not limited here, and in fact we find more defined textures, brighter and more vivid colors (just look at the first setting) and the introduction of self shadowing on the protagonist Ryu who, together with all the other characters, has been redesigned with a higher number of polygons. Last but not least, the animations have also been updated, and now the result is more convincing and in line with the rest. Being still a port of an ~old~ graphic engine, there are some things that obviously don't convince and that lower the overall graphic judgment, such as the absence of any interaction with the environment, and the poverty of the settings, very well designed but lacking in detail. The PAL version offers an excellent written translation into Italian and the possibility of choosing between Japanese and English for speech. Unfortunately we have to point out that the European edition has been partially censored compared to the American one; no severed heads then, European players are too impressionable. Beyond the wall We've lavished several praises on the gameplay, but obviously not all factors are convincing. In the face of fighting close to excellence, it cannot be said that the exploration and puzzle part is of the same level, given that you often find yourself solving simple puzzles or doing different back and forth between already visited locations. The other problem is represented by the camera, cross and delight of the previous chapters and which, despite being fully adjustable with the back buttons, does not go well in the most chaotic situations or when you need to make jumps or passages where precision is essential. The difficulty is instead a false problem, for two simple reasons: Sigma is a very technical title, but if the player is committed to using a good part of the techniques at his disposal, he will have no problems completing it. At worst, after losing a certain amount of life, the title will ask the player to switch to easy mode, thanks to which there will be no difficulty in enjoying the game, however at the expense of a lower level of challenge. Obviously they told us this thing, we are too good to play at a lower difficulty level. Comment Sigma takes up the original chapter and the Black version, and enriches them with a visibly superior graphic sector and with various additions that will surely please fans of the saga. The exploratory and puzzle part is not in line with the rest and the camera still makes some tantrums, but Tecmo's title is a solid and very technical action game, certainly the best exponent currently available for PlayStation 3 and to be taken into consideration also by who played the original title, by virtue of the innovations introduced. Pros Very technical and rewarding gameplay Good graphic sector Cons Camera still to be improved Exploratory part only in the norm During the past generation of consoles, Team Ninja, a famous developer within Tecmo, seemed unwilling to develop for Sony platforms, either for the lower technical characteristics than the competition, or for a different type of programming logic. Times finally seem to have changed, and the Japanese developer is also appearing on PlayStation 3 with a revised and corrected version of one of his most important titles, Ninja Gaiden, arrived here in the Sigma edition. Before moving on to the focus of the review, it is good to make some historical references. The original title was born on Xbox in 2004, and saw a new edition the following year, called Black. Ninja Gaiden had actually already been very successful on the NES with three episodes, and is part of that group of very frenetic and at the same time technical action/adventures, with combat mechanics almost like a fixed-pattern fighting game. The story centers around the figure of Ryo Hayabusa, a ninja initially engaged in the search for a sword with immense powers, called the Dark Dragon Blade, and stolen from his native village, which has unfortunately been razed to the ground. The main character's thirst for revenge and research will lead to a clash against some demons and the explosion of the plot that will accompany the game for its entire duration.while remaining rather simple also by virtue of its typology. The development of the levels takes place through a few chapters, which act as a link for the narration of the plot and are accompanied by full motion video sequences. The scheme takes up the classic one of the genre: an exploratory part, the one dedicated to the fights and some puzzle components, which mainly focus on finding the keys, unlocking some gears and so on. The heart of the game, however, lies in the fights, which in Ninja Gaiden are a pleasure for the eyes and for the pad. It starts slowly using parry and attack, but if you want to progress you have to learn to dodge, attack quickly and use the large number of combos that the title developed by Team Ninja makes available. The Dragon Sword, initial weapon, can be joined by nunchaku and company (by the way, in Sigma there are two new ones, Dragon's Claw and Tiger's Fang, both with double swords) and by throwing objects such as bow with arrows, shurikens and so Street. Each weapon can be upgraded, through the blacksmiths scattered throughout the game, by spending the Karma points accumulated during the adventure, which also allow you to purchase items to restore energy, automatically ~resurrect~ in case of death and more. The brave Ryo Hayabusa can also run briefly on walls or jump from one wall to another, in order to reach otherwise inaccessible platforms or even as a strategy to attack from above, perhaps combined with the so-called special moves, here called Ninpo, which they are gradually acquired during the course of the adventure. He can also walk on water (the analogies with religion have nothing to do here) and unlike in the past, there is no need to press the jump button repeatedly, just keep running to not sink and use this particular feature from ninjas. Like Black however, once the game is over it is possible to send your Karma points in an online ranking, which will allow you to compete against other characters scattered all over the globe, and unlock the Mission mode, which, as the name implies, provides really difficult challenges that enhance the combat system of the Tecmo title. The Sixaxis pad goes well with the action, with the X button dedicated to jumping, square and circle for slashing with weapons and feet, and the backbones used for camera control. The introduction in the interface of the possibility of calling up, using the digital cross, a menu during the action which allows you to choose and use the available objects, without pausing the game, go through the main menu and then break the action repeatedly. The novelties of Sigma are not limited only to those previously listed, but are also grafted into the development of the adventure itself. The most evident is that of a new character, the blonde Rachel, who in previous versions of the game only appeared in the movies and non-interactive sequences, and who here in Sigma instead is an integral part of the gameplay. In fact, there are chapters entirely dedicated to this all too busty fighter, which allow you to reveal new plot points and levels. The fighting style, unlike that of Ryu, is focused on the brute strength of the protagonist, who for the occasion is equipped with a sort of extremely powerful hammer / axe, which allows you to get the better of enemies and demons with just a few blows , and to throw them at every point of the scenario. While not of the same bill as those that see Ryu as the protagonist, Rachel's levels are quite enjoyable and add a little more variety to the production. Even in general, the development of the adventure sees small changes and additions compared to the Black edition, starting from the positioning of the chests with the objects, to arrive at the appearance of new bosses and small sections of the scenario to explore, something that can already be found in starting with the second chapter.", "date": "2007-07-06", "grade": null}
