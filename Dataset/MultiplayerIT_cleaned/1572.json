{"name": "Clock Tower 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/clock-tower-4.html", "text": "Alyssawhere are you? The protagonist of the game is Alyssa, a young student in a British college: nearing her fifteenth birthday, our heroine receives a letter from her beloved mother, who desperately invites her to hide and stay away from her native home at all costs. Frightened by the disturbing epistle, Alyssa decides to contravene this latest warning, worried about her mother's seemingly incomprehensible fears. Inside her own home, however, the young woman comes across an unknown and mysterious man, dressed in a black coat and hat, who after some enigmatic statements disappears into thin air: as if that were not enough, however, Alyssa is found immediately after catapulted into the scenario of a London in the middle of the Second World War, persecuted by a ferocious assassin. Put in these terms, the plot of Clock Tower 3 could appear at least senseless; in reality this brief introduction to the facts is only the prologue of a solid and well-constructed storyline, of which we do not provide other elements in order not to risk ruining the surprise for interested users. Suffice it to say, however, that during the adventure, Alyssa will discover the dark past of her family, and will be forced to face six different serial killers in as many scenarios from various temporal locations. Which connects us directly to the game structure of Clock Tower 3: having abandoned the awkward and ill-suited point-and-click interface of the previous episodes, this third chapter presents a more appropriate and familiar scheme, with totally 3D settings framed by both fixed and mobile cameras and with the movements of the protagonist manageable directly from the controller stick. Nothing new, therefore, but the peculiarities are only starting now. As mentioned, during the game Alyssa is constantly threatened by the presence of a serial killer, whose approach is emphasized by a distressing musical accompaniment: well, all that our heroine can do is simply run away. Oh yes, because if we exclude the bottle of holy water useful for momentarily blocking the villain on duty, Alyssa is completely defenseless, and must try to hide from the eyes of the assassin by exploiting certain hiding places marked by a bright glow in order to lose her traces of it for a certain period. Like Sailor Moon Another peculiar feature of Clock Tower 3 is the presence of a single indicator on the screen, which shows the level of fear of poor Alyssa, susceptible to increases during close encounters with the serial killer on duty: when it is completely full, our heroine she panics, begins to run erratically and stumble, and only then can she be killed by a single blow. Precisely these characteristics of the gameplay make Clock Tower 3 an extremely impressive title, both for the continuous feeling of anguish that one feels for the looming threat, and for some sudden appearances on the scene of the evil assassins, often really heart attacking. Added to this is the great crudeness of some murder scenes of the aforementioned serial killers: seeing a little girl brutally killed with a hammer or a defenseless old lady being dissolved in acid (just to give two examples) is certainly not a trivial matter. . And the good technical realization of the game helps to emphasize these and other aspects of the adventure, thanks to very accurate settings and polygonal models (only Alyssa's animations leave something to be desired), truly masterful cut-scenes and a sound accompaniment intelligent. Unfortunately, the overall quality of Clock Tower 3 is undermined by a general limitation of the gameplay: the puzzles to be faced are very simple (the resolution of all the chapters also lies in bringing particular objects back to the spirits of the victims of the assassins in order to be able to free them ), and the continuous escapes to hideouts can in the long run become quite repetitive, albeit always distressing. The battles with the bosses deserve particular mention, probably the most out of tune note of the entire Capcom production. At the end of each chapter it is necessary to face the serial killer on duty in battle, a procedure that is allowed by an unfortunate expedient: in an atmosphere more like Sailor Moon than survival horror, Alyssa's bottle of holy water turns into a magical bow capable of defeating evil. Armed in this way, our heroine can face daunting combat: we simply go around in circles, waiting for the enemy to stop to launch an attack (empty, yeshopes) to hit him with an arrow. And the incomprehensibly high energy bar of the bosses forces you to repeat the tedious process for many, too many, minutes Comment Clock Tower 3 is a title that in the face of a really well-constructed storyline (emphasized by excellent cut-scenes), a respectable technical realization and a decidedly scary atmosphere capable of giving numerous jumps on the armchair, fails unfortunately to offer a gameplay up to par. Beyond the aforementioned boss battles, at least out of place and ill-conceived, the Capcom product suffers above all from problems related to a rather limiting game system: after all, it is always a question of escaping from a serial killer, hiding when possible and solving easy puzzles during times of peace. Having said that, Clock Tower 3 is absolutely not a bad title, and indeed deserves all the attention of fans of the genre, for the undoubted advantages listed above: there is still a bit of a bitter taste in the mouth for a product which, if more level of gameplay, he could certainly have competed on equal terms with the various Resident Evil and Silent Hill. Pros: Excellent plot and cut-scenes masterfully shot Great atmosphere and heart-stopping twists Original compared to other survival horror films Cons: Limiting game structure Cumbersome control system Poorly done boss battles In the beginning it was Alone in the Dark. An excellent title, certainly, but which despite the various sequels remained for a long time the only worthy representative of a genre that only several years later, thanks to Resident Evil, became known by the masses as survival horror. From then on, this category of video games was rapidly enriched with titles that were also different from each other, but which in any case led to a certain fossilization of the game structure within certain standards. Fortunately, there is always someone who tries to break new ground: this is the case of Clock Tower 3, which instead of putting on the plate the usual carnage of zombies and various monsters, forces the player to assume the role of an ~armed~ girl  only of a bottle of holy water", "date": "2003-07-25", "grade": null}
