Fun and well done, MMX Hill Climb stumbles a bit on a poorly calibrated level of difficulty It takes beastly physics In MMX Hill Climb, the user's primary objective is not so much to reach the finish line of the various routes as quickly as possible, but rather to get there in one piece: on board one of the eight monster trucks available, it is necessary in fact tackle over 20 tracks characterized by ups and downs, ramps and various obstacles, all elements that put a strain on the stability of cars characterized by the ability to explode at the slightest contact of the bodywork with the asphalt. To try to overcome this fatal fate, the player must act on the only two commands on the screen, namely the accelerator pedal and the brake pedal: in addition to fulfilling their obvious functions, the keys also serve to balance the weight of the car , returning it to four wheels in the event of a wheelie or rotating it when suspended in the air. Much easier said than done, because the developers of Hutch have well thought of applying to the cars of the game not exactly realistic physical laws, which make the vehicles extremely sensitive to any solicitation, especially when they have not yet been duly strengthened. In fact, by spending the emblems collected along the way, it is possible to increase the four different characteristics of the current monster truck up to a maximum of ten points, namely speed, grip, stability and inclination. Here the donkey falls a bit, in the sense that like any self-respecting free to play, MMX Hill Climb also tries to complicate life as much as possible for the user less willing to put his hand to his wallet: therefore you have to go through a heavy grinding to be able to carry out all the upgrades without giving in to the lure of in-app purchases, just as you have to sweat the proverbial seven shirts to be able to ~honestly~ unlock the most advanced models. The catch lies in the fact that - at a certain point - without a vehicle up to par it becomes practically impossible to aspire to complete the internships, much less compete on equal terms with your friends who occupy the highest positions in the rankings. Indeed, it is here that the phantom social component we mentioned at the beginning takes shape: during each match, in the background it is possible to observe a parallel track on which the ghost car of the player who occupies the immediately higher position in the ranking runs, an element which allows us to observe his driving techniques and above all acts as a stimulus to do better to be able to overtake him. Advancing in the rankings is not only a source of pride, but also guarantees a prize in coins of an entity directly proportional to the position conquered: a certainly effective formula, which adds a pleasant multiplayer nuance to a product that remains an experience to be enjoyed strictly from alone. The presence of an adversary also helps to mitigate the inevitable sensations of repetitiveness and frustration that one feels when one is forced to restart from the beginning for the umpteenth time after having seen one's car explode due to poorly calibrated acceleration: one could however, to do better as regards balancing the difficulty, and it is quite evident that the Hutch family has been seduced by the prospects of easy earnings through in-app purchases to the detriment of the pleasantness of a gameplay which inevitably at a at some point it gets boring. Even the sound sector deserved an extra effort, being composed of few effects and country-style background music which after a few sessions already becomes unbearable. On the other hand, nothing to object to a graphic design that performs its duty impeccably: the tracks stand out against colorful and pleasant backdrops, and the models of the cars denote a good level of detail and physical routines consistent with the arcade tone of the production.", "date": "2016-06-04", "grade": "7.5"}
