{"name": "Transformers", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/transformers-2.html", "text": "I wrote a while ago on the subject: tie-ins generally exploit the popularity of the series they're based on to hide their weaknesses. The moment the production of a game is entrusted to expert hands, however, and the resources necessary to create something good are made available, the story changes. So far (and I'm talking about thirty years of video games) this has occurred so rarely that it is difficult to remember the specific cases. The managers of Melbourne House, the team that gave birth to Transformers, have made it clear that their latest work is a game to be taken into consideration regardless of the Hasbro/Takara license, and indeed they have invited PS2 owners to forget that it is of a tie-in. In reality, Transformers goes beyond these concepts: it is a game with a rich structure, which combines action (and what action!) with strategic and exploratory elements worthy of the best products of the genre; and which seasoned everything with a clear passion for transformable robots that come from Cybertron, involving them in a simple but fascinating adventure, full of ideas for fans and nice extras. But let's go in order... Transformers, the game Initially titled ~Transformers Armada~ due to the clear reference to the animated series of the same name, then simply renamed ~Transformers~ for a matter of mere recall (I suppose), the game tells its story through a series of exceptionally well-crafted animated sequences, intersect with the topical moments of the adventure. We are on Cybertron, one million years ago. The planet is populated by robots with consciences, ruled by the valiant group of Autobots... until the evil Megatron and his Decepticons find a way to amplify their power and overthrow the government, plunging Cybertron into tyrannical chaos. The secret is in the Mini-Cons, a race of small Transformers who can combine with Decepticons or Autobots to give them new powers. Some Mini-Cons manage to free their comrades from Megatron's prisons and escape aboard a spaceship to freedom, but things don't go well and these little Transformers fall to planet Earth, only waking up in the present day. Once the Mini-Cons' location is discovered, the Decepticons travel to Earth en masse to find them and, while they're at it, colonize the planet. It will be the task of Optimus Prime and his Autobots to stop the enemies of all time... The player can decide to play one of the three Autobots available: Optimus Prime (powerful but slow), Red Alert (rather balanced) or Hot Shot (very fast but not suitable for close quarters). Once the choice has been made, we leave for the first area in which Mini-Cons have been identified. Here, following the instructions sent by your companions, you will have to face a large number of Decepticons and find all the hidden Mini-Cons. Once you have found a Mini-Con, you can use it to your alter ego's advantage and assign its functions to one of the Dual Shock 2's four back buttons, checking its availability using the appropriate bars. When the number of collected Mini-Con exceeds four units, you have to select the desired ones before setting off on a mission, being careful to combine them so that they do not overload the system (in fact, it is not possible to use only high-powered Mini-Cons) . From the second level onwards, our character will also be accompanied by a ~shoulder~ Mini-Con, which will support our attacks and give us the possibility to combine with him (Square key) to become faster than the enemy in a sort of ~bullet time~ spectacular but to be used sparingly (it consumes energy). Naturally, these special abilities are accompanied by the normal functions of our Autobot: the basic attack (R1 key, which can be modified according to the Mini-Con available), the jump (L1 key, with the same for assigned Mini-Cons) and the ability to quickly transform into a vehicle. This particularity of the Transformers is exploited in an intelligent way by the developers: the characters move slowly precisely to exploit the speed of the vehicle mode when necessary, or to speed up the exploration of certain areas or to escape a numerically unfavorable battle. Once the player gets familiar with the control system, he can use the transformation in an absolutely dynamic and convincing way, especially when facing the bosses: get away from the attacks in the form of a car, become a robot and already in mid-air unload towards the own enemy all available weapons. These are sequences that are difficult to describe in words, but reallyor exceptional to live in the game. The combat deserves a separate discussion, as it is open to numerous approaches. Our character moves in three dimensions using the analog sticks in combination, a bit like in first person shooters. The constant presence of a crosshair on the screen clarifies the ideas on how to carry out attacks from a distance, but that's not all: by pressing the Circle button, or the right analog stick on its axis, you enter a mode with a first person view and three levels of zoom, great for attacking from afar (perhaps with a dedicated Mini-Con weapon or when you have a Mini-Con that amplifies the range of your guns) or simply to scan the horizon in search of the golden flashes emanating from the Mini-Cons. When an enemy attacks us closely, it is possible to press the R1 key repeatedly to hit him with punches and kicks, creating a combination of blows with different power depending on the character (and the Mini-Con used, as usual ). Levels and Mini-Cons For breadth and detail, the environments of Transformers are among the best ever seen in an action game. The graphics engine really moves a lot of polygons in an extremely fluid and convincing way (especially with the 60 Hz mode activated), and the uncertainties can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Of course, one could argue that there are no urban scenarios, but no one has raised the problem for Halo and so that's okay. In any case, I hope for their presence in a possible sequel: running your Autobots in vehicle mode on the asphalt would undoubtedly be fascinating. We find ourselves exploring forests, mountains or frozen wastelands, with a final visit to Cybertron which represents a variation on the theme and a worthy ending for such a product. Each stage contains a certain number of Mini-Cons and Info-Cons (bonuses that unlock game goodies), but you don't need to collect all of them to complete the level. Indeed, it is impossible to collect them all right away: to do this you need to have certain skills available, which can only be acquired in the following levels (for example the Mini-Con which allows you to glide for long distances, or the one that enhances the jump). So you just have to follow the directions and reach the long where you will collide with the inevitable end-of-level boss, represented by the most important Decepticons (Cyclonus, Starscream, the gigantic Tidal Wave, Megatron and finally well, you'll find out for yourself). Defeated the enemy, we will be able to access the next stage or replay the one just completed. The ~replayability~ factor, in fact, was taken into great consideration by Melbourne House: when you go back to the completed levels, and at a certain point you have to do it by force of circumstances, you find many more enemies to face and things are more difficult . Luckily there are several ~checkpoints~ through which you can either save progress (specifically collected Mini-Cons) or return to HQ to switch characters or use different Mini-Cons. The Mini-Cons represent a very valuable variable for the game. Those to be collected are many, and each of them provides a peculiar ability within a certain area. There are Mini-Cons that enhance or replace the main weapon, those that provide a secondary weapon (homing and non-homing missiles, sniper rifles, mines of various kinds, etc. etc. etc.), those that act on mobility (glider, super jump, super dash and so on) and, finally, those that improve the defensive capabilities of your Autobot (reflective screens of various strengths, offensive force fields, etc.). It is also possible to use Mini-Cons that enhance melee skills or those that serve to amplify the character's sensors in order to locate other Mini-Cons or Decepticons. As I have already written, assigning the Mini-Cons to the pad's back buttons also requires a bit of strategy: each upgrade has a certain ~effectiveness~ value, and it is not possible to exceed a certain limit under penalty of ~overloading~, so yes must choose according to the characteristics of the level and according to the type of action you want. A realistic and intelligent way to limit the game's aids and maintain a certain consistency in the difficulty of the stages. The Decepticons In the game, the Decepticon army is very numerous and moves thanks to transport ships (very difficult to shoot down) that promptly reach the landing sites when necessary. The most numerous units, of course, are also the least resistant: just a few bursts are enough to destroy them. The story, however, soon becomes different: more tough robots are starting to appear, for exampledirectly equipped with shields, or the fearsome ~heavy units~, or very large robots, who unload lasers and missiles on you without paying attention to expense. There are many ways to tackle the fights, taking advantage of the possibilities offered by the developers: you can mow down the group of enemies from afar before launching to finish the job and collect the energy left by the destroyed robots (very important, watch out), or stay at medium range and move continuously while firing at the first opponent within rifle range. Or still choose the ~chaotic~ road: arriving on the spot launched at breakneck speed in vehicle mode, investing two or three enemies and transforming on the fly to place missiles on the Decepticons still standing, closing the practice with a burst of the basic weapon. It is obvious that each approach implies advantages and disadvantages, and that the Mini-Cons with defensive properties (which improve the resistance of the character or provide him with deflector shields with different effectiveness) offer great help in the most difficult situations, when one has to collide against dozens of robots who are not only furious and eager to tear us apart, but who also know how to fight and demonstrate it by dodging missiles or hiding behind possible cover. The apotheosis is reached in the clash with some bosses, when the player finds himself experiencing moments of pure action, in which one must be cunning but also precise. I can't fail to mention the fight with Tidal Wave, which is basically a huge warship that transforms into a robot a few kilometers high. To defeat him you need to hit his head, but it's not that easy: the friendly Decepticon has a fearsome arsenal and has no qualms about using it. You'll find yourself transforming into a car to race away amidst blasts of missiles, avoiding lasers that cut through the ground until you find cover behind some rocks and there, finally, mount an attack. A fantastic experience. Technical realization There isn't a great game that isn't also beautiful to look at. The graphic realization is absolutely important, even fundamental with the advent of current gaming systems, and Transformers does not disappoint in this respect at all. I've already written that the levels are huge, rich in detail and very well designed, but I haven't mentioned the many lighting effects that enrich them and enhance the landscapes. In short, a great sight, with the only reservation that I have already made previously: there are no urban settings. Maybe next time. There are only three playable characters (and this is something else from review for a possible sequel), but offer a full range of features and are completely faithful to the original counterparts. It is also interesting to consider that the various animated sequences (exceptional, I repeat) change the protagonist depending on the Autobot selected to face the stage. The quality of the animations is high for both the Autobots and the Decepticons, and in fact there isn't the shadow of a carelessness: all the graphics remain at high levels, from the first to the last stage, both for the important characters than for the secondary ones. An excellent job. The magnificence of the graphics is crowned by an up to date sound sector, equipped with highly valuable music (which at the end takes up the original theme of the series) and very convincing effects. The game has been completely translated into Italian by Atari, with a well-made dubbing that sees the presence of the usual Marco Balzarotti.", "date": "2004-05-04", "grade": "9.0"}
