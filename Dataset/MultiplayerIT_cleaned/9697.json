{"name": "DJ Hero 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/81843-dj-hero-2-mixare-e-ancora-piu-divertente.html", "text": "Tested version: PlayStation 3 Once upon a time there were beautiful and innovative rhythm games, a novelty that had managed to establish itself in a very short time and to sell its representatives loads of copies thanks to the fun mechanics and the possibility of making the player identify with if then the reproduction of the guitar or the mat on duty was far from being realistic. Then came the videogame Middle Ages, a continuous and exhausting repetition of the same ideas corroborated if we also want by soundtracks that are less balanced and powerful in terms of impact, the so-called dark years awaiting a new Renaissance. Alongside a Rock Band 3 that tries to usher in a prosperous era in this sense, the Hero series has already been enriched since last year with a new trend dedicated to budding DJs, which has brought a breath of fresh air and made available a consequently extremely different tracklist which actually affected a smaller circle of users, probably due to the selection of songs mentioned above and above all due to the cost of the peripheral needed to play, decidedly not popular. Last year we complained about a career put there as an excuse to play all the mixes and for a multiplayer reduced to the bone, this year the Freestyle Games have committed themselves and now we have a more complete and mature title that will delight all those who are interested in the songs present and who want to try a rhythm game with different mechanics from the ~classic~ ones. I scratch brother! As per good and right tradition, DJ Hero 2 offers completely renewed menus both from a stylistic and functional point of view, certainly more pleasant to read and with fewer steps to access the options; the only thing missing is an intro as beautiful as that of the first chapter, replaced by a stylish logo but with little personality. However, for newcomers to the series there are five different types of tutorials for as many difficulty levels, which introduce the player to all the mechanics available to the game. The Italian dubbing was entrusted to none other than Marco Mazzoli and Wender of the 105 zoo but the result is one of the most irritating we have ever heard in a video game, with tones of voice on paper that are nice to illustrate the gameplay but which in reality are more than they once led us to have homicidal instincts. That said, it's good to give a refresher on the basics of DJ Hero 2, for new followers and not. On the game screen there are three tracks that scroll constantly and which represent the two songs to be mixed on the outside, all the effects that are applied in the center. First of all there are the notes that must be intercepted in the classic way, thanks to the three colored buttons on the DJ plate; by leaving them pressed and moving the record up and down, you can scratch. On the side base of the console it is possible to use the crossfader which, initially placed in the centre, allows one or the other track to be excluded by following the scroll line on the screen which moves further outwards when there is need to concentrate the I only play on one song. Other techniques can be found in the knob placed above the crossfader, which allows you to apply distortion effects and double the points multiplier; next to it on the left we have the button to activate the Euphoria when available: think of the Star Power to double the points, in this case during its use the game automatically crossfades, and it is therefore useful to activate it perhaps near sections quite difficult. Finally, if the icon on the right side of the screen lights up green, it is possible to throw the plate backwards for rewind up to 720 degrees, and repeat a particular section with the multiplier doubled in this case too. Up to this point the concepts are the same as in the first chapter, where, however, the developer has gone to enhance and refine the game mechanics throughout the part dedicated to freestyle. In fact, in the central area there is once again the possibility, when proposed, to perform freestyle via tap, but with a series of samples directly connected to the mixed tracks and not from an always identical predefined squad. The same thing applies to the freestyles dedicated to scratching and above all to crossfades, decidedly more integrated with the music and able to give a greater sense of identification and involvement when working on the musical tracks, for a much better job than in the past. What changes from one difficulty level to another? In the five iterations available, from beginner to expert, obviously increases the vspeed of scrolling of the audio tracks and there are also more complex scratches with high and low closing, instant crossfades (pinch) and notes to be pressed simultaneously, for a mix that does not leave a moment of breath. Another addition is the Power Decks, which allow you to receive a bonus such as the highest multiplier or best scores for successfully completed scratches and taps. The funniest is the one called ~Iperdeck~, which significantly increases the speed of the scrolling of the track while keeping the complexity of the keys to press intact. After completing the game to 100% we can say that up to the normal and mostly difficult level you really have a sense of fun where the skill with your hands is also combined with the possibility of enjoying the music and the mixes present. As an expert, everything becomes a frenzy and the concentration shifts solely to the visual and mechanical part, with the most advanced tracks absolutely crazy and complicated to complete with 5 stars or 100%. DJ Tanzen recommends DJ Hero 2 offers over 100 music tracks, mixed in groups of two by some DJs within the developer and by well-known names in the sector such as DJ Shadow, Tiesto, David Guetta. The choice is quite wide, and artists such as Chemical Brother, The Prodigy, Sean Paul, Eminem, The Jackson 5, Lady Gaga, The Notorious B.I.G. and so on. To take a peek at the complete soundtrack, just follow this link on Multiplayer.it, where there is the all-inclusive list of the title. Here are the five recommended to start from DJ Tanzen, strictly to be played in Hard or Expert mode: The Prodigy - ~Firestarter~ (Remix by FSG) Sean Paul - ~Get Busy~ Mixed With Harold Faltermeyer - ~Axel F~ The Notorious B.I.G. ft. Mase & Diddy - ~Mo' Money, Mo' Problems~ 2Pac ft. Dr. Dre and Roger Troutman - ~California Love Remix~ Mixed with B.o.B ft. Bruno Mars - ~Nothin' On You~ David Guetta & Chris Willis - ~Love Is Gone~ mixed with Sam Sparro - ~B&G~ a/k/a ~Black & Gold~ Playstation 3 trophies DJ Hero offers 49 trophies, of which 2 Gold, 5 Silver and 6 secrets. To unlock them will take quite a bit of time, because you have to play all the mixes, dj battles, do a large total number of taps, scraths and crossfades, 4 rewinds at 720 degrees in the same song rather than getting 5 stars in Galvanize of the Chemical Brothers at expert level. There are also several trophies dedicated to online, which assume a certain number of victories in the various modes and reaching level 50, which requires a good amount of hours and victories. Mixing is my profession Where the first DJ Hero offered a hip hop-oriented tracklist with concessions to electronics, that of DJ Hero 2 ranges towards more genres, with club and dance pieces but also techno, house and more commercial tips for Lady lovers Gaga and the like. The result is not bad at all in terms of quantity and variety (we are in the order of over 100 tracks) and as in the first chapter the quality of the mixes is simply outstanding. Also because some come from famous DJs such as Qbert, Deadmau5, RZA and David Guetta, with the bombastic entrance of Tiesto, the highest paid DJ on the face of the Earth. It goes without saying that their productions are qualitatively very high and cataloged under the heading of ~megamix~, which include 3 or 4 connected to each other without interruptions which instead represented one of the critical points pointed out in the first chapter. The Empire mode is the one that encompasses the classic career, through six locations that put the player in the role of a DJ who must conquer the most prestigious clubs in the world. Each venue offers a certain number of mixes and a minimum quantity of stars to reach (on any difficulty), the aforementioned megamixes and battles with famous DJs (there is also Shadow) for a slightly more articulated but our way of seeing still not satisfactory because it remains mainly a pretext to play most of the musical tracks present. This mode also allows you to gradually choose between different DJs and customize their appearance, headphones and deck used to a minimum; then the graphic part is certainly more pleasant starting from the artwork up to the effects and animations that accompany the performance of the budding DJs. Quickplay handling has also been improved, as you can sort your mixes by a myriad of parameters and save your own custom playlists for later use. This greater attention to usability and completeness is also noticeable for the other options present, including the page of your statistics but also the data relating to each mix. The cute thing is inoIn addition, at the end of each one it is possible to send the challenge to a member of the friends list with one's score, which becomes the one to beat. All this forms the ~social~ basis for the extremely detailed rankings, divided by difficulty, club, mix and so on, and for the multiplayer component, both offline and online. In fact, if in the first chapter the multiplayer was just a sop, with DJ Hero 2 FreeStyle Games has made great strides thanks to a multitude of modes and options that await the player. Your online gamertag is the starting point, with the level rising more or less quickly depending on the opponent you beat and dozens of logos and mottos that can be unlocked under certain conditions. At this point, through a sort of matchmaking, it is possible to express one's preferences regarding the venue, the number of mixes and the type of opponent, as well as the level of difficulty which can also be different since the game then calibrates scores and performance in relation to the one used: at this point the desired modes are chosen and the system takes care of doing the rest. Alongside the classic star battle between two people where the mix is exactly the same and whoever gets the highest score wins, we finally have the more appropriate one where the two DJs also play different pieces in a continuous and extremely amusing alternation. And again, the checkpoint mode divides the mix into different sections, each of which gives a point to whoever gets the highest percentage, in the event of a tie, perfect execution or a smaller amount of errors act as a tie break to assign the point itself. However, where we literally spent hours of play were the two modes called Sequence and Accumulator, absolutely new for the genre. In the first, the aim is to end the song with the highest sequence of consecutive notes, which must be ~saved~ using one of the Euphoria blocks available. If you miss a note, you start over from scratch. The strategy therefore lies in deciding the right moment to memorize the notes, not too early to avoid being overtaken by the opponent but not too late to avoid running into sections that are too difficult to deal with. Accumulator has the same basic concept, but in this case each save acts as a checkpoint for the sequence of notes and as a starting point in case you make a mistake in their execution, bearing in mind that the Euforia blocks to be used are not unlimited. Final notes for the elimination of the DJ vs Guitar mixes, which are absolutely not missing, and the expansion of the possibility of using the microphone to act as a vocalist, present in 58 mixes. Once again, however, it appears to be uninteresting and only useful in party mode, ideal when you want to play without too many frills or make a lot of noise in ad hoc organized mini parties. The DJ console DJ Hero 2 proposes the same peripheral of the first chapter, so there is no need to buy a new one and in any case its price has dropped compared to last year. The turntable, deck or simply DJ console consists of a plate equipped with three colored buttons, which are used for scratches, rewinds and to intercept the notes that pass on the screen. Together with the platter there is a base that houses the crossfader, the Euphoria button and the effects knob, while at the top there is a compartment, which can be closed to prevent it from being touched during a performance, which houses the controls of the pad. In the specific case of PS3 the digital cross, the start, select, PS keys and the front buttons. It is also possible to attach this base to the opposite side of the turntable, for all left-handed DJs. The peripheral is made mostly of plastic, with metal inserts on the sides of the platter. The upper part of the latter has some grooves which are used to ensure a good grip and reflect the real ones of the discs. On the back there are some rubber pads dedicated to ensuring stability on the surfaces where the device is placed. As for the dimensions, the console is rather small if compared to a real DJ station, both for the dimensions itself and because it is composed of a single plate, unlike the two typical of the real counterparts. Overall the build quality is quite good albeit ~plasticky~, the console gives its best on a specially created workstation but can also be used on the legs with few problems. The most critical point remains the crossfader, which has a small cavity in the central part that serves to give a sense of position, but it is too ~light~ and in the most agitated phases you risk not feeling it unless you have an extremely ~polite~ hand ~.
