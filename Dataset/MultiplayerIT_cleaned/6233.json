Stronghold Crusader 2: the Emperor and the Hermit expands the game world with new features and levels, therefore with numerous hours of additional fun that will increase the already substantial ones present in the basic title. Once the DLC has been downloaded, we will get to know the two figures who steal the show already starting from the title of this content: the Emperor and the Hermit. Both of these curious characters are linked by religious fanaticism, which leads them to organize themselves into violent and bloodthirsty groups ready to slaughter each other to take control of the maps. The two leaders, with clear belligerent intent towards us - how could it not be so? - they were taken from Stronghold Crusader of 2002: the Emperor keeps his original features, while the Hermit was the Abbot at the time. The package you will take home includes a campaign consisting of seven missions, even quite long-lived, new objectives to unlock, unpublished shield designs and the possibility of playing with these characters in multiplayer. The game, for its part, has never ceased to be supported by the development team and it can be said that technically it has also improved, although the graphics engine still suffers from an underlying heaviness such as not to be digested by all configurations. Try to mobilize a large army against as many large opposing armies, and if your PC shows the sign of time approaching the minimum requirements, you will experience an annoying drop in frame rates. If on the side of the negative aspects you will therefore find that you have inexplicable pop-up effects, it must be said that the textures enjoy an improvement in the details, visible on the troops but also by observing the landscape which now offers defined elements and sharper contours. There is nothing really extraordinary, but it is still pleasant to note the finishing work carried out by FireFly Studios, to which at this point we only ask to put their hand in optimizing the code more effectively. An expansion that tastes like sand, hot blades and duels to the death More of the same This expansion does not revolutionize anything, as is right and usually expected for an add-on, resulting in an addition designed only for the most loyal fans and for all those who intend to see the completion of the narrative arc. Users who will put their wallets in hand, paying a small amount after all, will still have several hours of play in their hands. As we wrote above, there are seven missions in ~Skirmish~ mode that are added to the others already present: while not bringing with them an insurmountable difficulty, they require a tactical effort and a basic understanding of all the mechanics of the series and playing on several occasions we had to repeat some of them before having the upper hand. In short, they are definitely not recommended for those who have not completed the original experience or for those who have already found it too complicated. The more complex nature of this DLC requires that you know how to juggle with a certain agility in finding resources, managing the number of troops and building outposts. In short, you won't have much time to look around. To be honest, the first mission can be misleading, since it is quite simple and not too long - you will see the epilogue in half an hour or so - but the others will be much more difficult and could commit you for at least double the time. Two shady figures We come to the two central figures of this small expansion. The Emperor is the symbol of corruption: a grim, devastated face and mirror of his black soul, in stark contrast to the magnificence and luxury with which he shows himself in public. However, his money is not only squandered on useless frills, but also on the construction of the stronghold in which he loves to take refuge defended by his soldiers, a fortress which you will not access easily as it is almost impregnable. The number of opposing troops to keep under control is really high and this scenario will require you to know very well not only the basics of the game, but also the advanced tactics for the control and supremacy of some areas of the maps. Whoever lacks organization and speed will be literally overwhelmed by the enemy waves. The Hermit is, perhaps, an easier thread to deal with, although the complexity of this encounter can be rather subjective. His visceral hatred for the crusaders is dueto religious fanaticism which led him to isolate himself and to create a sect of followers who idolize him. Lethal as scorpions, his assassins will attack the moment you don't think they can raid your area, and that will be the moment you learn to keep your antennas up and erect walls and adequate defenses. It can be frightening as an enemy type, but it is still easier than the Emperor once you understand his attack strategy, even if ultimately the two opponents require completely different approaches. In short, no revolution but a lot of substance: for five euros it was difficult to expect much more.", "date": "2015-07-01", "grade": null}
