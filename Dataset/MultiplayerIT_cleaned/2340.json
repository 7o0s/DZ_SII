{"name": "SEGA GT: Dal Dreamcast al PC.", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sega-gt-dal-dreamcast-al-pc.html", "text": "At school at the Poliphony's What game is SEGA GT? Well, we necessarily have to compare it with that videogame masterpiece that is Poliphony's Gran Turismo and from which it is inspired in all respects. The gameplay is simple but impactful. Our goal is to obtain driving licenses that will give us the opportunity to access increasingly difficult and demanding competitions. The cars represented, unlike the glorious rival, are almost all European and this to satisfy our tastes in terms of cars. We can also buy and sell cars and special parts with the credits we get thanks to our performances. But not only! SEGA GT goes further. We can also design the car of our dreams thanks to a simple and effective system in which it is possible to choose the salient features of the vehicle we intend to build. The numbers, in this case, make an impression. 130 cars of all types and models and over 2,000,000 different combinations depending on how you build your car. There are 3 championships, 5 seasons and as many as 22 courses of various types, topped off by the nice replay system. It seems clear that a game with these characteristics ensures a remarkable longevity and hours and hours of healthy digital entertainment. So the occasion is one of the greedy ones, given the chronic lack of this type of game for our dear PCs. Also let's not forget that SEGA GT, right after the excellent Ferrari F355 Challenge, is the best driving game for the Japanese console. In short, the conditions are all right, but... there is a term that... gives you the creeps. Conversion? Conversion! Argh!!!!!!! How many times have absolute masterpieces literally turned into mediocre games moving from one platform to another? Unfortunately many times.. maybe too many. The conversion risks being a simple marketing exercise, whereby the title of an excellent game is exploited to sell a ton of copies, but hardly anyone makes the necessary changes to adapt two such different hardware. Furthermore, in the case of the Dreamcast there is one more element that bodes well and it is the compatibility of the SEGA console with Direct X. On the other hand, SEGA has already produced itself on other occasions in the obviously difficult exercise of re-proposing a title on different platforms, and the results have been mixed, with noteworthy conversions to less successful ones. What we wonder now is if SEGA GT is among those well converted. Well what I can tell you is that it certainly deserves a special mention. Do you wonder why? Let's find out together! Let's start by considering the graphic aspect which features a ~spectacular~ graphic resolution of 640x480, in which we do not find particularly significant effects. To be honest, there is a menu of graphic options which is not there. Conversion? Conversion! Argh!!!!!!! The polygonal models of the cars are poor, both in terms of polygons and textures, the circuits are simply ugly, there is no 3D cockpit and to top it all off, the ~big squares~ are the masters. If we then look at the game interface and the menus. well the pictures speak for themselves. The control device management system is performed in the Setup phase before entering the game, once inside you can no longer change anything. I have to say that I couldn't get my analog peripherals to work properly (including the Logitech steering wheel which is a standard in driving peripherals). The music appears dated and does not create any atmosphere, just as the sounds have no positional effect and are of just sufficient quality. The behavior of the car is one of the good things about the game. The physics engine is Arcade, but well done, where the adjustments we make on the car are felt while driving. The physics engine, although we are dealing with a purely Arcade title, appears to be one of the best things about the game. There is no damage model and the AI is not too combative. Let's understand each other, we are always talking about an Arcade game, but it must also be said that by acting on the adjustments we notice that they have a realistic effect on the car. The multiplayer mode is limited to a two-player split-screen. I don't know what else to add. We conclude Do you remember the initial preamble? SEGA GT only demonstrates how the two platforms are actually absolutely different, even in defiance of the allegedcompatibility with Direct X, and indicates, to those who want to try a porting from one system to another, the only way to follow which is to rewrite all the code from scratch. This simple consideration, evidently, was not made by the developers of SEGA GT, who rather bet everything on the marketing effect induced by a title so well known in the world of consoles. So who would you recommend the SEGA GT to? Well it is certainly not the right title for those who want to put the latest generation HW on the rope, but rather for those who enjoyed the original for the Dreamcast and want to experience the same emotions again on the PC. How to unleash a flame? Nothing simpler! Suffice it to say that a console is better than a PC (or vice versa) to witness a rapid escalation of ~violence~ within the Forum or NG in which it is posted. I have always pulled myself out of this type of speech, also because I believe that the hardware is a simple component of the final result where the part of the protagonist is covered by the game, but you know, the gamer is often animated by ~faith~ rather than from reason and therefore. An example of how hardware actually plays a simple supporting role is provided by the Nintendo 64, one of the most unfortunate consoles of recent years. Yet the Nintendone runs some of the most beautiful games ever made, such as Mario 64 or Zelda: The Ocarina of Time. In any case, let's go back to the subject of this review which promises to be particularly interesting precisely because it could provide a further element of reflection on the eternal dispute and that is a PC conversion of SEGA GT, one of the most acclaimed games for the now dying console SEGA Dreamcasts. So, what better occasion than this to measure the goodness of a system if not through a direct comparison, delegating the delicate field of judge to a game?", "date": "2001-11-29", "grade": null}
