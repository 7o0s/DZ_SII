{"name": "Another Code: Two Memories", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/another-code-two-memories.html", "text": "Two memories is better than one The game created by Cing is certainly part of that category of titles ~for many but not for all~: in fact, as already mentioned, it is a point-and-click adventure in many respects similar to those that raged on PCs a few years ago, above all thanks to a Lucasarts in great shape and undisputed queen of the genre. This means that Another Code is not a product recommended for those looking for action or an immediate and noisy experience: on the contrary, the Nintendo production is the exact opposite, requiring the player to solve puzzles, read mountains of text and wander through various settings in search of items or hints. The ~point and click~ aspect on DS is entrusted to the use of the stylus, which obviously adapts perfectly to this kind of purpose. The story that forms the background to the events puts Ashley in the shoes, a thirteen year old very mature compared to her age, who grew up from the age of 3 thanks to the care of her father's sister after a tragic event destroyed her family. The mother had in fact been killed in her home right in front of the child's eyes and the father, out of pain and to escape the murder charges, had taken refuge in a huge and deserted villa within an equally deserted and gloomy island . The game begins with Ashley and her aunt Jessica aboard a small boat, en route to the aforementioned island in search of her father, who reappeared by sending his daughter a package containing a mysterious device, the DAS , an acronym for Dual Another System. Intriguing premises, albeit not particularly original, which represent only the incipit of a story destined to unfold step by step, and not only as regards Ashley's family ... yes, because after a few moments of play the protagonist is in fact destined to get to know D, the ghost of a child who died about 50 years earlier and wholly devoid of the memory of the events that led to his untimely death. Clicking with the stylus The game structure of Another Code: Two Memories is therefore rather classic, even if there is no lack of interesting aspects related above all to the characteristics of the Nintendo console. First of all, the use of the two screens, where the lower one allows you to see the setting and the protagonists from a bird's eye view and move them in the direction in which the nib is placed, while the upper one leaves room for static screens which in summary reproduce what Ashley sees first hand. In the event that an area or sector has interactable aspects, pressing an icon moves the image to the lower portion, thus allowing you to click on the objects present to retrieve information or objects. Similar speech for dialogues with non-player characters. Although Another Code belongs to a niche genre and certainly not on the crest of the wave, Cing's fatigue is certainly not a game intended to corner longtime fans of the genre. In other words, the Nintendo production is a rather easy title, extremely linear and practically incapable of putting any player with a minimum of experience in the ~sector~ in serious difficulty. This speech is valid throughout the adventure, with the exception of 2 or 3 rather challenging puzzles especially due to the need to solve them through so-called ~unconventional~ strategies, i.e. directly linked to the peculiar aspects of the Nintendo DS. Therefore, although Another Code is certainly not a point and click destined to remain in the history of the genre or capable of settling its sacred monsters, it undoubtedly has the merit of involving from start to finish, thanks to the discreet pace and interesting story. Although the game in question therefore represents an excellent start as well as an almost unique type of product on portable consoles, unfortunately it does not lack defects capable of compromising its overall evaluation. Surely the most serious must be sought in the extreme brevity of the adventure, which can be solved without too many worries in 6 or 7 hours. Figure destined to further collapse excluding the time spent in dialogues, often exhausting and too articulated, and in reading notes and notes in many cases not very incisive within the narrative. The limited variety of settings should also be noted directly connected to the reduced longevity: after a brief preamble outside the villa, the whole story takes place inside it, mortifying the exploratory phases between all the same corridors and more or less large rooms to explore . On the other hand, the speech regarding the technical aspect was positive, thanks to a particularly successful manga graphic style flanked by an excellent onelevel of detail of the locations to be explored. On the other hand, the sound is not enough, consisting of effects reduced to the bone and songs that are soon repetitive. Second Opinion When you are called to sum up a title like this you always have to weigh different parameters of judgment, but one of the essential certainties of this Another Code is originality. By exploiting the point-and-click adventure mechanics, the developers have created new foundations of a genre almost as old as video games themselves; photos are taken, clues are superimposed, documents scattered throughout the settings are studied to find new ways and all completely through the use of the stylus. A tragic story behind it, two narrative plots, two memories to recover, animations that wink at Japanese anime and manga productions, candlelit settings that hide more than they show... this is Another Code A 360 touch-screen game, one of the most interesting novelties of recent times, a courageous and demanding product unfortunately affected by one of the most common diseases of the Nintendo laptop: poor longevity, but we get over it, we get over it ... VOTE: 8 Alessandro Locatelli Comment Another Code: Two Memories is a welcome addition to the range of games available for Nintendo DS, offering a point-and-click adventure capable of making fans of the genre a little nostalgic and entertaining those who have never had anything to do with it. do with Guybrush Treepwood and company. A title with a good technical sector, supported by an intriguing story and a valid game mechanic, but which fails to achieve excellence due to a very low longevity and an excessive amount of text in the face of puzzles that are often too much easy to fix. An excellent starting point then, a confirmation that point and click adventures are not dead and yet another proof of the capabilities of the Nintendo DS. But don't expect a masterpiece. Pros: Intriguing story Great use of DS features Good graphics Cons: Way too short Quite easy puzzles Too much text compared to the actual game Triumphantly welcomed at home and awaited in a language understandable by us Westerners, Another Code: Two Memories has finally arrived on the European market (for once even before the American one), an intriguing adventure capable of fully exploiting all the peculiar characteristics of the Nintendo DS. With an unexpectedly thriving start to summer for the two-screen console playground, is it really worth taking a step back in time to go back to point and click?
