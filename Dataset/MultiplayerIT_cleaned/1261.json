{"name": "Recensione di True Crime: Streets of L.A.", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/recensione-di-true-crime-streets-of-la.html", "text": "The City of Angels What is truly impressive about True Crime is the impressive detail in which Los Angeles has been reproduced. The result is so realistic that one gets the clear impression that the Activision programmers have spent whole days touring the city, camera in hand, to collect data on every street and alley. The buildings, the plants, the irregularities of the terrain, everything is incredibly natural, and above all unique. There are no repetitions of objects or details to save money (except the obvious things like light poles), and the name of each street is reported. So ironically it would be possible to use True Crime as an interactive map of LA before actually going there, so you already know how to get around, even if you've never actually seen it. Only a couple of things aren't convincing: the beach, completely deserted and free from spray and clouds of sand when you drive along it, and the water channel, where you can't go. Five games in one True Crime offers various game possibilities, but all of them refer to the scenarios that make up the plot, which are essential to unlock the other sections. This is quite complex, and offers a large number of alternatives and crossroads that occur both in the plot itself and within the 12 scenarios that make it up, depending on whether we will carry out the tasks entrusted to us successfully or if we will fail them. The missions that we will have to face are of five types, completely different from each other. 1st game: DRIVING: which in turn is divided into stalking, pursuits, escapes and races against the clock. The principle is simple: get into the car and reach the target before it runs away or the time runs out. Furthermore, in the case of tailings, care must be taken not to get too close, or the suspect could notice. Five games in one 2nd game: COMBAT: certainly the least convincing of the sections that make up True Crime, even if equally entertaining. The controls are basic: three basic attacks (punch, low kick and high kick), the block and the directional commands. Added to these are the grabs and final attacks that inflict high damage, but which can only be used when the opponent is stunned. Each successful hit with basic attacks inflicts, in addition to the normal damage, also a level of stun and after the opponent has suffered a certain number (indicated by the exclamation points next to the life bar), this remains stationary for a few moments, during which we can enter the code to carry out a final attack or hold. The basic concept is valid, the problem is that to stun criminals you can only use basic attacks that do not combine with each other, given that the time interval between one blow and any other is sufficient to allow the opponent to block. So fights often boil down to a random-key-pushing-and-hope-they-hit, when a simple combination system would have made it more technical and fun. Five games in one 3rd Game: SHOOT: in perfect shooter style with the aiming controlled by the mouse and movements by the keyboard. We will be able to run, roll, hide behind improvised covers, do Matrix-style slow-motion jumps while shooting, or strike with precision and choose whether to aim for vital points or just neutralize the target. We will also be able to borrow weapons from eliminated enemies, even if the choice is not particularly vast and, once most of the upgrades have been obtained, the two dear old service pistols become better than an AK-47. Five games in one 4th Game: STEALTH: the most difficult of all missions. Not because of the difficulty itself, but because you can't see anything! The goal is to complete a certain path, without the guards who guard it noticing your presence, or at least that we have no way of raising the alarm. Put simply, keep moving forward until you spot a guard, sneak up on him, then stun or kill him (this damages reputation though). Scattered here and there we will be able to come across obstacles, such as glass or chairs, which can make noise, therefore warn of our presence and send the mission upstream, and which therefore must be carefully avoided. These wouldn't be difficult assignments, except that the brightness is so low that you can't see anything where you're going, and you seriously risk coming out in a corridor without even realizing it and being discovered, or completely losing your bearings . Five games in one 5th Game: TRACKING: the sum of the first three genres, the goal of the patrols isonly to go from one place to another, without time limits. During the journey, we will receive calls from the station to report a crime in progress in the area where we are. Obviously we can also ignore it and continue on our way, but the foiled crimes provide points, which are essential to access the upgrades, so it is better to roll up your sleeves and get busy. In True Crime there are dozens of different crimes, from clandestine races, to fights, to shootings, to serial killers, to escapees, up to the theft of an Activision truck loaded with video games (which the plant specifies of great value...). Once the suspect has been identified, we will be able to try to stop him with kindness, threatening him with a pistol shot in the air, or knock him out with his fists, as long as he does not run away (which almost always happens), in which case we will have to chase him and stop him . The risk in these situations is that the fleeing criminal is armed. In fact, if once his run has been interrupted he draws his weapon, we will find ourselves in a situation of clear inferiority: this is because we will not be able to try to stun him in close combat (it is not clear why in these situations the blows land, but do not damage ), also switching to shooting mode will still be difficult to hit, since it is not very suitable for tight spaces. During the patrols, among the many things to which attention must be paid, there is also the mood of the citizens, in fact, if we carry out too violent actions, the population will begin to react in a hostile way to our presence, up to the moment when whose groups of armed vigilantes will try to kill us. Five games in one Extras: scattered around the city there are some buildings that allow you to get weapon upgrades or new driving and fighting techniques. By entering these places (which, as already mentioned, costs a good number of points) thematic training missions are unlocked. By passing them you get the promised prize, otherwise you can try again by paying the amount of points again. In addition to the training there is the Dogg Patrol mode, in which you will impersonate Snoop Dogg (famous American rapper) and you will have the task of thwarting the greatest number of crimes in a single hour. To unlock it you have to collect, during normal scouting missions, the 30 golden bones that are scattered around the map: not an easy task, even if after finding the first one the position of the others will appear on the LA map. An entire album as a soundtrack Games with such a rich soundtrack have rarely been seen. Almost half of the manual is occupied by the list of songs that compose it. Over 50 songs, performed by big names like Ice-T, Megadeth, N.E.R.D. and many others. To give an idea of how important music is in True Crime, suffice it to say that during the patrol missions, there is a button dedicated to skipping the current music track and moving on to the next one. But it's not over! An album dedicated to True Crime has also been released, with as many tracks by equally famous artists: Snoop Dogg, Westside Connection, E-40, Kam, Damizza, just to name those that are written larger on the official website. However, this album can hardly be found in normal music stores (we are not in America), better to contact specialized online stores directly. Technically speaking From a technical point of view True Crime stands at a first glance on excellent levels, the level of detail is excellent, and the fluidity too. There is just a certain repetitiveness in the appearance of the passers-by, with some that seem to come directly from Resident Evil. This obviously comes at a cost in terms of hardware requirements, especially with regard to the graphics card, so if your card is more than 2 years old, the best advice is to check that it is among those on which True Crime has been tested . On the other hand, the distinction between the processors is strange: Pentium 3 800Mzh / Athlon XP 1500. Boh The real problems therefore are not in the basic structure of the game, but in the general distractions of the programming team when converting from console to PC. The first Berlin Wall is right on startup: ~CD/DVD emulation software has been detected. Please disable it and restart the game~. The message is cryptic, it doesn't give any indication of what the problem really is, so you don't know how to fix it. Activision itself were not informed of the error, but after a bit of insistence they found a solution (this is the link with the instructions). Another drawback is the incredible darkness of the entire game. Having to max out the monitor, turn off the room lights, and still have a hard time seeing where you're goingin stealth missions it is not acceptable. Given the type of problems, the impression is that the conversion from console to PC was done hastily, or with little attention, and to confirm it there are the official screenshots (valid for both the console and PC versions), perfectly visible and without any brightness issues. A pity that oversights of this kind spoil an otherwise excellent work. Final comment True Crime is one of many attempts to merge different genres into one game, in order to please as many players as possible. Precisely because it is a multi-genre, it is difficult for players to be able to juggle all its parts with equal skill. For this reason, the first problem to be faced during the development of this type of game is to balance the difficulty of the various genres so as not to penalize (and therefore displease) any player. In the past, in many cases, excess was reached, and the final product turned out to be too little technical in almost all its parts, therefore, in the long run, boring. True Crime, on the other hand, almost always manages to stay on good levels. The driving sections and the shootings are excellent and exciting, the stealth phases are affected only by some technical problems, while only the hand-to-hand combats are unconvincing. In any case, however, these are secondary problems that in a hypothetical sequel could be easily resolved. The reconstruction of Los Angeles is incredible, and the same goes for the soundtrack, definitely spot on. Also guessed the choice of multiplayer divided according to the types of game. The only suspicion, however, is that too much space has been given to the phases that complement the plot (exploration, areas for improvement, Dogg Patrol mode), and less to the 12 scenarios that make it up, resulting in a potentially long-lived game, but which offers the right stimuli to dissect it to the bottom. However, we must not run the risk of dismantling True Crime into its subparts and comparing each of them with other more specialized games: it would be an unequal battle! Grand Theft Auto itself, similar in some respects, is not suitable for a comparison, because it is decidedly more focused on driving. True Crime must be considered as an experiment in merging many genres, and seen from this point of view it turns out to be an excellent title, immediate and able to satisfy the most disparate players, only marginally ruined by a series of annoying drawbacks. Pros: Reproduction of Los Angeles in minute detail Four totally different game modes Multiple endings Cons: Too dark environments Clumsy camera Lack of difficulty levels Trouble starting Multiplayer for all tastes True Crime is an exclusively single player game therefore, in order not to penalize the game in this now indispensable sector, the Activision programmers had to invent something new. Taking advantage of the many genres present, five different multiplayer modes have been prepared. Protection: It is the basic job of every police officer, to protect citizens from criminals. Players are divided into teams or play individually, with the aim of foiling the greatest number of crimes. Whoever gets the most points at the end of the game wins. Pursuit: One player is defined as a suspect, the others as policemen. To win, the suspect must escape the cops. The pursuers instead have to demolish his car and kill him. Dojo: all against all or teams in a megarissa to determine who is the master. All combos and finishers are unlocked, with the exception of ground attacks, to avoid endless streaks between members of the same team. Shooting master: a general shootout, ~free for all~. Of course, the one who survives wins. Street Race: The classic street race, with the option to enable or disable the use of firearms. It is possible to compete on one of the five predefined routes, or the host can customize the route by placing up to ten mandatory stages. A great way to keep the game going even after you finish the story. Mouse and keyboard are not a pad ...and this is evident to everyone except the programmers In fact, the way in which the control keys have been chosen is uncomfortable to say the least, at least for those who don't have three hands. In fact, some are at the left end of the keyboard, others in the numpad, while the camera controls are in the mouse. This forces the player to move a hand continuously between the mouse and the keyboard, wasting time and risking pressing the wrong button each time. Fortunately, not all modes in True Crime suffer", "date": "2004-07-07", "grade": null}
