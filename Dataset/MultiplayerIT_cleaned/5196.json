In short, one hundred percent e-sports. The gameplay is the classic one of competitive first-person shooters, only now thanks to the potential of PlayStation VR, our field of vision is truly gigantic, in short, we don't limit ourselves to looking at a screen in front of our eyes. The game mechanics are extremely frantic and fast, as a result it is possible that motion sickness problems may occur. In this sense, however, Guerrilla Cambridge has implemented a double mode to try to patch up this not too remote possibility: we can move the view using the head or the right stick of the pad (RIGS: Mechanized Combat League does not support PlayStation Move). We can also set the speed of this movement. RIGS: Mechanized Combat League is one of the best titles for PlayStation VR and here's our review Money money money Three game modes in which to challenge opposing players: Team Takedown, to be understood as a real team deathmatch, Endzone, a sort of robotic American football where the goal is to bring the holographic ball into the opponent's goal and Power Slam , where points are acquired by jumping through a circle in the middle of the map, only to do so you have to send the Rigs into Overdrive, making three kills, or rather three takedowns in a row or collecting spheres. By doing so we will have all three power-ups activated (offensive and defensive) and the road paved towards the point. The modes work and are fun, RIGS is pad in hand and visor in head one of the best titles on PlayStation VR and offers an all-round gaming experience. In short, we feel that the game is not a simple show of the potential of the new Sony peripheral but that it is a project with a lot of substance underneath. Too bad therefore that there are only three game modes, the contents in this sense are not that many. So let's hope for more downloadable additions at a later time. The exact opposite instead of the customization and use of the RIG. There are four types available, with tangible ~class~ differences. Mirages are pretty big and can double jump, Tempests can glide, Hunters are the smallest and most agile of the lot, while Sentinels can jump very high and then land with a devastating area-of-effect attack. In addition, each RIG also comes with an extra ability. In short, there are quite a few variations in play. The matches that make up the career, both online and offline, are placed within a rather effective progression to push us to never give up the pad. We need to choose a team and a generous sponsor who, upon reaching particular objectives and victories, will reward us with the money needed to buy more RIGS. With the fans we conquer, however, it is possible to buy stronger teammates, obviously when playing alone against the good artificial intelligence. On a purely technical level RIGS: Mechanized Combat League is undoubtedly a good sight, most likely one of the best PlayStation VR launch titles. The detail is striking, the good level design of the maps, the very colorful color palette chosen and obviously the generous field of vision offered by the viewer. A really nice surprise indeed.", "date": "2016-11-01", "grade": "8.0"}
