However, it happens to find the proverbial exceptions to the rule, such as the here present Paper Wings that we are about to review: a title not only endowed with an intriguing playful structure and a refined look, but also animated by a genuine charitable spirit which takes the form possibility given to the player to make a cash donation in support of the safeguarding of the ornithological species most at risk through a special form accessible from the main menu. After giving a symbolic pat on the back to the developers of Fil Games for the noble initiative, let's now find out if the actual game is worthy of praise too... Paper Wings is a relaxing title, well done and even animated by noble intentions L'uselin de la comare As it is easy to understand, the absolute protagonists of Paper Wings are birds, here represented in a quite original way as if they were origami. A choice that is not only functional to the minimal and elegant visual style that distinguishes the application, but above all that perfectly matches its peculiar gameplay. The player's task is to guide the bird on duty, helping him to collect the luminous orbs that fall from above before they reach the bottom of the screen. The physical laws underlying the trajectories of the bird are (with the dutiful playful concessions) completely similar to those that regulate the flight of a very common paper airplane, including the need to accumulate momentum in the descending phase in order to be able to ascend with a subsequent soaring. In terms of control system, all this translates very simply into two pressure zones placed on the sides of the screen that allow you to rotate the bird and make it proceed automatically in the desired direction. As often happens, these mechanisms are much easier to execute than to explain, so much so that Paper Wings needs only a couple of seconds of tutorials to make the user aware of everything there is to know: a once these quick formalities are done, all that remains is to try your hand at the four modes in which the single player is divided. The Fil Games product is not exactly a sample of content (indeed) but the different sections are still made with a certain skill: we start with the Classic Mode in which the loss of an orb immediately leads to game over; then there is the Timer Mode which adds a countdown to the equation that can be fleshed out by collecting the spheres and which vice versa is reduced every time one is lost; the Hazard Mode instead changes the cards on the table, placing red orbs in fields that must be strictly avoided; finally, the Calm Mode does not offer any challenge whatsoever, limiting itself to allowing the player to twirl without any constraints or dangers. Each of these modes can count on its leaderboard which in fact constitutes the only feeling of progression offered by Paper Wings, combined with a handful of objectives that allow you to unlock various rewards. It goes without saying that the longevity of the title goes hand in hand with the interest of the single individual in the ranking logics, apart from which there is very little iron left in the fire, also considering how the mysterious multiplayer component appears on the main menu accompanied by a laconic ~ coming soon~. Even if undoubtedly poor in substance, Paper Wings still remains a very valid pastime, equipped with a pleasant audiovisual aspect that never hurts and above all free from the suffocating free to play dynamics that afflict many similar products: apart from the request for a few likes and the proposed by some advertising videos, the application does not annoy the player too much, leaving him free to enjoy the experience without bottlenecks or various forcings.", "date": "2017-03-31", "grade": "8.0"}
