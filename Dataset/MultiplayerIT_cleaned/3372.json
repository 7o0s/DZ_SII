Like every year, even in the moment of writing this review we have felt the sacred football fire that we have inside renewing, pushing us to spend whole tens of minutes studying game schemes that would adapt to our squad, to then take the field and guide our club with the same fervor with which we would actually sitting on the bench in a stadium. It doesn't matter if the players we train are those of our favorite team or those of a team lost in the Asian minor leagues: the love of fans for Football Manager has remained intact for over twenty years, during which the football manager has continued to grow and expand in its dynamics. Beyond some customary updates such as the one concerning the squads of the current season, the main challenge faced by Sports Interactive has always been to create a Football Manager year after year that would be attractive for experts as well as for newbies, while adding mechanics that can differentiate a new edition from the previous one. Not a simple task, which Miles Jacobson and his boys obviously had to undergo once again with Football Manager 2020. Let's find out what they thought for us. What's new: corporate vision and planning Between more publicized new features and others a little less known, every year Football Manager brings with it at least one aspect on which the development team has focused in particular. The 2020 edition is dedicated to long-term club management with the aim of adding variety to play between saves, while retaining initial engagement as football seasons progress. In detail, SI Games has introduced the concept of corporate vision, to which the way in which the management apparatus now evaluates our work is linked. There are, for example, clubs that are particularly keen on enhancing young players, while others aim to weaken their opponents and still others to make ends meet flawlessly. With planning spread over time, our work is therefore no longer evaluated only on the basis of the position in the standings but also considering other factors, which must be kept in mind during management if we want to fully satisfy the will of the president. This is in fact the most relevant novelty of Football Manager 2020, for an edition that after the substantial changes to tactics and the introduction of the VAR a year ago is rather conservative. Obviously this does not mean that there is a lack of other additions in the gaming system, such as the one which (again with a view to longer-term management) allows us to set a playing time for players in the contract renewal phase. Before moving on to economic issues, it is possible to establish a growth path for a potential star, or to set the record straight with a player at the end of his career with declining playing time. In terms of gameplay, the most relevant additions are these, net of a reorganization of some management aspects intended to make simpler tasks such as the supervision of the nursery and the players on loan, to which one of the new staff figures present has also been dedicated in the game. The gameplay: filed some defects As Football Manager fans know well, there are some aspects of the game that for one reason or another have become critical over the years with the succession of the various editions. One of these is undoubtedly the onset of injuries within the team coached by the player, often too high with teams decimated by ailments right away. After having experienced Football Manager 2020 first hand, we feel like saying that the incidence of injuries did not seem above the real average, however taking into account that in the simulation as well as in reality there may be some striking cases. Another historical defect, that of the grumbling by the second lines, seems to have been definitively reduced by Sports Interactive, which has worked on a better management of morale inside the locker room to thus put the player in a position to adopt a more relaxed management of turnover. In the management of the team there is also room for the introduction of a code of ethics, to which all players agree to submit: the fines that we could have given even previously are thus triggered automatically, thus preventing the player fromi turn suffers from it as often happened. Another historically uncovered nerve for Football Manager concerns market management, in which the 2020 version presents lights and shadows. Bargaining with teams and players is now very thorough and allows you to calibrate economic and contractual offers in the most disparate ways, but keeping an eye on the evaluations, there seems to be something wrong. In the event that a player is not on the market, the teams rightly tend to shoot high in requests for the transfer of the card, but when Inter asked us for 120 million for Gabriel Barbosa (aka Gabigol) we could not do without smile. It's okay that in Brazil the boy is making sparks, but such an assessment is neither in heaven nor on earth and it is not the only case in which such a disproportionate request has been made to us for a non-top player. We are finally forced to report the sore point of every year, or the interaction with the media. The now hackneyed dynamics make the interviews tremendously boring, to the point of leaving it without particular guilt that our deputy takes care of it. At least, before we are faced with the questions, there is a screen where the probable topics of discussion are described, thus allowing us to decide whether it is appropriate to participate in order to give an answer in the first person. The same goes for the interaction with the players in the locker room and during the match, which in some cases remained unclear in its dynamics. For example, it happened to us that players in the starting line-up resented our good wishes for a member of the squad on loan in another team, something without any apparent logical connection. Little to say this time about the game interface, which looks similar to the one renewed last year. Even the introduction of some new screens such as that of the Development Center is nothing more than a collection of features previously already present but more scattered. Graphics and game engine Since the Football Manager matches have been enriched with the 3D engine, the work of Sports Interactive has also been dedicated annually to improving the graphic rendering of its creature. In particular, Football Manager 2020 has allowed us to appreciate a higher quality in the animations, including those of connection, the lack of which a year ago made some player movements awkward. In general, the graphics engine is cleaner and more detailed than the previous edition, thanks to the addition of new light effects that can illuminate the stadium and its elements in a more natural way. As for the simulation aspect, this time too we are faced with a product on which SI Games will have to continue working after the release of the game, smoothing out some unrealistic aspects that we have been able to encounter during the matches played by our team. In particular, we have noticed a clear abuse of the game changes by the players, even when in the tactics it was clearly indicated to prefer short-type passes. The management of penalty kicks should also be reviewed, given the presence of a fairly strong tendency (source of countless epithets) to get them wrong. As well as in the training phase, even during matches injuries seem to have less incidence than in the past, while fortunately it doesn't happen so often anymore to see numerous matches where dozens of shots on goal are made without being able to score.", "date": "2019-11-14", "grade": "8.2"}
