{"name": "Soul Axiom Rebooted", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/soul-axiom-rebooted-recensione.html", "text": "The subjective puzzle game has shown that it can provide some of the most original and intriguing proposals seen in the world of video games in recent years and this review of Soul Axiom Rebooted testifies that there is still room to expand the concept by staging new stories and worlds unpublished, even if in this case it is above all the recovery of a game that is a little too neglected. The original Soul Axiom was in fact released in 2016 on PC and current generation consoles, obtaining rather ~mixed~ responses from critics and the public, although it can be said that the negative ones probably prevailed. The Rebooted version aims to re-propose the game in a revised and corrected version, with a general overhaul of the graphics - which didn't shine before but which still isn't exactly a strong point even in this version - and a reworking of the rhythm and layout of the puzzles and events in the game. To tell the truth, without being able to make a direct comparison, it is not even easy to understand in what precisely the Rebooted version has improved compared to the original, given that at least on Nintendo Switch the game does not seem to deviate from how it appeared on other platforms a few years ago . It has been more or less since the days of Portal that the genre of first-person puzzle games has progressively defined itself, having come to offer some high-profile titles especially in the latter period. In fact, just when the original version of Soul Axiom came out, perhaps the apex of this type of game was recorded, between the end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016 when The Talos Principle and The Witness in particular arrived on the market , which in fact represented the best examples of this reinterpretation of the first-person adventure with puzzle elements and ~widespread~ narrative within the settings. This correspondence could also hide the reason for the Reboot operation, which has now arrived, in a decidedly less crowded period of games of the genre, perhaps to try to scrape together more luck in the absence of too cumbersome and close competitors. However, Wales Interactive's game falls precisely into that vein, offering strange and fascinating settings, environmental puzzles close to pure puzzles and a narrative basis that provides an excellent engine for events, at least initially. Mysteries and puzzles In fact, Soul Axiom Rebooted carries substantially the same strengths and weaknesses as the original version, given that there are no particularly marked differences compared to the latter. It all starts from a really interesting premise: the protagonist finds himself projected into a digital world that represents the afterlife to all intents and purposes, which introduces very profound concepts to touch for the story, between metaphysical considerations on life after death and the implications science fiction of a digital and IT heaven (or hell). However, the narration (which is not in Italian, despite the various languages present for the subtitles) manages to reach these levels only partially, also due to an all too disjointed story, in its excessive fragmentary nature. The game takes place in a world called Elysia, a ~Digital Soul Provider~ which effectively represents a sort of afterlife in which the soul can wander, or at least its digitization based on memories and characteristics person's brain. But something is not going right within the mysterious soul management service and the world of Elysia is turned upside down by something dark. The protagonist must therefore try to recompose his identity and then solve the mystery of the digital world trying to stop the threat that is creeping into it. The basic idea is therefore particularly intriguing, both for the metaphysical themes that it manages to bring out, and for the consequent variety and strangeness of settings that it can stage, because the exploration of memories and the subconscious allows for a creativity that is rarely attainable in other cases. The diversity of settings is in fact well present, also thanks to the ploy of teleporters that allow you to explore various memories/levels that can afford to be completely detached from each other, the problem is that this eclecticism is also reflected in a general lack of homogeneity of the narration, somewhat cryptic and in many respects not very inspired even with respect to the issues addressed, as well as causing a certain disconnection of the puzzles, whose artificiality is however justified by the abstractionism of the settings. The problems of the puzzles are above all referred to their excessive mechanism, being incendrawn somewhat forcedly on the opposition between the pairs of skills assigned to the protagonist's hands: with these it is possible to activate or deactivate elements of the scenery, make them move according to pre-set routines or stop their movement and finally destroy or not objects with fire . It is not so much the general simplicity that generates doubts, since even a simple ~enriched~ exploration of not too demanding puzzles is certainly not to be disdained, it is that the deductive part from the Soul Axiom Rebooted puzzle design seems to be missing, which is essentially based on the observation of the environment in search of objects that respond to the various powers (highlighted by the corresponding color) and on the application of these. There is no creative or complex use of the powers, which are always applied in a detached way from each other (considering the couples in a unitary way) and somewhat mechanically. The wonders of the digital afterlife What Soul Axiom Rebooted does well is to transport us into a truly strange and picturesque world, capable of alternating disparate settings without ever going off track, given its focus on a setting that has no realistic coordinates. This also compensates for the general poverty of the technical realization, although there are evident ups and downs in the representation of the scenarios: in fact, where a connection with reality is sought through a more realistic representation, the limits emerge in a very evident way. The game then expresses itself at its best in the most extreme abstract representation, in particular in the digital hub represented by the central part of Elysia, with its style a bit cyberpunk and a bit derived from Tron and from a classic sci-fi imagery but characterized by digressions variegated. In short, the artistic direction largely compensates for the obvious technical gaps, even if it is still capable of running into significant slip-ups, especially in some of the settings of the memories. The wonder of exploration and discovery is therefore amplified by the abstractness of the settings and by the general bizarre atmospheres and puzzles, because the context detached from reality easily creates a sense of mystery and pushes one to discover its secrets. The predisposition is therefore right, from the concept and its realization to the artistic level, but it seems that his translation of this vision into a video game is the part that came out worse, net of the graphic poverty of many settings. The features of the puzzle design are structural elements that cannot be solved completely with a general ~reboot~ of the game, so we have to live with them also in this new version.", "date": "2020-02-27", "grade": "6.7"}
