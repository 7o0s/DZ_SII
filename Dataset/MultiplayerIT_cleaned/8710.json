Simply put, Realm of the Mad God has landed on Steam, and now you can't ignore it anymore. You, because we were already following him many months ago, as evidenced by an article hidden in a Multiplayer.it column that is impossible to find [here]. However, the substance of the game is always the same: you start by choosing the wizard in the gray tunic, the only class available when you play for the first time. If we reach the fifth level with the wizard, the cleric is unlocked, if we survive up to the fifth level with the cleric, the archer is unlocked and so on up to the thirteenth class available. Once in the game world you must first get the tutorial out of the way. A trifle, however: WASD to move, the mouse to aim, a key to shoot and one to launch the special ability that consumes the mana bar for each class. Everything is reduced to the essentials, even the slot for items and equipment. Hardly any of them will go back. After this moment of solitude we arrive at the Nexus, where we find the company of dozens of frenetic pixels who sell objects, buy objects, sometimes give objects away, or waste time taking care of themselves under the fountains from which delicious blue and gray cubes gush. The most introduced you will see them disappear into the guild hall, while everyone else can only choose one of the worlds where there is still room and rush in, up to a maximum of 85 players in each world. Outside the Nexus it's a ordeal of killer pixels on the loose. The more adventure there is towards the center of the map, the more frantic and cruel the enemies become. It's as if Jamestown met Torchlight and invited dozens of players to the same game. Everywhere there are others like us running and shooting at everything that moves. Squeezing is just that the discovery of the game: kill enemies, loot loot, level up and hope to survive long enough to come face to face with Oryx, the Mad God. Sometimes it happens to die. Sadly, death is permanent. They didn't tell you, did they? It's a bitter lesson, but if it's any consolation, we've all been there. And we continue to go through it with disturbing frequency. We live together, we die alone The other players are vital, but that's something that comes later. In Realm of the Mad God you are first and foremost obsessed with character growth. Everyone wants to level up right away. It takes a couple of hours at most to get to the twentieth and final level, but the feeling of not counting for anything before the coveted goal is unbearable. Then there's the loot: unfortunately the fastest grabs what is left on the map by the enemies. And the idea of being missing out on the crowd fuels greed. Never has a game been so selfish. The chat is there and serves to call the players in the world for the trains, swarms of players who run together along the road filling up with experience points, or to signal to everyone that a deity has been found and the presence of each player skilled in combat is required to bring it down. Regarding the first point, here's the good news: everyone gains experience points for killing an enemy, as long as they are nearby. As for the second point, sixty players are often not enough to defeat a deity. However, if you want to reach a player, simply type ~/teleport player name~ and you will instantly appear in the heart of the action. Bwahahahah: level 20! But how long will we last? Just try not to teleport near someone who is ten levels older than you. Otherwise you already know what can happen. The fact is that these warnings are useless, the enthusiasm to grow, grab and discover everything always prevails over common sense. For example, you can teleport to the Nexux at any time and deposit extra items there in your safe for the benefit of future characters, but this would mean leaving the action halfway through. And then often the next level is so close. Thoughts like that kill in Realm of the Mad God. However while we are busy shooting at everything that moves, we happen to see monsters framed in a box with an arrow. That is the direction of a particular boss, the equivalent of side quests in this game. It goes without saying that no NPC will ever greet you, and you won't read anything other than other players' babble in the world chat. In fact, even the quests are resolved in excited moments of general shoot-shoot. Obviously oftenyou die, but you should have already grasped this. Fortunately, each of our deceased characters can accumulate fame in the course of his life, an element that will be useful for our new incarnation. Good blood doesn't lie. And in any case where patience does not arrive, our credit card could arrive. Yes, there are even the tempting micro-transactions to keep us coming back for the umpteenth ~last game before disconnecting~. Realm of the Mad Gold You can dispense with the real money and still enjoy the game, going as far as luck and skill will allow. You may even live to meet Oryx, who appears only after players on a server have killed enough of his demonic minions - at which point all players on the server are teleported to Oryx. Half of them are certain to disappear during the first few seconds of the final battle. Yes, you can very well do all of this without putting a hand in your wallet, especially if you join an organized guild. But then you know, guilds are worse than Scientology, they always want more. And then why hope that a boss after his death will bring up a rare entrance to a dungeon when you can buy the key to open it yourself. The fever for better equipment may rise and patience wane. And after all, the space in the safe is never enough; not to mention that you may want more characters active at the same time. Typical moment of youth aggregation. In short, it's a matter of time, sooner or later a micro transaction slips by and, strangely, it leaves no sense of guilt behind. Whether it's worth it or not we'll let you decide, the writer has thrown money into some of the stupidest micro-transactions (Farmville?). The important thing is to know that even if you avoid them, you won't lose anything. On the other hand, Realm of the Mad God has some flaws, for example its repetitiveness, although it is compensated by the large number of enemies and different classes, each capable of changing the rules of their own way of playing. Another annoying element is the fact that anyone can steal the loot from under your nose, except in the rare cases where it is permanently linked to the players who have killed a particular boss. Being able to organize into a cohesive group outside a guild is also no joke and might put off new adventurers. But this is the spirit of the game and its immediacy is one of the qualities that make it so magnetic. But we warn you: starting to play it costs nothing but breaking away can become difficult. All that equipment, accumulated fame, rank for all to see. And Oryx waiting. No, breaking away is impossible.", "date": "2012-02-29", "grade": "8.0"}
