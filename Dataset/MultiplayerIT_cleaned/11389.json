It's fun to play as a superhero, the perfect soldier, the invincible robot, the demon hunter with a good sense of humor, but the medium can't continue to grow up without finally taking into consideration absolute humanity, with its limitations and defects. The adventures that have the courage to offer us the emotions of a heart and any day can be counted on the fingers of one hand: they are few but precious. Fortunately, for a few days, there has been one more. Let's find out about this surprising experience in Lake's review. YOLO The residents of Providence Oaks bring an excellent cast to the game. Game, experience, adventure. Lake you can call it whatever you want, it doesn't matter anyway. Interesting are the emotions it wants to arouse as well as the doubt with which it tries to confuse you. We don't know if it's luck or mere calculation, but Lake focuses on one of the big questions of these years, always in plain sight among post-pandemic reports: will we go back to who we were before? In part yes, I'm sure, but as the news tells us, many people are questioning their lives, starting with their chosen profession and in many cases suffered in the years prior to Covid-19. As they say in Rome, life is a butt and the situation in which we found ourselves reminded us of this in the most shocking way possible, revolutionizing the order of priorities of each of us. Is it worth overearning, if I tell you right, but living off work? Never really knowing your children, always staying away from home, thinking only about your career and damn little about yourself? Maybe, or maybe not. Providence Oaks Being a postman in a small town is undoubtedly a repetitive job, but it also has several positive aspects. Would you do it? This is Lake's theme, this is the crossroads in which Meredith Weiss will find herself, a woman not far from her early forties and with an excellent career in a big city who agrees to her father's request to replace him, for just two weeks, as postman of the small town of Providence Oaks, where she was born and raised. Delivering letters and parcels, he will meet old acquaintances and shake new hands, until he finds himself at the most important crossroads in his life. In Lake there are no supernatural entities, no violent swerve towards horror or thriller; what you will experience together with Meredith is a small but fundamental corner of life, a sweet portion of normality. A September in the 80s Meredith's parents, who own the house where we will live for two weeks, are on vacation in Florida and will often call us to update us on their adventure. The events of Lake take place in the heart of an 80s September in which a little summer remains, even though autumn has long since begun to recolor the avenues and forests of Providence Oaks. This small rural village is made up of a contained city centre, squeezed between a few streets, an even smaller residential branch located after a bridge, and little else to embrace this large and mysterious lake surrounded by woods, such as a diner, a campsite, a small motel and a wooded area characterized by several cabins inhabited by loggers and people in search of tranquillity. There aren't many roads, and some aren't even paved. All very intelligent design choices because they manage to make an extremely small map seem larger, so that it has a realistic breadth without making the postman's job too tedious. There's a package for you There is no risk of making a wrong delivery in Lake. Its gameplay expresses a message, not a challenge. In the two weeks in Providence Oaks, we'll spend most of the time as a postman, driving the white van made available to us by the company. Every day we will have to deliver two types of mail: the letters to be placed in the classic American mailbox, and the packages that will instead be brought to the door of the house and, if possible, delivered by hand to the recipient; if this is not possible, if no one answers the bell, they will be left in front of his door. Each work shift has a predetermined number of deliveries to make: sometimes they will be more and others less, sometimes they will drive you to the opposite side of the lake and others will allow you to get to the end of the day faster, but there is no it is no risk of being wrong. The gameplay linked to this activity does not include failures of any kind, it is not possible to insert a letter in a box that is not its own, ruin the packages or even damage the van with an accident, it takesre a fine. The aim in this case is to make us savor a deliberately repetitive everyday life, unraveling our time so as to have no doubts about the life that awaits us if at a certain point we decide to leave everything behind to start again from this lovable village. If you are looking for a postman simulator, a sort of Death Stranding  la Life is Strange, with Lake you are in the wrong game. A role already written There are many cinematographic references in Lake, such as musical ones. But the soundtrack would not have hurt a couple more songs, and of different genres. However, delivering certain packages will make us come into contact with different characters, organize appointments in our free time, activate small side quests always focused on delivering something to someone. When these encounters take place, Lake will be transformed into a sort of visual novel where in the dialogues we will be able to choose to interpret our character, Meredith, in different ways, but without ever leaving a figure that has very specific characteristics. Given their importance, it is good that the dialogues are so well written, and acted much better than expected. The quality of the dubbing often exceeds that of the facial animations, but it is not a big problem and in general the graphic quality achieved, the style thus outlined, always go beyond what one would expect from a product created with a budget and a team so content. Although the plot does not include major choices, based on how we respond to the dialogues we will still be able to establish and reject friendships, even discover love where we never thought we'd find it. It is a great experience, which allows you to play a role that has already been written with extreme effectiveness. Two weeks There's even an interactive video game in the Providence Oaks diner! The Steam counter says that it took us about nine hours to get to the end of Lake, but we played the game to the end, always avoiding teleporting to our destination and enjoying every inch of the setting. You can do all of this even in less, seven or eight hours, or run towards the end credits in even half the time, but if you're in such a hurry maybe Lake isn't the experience you're looking for, the one that's right for you. After all, the goal of the game is to make us slow down, and the only way it has available to hit us is to do it through the gameplay of a deliberately rarefied video game, but no less full of emotions.", "date": "2021-09-05", "grade": "7.6"}
