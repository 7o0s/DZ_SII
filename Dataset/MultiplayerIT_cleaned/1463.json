{"name": "Ghosthunter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ghosthunter.html", "text": "It was a dark and stormy night Lazarus Jones is the classic rookie cop, zealous and impulsive. Having arrived in the homicide department for just over a week, he finds himself on a mission together with his partner Anna Steel, with the seemingly trivial task of investigating an old abandoned school after the mysterious death of some of its students. However, our hero still cannot imagine what the building really hides, and his impulsiveness will end up triggering a series of tragic events, which will see him merge with the Astral spectrum in an attempt to stop a horde of ghosts ready to terrorize the world. As already underlined, Studio Cambridge has opted for a game mechanic very similar to Primal, retouched only in some details, which obviously puts us in the role of the young Lazarus, initially in a desperate search for his companion kidnapped by the ghosts, to then end up entangled in a much more complex and multifaceted plot. Unfortunately, the changes made by the developers are not sufficient to fill the gaps in the first title, on the contrary this Ghosthunter practically proposes all the capital defects that afflicted Primal, radically changing only the background in which the events take place. So here we are again dealing with levels with exasperating linearity, which lead the player through a practically obligatory path, interspersed only by fights and sporadic puzzles. The choice then to allow us to use Astral's abilities only in certain locations, which are extremely rare among other things, effectively cancels even the little freedom granted, as well as providing a clear indication on how to continue the adventure (you are stuck No problem: if there is one of the areas nearby to invoke Astral then it is obvious that its help is needed to continue). It also served little purpose to give our ectoplasmic partner a whole series of special skills, which will be unlocked by capturing the ghosts gradually in the adventure, so as to be able to propose puzzles which, at least in intentions, should have spurred the player to strive to find the one suited to the circumstances: in reality in the vast majority of cases the skill to be used is so evident as to consequently frustrate any enigmatic ambitions. On the other hand, the addition of a pinch of strategy in the fights with some ghosts is interesting, which can only be captured in particular circumstances or through specific approaches, thus forcing the player to a phase of observation and experimentation which, if nothing else, helps to variegate a little game experience. Even the actual combat system has been slightly enhanced, given that almost all of the ghosts cannot be killed in a canonical way, but must first be weakened with weapons and then absorbed via a sort of Frisbee bomb to be thrown, adding a extra touch of action which is always welcome. It's just a pity that the artificial intelligence of the enemies is absolutely approximate (as in Primal, on the other hand), and the absurd management of the camera, practically at the complete expense of the player, nullifies everything, making each clash an often boring and frustrating practice. Polygonal ectoplasms Like its predecessor, Ghosthunter still manages to amaze for a technical sector that stands at the top of the videogame panorama available on PS2, reconfirming the guys from Studio Cambridge among the most talented in squeezing the monolith down to the last bit. The graphics engine, a direct evolution of the one used for Primal, grinds a very high quantity of polygons, coating them with always very clean and detailed textures, particularly impressive especially as regards the face and clothing of the various characters. The transparency effect applied to some ghosts is also splendid, as is the creation of sunlight, enveloping like never before, while the animations, a little too woody and unreal, would have deserved some extra tweaking. The design of the levels also deserves a special mention, with settings ranging from the typical swamp ghost village to the Alcatraz-style prison, all extremely atmospheric and with always spot-on scenography, even if sometimes a little stereotyped. The same goes for the sound sector, characterized by a varied and pleasant musical accompaniment and by an absolutely phenomenal dubbing, both for the choice of voices and for the quality of the interpretation (in fact, you will not struggle to recognize many of the film dubbers). The effects are also good, sufficiently frightening and atmospheric, as rightly befits a production of this kind. Longevity is around the fifteen hours needed to complete the game, mainly due to the exceptional size of the levels, which can even take several hours to be successfully crossed. Unfortunately, the title does not lend itself much to being replayed, but this is a characteristic problem rather of the genre itself than of this product in particular. Comment Ghosthunter is, like Primal before him, something of a missed opportunity. Very valid graphically, however it fails to offer gameplay up to such technical goodness, while demonstrating a certain goodwill on the part of the developers to introduce some improvements to the game mechanics, even if unfortunately with only marginal results. It's not a bad game, mind you, indeed its brilliant atmosphere, halfway between the serious and half-jokingly, combined with the valuable level design and the particular combat system, makes it a pleasant and fun title, but certainly not the masterpiece that many expected. Pros: Technically remarkable Excellent voice acting Cons: Too linear levels Uninspiring gameplay Poor camera management Not even a year has passed since the release of Primal, yet Studio Cambridge has certainly not sat idly by, on the contrary it has worked hard to take advantage of the ready-made technology and make the most of the accumulated experience: the result is this Ghosthunter, a direct descendant of the Primal project, with which it shares several elements, not only technical but also as regards the game mechanics, with the promise, however, that it has taken into due consideration the criticisms made by the gaming community to the previous title.
