Among those who feel the weight of touch screens most there are undoubtedly those who want to create platformers, given that simple virtual keys are often not precise enough to jump with ease and speed between platforms, cliffs, traps and enemies. Some authors have tried to experiment with alternative solutions, but for those few who manage to find more comfortable formulas, many others fail spectacularly. This is sadly the case with The Other Brothers. Unfortunately, we underline, because the game promised sparks since the campaign that appeared on Kickstarter last summer. Disappointing campaign but which apparently would have only served as a prelude to a much greater failure. Tribute out of control The developers behind the US label 3D Attack Games have never hidden the obvious sources of inspiration that influenced the development of The Other Brothers. There's a lot about Day of the Tentacle and the way humor, storytelling and pixel art are mixed together. But above all, the most obvious muse is Super Mario Bros., both in platform mechanics and in characters. In fact, the protagonists are the brothers Jim and Joe, two mechanics with moustaches, hats and overalls, one thin and the other short and stocky. Set in a dark, filthy and rainy city, the adventure of the two begins when a group of gangsters kidnaps Tavy, a mysterious girl who plays the thankless role of damsel in distress here. There are many references between one level and another, ranging from the descents into the sewers to the weather vane that indicates the end of the level, passing through a level in which a series of ramps clearly recalls those of Mario Brothers, the arcade. However, this is not a parody of the classic Nintendo, but a tribute that aims to revive the sensations of the 16-bit era by combining old and new, both from an aesthetic and mechanical point of view. Let's start right from the artistic component, the element that in the past months has allowed the 3D Attack Games project to attract the attention of the press and nostalgics. The Other Brothers sports delightful pixel art aptly spiced up with some more modern effects and backdrops full of detail. Added to this is a funny design of the characters and an excellent job in terms of animations, but it is a pity that between landfills, construction sites, sewers and underground tunnels, the scenarios look too much like each other. In general, however, we appreciated the choice of adopting a graphic style with its own personality rather than limiting itself to emulating the aesthetics of the past. Behind these lively graphics, however, there is a very traditional platformer, in which you jump on enemies to eliminate them, overcome ravines and hop from one platform to another. As for health management, the game clearly takes up the ring system of Sonic The Hedgehog, however replacing the golden objects with pigeons. If the character is hit, he loses all the pigeons he has collected, and dies if he is damaged before having collected any more. The difference with SEGA's blue hedgehog lies in the fact that, in this case, the precious birds tend to fly away, which adds a touch of uncertainty to the challenge, especially in the fights with the two bosses. However, as mentioned at the beginning, the 3D Attack Games domino collapses disastrously in terms of controls, thwarting any attempt by the developers to create an intriguing and pleasant platformer. The Other Brothers provides the player with a single and unsuccessful control system, a sort of hybrid between the virtual D-Pad and the dynamic stick increasingly used in action and shooter games. What comes out is a directional pad that follows the finger as it moves across the screen, but resets the position with each new touch. Such an idea can work for some genres, but in a platformer like The Other Brothers it necessarily collides with the precision of the jumps and, above all, with the need to constantly move from one place to another. By jumping from platform to platform and making sudden changes of direction, the system leads to frustrating and repeated errors, and before the player can get the hang of it the adventure is already over. Although there are already additional chapters to download for free, the version of the game currently on the App Store consists of only six levels and two bosses. The time spent arguing with the controls almost overshadows the other issues of the dayco, which in addition to the short duration also concern a trivial level design and checkpoints often placed in the middle of groups of enemies, with the result that from time to time you are attacked just after the respawn.", "date": "2013-04-09", "grade": "5.0"}
