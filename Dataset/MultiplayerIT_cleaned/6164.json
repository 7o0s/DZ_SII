{"name": "Guerre interiori", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/153781-red-goddess-inner-world-guerre-interiori.html", "text": "The human soul is often a dark place where passions, anger, fear and memories intertwine in knots that are difficult to untie and heavily affect our lives. Looking inside and trying to untie these knots is a very important activity for human beings, especially when a terrible moment tightens them even more, until they are almost inextricable. Each of us experiences daily inner battles that the rest of the world ignores and that is why we should always be kind to others, we cannot know what is hidden behind their gaze and what battle is taking place while we speak. Will we be able to defeat the inner demons of a deity? A modest project Red Goddess: Inner World is a title that takes all these themes and tries to bring them within the classic structure of the ~metroidvania~ by staging the events that take place within the psyche of Divine, a young but unfortunate goddess who suffered a terrible mourning. Divine has in fact lost her entire family in a terrible battle and now she is forced to process the memory of it in an adventure full of metaphors in which anger and fear are the weapons she will need to triumph against her worst parts and return herself. Red Goddess was born as a Kickstarter project with a rather low goal: only $30,000. In one month the developers managed to exceed this figure of 10,000 dollars, not bad for a small Spanish studio of only six people. However, it is enough to play Red Goddess for a few minutes to realize that perhaps an even more modest result than the money raised is hidden behind this success. As we have already said, the game is a metroidvania, so it mixes some platform parts with the possibility of unlocking new skills with which to access unexplored areas of the map and consequent backtracking in those already visited. However, hopping here and there it is impossible not to notice how the animations are wooden, the controls quite imprecise and the scenarios quite poor, with very rare touches of personality. Anger and fear The most interesting feature is that Divine can transform into both an incarnation of anger, characterized by the color red, and one of fear, which obviously uses the color blue. Each of these two avatars can destroy certain rocks and attack certain enemies, little men called ~Negative Thoughts~ who can have various characteristics: there are simple ones, those who shoot fireballs, those armed with energy sticks and so on. In theory, the idea of having to change avatars during a fight is interesting, but its implementation is decidedly unsuccessful. In fact, the enemies can overlap, so while we attack a red thought the blue one, which we don't see, can attack and stun us. Furthermore, the combat is simply based on hitting the enemies in front of us, without any particular strategy. Therefore, either the clash is trivial or it is frustrating. If you want, there is also the possibility of possessing an enemy for a few seconds, which makes things slightly more interesting, but you don't know why this power sometimes seems not to work and you end up being beaten without the possibility of reacting . The bug festival Unfortunately, even the non-fighting sections don't do much to improve the situation. Exploring Divine's inner world is quite a frustrating experience, due to a not particularly sensible use of automatic checkpoints and the many bugs that ruin the gaming experience. In fact, he can understand that the game crashes, that a script does not start, that we get stuck for no reason and that we will have to reload the level every time, having to endure loading times that are decidedly unsuitable for what should be a simple and light title. The beauty of metroidvania is the satisfaction that comes from acquiring new powers and using them to make the gameplay more varied, discovering new areas, however this feeling is decidedly subdued in the work of Yanim Studio. The combat system glitches and glitches make exploration quite boring, if not downright frustrating, and not because the game is difficult, but because it's poorly programmed. This is a real shame because the idea behind the game could have been very, very interesting. The prospect of delving into the human psyche, addressing absolutely difficult themes such as loss, mourning, anger and fear could have made Red Goddess a great classic of indie titles and instead we find ourselves faced with a game in which the narration is quite superficial andthe technical realization is absolutely not up to par.", "date": "2015-07-27", "grade": "5.0"}
