During this time the game's team changed their name from the wacky ~Robots Vs. Wizards~ to a more conventional ~Mobot Studios~, but continued to work on the same project to expand the experience and bring it to PC first , last month, and now on Wii U. Fortunately, the starting material was really good, a title characterized by traditional but solid platform mechanics, as well as a strong exploratory streak and a certain taste for two-dimensional level design. Translating it to other platforms, in this case PC and Wii U, was therefore not a problem, all the more so given that the operation implied the insertion of various new levels and the inevitable graphic ~remastering~, which in this case led not only to an increase in resolution but also to a new and more complex lighting system, capable of further enhancing the polygonal models and creating a certain atmosphere. The new version also includes a freely explorable hub, from which it is possible to access the stages and view the progress in terms of staples collected, given that from a certain point on it will be necessary to have a certain amount of them in order to try the advanced levels. Each location hides three paper clips and a gold button, but finding them won't always be easy and it will be necessary to travel paths that we didn't think possible, going a bit in search of the secrets of each place. This exploratory vein, together with the aforementioned staple-based progression system, creates a stimulating and engaging environment, which pushes you to see ~what comes next~ and to delve further into the paper world created by the guys from Mobot Studios; in an adventure that is beautiful to see but much less to listen to, given the inconsistency and lack of originality of the soundtrack. Paper Monsters Recut is a solid and pleasant platformer but a bit too easy I'll throw you a carton The protagonist of Paper Monsters Recut is a sort of little robot made of paper, which moves in a world that is itself made of celluloid, inhabited by cardboard monsters that mostly have to be eliminated by jumping on their heads, as in the textbook. A fairly original setting, free from particular narrative devices but rendered very well on the screen, also and above all thanks to a certain variety as regards the scenarios. In fact, one passes from dark caves to snow-covered wastelands, from green mountains to metal corridors, slipping into traditional tubes to appear perhaps from a distance, in the background, bringing into play interesting visual solutions. Everything is interspersed with nice alternative sections, in which we control a submarine (unfortunately in a context completely devoid of inertia), use a sled or even a jetpack. There are also bosses, even if they probably represent the weakest aspect of the offer: the clashes, which occur at the end of each area, are in fact spoiled by a trivial degree of challenge and by fairly gross design errors (see the octopus, which can't hurt us if we stand at eye level). Speaking of design, we found the standard movement speed of the character out of place, far too limited, which forces you to always hold down the ~run~ button to move in a credible way. Apart from this, the physical control system adds precision and reactivity to the commands, allowing us to ~dare~ much more than was possible with the touch screen of mobile devices, while the function to play on the GamePad screen, activated by pressing of a single key, it adds the allure of mobility to the package while stripping us of much of its visual impact. The transition from iOS and Android to PC and Wii U appears well studied, even if an original intention remains, made up of not very large and not very complex environments, tailor-made for a fruition that could have been fleeting and impromptu. However, it is above all the lack of a challenge proper to prevent Paper Monsters Recut from really shining: the game is too easy and gives too many lives, perhaps in this sense the authors should have taken some measures.", "date": "2014-11-19", "grade": "7.5"}
