The history of the Orion project is long and, leaving the editorial line of the third person for a moment, I must confess that I was quite fond of the project, to the point of going to look for material to see how it was coming about. Some movies promised well, as did the security of the developers of wanting to make a high-level hardcore product that swept away most of the free 2 play shooters. Look mom! A texture! Those were different times. Meanwhile the main project has been shelved and the studio's efforts have been diverted to this Orion: Dino Beatdown to try to raise the missing funds to complete the main game. Despite the certainly not exciting premises, there was still potential in a five-player cooperative sci-fi shooter in which you have to fight against increasingly numerous and aggressive waves of dinosaurs. There are extra weapons, which can be purchased by spending the credits accumulated by killing the beasts (velociraptors, T-rex or pterodactyls) and there are vehicles, which can be driven alone or in pairs (one behind the wheel, one with a machine gun). The first problem is that, in summary, that's all. Of course, there are three selectable classes and extra skills to be purchased with the aforementioned credits, but otherwise the contents are very few. If desired, one could still be optimistic thinking that after all, given the low price at which it is sold, there was little to complain about and that, increasingly after all, three large well-articulated maps are not even a few in front of refined game mechanics and a addictive gameplay (see Sanctum)... Necessary premise Now, a premise made in the second paragraph of the review will seem strange to you, but it is necessary to understand what we are facing: to test the game we had to wait for the release of the third patch. We actually received a review code, Every time you delve into the bowels of a map, a Michael Bay fan is born. but the first version of the game was practically unplayable. Every time you tried to log into a server you risked being spat out for mysterious reasons, when you weren't vomited right onto your desktop. Reading the game forum we found that these were quite common problems. In that state we didn't feel like reviewing it (also because we practically didn't get to play it). When the second patch arrived we tried again, but it was another tragedy. Once it was installed we were able to enter the game, but we only saw the void under the polygons that make up the maps and we couldn't really do anything except look at the sad image of a failure for long minutes. The third patch was the right one and, finally, we were able to touch Orion: Dino Beatdown with hand. I start with a bang Once the recriminations are over, the time has come to show off some healthy malice. To start off with a bang, there's no tutorial. It is true that it is possible to play alone, but for several games some mechanics remain mysterious. Were it not a little thrush, it would be impressive The manual can be found somewhere online (hey, they still exist!), but it's not accessible via Steam, the only store that currently has the game on sale, and you have to go for a ride on the forum to find out the fateful links. Someone at this point may be wondering why there is a need for a tutorial or manual in a cooperative FPS. The answer is very simple: Orion: Dino Beatdown introduces some mechanics that require clarification, such as the possibility of buying weapons only between one wave of dinosaurs and another from special terminals, or that of recharging from other terminals, the same as the others but of different color. In reality there are terminals to do everything, but until you understand in some way (we have taken advantage of the advice of a very kind player who has done his utmost to help us, other than a manual), one is groping in the dark holding a useless gun and without really knowing what to do but kill dinosaurs. Bugplays Despite three patches, Orion: Dino Beatdown is still buggy and glitchy to the bone marrow. We don't think it was fair to sell it as a definitive game and the developers would have done better to offer it as an alpha release, so as to be honest with potential buyers. The models of the dinosaurs are not bad... but there are few dinosaurs Instead they chose to release it as a full game and it was disaster. Even if there are many who continue to trust the development team, one cannot close one's eyes to a similar situation. Apart from the dinosa modelsuri and those of the protagonists, there is little else to save. We start by looking for vehicles to use while waiting for the first wave of velociraptors and we immediately realize the violent clipping (often the dinosaurs can literally pass the walls) and some graphic problems. Simply, some areas are unfinished and appear to be filled with the default UDK textures. Also there are glitches everywhere with graphics disappearing and others flashing; not to mention the continuous and merciless clicks of the graphics engine even with a high framerate. To give you an example of how critical the situation is, after a few games we asked a simple question about the server to the other players, to find out if only we were experiencing lag problems. The answer of someone who evidently knew a lot was that it wasn't a question of lag due to the connection, but to bad optimization. To give another concrete example of Orion's conditions, just talk about when pterodactyls grab players by lunging at them. When this happens, no animations play (not to mention that sometimes they manage to catch us even when we're indoors, but that's another story) and we are simply dragged into the sky as our eyes fill with a sad dance of disappearances hysterics of polygons, which ends only with our release. The dinosaurs won't win Now, we can't account for all the bugs in the game (well, the one of damaged vehicles losing stability, with the wheels moving left and right on their own, as if they were early 20th century cars, deserves a mention), but know that we have only described a small part of it. But how is the gameplay? You may be wondering. The answer is simple: bland. The vehicles are the best part of the game. Basically all the maps are played the same way: at the beginning it is better to invest the dinosaurs with vehicles, while with the arrival of the flyers and the T-Rex it is better to stay holed up in the base, eliminate all the velociraptors and then dedicate yourself to the bigger enemies . I don't think it's necessary to explain to you that it doesn't take much to get bored. The real drama, however, comes when you're killed first. Consider that there is no respawn time and to get back into the game you have to wait for the end of a wave or for the death of all the other players (you can spend credits to get back if you want, but you don't always have the very high amount required) . Also consider that often the clashes with the tyrannosaurs and pterodactyls are reduced to a slow weakening them with the basic pistol, because in the meantime the ammunition of the more powerful weapons (reloadable only between turns) has run out and nothing else is available. We translate: in such cases you can wait even several, very slow minutes before returning to the game (twenty minutes of watching someone who looks out, fires four shots at an enemy and goes back inside is to cut your veins). There are also situations in which the survivors need to reach another base to trigger the respawn. Since the game is not very clear in communications and that you have a few seconds to recharge and buy various weapons or upgrades, it often happens that the survivors forget to move or, out of simple necessity, they don't care at all. If you haven't already switched to another server... or another game by then.", "date": "2012-05-18", "grade": "3.0"}
