Overcoming your limits? Self discovery? Edward Bennett had less romantic ideas about it: on the untouched peak of Chomolonzo he was looking for a Terma, an ancient Buddhist treasure that would have given eternal life to whoever found it. Determined as never before, Bennett had tried in vain to reach the top of the mountain, losing a leg following a disastrous fall. But he couldn't give up, he had to have that treasure! So he remained on the slopes of the mountain, waiting to be able to hire someone capable of completing the expedition in his place. Frank Simmons seemed the ideal candidate: a young and skilled climber envious of his older brother Erik's successes around the world. Since his departure to the vault of the mountain, however, no one has heard from him... and in the meantime the valley has become a far from safe place, invaded by mysterious presents that have forced the population to flee. Intent on finding his brother, Erik Simmons prepares to face the most difficult undertaking of his life: a climb between reality and hallucination, in which he will have to find the courage to believe his own eyes ... or resign himself to a worse fate of death itself. Erik Simmons' journal, stardate... Cursed Mountain offers Wii owners a completely new survival horror as far as the setting is concerned, which sees us exploring villages, monasteries and of course snow-capped mountains in search of the missing brother of the protagonist. From a mechanical point of view, however, there is nothing new under the Tibetan sun: the movement system (mostly related to the character, but which depending on the shots it can become relative to the screen) is typical of the first Resident Evil, therefore very cumbersome and not at all helped by the massive presence of obstacles (visible and not) which make changes of direction difficult, especially when moving inside of confined spaces. It is possible to activate a first person view (by pressing the d-pad down), but on balance it is a practically useless feature, while it would have been appreciable not only to be able to control the view (here fixed and not always ~intelligent~) , but also have a map of the scenario available to understand which places we have already gone. This is not because the locations of Cursed Mountain are so elaborate and extensive as to require a schematic representation, far from it: they are too repetitive in appearance, so you end up getting confused. In the game it is difficult to find a building, a road and even less a mountain peak that is well characterized and therefore distinguishable from other places of the same type. The difficult art of instilling terror With a fairly articulated and engaging plot, which unfolds through ~visions~ and flashbacks shown on the screen in an at least original way, Cursed Mountain tries to build its own atmosphere through a very slow initial phase. The contact with the ghosts that haunt the valley and the mountain takes place in an extremely gradual way, and the mechanism that regulates the difficulty of the fights seems to give too much weight to the goodness of the weapon in our possession, with the result that the clashes turn out to be a walk of health if not towards the end of the adventure, when the spirits arrive in groups of four or five and you have to move continuously between one blow and another in order not to suffer damage. Even in situations more excited, however, the fact of being able to close the fight with a rite of ~extraction~ gives us ample margins of success, given that the procedure gives us back part of the energy. To fight we must first hold down the C button on the Nunchuck, which allows us to see the ghosts using our ~inner eye~ (this is underlined by an interesting visual effect), then use the Wii-mote's pointing system and press trigger B to hit enemies. When a spirit is weakened, a mark appears on its body signaling the possibility of proceeding with the aforementioned ritual, which involves pressing the A button and performing certain gestures with the controllers (not always well detected) to go successful. During the boss fight, you have to repeat such a procedure even several times, which gives the clashes a physicality that is anything but despicable. Finally, if the opponents get too close, we can still hit them and move them away by shaking the ice ax using the B trigger. Ghost Buster The protagonist of Cursed Mountain will find various weapons along the way to defend himself from the spirits he infestsI'm at the mountain. Firstly, the ice ax that belonged to his brother Frank, somehow ~blessed~ by the rituals performed before departure: it is capable of hitting ghosts as if they were flesh, even if it doesn't have great power. At its top various mystical objects can be ~mounted~ which increase its effectiveness: the Kartrika, a curved knife that cuts the ectoplasm without mercy; the Kila, a dagger that allows the ice ax to shoot flames as if it were a firearm; the Lag Pa, a sort of ~spiritual line~ that hooks spirits and can eliminate them in a single movement; the Khorlo, a small crown that emits powerful rays in various directions. In search of the lost riddle It has already been said that the scenarios to be explored are repetitive and limited. The problem is that this goes hand in hand with an excessive linearity of the action, which sees us moving from one place to another while breaking vases and possibly collecting incense sticks. The latter, burned in front of certain altars, represent the only way we have to recover vital energy but they come dispensed in large quantities and contribute to further sink the level of challenge of the Deep Silver product. The puzzles to solve are frankly few, excessively simple and poorly distributed. From this point of view it is possible to appreciate some improvement only towards the end of the game, while for the rest the ideas of the developers turn out to be sterile and ends in themselves: climbing with ice axes, which can be speeded up by moving the controllers, assumes tragicomic visual connotations between unrealistic animation and various interpenetrations; the walk on the snowy edges does not hide any concrete pitfalls; the ~hovering~ sessions, likewise, must be completed by tilting the Wii-mote forward and paying only a minimum of attention to the position of the character; the much feared QTAs are rare and far from complex to carry out. Technical realization The game offers an interesting interpretation of ghosts, rendered as tortured bodies covered in thick fog that ~slide~ menacingly towards the protagonist. They are divided into various types, differentiated in appearance as well as in behavioral routines, and convince at least until their ~explosion~ occurs, graphically represented in an unfortunately mediocre way. Erik Simmons himself has little to complain about, his polygonal model looks quite detailed (at least until he wears equipment for high altitudes) and the animations during combat are interesting. Less interesting is his walk, with the movement of the legs that often does not correspond to the distance covered and a run (obtainable by holding down the Z button) that is too slow and breathless, perhaps made this way out of fear that the player could complete the adventure in less time of the nine hours foreseen (going wide). Unfortunately, there isn't much to say about the scenery: the mountain cross-sections repeat themselves ad libitum in their nothingness, alternating invisible barriers with paths that are all the same. Perhaps the location of the monastery is saved, but even there there are too many limits to exploration and the numerous closed doors force you to take the only possible route. The sound is deliberately essential in the music, with good spoken English (literally: the characters have a frightening English accent) well translated into Italian by subtitles. The effects are decent, the mountain ~speaks~ quite convincingly and there are some nice ideas (see the Wii-mote speaker used to simulate walkie-talkie transmission).", "date": "2009-09-02", "grade": "7.0"}
