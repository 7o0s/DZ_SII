With obviously some exceptions, among which we remember Turok and its recent remake, as well as some independent productions such as Dino D-Day and Primal Carnage. Just this last game, Lukewarm Media's effort, has captured our attention by presenting itself as a first-person shooter with a fairly classic setting, but equipped with the interesting feature of allowing players to also control dinosaurs. All with asymmetrical mechanics between the teams in play and a purely online experience. Without many frills, the essence of Primal Carnage is in fact made up of the struggle between humans and prehistoric animals, resorting to a class system for the characters involved: a legacy that has now passed in a more than tested way from role-playing games to the shooter genre . Unexpected game-changer or yet another title in the sea of shooters that populate the market? Grab your shotgun and follow us quietly, because we're about to find out by hunting for dinosaurs. Are we humans or dinosaurs? As we have already said, Primal Carnage bases the entire gaming experience on a single component, the one via the Internet, thus leaving no room for single mode. The first consequence of this is that the plot is barely sketched, just to justify what is put before the player's eyes: following an experiment gone wrong, the dinosaurs are released on an island controlled by the military. A group of mercenaries is then sent to the location to solve the problem, eliminating the group of pets on leave. The team of humans, as well as that of dinosaurs, is made up of different elements. As for the former we find the Commando, a traditional assault class armed to the teeth; the Scientist, sniper with which to hit and weaken targets from a distance; the Pathfinder, able to support the rest of the group thanks to its equipment; the Trapper, a character able to immobilize and render enemies harmless; and finally the Pyromaniac, a madman armed with a flamethrower capable of setting fire to anything within reach. The dinosaur team is instead made up of the fearsome T-Rex, a huge monster with easily imaginable abilities, lethal if faced face to face; the Novaraptor, as fast as he is able to hit humans without even being seen; the Dilophosaurus, with which instead in immobilizing enemies at a distance, also resorting to the use of its poison; the Pteranodon, a flying animal able to see battle from the skies; and the Carnotaurus, another big dinosaur that makes its destructive charge its strong point. Five classes on one side and five on the other therefore, each with its own style of play: from a role-playing point of view, a pity for the absence of an experience point system thanks to which you can customize your character compared to those of the others. The only game mode available to us is instead the classic team deathmatch, beyond which (at least for the moment) it is not possible to go. Not much, for a game that is based solely on the online component. Having fun together In a similar way to what was seen in titles such as Left 4 Dead, the gaming experience of Primal Carnage proves to be different depending on the use of one of the two teams present: after starting a game as human beings, one realizes in little time how important teamwork is, rather than trying to be a hero by going around the map hunting for dinosaurs. While the Pyromaniac creates a kind of perimeter, for example, the Pathfinder can blind the dinosaurs thus allowing those with more firepower to carry out the attack. A collaboration also encouraged by the presence of score rewards not only for kills, but also for so-called assists. Just to allow players to stay united, the game offers the possibility to always see where our companions are, even through walls. A feature that is also present when playing with dinosaurs, in which case, however, there are some differences in the type of strategy that can be adopted: in fact, the view switches from first to third person, giving the player the possibility of having a better perception of the surrounding environment, without therefore feel the strict need to have someone to constantly cover his back. The characteristics of each dinosaur then do the rest, giving each oneof them a greater freedom to go around trying to do damage on their own. In reality, even for this team there are elements of group play: the T-Rex can offer a health bonus to the surrounding companions with its roar, just as the Pteranodon can communicate the position of human beings to the other members of the group. Despite the already highlighted paucity of modalities, the game manages to stand up thanks to the difference between the two teams, making it varied and fun. The temptation is obviously to try the particularity of the dinosaurs (especially thanks to the flying class), but we guarantee that it is possible to have a lot of fun even within a team made up of humans. It's all so Unreal From a graphic point of view, the presence of the Unreal Engine 3 to move the polygons of humans and dinosaurs on the screen offers a certain guarantee, even if, as in other episodes, the engine created by Epic Games is now starting to show its age. Overall, the visual experience offered by Primal Carnage can be considered within the limits of sufficiency, even if a greater level of optimization would have prevented the occurrence of some glitches scattered here and there. Also noteworthy is the occasional loss of video settings, or rather the need to reset them since they are inexplicably ignored. The sound is also normal, with effects from the weapons and the sounds of the dinosaurs that do their job well. The matchmaking has always proved to be quite fast, thus allowing you to enter a free server without having to wait too long in the queue, even using the quick match option.", "date": "2012-11-16", "grade": "7.0"}
