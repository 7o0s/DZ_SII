If this is a truth carved in stone with regard to traditional PC games, browser games deserve a separate discussion, which have advanced over time by huge strides to the point of giving us the opportunity to see some examples comparable to desktop version games . Thanks to these advances, guaranteed by new technologies, even virtual football has been able to see new experiments by more or less famous developers, who have tried to give players different variations from that of the Sports Interactive title: often less profound, but more suitable for usability both at home and away, thanks to immediate interfaces and mechanics. After having collected important collaborations such as the one with EA Sports for FIFA Online 3, the Korean Nexon has finally decided that the time has finally come to go ~on her own~, to try to make things big also thanks to the vast experience accumulated in the field of online games, a genre in which those parts have little to learn from others. A few days ago, taking advantage of the attention for football multiplied to the nth degree by the 2014 World Cup, the final version of United Eleven, the free-to-play football management system, was published: with no middle ground, the project entrusted to NHN BlackPick has aimed immediately at the top, also counting on the prominence also offered by the presence of Carlo Ancelotti, coach of the new European champions Real Madrid, chosen as United Eleven's testimonial. If you are looking for a football browser game, to be played at home or away, United Eleven is for you. Known faces The presence of the national Carletto as image man and guardian of our virtual coach in United Eleven is not the only way we have to deal with real-world football: to the delight of fans of Messi, Ronaldo and various colleagues, the game in fact, it offers the possibility of counting on the FIFPro license, thanks to which those who play United Eleven can enjoy a database of over 50,000 players. All of the characters reproduced naturally correspond to their flesh-and-blood counterparts, to compose a dynamic database, updated by the developers on a regular basis through parameters related to the form and performance of the individuals, in matches played in real leagues. Starting your experience in United Eleven is quite simple: in fact, you just need to choose one of the teams present, inspired by their names to the real ones, to receive the first three ~symbol~ players of the selected team. By choosing Napoli, for example, we were allowed to keep Higuain, Insigne and Hamsik, along with the rest of the squad proposed by the game's artificial intelligence. In case the names drawn are not to our liking, you can freely click to shuffle the cards to get different players to compose the team. From this moment on, the managerial aspect of United Eleven becomes similar to that of Ultimate Team, the FIFA mode that allows you to collect and field the ~cards~ of your players: in this case too, in fact, you can sell or exchange elements that no longer fall within our plans, buying additional ones by spending the game's virtual currency, earned by playing games and achieving particular objectives detailed in a specific section. Being a free-to-play game, there is naturally also a paid component, linked to the section of the shop inside the game, where you can buy bonus items that allow, for example, our players to recover their optimal form in a shorter time. A policy which, at least in the short term, does not seem capable of negatively influencing the game for those who decide not to pay a cent. However, everything remains to be verified in the long term, especially at the highest levels where we find ourselves dealing with teams of a certain talent. All on the field When choosing the formation to be deployed on the pitch, it is necessary to keep in mind the fundamental parameters of United Eleven, accompanied by other secondary aspects. If the roles and attributes of the individual players are indeed primary aspects to take into consideration, it is also necessary not to underestimate the level of harmony within those who make up the squad; equally important is also the aforementioned state of shape, which can be recovered with rest or training thanks to the specific programs obtained previously. Returning to the time to take the field, United Eleven matches take place every hour, giving the player the opportunity to check the result at the end of the match, orand follow it in real time, in a way that will feel quite familiar to anyone who loves Football Manager. In fact, the match interface shows the two formations, with relative votes and physical condition, in the middle of which we find a representation of the football field from above, which transforms into a two-dimensional commentary when one of the key actions generated by the game is displayed. game engine. Also in a similar way to Football Manager, it is possible to communicate from the sidelines with your players, for example inviting them to make fewer shots, but with more precision, to waste time or to keep possession of the ball. Overall, the direct experience with the United Eleven match is quite pleasant, even if the directives given from the bench don't always seem to have the desired effect. But this, as we know, also happens in real football. As far as the glance is concerned, United Eleven is quite pleasant, but it must obviously be kept in mind that we are still talking about a browser game, as well as a genre that normally does not already shine for its graphics sector.", "date": "2014-06-18", "grade": "7.0"}
