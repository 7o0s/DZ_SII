Even the protagonist of Hook Champ knows it well, an interesting platform developed by Rocketcat Games and available on the App Store for the modest sum of 2.39 euros. As usual, the selling price of an application for iPhone and iPod Touch can be considered high or low depending on the offer, and in this specific case we are certainly dealing with an extremely convenient product in terms of quantity and quality . Our character finds himself exploring a series of stages divided by a certain number of locations (which are increased through free updates, moreover) and his goal is to collect as many coins as possible as well as survive the traps and the assault by hostile creatures. Each stage ends in the same way, that is, the meeting with our clever companion who takes us out of the dungeon on duty. Tarzan or Spiderman? In the game we can move on foot, easily overcoming the most accessible obstacles, or use a rope equipped with a hook. The latter adheres to most surfaces and therefore allows us not only to reach otherwise inaccessible areas, but also to move much faster, continuously alternating the launches and projecting ourselves rapidly forward. Our expeditions are almost always characterized by the urgency of escaping evil creatures, from which we can possibly defend ourselves using a shotgun or other gadgets that can be purchased at a shop between one level and another. Using the collected coins, therefore, it is possible to equip the character with shoes that make him faster, with longer ropes, with more resistant and effective hooks, as well as with different clothes. All these enhancements have a substantial impact on our abilities and allow us to return to the stages we have already visited to reveal even the smallest secret and aim for 100% completion. Each location shows us a different scenario, and the stages gradually differ due to a general increase in difficulty and pitfalls present. Our adventurer does not suffer from falls from heights, but must beware of traps and the attack of any enemies. The magic touch Among the peculiarities of Hook Champ there is undoubtedly the clear reference to the video games of the 8-bit consoles, which can be seen in particular from the ~pixelated~ cutscenes. The graphics themselves, in fact, are excellently done and in step with the times: the character has a good set of animations, scrolling is fluid, the colors have been used in the best way and the locations are very varied and well differentiated , thanks to an excellent work in the design phase. The music helps to create the aforementioned retro atmosphere, with catchy melodies and the almost total absence of effects. Unfortunately, the control system acts as a ~bottleneck~ for everything else, in the sense that it undermines the enjoyment of an otherwise excellent product. Instead of relying on the classic solution of the virtual d-pad, in fact, the developers of Rocketcat Games have thought (wrongly) to opt for a more intuitive control, which involves simply pressing the touch screen left and right for the character to move, while the area to be touched must be changed (moving higher) to use the hook. Unfortunately, the two available options do not differ that much, inserting only a further impediment (the ~charge~ of throwing the rope) to an already cumbersome and very unhappy situation.
