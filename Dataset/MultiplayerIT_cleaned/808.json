{"name": "Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/brothers-in-arms-earned-in-blood-recensione.html", "text": "I had deja vu in front of the TV The video game industry isn't famous, or maybe it hasn't been, for its constant search for original products. While on the one hand the courage of the developers has to deal with the market and with the now very high profits, on the other hand it is normal for genres to evolve even more slowly. Perhaps with the arrival of the new platforms and with the possibilities that accompany them, something will change, but for the moment, FPS enthusiasts can breathe a little thanks to titles such as FarCry and, coincidentally, Brothers in Arms here. In fact, this Earned in Blood takes up that originality factor that its predecessor, Road To Hill 30, could boast of, in spite of the dozens of medal holders of honor that are already gathering dust on the shelves of enthusiasts. Perhaps however, precisely because it re-proposes a concept we have already seen, it doesn't also risk ending up in the great vein of inglorious sequels? The answer is in the middle and you just need to keep reading to find out if Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood, released less than a year after the first chapter, represents something more than a mere expansion for enthusiasts. All for one We can also immediately say that Earned in Blood is more than a simple data-disk and represents an all-round title, which overcomes several shortcomings of the previous chapter (the developers ensure that they have become aware of the suggestions sent to them by the fans), but which invariably the central concept of Road to Hill 30. On this point we feel a little disappointed, since the control system and the way in which orders are given have remained unchanged, as has the list of available actions. For the benefit of those unfamiliar with the series, let's start from the main concept of Brothers in Arms, which revolves around the management of the soldiers who accompany you on a mission in dynamic first-person battles. This means that you will have to worry about the life of your men by giving them various orders through a simple and intuitive control system, which allows you to push them into the assault, to fall back, to take cover behind any object taller than a blade of grass and to open barrage fire on enemy positions. Each clash is therefore a small tactical field where the ultimate goal is to outflank the enemy without giving him a chance, playing almost exclusively on the tactical component: without adequate menagement, any personal initiative inspired by the heroisms of Electronic Arts will end in a safe failure. This is the spirit of Brothers in Arms and we find it completely unchanged in Earned in Blood, including the signal placed above the enemy troops that informs you of the level of pressure to which they are subjected by friendly fire (your friend of course). But what interests us most are the developments in terms of artificial intelligence that the Gearbox guys have finally introduced. Project supervisor John Antal, a former army officer, allowed the programmers to recreate on our screens the real maneuvers that underlie any infantry action divided into four phases, from identifying the enemy to his encirclement, all while his companions force him with a wall of bullets to remain holed up in his position. All for one This already intriguing game concept now offers a renewed realism, because the enemies will not only try to retreat from their positions in order not to find themselves trapped, but they will implement the same tactical solutions towards you, turning the conflict into a game of moves and counter-moves in order not to be the first to find themselves with their backs to the wall. In this, Earned in Blood offers its best and already from the first levels we find ourselves repeating a section several times due to the difficulty of the situations, where there is no easy solution or a fortuitous assault to get out. The same enemy is much more cunning and avoids launching suicidal attacks, instead moving cautiously from cover to cover sparing blasts of suppression when moving. Even more interesting is the dynamic evolution of situations that lead us to have to reconsider our plans based on the changing conditions on the ground. Let's take an example; even if initially we will face a few settlements of soldiers and a single squad to manage, as we advance in the course of the game the war theaters will become more chaotic and crowded, so that an encirclement maneuver can lead us to discover a nest of machine guns in the meantime and if fail to deal with the new threat quickly, what seemed like a winning move could turn into a disaster. Selfto this we add the cunning of the Germans who are able to rescue the comrades closed by the barrage we will find ourselves in front of a stimulating and satisfying product, even if not everything is as glittering as it seems. All for one First of all, the approach to the game, as we have already said, has remained totally unchanged compared to its predecessor and this certainly does not bode well, while in the second place the monotony can become an unpleasant mission companion. It is true that now there are more weapons to wield and tanks and semi-mobile arsenal can be managed, but the principle does not change one iota and your first person support is not as satisfying as it may seem. Taking aim is certainly not easy and solo missions do not give the same emotions offered by team play, so it can be said that the tactical component surpasses the first-person experience in quality, making the player feel little present on the field. Furthermore, and perhaps this is the major flaw of Earned in Blood, the size and workmanship of a shelter is totally irrelevant. This means that you will not be able to shoot from a crack between the boards placed on a window and that one shot will never affect the protection value of whatever you have decided to put between you and the ballistic hell raining down on you. Even the improved AI routines lend themselves to some criticism, such as the fact that if the soldiers aren't totally annihilated by covering fire they will become aware of your presence no matter how sneakily you sneak up on them. Unfortunately it is the repetitiveness of the action that weakens a product that could still offer a lot starting from its undoubtedly winning basic idea. Rescue Private Hartsock Now that we have clarified the actual game dynamics we cannot ignore a component that makes the Brothers in Arms series unique and which consists of the historical and narrative background of great importance and depth. After wearing Sergeant Baker's uniform, you will find yourself within the same context in a parallel story which now sees Corporal Hartsock as the protagonist, grappling with the French war campaign which follows the events of D-Day in Normandy and which aims straight on towards Cherbourg, a place of great strategic importance for the Allies. We can break down the component that surrounds the action of the game on two distinct levels but totally integrated in the final result, i.e. the battlefield and the stories of the soldiers involved. On the one hand, in fact, we will find ourselves traveling through numerous urban settlements and vast countryside reproduced with such historical fidelity as to deserve a special mention, thanks also to the inexhaustible testimony of John Antal and to the geographical satellite photos. It is perhaps one of the most credible and plausible reconstructions seen in a game of this kind, while on the other hand each chapter is accompanied by an interlude where the personality of the different soldiers and the story of their respective lives emerge. The final effect, already seen in Road to Hill 30, is to highlight the heroism of simple men grappling with equally simple objectives but earned, as the title says, with blood, contending with the enemy for a meter land after land, perhaps to obtain trivial medicines. In short, no space base on Mars. Never change a winning team? Also on the technical side there does not seem to have been a great step forward and the much announced new engine looks a bit too much like that of the first chapter, with unconvincing textures especially as regards the buildings and the three-dimensional elements of the landscape, which deserve a greater care, above all if one thinks of the meticulousness with which they were reconstructed. The woody and rigid animations do not improve the situation, even if the final result is not disappointing, but certainly far from the standards offered by an FPS worthy of the name. The music cannot compete with the colossal soundtracks of Medal of Honor, even if the Italian dubbing definitely raises the morale of the sound sector; it's just a pity that the soldiers always end up saying the same sentences, few to tell the truth, even without the situation requiring it. On the other hand, the novel dialogues that occur throughout the single-player campaign and which make use of a discreet interpretation by the voice actors are much better. A last component, but only because we talk about it in closing certainly not for matters of little relevance, is the Skirmish option, which allows you to try your hand at 20 maps (10 already seen in the old title and 10 brand new) in solitary, with someand friend in split screen via LAN or thanks to the web connection, playing the role of Germans or Americans. You can customize the enemy's shooting accuracy and other parameters that make this mode easily usable for those who do not want to follow the story of the main campaign or to play in groups in Objective, Assault and Defense modes. The first consists in achieving very specific purposes exactly as occurs in Story mode, only that all the elements of the narration are missing, while the Assault option rewards your team for successfully completing the mission in the shortest possible time. Perhaps more intriguing is the last option dedicated to multiplayer, in which there is no victory but a higher score is earned by resisting the assaults of the enemy for as long as possible, which exacerbates the offensive with the succession of waves of attackers. Undoubtedly a rich dish, full of good ideas and improvements but which still has a supporting structure identical to its predecessor and which will delight the fans but which penalizes the title in terms of originality, especially if you are one of those who think that Doom deserved to finish in glory with the second episode. Earned in Blood comes out too early on the market and even if it presents itself as a game tout court, or perhaps precisely because of this, it betrays the expectations of originality by bringing with it the heart of the first chapter, proposing again the same narrative mold especially the control system itself. In short, the underlying philosophy has not changed, even if a much more acute and dynamic artificial intelligence makes the hours spent on the battlefields decidedly more intriguing. Still, there's still a good way forward for the development team to upgrade, while players who love Brother in Arms will have another chance to test their skills in now much more challenging conflicts. Others are left with an opportunity to experience a decent title with something fresh to say about the genre, especially if you can take full advantage of the multiplayer mode.Pros Enhanced Artificial Intelligence Dynamic Battles A new dose of tactics and strategy Excellent historical reenactment Versus Alla long repetitive The game system is unchanged in this sequel Outdated graphics engine and material physics Cross-platform The differences between the PC, Xbox and PS2 versions are purely technical. As it is easy to imagine, the PC maintains the highest quality standard, which loses a bit of tone on the Microsoft home console and further declines on the Sony machine, due to an almost absent anti-aliasing and occasional slowdowns, however they afflict all three versions. This does not affect the quality of the title, which on Xbox Live! earn several points thanks to the presence of the headphones with microphone supplied to all the faithful of the crusader brand; considering that Earned in Blood relies entirely on cooperation and teamwork, this is no small advantage.", "date": "2005-10-14", "grade": null}
