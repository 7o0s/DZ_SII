All you need is a Dualshock 4, the rest of the actions are carried out intuitively by downloading the application of the individual games on the smartphone of those present, so as to allow everyone to participate. The forerunner was Tell me who you are, now available this summer as a free PlayStation Plus subscription title, but three other products from the most disparate genres are now available: a party game at the quiz show (Knowledge is Power), the spin- off SingStar Celebration, and most recently Hidden Agenda. The latter, a cinematic investigative thriller, is perhaps the most interesting of the three, above all for the originality of the mechanics put in place, proposed for the first time in a social game sauce. Crime scene in the living room Hidden Agenda deserves attention even if only for those who took care of the direction, namely the guys from Supermassive Games. Exactly, the same ones who churned out that half-masterpiece Until Dawn. If you have had the opportunity to try it, with Hidden Agenda you will immediately find yourself at home, in the company of a decision-making system made up of crossroads, excellent acting quality and excellent graphics. On the other hand, the narrative genre changes, moving to the CIS-style detective/thriller. We are in an undefined large American city, grappling with a series of brutal murders that somehow seem to involve local police officers among the victims. The player's perspective oscillates between that of Becky Marnie, the agent in charge of the case, and Felicity Grames, the district attorney. Our task is to shed light on the events, discovering who is behind the face of the mysterious Manipulator. Over the course of a couple of hours between investigations, dialogues and distressing decisions, the relationships between the characters will show increasingly murky and ambivalent aspects, so that understanding something until the end will not be an easy task. Some really unclear moments don't help, in which the reticence of the protagonists or the reference to simple names of characters that we have seen yes and no for a couple of minutes leave us confused, even if they can later prove to be fundamental. The fate of the heroes and of the human relationships between them is linked to the actions we will choose to perform, to the meditated or aggressive game approach, and to the various narrative crossroads of the crucial moments; but the title never hides its nature as a pleasant film forcefully driven by the developers towards the different possible endings. Touch screen decisions The PlayStation 4 controller is required to start the application, from then on Hidden Agenda expects everything to be managed by smartphone in hand. One of the players, for a maximum of four participants, is appointed group leader, essentially the screen navigation officer in the tutorial and in the few game menus. While the story is told, divided into three parts, the players are called to democratically decide what to do, dragging their finger on the touch screen to move their colored cursor on the TV to the desired box. Do we explore the garden or do we enter the house? We swipe our finger and make our decision, the majority wins. But not always: certain situations, usually the crucial ones, require all participants to agree. And it is here that Hidden Agenda pushes players to discuss, to chat, and shows its best results precisely as a social game. The title also manages to tease those present with some interesting ~finds~. It can ask us, for example, to rate which of our friends we think is more assertive, honest, or compassionate. Later the person in question will be called to answer for a precise action within the title, very important, and only she will be able to do it (the cursors of the other competitors will disappear), a significant responsibility. Or Hidden Agenda gives us the chance to become real villains. Do we not agree with the decision of the majority? We can then impose our will, by spending a Decision Card; we have a limited number available, but nobody forbids us to collect others in the short and sporadic QTE sessions of the title, or in those to ~search for hidden objects~ in the scenario. There is also a Competitive Mode next to the Story. In this case we will experience the same story and we will have to make the same choices, but the game will secretly assign certain participants objectives to achieve, showing them on their smartphone. Our friend or family member, undetected, dhe will have to convince us to perform certain actions, thus earning points. However we found this variation much less inspired and enjoyable, and frankly it feels completely forced. Not only does Hidden Agenda gain nothing in terms of replayability (the proposed story remains identical), but one is led to neglect the narration and not enjoy the plot, to concentrate on unconvincing mechanics, especially if you play in two (or in Three).", "date": "2017-11-20", "grade": "8.0"}
