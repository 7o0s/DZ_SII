Borderlands continues to grind millions of copies sold and even if the third chapter is far from the results of the incomparable Borderlands 2, it is clear that the public has not had enough yet. With this awareness in mind, the Texan boys have seen fit to dust off one of the undisputed protagonists of the saga: that Tiny Tina who has never left the hearts of players in the past ten years. So here, after seeing her even crazier and slightly more adult in Borderlands 3, she is now the protagonist of an explosive spin-off. We have had the opportunity to try it and we are ready to tell you what we think of the campaign and the new mechanics present in the game. So are you ready to launch yourself into the review of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands? One bullet to rule them all! Tiny Tina's Wonderlands: some settings are really suggestive The announcement of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands was a great success, it is useless to deny this obviousness. Yet we, after flying around the world in the months leading up to the release of Borderlands 3, reviewing it in the comfort of our home and cyclically returning to play it for the release of the DLCs, hide from you only a pinch of fear l 'we always had. Although the third numbered chapter of the saga was a great success, we have always highlighted a certain reluctance on the part of Gearbox in having avoided taking any risks by trying to renew a game formula that has been the same for almost fifteen years. A few filings here and there, but nothing that could eliminate some now anachronistic elements of the series. To say that Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is an exception would be an exaggeration, but at least it tries to add some more interesting factors. Before analyzing the differences in the gameplay, let's also talk about the narrative of this spin-off. Tina invites the cosmonauts Frette and Valentine - stranded with the spaceship in trouble - and in the midst of the group madness that is the backbone of the Borderlands spirit, she decides to show off her skills as a bunker master and put on a roll of Bunkers & Badasses. With a wink at Dungeons and Dragons we are immediately catapulted into the Wonderlands: a huge continent entirely born of Tina's inspiration and for which the crazy girl has also prepared a board and an infinite series of game miniatures. We are to all intents and purposes the freshman of the team, the latest arrival who fits within the trio and who submits to the rules and narration of his deus ex machina. It would go without saying that the management of an RPG by an unstable and over the top character like Tina will lead to a series of totally crazy situations, which in some cases will even reach some climax in the history of Borderlands. We can't and we won't tell you too much especially because, having played the title thoroughly for about thirty hours, we are well aware of the reasons why 2K and Gearbox have asked us to keep our mouths shut. historical characters transformed into ridiculous fairies and new supporting characters who do not regret anything from the past, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is a continuous laugh. Also thanks to a writing that, since Borderlands 3, had evidently made great strides in the management of the rhythm and in the drafting of the dialogues, unfortunately sinning in the character of the two main antagonists. The same goes for the crazy side missions, even more out of place and over the top than usual, which in this case will also lead you to discover portions of the map and totally optional areas. It's really hard to think of asking for more from the character and style of Borderlands and, even if no one will ever be able to take the place of Handsome Jack, the spin-off delights thanks to its declaration of love to Dungeons and Dragons, with the irony and irreverent force of a now timeless series. The overworld Tiny Tina's Wonderlands: the bad guy of bad guys Let's get into the actual gameplay. Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, taking advantage of the hook of the live role-playing match between the protagonist and the other crew members, inserts very early one of the totally new mechanics for the series: the overworld. Basically it is nothing but the Wonderlands board: the continent created by the mind of Tina herself, where all our (dis)adventures unfold. No more star map then and, in its place, we find something very similar to the Classic Final Fantasy. Every time you leave one of the classic Borderlands maps, more or less large, we will find ourselves wandering around with the nostra pawn within the continent. The view will move from above and our character in super deformed version will be able to move in the overworld. Rather than just taking advantage of the parchment-style map - which we had already seen during last month's test, the Wonderlands are transformed in all respects into a cornerstone of the gameplay, with their own completion percentage, a series of NPCs and side quests, collectibles and, paradoxically, random encounters. Tiny Tina's Wonderlands: an air of fantasy in that of the continent With a wink to Pokmon, it will also be possible to explore the continent by following essentially linear paths, but which will gradually present deviations. Among the roads available to reach a specific dungeon, a chest to open or a bottle cap that will act as a shortcut, there will also be bushes. Walking in the tall grass means going much slower and attracting the attention of a series of enemies that we will have to defeat after touching them. At that point we will be instantly transported to an arena that will remember the area where we were and which will require you to kill a certain amount of enemies to complete. Only once concluded will it be possible to open the reward and return to the overworld or proceed to the next room until the encounter is complete. Believe us: the overworld is much easier to experience than to tell, especially for the lack of immediacy in explaining a system very far from that of the FPS, however hybridized with the RPG they may be. We liked the gimmick, both in purely stylistic terms - and here too we avoid spoiling some surprises linked here and there to Tina and her lack of attention to material goods - but above all because it tries to insert a completely new variable for the saga. There will even be a series of sanctuaries to be unlocked through collectibles that can be collected around the board. These will allow to obtain permanent modifiers to the characteristics of our character, thus adding a further level of customization as well as an extra push to completion. Ironically this choice works much better than that classic open world that was talked about so much before could have done of Borderlands 3, without renouncing to keep the experience on a human scale, as well as funny and ironic. Spells and melee The change in approach to gameplay has also seen some differences in the variation of gunplay. Although the game remains anchored to the guns and sometimes creates a certain estrangement between the awareness of the roll and having a machine gun in your hands, Gearbox has seen fit to implement the spells and melee weapons anyway. The former are nothing more than a real piece of equipment which, like class skills, adds a further possibility in combat. We may have seen less than expected, but we are sure that the team will also look into this aspect in the near future, because it represents a further important customization element within the build. Same goes for melee. Axes, swords, hammers and other types of bladed weapons can now be used instead of a simple melee attack. By holding down the relative key, our alter ego will continue to strike with weapons which, in some situations and following certain builds, will be able to be much more than a simple support tool. We ourselves have used it in more than one difficult situation to lighten the pressure of the enemies and free ourselves from some encirclement too many. Fantasy for Tiny Tina Tiny Tina's Wonderlands: could skeletons be missing in a wheel? If the overworld represents a totally new idea and bodes well for the future, the management of the character and inventory was less obvious. We are not in the real world, here it is all the result of Tina's imagination and since the creation of one's avatar it is possible to notice a series of substantial differences. There are six classes and range from Deathbrand to Berserk, putting more physical or more magical builds on the plate depending on your needs. Leveling up with missions or through lead shot will allow you to accumulate skill points and hero points. The first courses are always the same, managed on menus that are still identical to the past and which vary from class to class. The latter, on the other hand, are nothing more than real characteristic points, which can be spent individually to raise one's strength, intelligence, dexterity and so on. All parameters that will affect your effectiveness in battle and which we assure you will require more attention than you could possiblybelieve. Tiny Tina's Wonderlands: get ready to meet the most diverse races It is evident that the archetype recalls what we have always known about the world of role-playing games, but it is with the progress of the campaign and the unlocking of the second class that things get really interesting and they are able to raise the level of the gameplay. Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is in fact the title with the highest customization of the saga. When the game allows you to add a second active class, you will be able to spend your skill points on the skills of one or the other tree, spacing the active skills as much as you like. We go from minions such as mushrooms and phoenixes - they can become two if you choose two specializations that contemplate them - passing through support skills, up to those more devoted to brute force. This design choice, far from revolutionary, however puts a lot of spice in the continuation of its build and totally explodes in the endgame phase of the game, when the myth levels are also activated; as well as after the campaign, when it will be possible to choose another class still to intersperse with the second one you have already unlocked. us, but Gearbox's choice to remodel the random encounter rooms to create a concept very similar to that of Bloodborne's Chalice Dungeons is the gimmick that was really missing from the Borderlands post-campaign. An artistic madness Tiny Tina's Wonderlands: a goblin is forever Tiny Tina's Wonderlands does not deviate much from what we already know more than well of the Borderlands style. A very marked cel shading, artificial intelligence that is certainly not stellar and a stylistic code that is sometimes perfectly fitting, others more than anonymous, form the background for the umpteenth chapter of the series. We are very sincere in telling you that this spin-off has however given us some truly suggestive glimpses, also thanks to the possibility of exaggerating even more by exploiting Tina's imagination. To be honest, we'd be really curious to see your faces once you've seen a certain scene, with certain rockets, on a certain horizon. Unfortunately, we also have to note that the review code we played, in the PC version and through the Epic client, does not it was free from technical problems. To be able to make it run really smoothly and without major frame drops we preferred to lock it at 60fps (with v-sync enabled to save the cabin from damn tearing), equally lowering the refresh rate of our 2K monitor. Although this has solved the problem of fluidity, unfortunately there have been more than a few crashes to interrupt the experience during these days of testing. It is impossible to say whether the final version will suffer the same fate: we have been reassured by the publisher that most of the problems will be solved by updates at launch, but while we wait to verify it, we report it to you for the record. Overall, we have found the soundtrack and the sound design in general are a bit less refined and exciting than usual. Some sync problems, an evidently not perfect mix and the music that has been spinning in our heads with the game off for less time than usual, make us understand that this final filing work has suffered a bit from the covid situation and from smartworking. Nothing that can ruin the general work anyway or that can't be fixed through updates. It should also be noted that this time, unfortunately, the usual and very exaggerated Italian dubbing will not be present, leaving room for the extraordinary original cast. For the rest Tiny Tina's Wonderlands is the usual riot of colors, bullets, loot and general madness and whoever still in love with this style could find some really high peaks for the series in this spin-off. If, on the contrary, you think that this new chapter can make you appreciate what it hasn't done for you up to now, then forget it. Despite the news we are always at Gearbox and, on closer inspection, we are really happy that it is. Beyond the countryside Then let's talk about what are the main mechanics once you reach level 40 and complete the adventure. In Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, the Guardian Ranks of Borderlands 3 have turned into Myth Ranks. Having reached the current cap at level 40, experience will continue to be accumulated and with each level advancement points will be acquired to spend on a sort of constellation, in turn connected to four new specializations: Druid, Archmage, Master of the Sword and Sniper.
