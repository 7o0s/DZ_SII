We have now played many of 4X and that of Kubat Software is apparently identical, or at least very similar, to many others. There are settlers who build cities and roads on the squares that make up the game map. There are more or less aggressive nations to conquer. There are goals to achieve. There are a large number of military units to train and manage. In short, there is an empire to grow and prosper. The tutorial, divided into basic and advanced, explains a lot but not quite everything. When you start to get serious, that is when you take control of the game, you realize that Aggressors: Ancient Rome has a whole series of underground systems which, especially by selecting the higher difficulty levels, make the games deeper than it appears at first glance. Get into the game Describing every single feature of Aggressors: Ancient Rome is frankly impossible. Consider that the manual alone, which can be consulted online, consists of more than 240 pages full of information and details. As the title suggests, Aggressors: Ancient Rome is set in the times of ancient Rome. By selecting the Mediterranean as a scenario (if desired, it is also possible to generate random maps and customize the game in various ways), we find ourselves at the time of Republican Rome, with still a large portion of Italy to conquer and many other European peoples to subjugate and annex to the future empire. Actually from here on we can play the game as we want, playing the population we prefer (among those existing at the time). The difficulty of the games varies according to the level chosen during creation and according to the civilization selected. For example, driving Rome simplifies life enormously, because you immediately have excellent territories and a large number of resources available. The same can be said of other large civilizations such as the Egyptian or the Greek one. Things start to get complicated when very small tribes are selected such as the Illyrian Ardiei or the Kingdom of Pontus, which require more effort to reach such dimensions as to worry other civilizations. Each population is distinguished by some cultural, military or economic characteristic. The characterization acts in particular on some of the deep systems of the game, i.e. on the morale of the troops or on that of the population, as well as on diplomacy. All of this doesn't reach the level of a Civilization VI, but it achieves the purpose of creating a certain variety, making it interesting to replay the title over and over again using different populations. Gameplay The combat system is apparently very simple, focused as it is on individual units and on being able to unite them in legions, so as to increase their attack and defense values. To fight, just move a military unit onto the square you want to attack, whether it is occupied by another troop, by an economic infrastructure (such as a quarry) or by a city. However, we soon realize that the troops respond to a whole series of requests that make them more interesting than expected to study and use. For example, units created in newly conquered cities are less motivated than those created in cities that have already been integrated into a territory for years, because they still feel the weight of the abuse suffered and of the defeat. Using them in battle can even prove counterproductive, due to the moral repercussions that their defeat would cause. If we want, it is from these details that the best of Aggressors: Ancient Rome emerges, emancipating it from the reference models of the genre. Behind the apparent simplicity of some mechanics, there is a complexity that other games dream of, especially on the side of military management. The foundations are those of a real wargame, with a large number of factors that come into play every time a move is made: attack strength, frequency of fights, battlefield, troop morale and many others. In truth, the same level of complexity can also be found in the management of the empire, which not only requires you to grow enormously to win, but also to know how to intervene effectively in every field. There are many factors to consider, such as the productive orientation and loyalty of the cities, the demographic growth of the empire, the economic production of the territories, and much more. There are also technologies to discover, selectable from the classic tree scheme, which give access to new units and structures. In general, every choice seems to produce tangible effects on the game, a sign of the excellent work done to balance the game system as a wholecomplex. The only really weak side of the entire production, cross and delight of many 4X, is that of diplomacy, which seems to suffer from the Civilization syndrome, with rulers who declare war on us apparently for no reason, even in the face of reports until the turn friendly at first and attempts at an agreement in their favor. Almost always of the games we found ourselves at war with practically everyone, even when we weren't particularly aggressive. Otherwise the artificial intelligence performs very well, especially in battle, and does not seem to enjoy the artificial advantages typical of other 4Xs.", "date": "2018-09-06", "grade": "8.5"}
