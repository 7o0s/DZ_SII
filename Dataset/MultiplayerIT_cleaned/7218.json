In Fez, that same feeling of disbelief is felt by the player through the eyes of little Gomez, a two-dimensional creature who is told that the world he lives in is actually made up of three dimensions. A round of camera and boom! What starts out as a simple 2D platformer turns into a powerful blend of exploration and puzzles. Two years after its debut on Xbox Live Arcade, and after seeing a port for PC, the game by Polytron Corporation finds a new home on Sony consoles, allowing owners of PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and Vita to appreciate what, for a reason or another, it was one of the iconic games of the recent indie scene. Now that you can take it with you, Fez has never been more enjoyable to play PSVita trophies The trophy list repeats the unlockable objectives already seen in previous versions. Many challenges are related to the discovery of rare artifacts and specific puzzles, but obviously to bring home the platinum it will be necessary to complete the game 100%, collecting not only all the cubes, but also all the collectible objects hidden between the various levels. Fezzes are cool It may be that five years passed from the announcement to the release, but already at the launch of the Xbox 360 version the mechanics of Fez had already been explored in other more or less known productions. The need to rotate the view of the world ninety degrees to discover new paths and solve puzzles through ingenious perspective games was an idea first seen in titles such as Super Paper Mario, Echochrome and the lesser known Crush. Unlike all the developers who arrived before, however, Phil Fish's team had managed to take that concept and build a cohesive and coherent world around it, where the 2D-3D mechanics did not concern sporadic puzzles or specific sections, but any object, building and character within each setting. In search of the fragments of matter and antimatter cubes, artifacts, keys, chests and treasure maps, each scenario turns and turns like a Rubik's cube in the player's hand. Platforms and climbing plants, when viewed from the right perspective, can combine to create a high wall to climb; a bomb detonated on one floor can be aligned with a door that was a moment ago on a floor far away, blowing it up and creating a new passage. But also the simple pleasure of entering a small house and discovering, by gradually rotating the camera, the small clues or simple embellishments that are hidden on each of the four walls. There are no enemies or fights, but the reason why Fez has fallen in love with so many people in the last couple of years is all to be found in the amount of secrets, events and things to discover the good old-fashioned way, racking their brains and collaborating with other players. In some cases it will be necessary to keep your eyes and ears open, in others it will be essential to be in the right place at the right time, even up to having to use the network to translate a Morse code or a smartphone to decipher a QR Code. Portable size Since the game has remained absolutely identical to the original from a content point of view, for completeness we refer you to our old review, focusing here on the few new features of this port. Cross-buy support allows you to have the game on all three Sony consoles at once, but 1080p makes the PlayStation 4 version the more aesthetically pleasing and defined one, although it may seem like a minor difference in a title blocky like Fez. The other additions are absolutely accessory, such as the ability to interact with the map by pressing and touching the touch pad, or the way in which the DualShock 4 light bar takes on the dominant color of the level, an aesthetic flourish that can only be appreciated if you play in the dark. Predictably the most interesting novelty is the possibility of playing Polytron's puzzle platform in total mobility, also strengthened by an additional save slot for cross-save. Being a huge box of little challenges and having neither a narrative to follow nor long sequences to undertake all make Fez an absolutely perfect experience for short sessions. With Spelunky, the Spaniards of BlitWorks had already demonstrated their ability to exploit the OLED screen of PlayStation Vita to further enhance the graphics of a port, and the adventure of the littleo Gomez is no exception. It's a shame that the two development teams didn't take advantage of the opportunity to redo some of the less successful aspects of the original, starting with the game world map. Although the use of the touch screen and the rear touch pad help to speed up navigation, the layout of the levels and the way this is represented means that you lose an inordinate amount of time before figuring out where to go. Furthermore, just like the PC version, on PlayStation Vita it was necessary to remedy those (fortunately rare) puzzles in which clues are received through the vibration of the controller: replacing them with audio clues is perhaps a more subtle solution and at the moment less easy to implement. interpret, but which fortunately takes full advantage of the console's two speakers. It being understood that the best solution remains the use of a good pair of headphones, with which to fully appreciate the excellent soundtrack of Disasterpeace, an explosive mixture of ambient and chiptune which, if on the one hand fits perfectly with the pixel art of the game, on the other hand it offers an almost zen experience.", "date": "2014-04-02", "grade": "9.0"}
