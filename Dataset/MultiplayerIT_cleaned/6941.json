If you have never heard of The Walking Dead video game, we advise you to read the review of the first episode of the second season. Finally, if you are one of those who can not tolerate revelations about the plot of a story, skip the review and read directly to the final comment. The Walking Dead is a narrative game that plays on the player's emotions and sense of involvement, so everyone gets a different experience. There are those who miss Lee from the first season, and those who fell in love with Clementine's evolution in the second. If we take the two seasons and look at them in perspective, however, we see that they actually make up a single narrative block. The real protagonist, now, seems to us to have always been Clementine. The fact that in the light of recent developments we look at the past in a different way, finding new meanings for the events already experienced, is a success of this second season, because it means that we have truly experienced the emotional and psychological evolution of a character within ourselves . We have grown, we have changed. Above all, as happens in life, we reinterpret what happened to us previously. This is also just one of the possible readings, we are aware of it, but that poignant flashback, brilliant in its unpredictability, convinced us that ours is a legitimate reading. Clementine has completed her journey, but as things turn out, whatever combination of choices she ultimately makes, a new path opens up for her. Now she finds herself in Lee's shoes: no longer a child to protect but an adult responsible for another life. Whether this story will remain in our imagination or not we do not know. Telltale will most likely want to continue on the road that has earned him a big and well-deserved commercial success, but it is said that Clementine will still be at the center of the narrative. In any case, something has been consumed to the core. If there are more stories of survivors in a world of zombies on the horizon, it will take something different to convince us to sit around the fire again and together empty a new bottle of rum. The ending closes with The Walking Dead's present and past, but leaves a door open to the future A stage for two When you talk about an episode before you've seen the season finale, you end up saying things that you sometimes have to take back. Like for example the whole tirade we made about Jane's sudden departure, which surprises us again in this episode. It was nice to see you again, but we felt a little cheated. His presence serves above all to the authors to have a character with which to force Clementine's hand, so much so that the reasons for his return seemed unlikely to us given how the character had developed. On the other hand, the whole cast of supporting actors suffers in this second season. There are so many voices and little time to listen to them, so it becomes difficult to bond with someone, and the deaths seem as distant from us as those told on the news. Has anyone ever thought about Sarita, or about Carlos's daughter, for example? Even when Luke dies, the characters seem unimpressed, but more for script needs than for a real insensitivity caused by too many traumas. This is mainly due to the fact that, once Kenny entered the scene, attention was focused on the relationship between him and Clementine. So there are these two very charismatic figures, and then all the others, who remove the disturbance when necessary. In any case, beyond the forcings, which become evident especially now that we know where the story was going with, No Going Back leaves us in the end the possibility of making important and irreversible decisions. So significant as to define once and for all who Clementine is. We have been asked in more than one episode to be patient following the tracks, but in the end we have been rewarded. What remains Of this second season we will certainly remember Clementine and Kenny, a poor wretch who desperately tries to put the pieces of himself back together. But we will also carry fragments of intimacy within us, and we didn't expect this. Horror yes, we have experienced it in video games, even fear, or suffering, but something as elusive and difficult to grasp as the moment in which two people open up to each other is perhaps an unexplored frontier Before. Probably the intimacy scenes are also the ones that made the story lose its rhythm, because although some slowdowns are needed to make the conf explodeLitto, Telltale has not always managed to elegantly stitch the sequences together, sometimes going on longer than necessary. These ups and downs are more present in this season than in the previous one, but we are convinced that Telltale has dared more in the second series. Also in the visual representation of violence. Instead, what has tired us are the now cloying passages in which we have to press a sequence of buttons to start a car, for example. Or even worse micro walks within a single screen to have a chat with all the characters, scattered in the four corners like nativity scene figurines. It seems like a paradox, but it's just when The Walking Dead tries to be more like a traditional video game that it stops working properly. This is to say that the road traveled by Telltale in recent years is the right one, but it cannot remain a straight line for long.", "date": "2014-08-30", "grade": "8.0"}
