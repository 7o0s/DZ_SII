Common sense would like people in difficulty to work together to save themselves, but in reality differences of character, fear, prejudices or, on the contrary, love can divide and favor all kinds of bickering. The result is that there is always a need to elect a leader, who will then have to demonstrate in every situation that he is capable of getting everyone to agree and take the most difficult decisions. Zafehouse: Diaries really puts us in the role of a leader called to lead a group in difficulty. And what difficulty: we are the only survivors (or so we believe) in a town overrun by zombies. As players we know that in seven days a helicopter will land somewhere and then leave immediately if there is no one waiting for it. However, the members of the group do not know this. Only by visiting the city buildings can they find clues about the place and time of the evacuation, as well as the indispensable transceiver. The purpose of Zafehouse: Diaries is therefore to arrive with at least one member of the group still alive at the place of evacuation. Unfortunately, the undertaking is difficult and you will compile several diaries before being able to write the end word on the last page. If the purpose is clear, how to reach it must be negotiated from time to time with the situations that happen to us. Zafehouse: Diaries is a text adventure, but with a turn-based mechanism underneath that makes us make all the decisions and then advance the time by an hour by clicking on the digital clock at the bottom right of the screen. An hour doesn't seem long but in those sixty minutes anything can happen. And rest assured that it will. Password: resist The game takes place on a randomly generated map showing explorable buildings and the goods they may contain. There are also five different markers on the map, one for each of the five survivors. To move a party member on the map simply move the marker and then pass the turn. But let's stay focused on our little group of runaways for now. Each of them has a past, usually limited to the type of profession and the social group to which they belong. His skills are also indicated: a policeman will be able to fortify the house, carry out a reconnaissance tour and fight, while a surgeon may be able to modify objects or build traps. Whatever the talent of the character is good to keep in mind along with his prejudices. There are those who hate a particular ethnic group and those who can't stand the rich, for example. The relationships between the characters are summarized in a relationship graph, one of the most important aspects of the game. If relations between some members of the group degenerate beyond a certain limit, expect them to kill each other or refuse to cooperate. The first thing to do then is to work towards uniting the group, a feat that first requires getting the right rumors around about less popular characters. This operation can be done once a day. In one case it was enough for us to let it be known that Joseph volunteered among less educated middle class members to endear him to the other members of the group, all of whom were middle class in that match. Another good idea is not to have people who don't love each other or whose skill level is too different to work with each other. If the person next to you does not know what they are doing, they become a hindrance rather than a help. The other enemies of the group are hunger and zombies. Hunger in particular is an ugly beast. Finding food supplies and cooking are activities that must take precedence over everything because people die of hunger in a few days here. An extreme choice, due more to the needs of the game than anything else, but we have to deal with it. Assigning a few of our men or women to search the building is a great way to find spare parts, weapons and food. With the spare parts some group members can let their creativity run wild. Give them an ax to modify and they will make it into an edged weapon capable of glowing in the dark. But beware that while they are doing their homework like good schoolchildren, the zombies outside attack the house without respite. If you have a lot of shots you can clear the outside with a shotgun or even send someone outside to watch the perimeter and set traps, but barricading the house is always the best solution. And in this case: will you run around causing a lot of noise and attracting more zombies or will you work on soundproofing the rooms? The choices depend on the situation and,as you may have understood, the complexity of the game is remarkable. However, you cannot remain closed where you are forever. Your food and ammo will run out before you know it. That's why it pays to send someone to explore new buildings. If you decide to move a marker, you must also decide what the corresponding character's task will be: carry out a first reconnaissance, raid or clean up the area. And you will also have to decide what equipment he will have to bring with him. Zafehouse: Diaries is a tough and ruthless game, sometimes even unfair. Expect to see your best plan go up in smoke after days of hard work at any moment. Sometimes a mistake is enough to bring down the house of cards of our certainties, other times it's bad luck to row against. On the other hand, in a game that randomly generates scenarios and events, you have to expect everything and above all enjoy the adventure, rather than insisting on the result. If you've played FTL: Faster Than Light you know what we're talking about. Alright, now that you know the basics, let's take a look at the diary. Ready Set Go! With patch v1.1.6. the developers have added Road Kill, a new game mode. In this case the match doesn't end after seven days because the objective is different. Instead of waiting for the helicopter to arrive, we'll have to find a means of transport and spare parts to fix it before escaping. Therefore the strategies to be adopted and the events change, as well as the reasons for tension between the characters of the group. Furthermore, the ending will depend on how we have behaved previously and above all on the type of supplies and equipment that we have loaded in the trunk. This patch shows that the developers are interested in supporting their game and that we may have more big surprises like this in the future. A story to be written and rewritten But what happens when we press on the clock and advance the time by an hour? At that moment the turn passes to the world around us and in the diary we see the result of our decisions appear in narrative form. That's also the only time we hear sound effects like shouts, moans, gunshots, or boards breaking. In some cases, a splash of blood on the pages of the diary informs us that a fight has taken place and that someone is injured. Apart from these small tricks, the graphics are reduced to the bare minimum and for this reason the photos of real people and places stand out. Even if the characters heal and eat themselves - as long as there are the objects to do so - the management of the inventory and commands is not very clear, especially at the beginning. A graphical interface could have been created to always have an eye on who does what and what resources the group has. From this point of view the developers have done a better job with the map and social relationships. Another problem, typical of these games, is the lack of the surprise effect that is felt after a few games. While there are many special events and an ever-changing map, sooner or later you will have seen all the events and played with all too similar groups. In fact, the characters can be musicians, workers or soldiers but in the end they are only able to do those three or four things and the reasons for hatred and intolerance always concern gender, ethnicity or social class. You will learn which are the right voices to spread and they will no longer reserve you so many surprises. Even the narration of events soon tends to repeat itself and the sense of already seen surpasses that of amazement. It is undeniable that Zafehouse: Diaries has a deep structure and offers moments of satisfaction, as well as tension, but to keep the interest high, many more possible combinations are needed than are available right now. It must be said that, just as a new game mode has been added, it is likely that the developers will expand the game with other events and new possibilities for interaction. But if you really want to get the most out of this title, you have to be among those who enjoy role-playing by filling the gaps with fantasy. If this is what you are looking for then know that you can save your diary, rewrite it and publish it online, and maybe use photos of your friends or buildings in the city where you live to create characters and maps in which to tell your story. Most of these possibilities will leave you indifferent, but those of you who love text adventures will find in Zafehouse: Diaries a neat and stimulating game.", "date": "2013-02-20", "grade": "7.5"}
