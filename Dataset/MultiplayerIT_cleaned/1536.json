We are talking about one of the best known role-playing games ever, at least in name even among those who keep away from the genre; which at the time proposed, with all the limitations of the time, an incredibly vast world, non-linear gameplay and remarkably charismatic characters. For these and other reasons, in recent months the announcement of its remastered by Square Enix has been greeted with joy by fans. From April 15, 2021 (i.e. tomorrow) Saga Frontier Remastered will be officially available on PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, PC and also on mobile devices (Android and iOS) at the price of 24.99 euros. Meanwhile, we have spent several hours in the company of more than half of his characters, and we are ready to tell you all the news. The story, or rather: the stories We usually dedicate the first paragraph of a review to the story, or plot or narrative world of the production in question: but in the case of Saga Frontier Remastered it is appropriate instead to speak of stories, in the plural. In fact, each player will choose his favorite character, after reading a few lines dedicated to his identity and his context, and from that moment on he will follow his narrative line within a game world that will adapt accordingly. while keeping its main places ~fixed~. Saga Frontier Remastered and its characters It follows that Saga Frontier Remastered has eight main storylines to offer: the original title actually had ~only~ seven, but the updated re-edition included another protagonist, Fuse, as well as some tweaks for another of the present we will talk about further on. Each story lasts a good number of hours, allows you to travel between many different worlds and places, as well as witness unique events. Consequently, it is clear that the longevity and replayability of the title still represent some of the main values of the production today. Even considering the fact that the New Game Plus mode will allow you to play again all over again (in short, you can ~ask for an encore~), with some changes. Saga Frontier Remastered: eight plots and stories From the point of view of the characteristics of the individual narrative lines, today one could easily make the mistake of judging them trivial or taken for granted. However, we must instead think, contextualizing the title, and think about how fresh and rich it could have already appeared in 1997. There are several interesting ideas: for example, you can play as the monster Riky, who to save his world from catastrophe undertakes a journey in search of nine magical rings; or of Blue, a very skilled wizard who will visit the various Regions to learn ever more complex and powerful spells, in order to eliminate forever his rival, his brother Rouge. These are just a few ideas, useful to give an idea: among the other characters you will also find a robot who has lost his memory, a minstrel involved in plots between secret organizations, a woman unjustly accused of the murder of her boyfriend, and much more. . Playstation 4 trophies As expected, Saga Frontier Remastered also brings a very substantial list of trophies to PlayStation 4, including the Platinum one. To get all of them you will have to play as the various protagonists, complete the respective narrative lines, including that of Fuse. It will take a while, but it's nothing impossible. The news of the remastered Clearly Saga Frontier Remastered will be purchased on PlayStation 4 (or elsewhere if desired) primarily by those who want to relive the same emotions as many years ago: this is a fact. But another fact consists instead in all the novelties of the case, with which Square Enix has embellished and embellished the re-edition in question. Initially they hadn't impressed us that much, also because the main revision (the purely graphic one) still leaves us with mixed sensations. In any case, it is advisable to start from here: namely from the fact that Saga Frontier Remastered is now usable in HD on any device. Saga Frontier Remastered: Party management is still very deep More relevant, in truth, are certainly other additions of a content type or technical modifications of various types. As for the unpublished material: now you can also play with the character Fuse, which thus brings the number of protagonists to eight; will not be available immediately, but you will have to satisfy dDetermine conditions by playing first with everyone else present. By playing Fuse, a special agent, you will experience events related to the seven main heroes of the franchise from a different perspective; the intention of the developers was certainly to add more variety without making everything trivial, and it was achieved. Incidentally, the story of Fuse was not improvised, but written by SaGa series director Akitoshi Kawazu and screenwriter Benny Matsuyama. Saga Frontier Remastered and its frantic battles You will also be pleased to know that the remastered has reintroduced some events and films related to the Asellus narrative line, which in the first edition had been cut due to the need for space. Furthermore, the new New Game Plus mode allows you to start playing again, bringing with you some materials already present in the first save (credits, skills, techniques, and inventory items). Separately, the many customizations and changes related to the game interface must be considered, which you can experience for yourself from the first seconds in the main menu. For example, you can alter the game speed inside and outside battle moments, doubling it; or in general you can triple the speed of movement of the protagonist as he moves between the different scenarios. Even the enemies, however, will move faster: and therefore avoiding them will be equally complex. Technical compartment Saga Frontier Remastered and its bosses Saga Frontier Remastered is, in fact, an updated reissue of the original title, not a true remake (that is, it has not been remade practically from scratch). This is perfectly evident in the technical sector of production, which shows fluctuating results. On the one hand, the ~old Saga Frontier~ was exactly like this: small, angular, with variously inspired backdrops, with all those two-dimensional avatars that moved on the screen. How to bring it back to the contemporary world, and in HD, without distorting it or even making it grotesque? It was decided to mainly update the models of the various protagonists: you will immediately notice that the characters (main and secondary) are the most well-finished elements on the screen; a good hand was also reserved for movies, pleasant and defined. The game environments, whether they are cities, caves, swamps or sewers, are not always equally well done. Some objects present, indeed, seem really grainy, and stand out strongly when compared with the others. On the other hand, the soundtrack is excellent, already excellent in its time and perfectly updated.", "date": "2021-04-14", "grade": "7.5"}
