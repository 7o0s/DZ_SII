The game is a managerial simulator in which we will have to build an oil industry from scratch and conquer all the world's markets. As soon as we have started it, we will be able to enjoy a really ugly introductory sequence, where the absurdity of the theme is only worse than its banality. Oh well, let's continue further... We will immediately be presented with a menu from which to choose whether to load a game or start a new one and, having chosen to start a game from scratch, we will be able to configure some game parameters. In truth, the available choices are rather limited and, very strangely, even the Options panel is missing. All this, it must be said, is offered in an extremely gratifying resolution of 640x480!! Oh well, sooner or later we'll find video options somewhere, right? No. Ok, let's keep the resolution low and continue... Like so many miniature Scrooges, we set fire to the pens of our Rockerduck.... Once a new game has been created, we will find ourselves in front of a planisphere from which we will be able to reach our business offices, scattered all over the world. The first thing to do will be to look for a good site to test the waters with prospecting. We will have a fair number of regions where we can build our wells and there will also be cities where we can make our branches flourish, recruit manpower and carry out research in specialized centers. We will soon be building our first oil well (...a no brainer, I would say...) and we will have to equip it to the max, being able to choose whether to buy each individual piece of machinery or rent it under a lease, furthermore we will have to hire staff, as well as a team of engineers and provide them with an adequate food supply. Like so many miniature Scrooges, we set fire to the pens of our Rockerduck.... Without going into too much detail, slowly we will be able to have oil stocks to sell to the main markets, chosen by following the fluctuations of the crude oil through a special window. Furthermore, it will also be possible to build refineries and, later, factories to transform oil into finished products: Petrol, Diesel and Machine oil. An interesting feature that this game has been equipped with is the mix between scientific research and city development. Basically, we will be able to build laboratories, in every city, in which to study new technologies that will allow us to obtain rather significant socio-economic improvements. And already, really socio-economic, given that in addition to being able to build our factories, we will also be able to supply the cities, which host our branches, with schools, hospitals, parks, and many other things. We will have a panel for each of them, through which we can monitor their ~state of health~ and decide which works to build. The game develops on different layers, from the top one, represented by the planisphere, to the one relating to the individual cities, passing through the section of the regions and your own office, from which you can manage the more purely financial part of our society. But we won't be the only Scrooge McDuck in the world, we will in fact be able to let the computer control many Rockerduck, who will be our natural adversaries. Therefore, the international chessboard fills up with challengers and the game will sometimes get very dirty, up to the point of mutual sabotage! When the pipes of our existence lose the oil of knowledge... Oil Tycoon is a title that leaks from many sides, starting with the unfortunate choice to give it such a low resolution. The weaknesses are many and, let's face it, decidedly decisive in the final judgment. First of all, there is no damn tutorial that introduces even the less experienced player to the very delicate world of oil companies. A number of important details are missing, which can even negatively affect the outcome of our game. For example, there is a lack of an account of events, a sort of diary that keeps track of all the things that happen, so as to be able to untangle many different but still important situations. It's awful to forget a well that has a broken drill bit, because it's not marked somewhere! And, again, when buying food, for the drilling teams, the cost of the food does not appear and the player is forced to proceed by intuition... There is no card that describes the technologies discovered nor one that illustrates what buildings became available. Also, it is difficult to navigate between menus, which are often poorly connected, and information rthey are difficult to find and organize. Not to mention a horrible localization, with painful translations that seem to have been made with low-end software, worse than those found on portals. When the pipes of our existence lose the oil of knowledge... The game itself is rather naive and the sequence of random events resembles that of Monopoly (the only thing missing is ~the coupons for your actions accrue...~). The evolution of society and the unfolding of the world oil scenario are rendered very roughly and there is no feeling of being faced with the natural consequence of one's actions. But is this game really that bad? When the pipes of our existence lose the oil of knowledge... In fact, the game also has strings to its bow. Management simulation is full of variables and there are many stages to follow, furthermore the possibility of entering individual markets with your own products is decidedly intriguing. The section dedicated to city management and the search for new technologies also intervenes to increase playability. In short, the game for domination of the markets is played out on several levels: to the tune of millions (of dollars, of course), based on popular favor and in the secret laboratories of the companies. I won't deny that, having accepted the shortcomings of this title, I managed for a while to get involved and even enjoy myself. But only for a while! As you have certainly understood, this Oil Tycoon is not that great, given its poor technical realization, and indeed I do not recommend it to anyone who loves managerial management and in general games with in-depth attention. In the end, it is a game that refers to the past, to those nave and moderately amusing titles that populated the cassettes of our various Commodores and Spectrums. And that's not a compliment. A necessary introduction... When this Oil Tycoon came into my hands, I believed it was a direct descendant of Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon that conquered audiences all over the world many years ago. Soon, however, my gaze fell on the name of the development team and the first surprise arrived, given that they are the Germans Blackstar, already authors of that sensational flop that is Hired Team. This certainly does not bode well, given that one of the reasons that led me to reject that title was the lack of creative ability shown by the authors, as well as the poor technical realization. For this reason, I have approached Oil Tycoon with a certain amount of skepticism. Do you want to know if my fears have been disregarded or not? Continue reading, then... By the way, the game is entirely in Italian... unfortunately...", "date": "2001-05-16", "grade": null}
