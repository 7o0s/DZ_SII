{"name": "MADiSON", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/madison-recensione-horror-avventura-grafica.html", "text": "First-person psychological horrors all have similar characteristics. Some have now entered the collective culture of the videogame medium, such as certain exploration dynamics, while others are less obvious, but still present. Let's say that in many cases it seems to be faced with forms of self-analysis by the authors, who pour into their games that dark side of the human being that hardly manages to surface in everyday life. For this reason, many exponents of the genre have a strong personal imprint, often almost authorial, even where they go to retrieve styles and stereotypes of all sorts. In this sense, MADiSON's review could almost turn into a session of psychoanalysis. Horror adventure MADiSON is more Monkey Island than Amnesia Let's immediately clarify a very important point: MADiSON is not from the parts of Amnesia and the like. Of course, the view is in first person, but the focus of the gameplay is above all on the puzzles, so much so that even the appearances of enemies, when they can kill the protagonist and are not mere scenographic elements, are managed as if they were puzzles to be solved. In this sense, the fact that it very much recalls P.T. in the atmospheres it is almost a blunder, because here we are more from the parts of Monkey Island (in a broad sense) than from those of a classic horror. The thing is very clear from the first sequence, in which the protagonist, called Luca, finds himself locked up in a room of what we will discover to be his grandparents' house, besieged by his father, who wants to harm him for some unclear reason, which will be revealed during the adventure. Looking around we must be able to find hidden objects, take advantage of interactions with others, such as a television that can be rotated to direct its light, then use an inventory object to escape to another area of the house where, always solving puzzles , we will get a Polaroid-like camera, therefore capable of instantly printing the photos taken, which will prove to be essential for the whole story. It is in fact the only tool with which we can look beyond the veil of reality, coming into contact with the world of the dead. The exploration and resolution of the puzzles are accompanied by all the samples of scenic effects that characterize the genre: the environments are dimly lit, with large areas of shadow that always seem to hide who knows what; disturbing noises of unknown origin can be heard everywhere. To make it all the more disturbing, there is the fact that reality and imagination often seem to overlap. So a flooded dungeon can turn into a nightmare full of red doors to open, or a visit to a ruined cathedral can become a way to travel through time. From this point of view, MADiSON is full of surprises. Puzzle Photography is central to the whole experience As we said, there are very few fights. Indeed, practically none, despite the fact that in the second half of the adventure (which lasts a total of about five / six hours based on the speed with which the puzzles are solved) unexpected enemies emerge, also well contextualized in the story. Let's say that, despite a few jumps in the chair, MADiSON aims more to be disturbing than scary in the classic sense. The player ends up digging into the past of Luca's family, discovering terrible facts that gradually lead to the ending. The narration is conducted by listening to audio tape recordings or by reading documents. There are no other human beings to interact with. Here comes one of the biggest problems of the game: the last part, the conclusive one, does not live up to the expectations created by the first. From a certain point on, you enter the realm of the predictable, which leads to an effective but questionable ending. The experience itself is engaging, but it's as if all of a sudden the inspiration is lost and the scene is stolen by clichs, so that you can guess the next facts without major problems, to the point where you are amazed that things go as they actually imagined. Moments at the P.T. There are However, it is the puzzles that make MADiSON engaging, which as already mentioned recall those of point and click adventures in terms of complexity, a fact that struck us, above all for the courage shown by the developers. After the first few minutes, in which it is easy to guess what to do, MADiSON becomes quite intricate, above all thanks to the intelligent use of the camera, which has been integrated perfectly into the gameplay, despite the developers' lack of knowledge of how it works (really c (who still believes that to develop instant photos you have to wave them?) What is it for, basicallyto? Initially mainly to reveal clues, but soon it will also take on other functions, such as that of traveling through time or activating certain passages. Sometimes it can also serve as a torch, i.e. you can use the flash to illuminate dark places, with the risk, however, of being faced with some not very pleasant images. Finally, a secondary activity of the game is linked to the camera, that of searching for collectibles, that is, red polaroids that are photographed to be collected. Graphics and problems These statues will recur often Technically MADiSON is a successful game. Visually it does not offer a particular style. As already mentioned, the atmosphere is completely governed by the lighting system, while the 3D objects of them are treated in a fairly standard way. However, everything makes it very good, in the sense that some environments are decidedly suggestive and there are tense moments, even in the absence of looming threats. If we want, the soundtrack has the same goal, dedicated as it is to harmonizing with the visual part to strengthen the player's tension, which grows a lot in the final part, where the jumps on the chair multiply. As you will have understood by reading up to here , MADiSON is not a perfect game. It certainly lets itself be played and is a must for horror lovers but, in addition to those already illustrated (disappointing final part, not very marked style and so on), it also has high structural defects that cannot be overlooked. Luca can only carry a limited number of items at a time (ten, after the last update, but we tested him with the limit set to eight) and can leave those he deems useless in safes scattered throughout the game. Some puzzles need to be studied Unfortunately MADiSON does not easily let us guess what might or might not be useful to us in the next sequence and sometimes we had to go back to get objects in the safe that we absolutely needed. We understand wanting to imitate a Resident Evil-esque inventory, but Capcom's is a game so different in its setting (it's a survival horror) that the small inventory takes on a whole different meaning, while here it's just a nuisance, since it doesn't there are survival mechanics that create the same sense of oppression and anguish. Furthermore, there are objects that can never be removed and that occupy a fixed slot, such as the camera or Luca's diary, which limits even more what you can carry around. Another problem is how interactive objects are underlined. That is, how they are not underlined. They are usually easily identifiable, also because one tends to look at all corners (the overall map is not very large), but sometimes it happens that they are difficult to see, despite being accompanied by icons. Overall, MADiSON's inventory management could have been done better. It's not disastrous, this really isn't, but certain passages could have been avoided, which were counterproductive for the experience.", "date": "2022-07-15", "grade": "7.8"}
