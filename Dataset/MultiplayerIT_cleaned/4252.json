{"name": "Suicide Guy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/199384-suicide-guy-suicide-guy-la-recensione-per-switch.html", "text": "First-person view, puzzles to solve and a protagonist we know practically nothing about: we have already found titles of this kind in our hands, and above all when they are made with an extremely limited number of resources available, hope is always that beyond the appearance, beyond rusty mechanics, somewhere there is a good idea. A good idea doesn't save a bad game, mind you, but it shows that there can always be something positive to look for. This is how it went with Suicide Guy: there is a good idea... and little else, certainly apart from the desire to always look for fresh and original situations, winking at a large number of different media. Oh, and there's a very likable protagonist as well. We spent a few hours in the company of his hero laptop, and between ups and downs he made us smile more than once. What are you doing today? I die Suicide Guy is a very curious product, just like the title itself is particular: appearances, however, are deceiving, and never as in this case, since it is not a game that wants to instigate mass suicide. The title instead underlines the basic mechanics of the small creation of Chubby Pixel and Fabio Ferrara, which in fact also constitutes the only true winning and original element of the production: to ~win~ in Suicide Guy we must actually ~lose~. Don't be confused, after the first two levels of the game the question actually becomes very intuitive: the protagonist of Suicide Guy is a funny fat man who recalls Homer Simpson beyond a reasonable doubt, stranded on his sofa and completely absorbed in devouring anything edible in the nearby, of course with the trusty bottle of cheap beer by his side. The problem is that the protagonist is also particularly inclined to fall asleep, thus remaining locked up in dreams from which he can no longer wake up: to return to our world he must first find a way to die in the dream. And here is the mystery: to complete each level of Suicide Guy requires the player to find a way to die, to ~lose~ in the usual sense of the term. Our task is to guide the fat man through the 25 levels of the main adventure, all different, all conceptually separated from each other, each time facing the situation conceived by the developers. Each game level has a modest extension, and does not actually provide more than one way to die: usually there is a particular object to find or a specific action to perform, which can be more or less clear from the very first steps in the dream, we have the task of being able to set up the suicide plan. And here more than one word can be spent to underline how not only the basic idea is nice, but also how original some situations thought up by the developers in the different levels are: it is difficult for the same idea to be repeated more than a couple of times , and themes and contexts are the most diverse. The quotations and references to other products that are different from time to time are also valid: in Suicide Guy there is space (but with due continuity) for a novel like Moby Dick, a level of Super Mario in 3D, the improbable and deformed monster of Frankenstein, Portal and many other names known to the more or less specialized public. The two strong points of Suicide Guy are exactly these: an original basic mechanic and the rampant quotationism that invests everything and everyone. The grace of an elephant Our protagonist is the last person in the world you would invite to a cultural event, but if you think about it, you wouldn't even take him with you for a walk: among the actions he is able to perform, jumps, punches and burps stand out. He's definitely not a bad person, but not even one with good manners, however there is one important detail: if he moves so awkwardly, if he's so awkward, if he can't jump onto a platform so often without falling, perhaps it is also partly the fault of a control system and game physics that seem far from complete and finished. The grace of the elephant is not only that of the protagonist, but of the entire production: it is a bit all Suicide Guy to be like this, to show itself a title perhaps complete in content, but a little lacking in many other points of view, also if we must remember that it is a product designed to be light from the outset as well as inexpensive (the price is around five euros on PC, which becomes eight on Nintendo Switch). And that's how we encountered during our crazy death-seeking sessions some little problems: hooking to elevated platforms doesn't always work, grabbing an object always meanshappy to watch it levitate in front of our face, the interaction between a key and a trunk is something between the magical and the supernatural (they fly, they fit together, somehow they collaborate). They are certainly not factors that can ruin the gaming experience too much: from the beginning Suicide Guy makes players understand his awkward and not very graceful nature, but it is precisely this aspect that wants to make gameplay fun at times improbable, and even more believable a protagonist who manages to seem everything except the hero of the situation. The puzzles proposed in the various levels oscillate between the interesting, the ingenious and the banal, as if some had received much more attention than others: in most cases, either the solution is immediately intuitive, or there really is racking your brains ; and among the obstacles to complete the mission you still have to deal with the game physics, at times truly bordering on frustrating, but not so much as to ruin what ultimately turns out to be a light and suitable experience for everyone.", "date": "2018-05-18", "grade": "6.5"}
