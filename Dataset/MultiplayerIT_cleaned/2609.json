{"name": "ISS Pro Evolution 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/iss-pro-evolution-2_a.html", "text": "In a country where football is talked about on television 24 hours a day, where one's team becomes the most important thing after the mother and the girl, where a penalty that is not awarded or a phantom goal is made a matter of state ... only in Italy a game like ISS Pro Evolution 2 could have aroused so much interest. A little history doesn't hurt... The modern era of football games begins in the mid-90s with FIFA International Soccer, produced by EA Sports (a brand that was not yet well known at the time), which brought about a revolution in the field of video games. Finally, exploiting the potential of the then very powerful 16-bit consoles (Sega Mega Drive and Super Nintendo), it was possible to recreate the emotions of a real football match. The introduction of the isometric view gave the game a certain three-dimensionality, however illusory, and the sensation of actually being on the playing field was very strong. The realism of the actions made one cry for a miracle, but only now can we say that it was probably our imagination that made everything seem so real. How much time, and how many technological generations, have passed since then. We've gone from 16 to 128 bit, and football simulations have evolved as technology has advanced. The search for the definitive game hasn't ended yet, although more than once the legendary Konami (no longer EA Sports) has shown that it has the key that can open the doors to the perfect simulation of reality. Over the years, the various editions of Winning Eleven (ISS Pro in Europe) have followed one another on PlayStation which, year after year, have breached the hearts of millions of gamers, often annihilating the competition. Konami tries again Whether you liked it or not, I couldn't help but perform in a historical re-enactment, useful for introducing ISS Pro Evolution 2, a new version of the most famous console football game ever. At the end of the spectacular introduction (the same as Winning Eleven 5 for PS2), you immediately find yourself in the button room, the classic initial menu of the game that faithfully reflects the appearance of the previous edition. Friendly, penalty contest, all-star challenge immediately throw us in the middle of the field, and these are the modes that can be used especially with friends. Also available, as in the past, are a series of international competitions capable of giving us the excitement and spectacle of the most important football events. The greatest challenge of the game, however, is the Master League which brings together 24 (no longer 16) of the most prestigious teams in the world, involved in a championship, divided into two leagues (series A and B). Whether you choose Turin (Juventus), Milan (Milan) or London (Arsenal), you will have to start the season with players of the caliber of Miranda, Castello and Valey who, however, you will be able to support much more famous champions by resorting to the classic transfer market. In short, with its numerous competitions ISS Pro Evolution 2 will keep you busy for a long time. Kick off The thousands of games played at ISS Pro Evolution have left their mark. Believing that no appreciable improvements could be made to KCET's already perfect game, I greeted the newcomer with some coldness. After playing it for half an hour, I came to the conclusion (very wrong) that there hadn't been any substantial changes to the gameplay. To realize my mistake, I had to play the two titles almost in parallel. The thing that immediately catches the eye is that the speed of play has certainly decreased, and this influences the development of the actions that develop with less frenzy due to the reduced speed of the passes. We realize later that the slower speed helps to increase the realism of the game. We have more time to think, to plan action, to apply a tactic or even just to catch our breath. This does not make the task less difficult. The computer-controlled teams prove to be even more difficult than in the past, being able to count on more reliable and present goalkeepers (some of their outings are memorable). Luckily the defenses, while certainly not reaching the levels of an oratory team, prove to be more ~dancers~ and less effective in closing. So it will often happen to speed away at the opposing full-back, or to dribble past two defenders in the space of a few metres. Shots, crosses and passes use vastly improved ball physics compared to ISS Pro Evolution. Directing the magical ball towards the opponent's goal, or being able to catch one of our teammates in the opponent's area, is certainly not child's play, but the gratification that comes from making an effective play repays us for every effort. Added to this is that it often happens to perform real circus acts. Scissors, dives, shots from the ground are the most spectacular way to conclude an offensive action, and you will find that it will be quite simple to use them. A small note can be made to the management of free kicks, which often lacks a bit of precision. Nobody's perfect... W Bulgarelli! Visually we are at the limits of the PSOne's capabilities. More and more detailed players and with numerous animations (some new), almost perfect stadiums, push the processor of the poor 32-bit console almost to exhaustion. Even more often than in the past, the most frantic actions will be accompanied by the now faithful slowdowns, which in any case do not bother the continuation of the actions too much. The audio department has also undergone a slight improvement. The music, certainly not from the Gramy Awards, is less annoying than in the past and almost manages to make us forget the now classic third-rate commentary, which will accompany our every play with traditional incompetence. I hate to admit it, but Bulgarelli and Caputi are from another planet! Triple final whistle Now is the time for the post-game comments. There's no need to mince words... we're facing yet another Konami-branded masterpiece, once again able to replace the previous version, improving its overall quality. I'm almost sorry that I can't claim that it's the best soccer game on the market. With a title like Winning Eleven 5 on PS2 it's hard to compete. However, ISS Pro Evolution remains an obligatory purchase for all PSOne owners and for those who do not yet know that WE5 will arrive in the PS2 Pal version only in the autumn. Pros: Almost better than real football! You'll play until the joypad wears out Cons: Annoying commentary", "date": "2001-04-10", "grade": null}
