We begin to draw from the foundations and then gradually we go up, giving shape to the load-bearing structure and carefully choosing the materials that will go to make it up. Everything must be studied in detail, you must respect the laws in force on safety and try not to make any mistakes. But what happens when for some reason the building has to be demolished? Anyone who believes you can proceed at random, throwing yourself with a wrecking ball on the walls of the building to be destroyed or placing a huge explosive charge on it, is very wrong. Just as the construction of a building passes from paper to reality, subject to strict rules, in the same way its demolition arises first of all from a project. What are the pillars? In which points must you act to obtain a complete collapse using the least possible impact force? Boom! The gameplay of Implode! it is based precisely on these elements: pillars, weak points, controlled collapse. Our aim in the game is to demolish the building present in each of the sixty stages available (divided into various zones and unlockable as we successfully complete them) through the use of a limited number of explosive charges. These come in the form of sticks or (after a few stages) barrels of dynamite, which must be placed in strategic points of the building in the hope that their detonation will cause the complete destruction of the building within the terms that we must respect each time. Terms that manifest themselves in the form of a limit to the maximum height for the rubble that remains at the end of the operation (represented on the screen by a dashed line), as well as areas that absolutely must not be touched by the debris. The game interface allows us to do our experiments with great peace of mind and possibly restart the stage from scratch, in case wrong choices have been made. When the job is done, the goodness of our performance is evaluated on the basis of the number of charges used and the presence of sections of the building still intact. It is therefore clear that using a single stick of dynamite can help us obtain higher scores, and in the same way determining the exact point in which to place it to obtain the desired result soon turns into a real art made of intuition, coup d eye and a bit of luck. Demolition crew To create the graphics of Implode!, the developers of IUGO have taken a very particular approach, representing the playing area in the form of a green board and drawing buildings on it as if using chalk. The impression is therefore that of being faced with a real project, whose components at the moment of the explosion, however, behave following the dictates of a very complex and convincing physical environment, which we can exploit to our advantage if we wish ( for example by placing a charge at the end of a beam, which will shoot off and push the opposite wall, etc.). The two types of explosives at our disposal are characterized by very different behaviour: the sticks tend to disintegrate the portion of the building on which they are placed, emitting a shock wave of negligible power; barrels, on the other hand, see their strong point precisely in the shock wave, and allow us to demolish a large building even in a single blow, once the best possible location has been identified. The positioning of the charges by touch is unfortunately a bit awkward and cumbersome, however: we hope it can be remedied with one of the next updates. The sound accompanies the action in a very essential way, without disturbing. The tested version is 1.5.0 App Store links", "date": "2010-03-10", "grade": "8.0"}
