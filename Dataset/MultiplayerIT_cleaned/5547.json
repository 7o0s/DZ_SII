On the other hand, life puts you to the test when you least expect it, and for some mysterious reason Fate decided to play a strange trick on our hero, sending him without too many explanations into a sort of dark dimension where, suddenly and for the first time, Kobe's primary concern became simply immediate survival. Go and trust the old men who offer you a candy, as it is well known, these can actually be vehicles to transport us inside bizarre dark dimensions. However, from a disturbing and desperate situation a great adventure can be born if you have the right predisposition, particularly if you demonstrate a remarkable propensity for melee combat, exactly like the quiet Mr. Kobe. This is how the story of Survive Mr. CUBE! starts and without many explanations, a strange hybrid between twin-stick shooter, brawler and RPG that sees us essentially intent on surviving against waves and waves of overwhelming enemies within levels similar to arenas. The mechanics are therefore well known and the general setting as well, but there is a certain balance in the union of the parts that characterizes Survive Mr. CUBE! although it is certainly not an original product. The excellent gloomy yet stylized and cubed atmosphere in the style of Crossy Road but with a truly unique touch helps to put together a particular experience, even if not without its flaws. Never accept candy from strangers - Survive protagonist Mr. CUBE! do you know something... Under the guise of loot The aim of the game is therefore to survive within progressive levels made up of closed arenas and characterized by different settings (all rather obscure), trying to achieve the set objectives and open the portals that appear at the end of each challenge. All supported by the classic mechanism of accumulation of money and bonuses, according to the indestructible theory of loot as the engine of the gaming world. Indeed, the naturalness with which objectives are achieved and money is earned pushes us to move forward level after level, despite the gameplay being somewhat spartan, while the evolution of the character supports the game over a longer term, returning a good feeling of progression. In the heart of the action we simply find ourselves eliminating hordes of enemies according to the classic twin-stick style dynamic, only in this case we are dealing with melee attacks with various edged weapons. The enemies come in different varieties but the attack patterns are practically always the same, with the hordes trying to surround us from different directions and a certain alternation between melee and ranged attacks, basically representing the classic herds of cannon fodder. The two-finger control system is fast and reactive but not always precise in the rotation of the character and also given the difficulty that often emerges in understanding which way the protagonist is facing this can represent a problem, given the importance of hitting frontally and not to get attacked from behind. On the other hand, the camp that can be reached between one dungeon and another represents the other fundamental element of the game, or rather the care of the fighter with the possibility of purchasing weapons and equipment and the evolution in skills and attack capabilities and defence. Being a free-to-play, it is clear that Survive Mr. CUBE! you also try to stimulate the purchase of in-game currency with real money, but in most cases the balancing of the difficulty allows you to continue even without spending, although once you reach a certain level the ~grind~ manifests itself with the usual importance if you don't want to succumb to in-app purchases.", "date": "2016-04-27", "grade": "7.5"}
