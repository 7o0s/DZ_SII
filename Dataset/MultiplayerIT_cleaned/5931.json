Before leaving us to wait, he obviously recommends not touching anything; but will we be able to resist the temptation of that inviting red button? Please, Don't Touch Anything is a very special product, there is no doubt about that. In fact, we are not talking about an adventure, nor a puzzle game properly speaking, but rather an experience that draws liberally from pixel art graphics and chiptune-style music to catapult us into another era, just us and that damn button. What will happen if we press it? And what will happen, however, if we follow the recommendations of our friend and we are still and good to wait? In reality, this is also one of the possible options and leads to one of the ~good~ endings of the game, with a view to a shortlist that includes various conclusions, some catastrophic and some less so, some surprising and others ... even more. Please, Don't Touch Anything offers an original experience, but with many limitations and an excessive price Come on, tap here The red button, we said. Pressing it once brings up a second control panel with Roman numerals, pressing it again repeatedly opens drawers from which a screwdriver and a hammer can be removed, to be used for example on the console itself or on the monitor which, in the background, shows an unsuspecting city of the possible nefarious fate that could befall its buildings. If a countdown starts, there's little you can do: a huge explosion will sweep everything we see on the screen, and at that point we can't do anything but touch the ~restart~ button and start over, trying our luck with new combinations and drawing inspiration only in a very limited way from the textual indications present in the room. In short, we are talking about a pure trial & error, which invites us to experiment continuously to find a viable path and a possible ending every time. Each epilogue collected will decorate the wall with ~souvenir photos~, in a sort of archaic achievement system. What works well about the Please, Don't Touch Anything formula? Certainly its originality, a significant factor in the current videogame panorama, and the fact that it offers a different experience than usual, to be enjoyed for what it can give back in terms of visual and auditory sensations. The counterpart is represented by a graphical interface that does not marry touch commands perfectly, starting from the mouse of the original version: there are honestly too small buttons, and pressing them can prove difficult. But above all to turn up their noses is the limitation of the gameplay, which in the end is nothing but a codified sequence to be guessed, albeit in its various forms, through simple trials and errors. A concept that is based on trivial IF and THEN, with small animations that start depending on the path taken: a little too little for a price that is accessible on PC, but which on the App Store characterizes premium productions.", "date": "2015-10-29", "grade": "6.5"}
