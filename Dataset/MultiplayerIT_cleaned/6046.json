Unfortunately, the language barrier and the shortage of this type of product on consoles are elements that have contributed to its poor diffusion in the West, where the genre sees many valid exponents on PC. Nobunaga's Ambition: Sphere of Influence therefore arrived with great surprise on PlayStation 4, while - unfortunately - it is not surprising how much it has been adapted on the platform. The learning curve is unfortunately extremely steep and it doesn't even help the historical setting of the Sengoku period, full of charm, yes, but able to capture the maximum interest only from fans of Japanese culture. The coup de grace comes from the total absence of Italian localization: the title is completely in English, both in terms of text and dubbing, but with the possibility, for the diehards, to set the audio in Japanese. The result is that little or no margin remains for new fans: the title is strictly for a precise niche of users, who know what we are talking about. Apart from this, which is no small thing, Nobunaga's Ambition: Sphere of Influence remains a production of high and undoubted quality. Nobunaga's Ambition: Sphere of Influence is a complex but rewarding title All mine the city The game tries to break the ice by proposing a long tutorial phase that tries to be as didactic as possible. In this ~prologue~ we play the role of a young lord, Hideyoshi Kinoshita, engaged in managing a small provincial agglomeration under the guidance of an expert mentor, Masahide Hirate. However, even in this way it is not possible to facilitate a simplified approach to the game mechanics: the descriptions are innumerable and are lost in an infinite number of menus and texts, not always easily readable on a television, exacerbated by an extremely slow pace and various activities collateral and interconnected, which risk making the player instantly lose the logical thread. The lack of even one piece can prove problematic in understanding the whole picture. Here Tecmo Koei has some responsibilities, as a minimum could have been worked to make the console version more accessible; in essence we are faced with a typical PC title in all respects, starting from the configuration menus. Returning to our budding leader, we have to manage the small daily practices of our village, quickly reporting the expenses and operations carried out to the council. In this preliminary phase you learn how to manage the available resources, carry out jobs and make agreements with other clans, all through a series of menus located on the left side of the screen: these also manage the passage of time, which can be stopped at any time. moment, entering pause. However, it is necessary to close the cycle to enter the next ~loop~, which always begins with the board meeting. To be clear, the pause phase is used to make all the strategic decisions of the case, while the real-time one puts into practice the effects on the map of what we have established. A phase of pure administration is then replaced by that of fighting, where we have to manage the troops and unfortunately witness the effects of the opposing ones. As mentioned, it will be helpful to create a network of alliances to increase one's offensive and expansion power, however bearing in mind that not everyone is well disposed towards us, even if impeccable work in diplomatic operations could make the difference. Playstation 4 trophies Nobunaga's Ambition: Sphere of Influence features 39 Trophies, some will come naturally by conquering the first achievements, such as building our first fortress or winning the first battle. Others are more complex, like earning all the various possible endings. Good luck! My Japan From a technical point of view, Nobunaga's Ambition: Sphere of Influence is a production that points to the practical side. The turn-based grand strategy genre does not require particularly complex graphic design, but in its small way Koei Tecmo has included details which, while certainly not putting the PlayStation 4 hardware under pressure, are appreciable. You can rotate and zoom on the polygonal scenario, an environment that is enhanced by a pleasant cloud management system, with their shadow projecting dynamically on the map creating a realistic effect. The textures and frame rate are also good, at sixty framesammi per second, albeit with some decline. The orchestral music, on the other hand, is excellent, perhaps more suitable for a medieval fantasy setting rather than sixteenth-century Japan, but manages to create the right feeling for a very sophisticated product. Nobunaga's Ambition: Sphere of Influence is a complex and hermetic mosaic, which requires attention and dedication from the player, much more than the average of the products we are usually used to playing on consoles. What must be pointed out, however, is the satisfaction obtained after fully understanding its mechanics, capable of repaying all the time invested to assimilate them with interest. The freedom granted to the player is almost total, as are the possible evolutions of the scenario; the expansion of our empire is always linked to our actions. The reverse of the medal is finding the constancy and interest to overcome the barrier set by the title by those who are not accustomed to the genre: it is true that it is possible to entrust the entire management of the clan to artificial intelligence, but in this way one becomes a mere spectator, also precluding the conquest of various trophies.", "date": "2015-09-12", "grade": "8.0"}
