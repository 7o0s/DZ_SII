{"name": "Collection of SaGa Final Fantasy Legend", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/collection-of-saga-final-fantasy-legend-recensione.html", "text": "Curious fate, that of SaGa: the first title, dating back to 1989, was designed for Game Boy by Akitoshi Kawazu to become an alternative to Final Fantasy. The series was supposed to launch Square's JRPGs on the Nintendo portable console with a more demanding and characteristic branching that was supposed to attract a more savvy and demanding audience. Nintendo, however, changed the title to The Final Fantasy Legend of the American release to ride the success of the other brand, effectively alienating all those enthusiasts who thought of buying a new Final Fantasy and found themselves in their hands something very different. Oh, well, not that it made much difference to us: the first three SaGas in Europe never arrived and the series hit our shelves like eleven years and six titles later. The review of Collection of SaGa Final Fantasy Legend talks about a project that fills this chasm, guaranteeing fans of the genre the opportunity to get to know these lost JRPGs. Was it worth waiting all this time? The origins of the SaGa We can imagine the amazement of those players who, many years ago, bought Makai Toshi SaGa thinking it looked like Final Fantasy only because the Square logo dominated the packaging and the title had changed to The Final Fantasy Legend. In reality, Kawazu's first title shares only the composer, Nobuo Uematsu, with the real Final Fantasy, while the gameplay is more similar to Dragon Quest or Shin Megami Tensei, with enemies appearing on the screen as if the player were watching them in first person. Even the structure has little in common with the first two Final Fantasy released in those years: it is much less linear and the story must be reconstructed by talking to the NPCs, as there is no real direction. By connecting the dots, we discover that the four characters that make up the party - the first chosen at the beginning from a variety of racial options and the others recruited from the guilds - are trying to ascend a tower that is said to lead to heaven, coming across various worlds during the climb, each with its own problems, presided over by a very powerful boss. The grind is important and the turn-based combat system focuses on random encounters that follow each other with great frequency. Each race represents a kind of class that gives them unique abilities: humans gradually learn different skills and can equip a greater number of items, mutants learn spells almost completely at random, monsters can devour the flesh of defeated enemies and evolve or involute accordingly. Unfortunately, the game explains almost nothing about the gameplay, as was often the case with 80s titles, and without a handy guide you risk getting stuck all too often. Luckily the adventure isn't particularly long, and a lot depends on how good you grind and are in combat as the mechanics include a sort of permanent death for characters who are defeated a certain number of times in battle and therefore have to be replaced by new recruits. Final Fantasy Legend II is very similar to its predecessor: Kawazu also directs this episode, marching on the characteristics of the original even if filing some angularities of the gameplay, such as the durability of the weapons. A little longer but certainly more challenging than the first, SaGa 2 sees us once again engaged in exploring different worlds in search of MAGI, artifacts that are said to confer extraordinary powers. The narrative focuses more on the protagonist and some supporting actors, slightly more characterized than those of the previous title, but oscillates between fantasy and sci-fi all the time, making a clear turn on the ending that already orients the franchise in the direction very specific that almost all subsequent chapters will follow. Of the three titles in the compilation, Final Fantasy Legend II is perhaps the most iconic for this very reason, representing a real improvement on the formula attempted the year before. Kawazu - engaged on Romancing SaGa for SNES / Famicom - does not direct the third episode, delivered instead in the hands of Kouzi Ide, and perhaps it is for this reason that we are faced with a much more derivative title and similar to Final Fantasy. The story sees us once again in control of a party of four characters, committed to fighting a very powerful entity that is endangering different worlds and eras: Final Fantasy Legend III introduces the concept of time travel, faced aboard the Talon, a sort of spaceship that we will have to upgrade during the adventure to reach new destinations. On the gameplay front, the title dated 1991 proposes the mechanics of the previous ones in modo clearer and more accessible: above all, there is greater control over the growth of the characters, who initially can only be humans or mutants and change into beasts, monsters, cyborgs and robots by consuming specific objects. The Switch version The three SaGa that make up this Collection of SaGa Final Fantasy Legend are extremely old JRPGs, the prototypes of a series that has never been particularly popular and that, even after occasionally landing in our area, has carved out a tiny slice of fans. In an attempt to distance himself from Final Fantasy, well before that name was chosen for the American release, the creator of SaGa opted for divisive solutions that would have anticipated the experiments of the following years, especially today's ones. However, this does not make the three SaGa cutting-edge titles, but rather immature role-playing games that demonstrate all the limitations of the hardware and the times in which they were released. If Uematsu's music - but also that of Ryuji Sasai in the third episode - still remains among the best of the time today, the three Square titles lack the details and care placed by the developer himself and many others in the best Game Boy software. Beyond the value that can be given to a technical sector of over thirty years ago, which is then very personal and brings into play the nostalgia effect like few other things in the world, it must be said that Square has not wasted much more in the making of this Collection. It would have been nice to find the remakes for mobile systems and Nintendo DS, together with the three original titles, and maybe some extras in the form of trailers or important illustrations. No, the compilation only guarantees above all the possibility of accelerating the gameplay - but not the music playback, fortunately - to speed up the more tedious moments of the experience, such as exploration or grind. In this respect, we must say that we were positively impressed by the nice solution that allows you to narrow the game screen to respect the original resolution, customizing the Switch touch interface to transform the tablet into a real virtual Game Boy: a found ingenious that we hope to see again in the next compilations.", "date": "2021-01-14", "grade": "6.0"}
