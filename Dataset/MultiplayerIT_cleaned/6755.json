{"name": "This War of Mine", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/140739-this-war-of-mine-sopravvissuti-e-sopravviventi.html", "text": "After trying This War of Mine exactly one month ago, with a beta containing the first ten days of the story and a limited series of locations that can be visited, here we are grappling with the definitive version of the game, which also boasts an Italian translation for the texts on screen (with a few glitches here and there, however). We have already talked about the talent of 11 bit studios in the field of strategy (they are the authors of the excellent ~tower offense~ Anomaly series) and how brave the choice of the Polish team was to try their hand at a difficult genre such as that of survival games. We hoped that the skill of the developers and their ability to introduce innovative ideas could somehow offer a different perspective with respect to this particular videogame vein, marred by intrinsic limitations such as the repetitiveness of the action. In fact, in survival games, once you reach game over, you start all over again and you have to basically do the same things, follow the same progression and hope to get further, perhaps by unlocking new objects and experimenting with new situations. Well, there has been a change of perspective, but only in terms of narration and realism of the experience. This War of Mine really puts us in the shoes of a group of survivors barricaded in an abandoned house, within a city suddenly placed under siege; and, likewise, it requires us to satisfy the needs of each character, be it tiredness, hunger, physical or mental discomfort. There is no doubt that such a cruelly realistic product could be the classic ~punch in the stomach~ and raise awareness of certain issues. What we asked ourselves during our games is whether a setting of this type could also be fun to play, discovering that the answer to this question is not so obvious. This War of Mine is a gritty and realistic survival game, capable of delivering a message loud and clear Day and night The gameplay of This War of Mine is divided into two phases: day and night. During the day we will have the time and tranquility to satisfy the needs of the characters, keep them up by making them talk (a feature that was not present in the beta) and use the objects found around to build various types of tools and appliances, from the most simple to more complex ones. Generally the first things that need to be created are a shovel and a bar, essential for clearing any rubble that obstructs the path to a searchable area or for breaking into cabinets or locks; after which you can move on to making a bed (resting well is one of the things that should not be underestimated), a stove (to cook food that would otherwise be eaten raw) and, further on, white or firearms, to be kept in house against possible thieves or to take with you during the night search sections. So we come to the night, the moment in which we will have to decide which of the characters will go around looking for resources and which, instead, will remain to defend the house from possible intrusions or will enjoy some sleep. Always having in front of the specific conditions of each survivor, which highlight problems such as tiredness, hunger and the presence of injuries or illnesses, as well as the capacity of the backpack, it is quite simple to understand who will have to do what. Sure, it's one thing to leave with the intention of stealing canned meat, medicines and crafting components, quite another to actually return home alive and with the desired material. Realism, remember? The system works using a simple and intuitive control system, based on the mouse alone: one click on the characters to select them, another one for them to reach a specific point on the map or interact with an object, a double click for them to run. Dragging the pointer also scrolls the screen, while the wheel zooms in or out. In the lower part of the screen there are also the files of each character, which are updated with a sort of diary that reveals their immediate thoughts and reflections on what is happening. Inexorably The adventure always begins in the same way, with three characters inside a house whose objects are arranged randomly. The random placement is necessary to change the cards on the table at least from game to game, given that the first thing to do is to look in the building for the resources to be used to build objects, fill the medicine cabinet and maybe put something underneath teeth. Always during the day it can happen that someone comes knocking on our door, offering a barter or asking for our help for a more or less difficult mission.and (extracting someone from the rubble, transporting an injured person, etc.) which will commit one of the team members for a day but at the same time involve a real risk: the person we send may not even return. It may even happen that someone shows up looking for shelter, and there it will be necessary to decide whether or not to welcome a new mouth to feed. All decisions that will be ~thrown in our face~ at game over, tracing the lines of positive or negative conduct, but which in the end will not influence subsequent experiences in any way, simply acting as a ~diary~ which, once again , will make us understand the horrors of war and what people are forced to do in such situations. The time available during the day can be reset at any time to switch to the night phase, which is naturally the busiest and in which stealth mechanics based above all on the perception of noise are put into practice. Stealing from an abandoned warehouse is one thing, rummaging through the drawers of a house still inhabited, perhaps by armed people, is not the same thing. When things go badly, you can run away by clicking on a single command and frustrating a search operation which, however, is made slower and more frustrating by the limited capacity of the backpack. This factor unfortunately affects the enjoyment of the game in its entirety, given that you have to make quite a few attempts before understanding how certain aspects of the gameplay work and the progression is very slow. Furthermore, if in the meantime one of our characters gets injured or falls ill, things will become even more uncertain and finding the starting balance could become impossible. It happens several times to die for a silly thing (running to a manned hospital? It's not a good idea) or to go home and discover that one of your classmates has decided to end it all because he's too depressed. Sometimes random events, sometimes not, which reaffirm a concept of rigid realism. Very touching, very deep and certainly interesting, but also quite depressing. Outside of this discussion is the truly peculiar technical realization, with characters filmed live and then translated onto the screen with a ~pictorial~ style, almost completely monochromatic but very dynamic, assisted by an essential audio sector capable of creating the right atmosphere.", "date": "2014-11-15", "grade": "8.0"}
