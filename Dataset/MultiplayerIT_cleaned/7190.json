{"name": "Starship Troopers: Terran Command", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/starship-troopers-terran-command-recensione.html", "text": "Starship Troopers - Space Infantry is one of those films that did not sparkle at the cinema, despite the fame of director Paul Verhoeven, who had made a coup with Act of Strength, and despite the large budget spent to produce it. Even the critics were rather lukewarm towards him, so much so that the fate of the film seemed to be oblivion. Thanks to the home market, however, over the years it managed to recover ground and became a cult work, re-evaluated by all, critics included, and capable of giving rise to various sequels. It failed to become a huge brand like a Star Wars or others, but if you are reading the review of Starship Troopers: Terran Command today it is because evidently the war between humans and arachnids has also managed to find its place in the collective imagination. Who are the good ones? Maps are built around missions If we talked about the film and not the book Space Infantry by Robert A. Heinlein, from which the film is based, it is because the game directly refers to the film, with its satirical representation of a certain Nazi-like militarism and the vision of a humanity physically and mentally enslaved to the expansionist aims of totalitarian governments. Not for nothing was the first scene an adaptation of a sequence from Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, the most famous propaganda documentary of the Third Reich. But we digress. The title of The Aristocrats, a studio specializing in strategy, known among fans for the Order of Battle series, obviously focuses on humanity's war against the arachnids, an alien race that lived peacefully until the earthlings decided to colonize the planet Kwalasha to exploit its resources. Like good parasites, human beings do not think twice before declaring war on anything that hinders them from appropriating resources that do not belong to them, trying to pass it off as a battle of civilization and democracy. So here we are ready to lead the mobile infantry in a large-scale military campaign in which we will essentially try to exterminate what is in effect the indigenous population of the planet, so that we can suck the lifeblood undisturbed. Beautiful, is not it? The missions Arachnids are often indomitable Starship Troopers: Terran Command is a single player real-time strategy in which we will have to overcome a series of missions that make up the main campaign, using all the resources made available to us from time to time. Unlike other titles of the same genre, we will not have to go around collecting wood or stones to build bases and accumulate troops, but we will have to go around the maps reacting to what we find ourselves in front of and using our military strength to wipe out the arachnids, slipping into their burrows after having exterminated their population. In total there are about twenty missions, which are also replayable in scenario mode after unlocking them in the campaign. There is no multiplayer mode, but there are five selectable difficulty levels for each map, which add a lot to the life of the game, if you get caught up in its formula. The missions are introduced by well-crafted cutscenes that serve to to acclimate the player with the scenario, offering him remnants of the ruthlessness of propaganda, the main engine of our actions. At first glance, the game itself seems to be a very classic RTS, but the particularity of the main opponents makes it quite peculiar in its dynamics. Basically we have a certain number of troops available from the beginning, which can be increased by calling reinforcements via radio after having conquered communication centers and supply crates (the latter allow you to increase the number of recallable units). Formed our army, with the classic infantry armed with assault rifles, with units armed with flamethrowers capable of placing turrets, with snipers, with units armed with rocket launchers and so on, we must try to reach the reported objectives of time after time, often multiple for each map. Usually between saying and doing there are hundreds of arachnids to kill. Indeed most of the battles, except those against other humans (who will add to the enemies as the game progresses), are basically played on positioning and stamina. That is, to repel the enemy waves you need to be able to exploit the bottlenecks present in the maps, as well as the heights, so as to have a better aim on the targets. Wrong positioning means that the enemies will have a good time getting to the throat of our soldiers immediately, taking them out in one fell swoop. The arachnids ofthey can be simple warriors, spitters, i.e. insects capable of spitting acid, tigers, essentially ultra-resistant warriors, tanks, i.e. large, powerful and very resistant insects and others. As we said later in the game, rebel human troops also appear to attack us, equipped more or less like our men. The strength of design Soldiers against bugs The strength of Starship Troopers: Terran Command compared to other real-time strategy games is in the design of the maps, which clearly shows the exclusively single player concept of the game. Normally in RTS maps are battlefields, where the different elements are used to balance the forces on the field. In single player the focus is always on the progression of the single mission, which is managed by areas, while in multiplayer the designers seek a greater balance, i.e. they aim to give players the same possibilities in terms of resources and distances to travel. so that they don't feel disadvantaged in any way. Starship Troopers: Terran Command presents maps designed essentially to mark the different events of the missions and manage the progression of the player. For example, in one map, space infantry find themselves defending a ruined outpost from waves of increasingly strong arachnids. The outpost is located in the center of the area, the waves arrive from the south, i.e. from an area where we will never go and which serves to pace the timing of the attacks (so as to always give the player time to regroup) , while to the north there are some mines that we have to free, sending some troops to scout ahead. The atmospheres are the right ones After the initial organization, the map becomes a continuous ping-pong between the outpost, which must be reorganized for attacks, and the assault team, which instead must go hunting for nests to clean up. In another case we find ourselves defending a prison from arachnid attacks, in a map that fully shows the objects of Starship Troopers: Terran Command. Initially we have to find a fugitive by leading a small group of marines, and then we have to escort him to the prison. From here we have to organize the defenses of the walls, making sure that the arachnids do not disturb a certain event (which we are not going to tell you about). Between one assault and another we can send troops to recover resources to increase the number of troops. In all of this there is an area of the map to the north that is apparently unused. It will be after repelling a few waves of insects, when we will be asked to clean it of rebels. Then we will come back to defend the prison walls from a final vast wave. This all happens within a single mission. Later in the game the situation will become particularly violent The limitation of this setting is only one: there is almost no form of continuity between one map and the next, so everything is reset every time. Even the elite units (through combat, each unit can acquire the elite level, which unlocks an additional ability) disappear, replaced by fresh cannon fodder. It all makes sense, given the particular structure of the game, but it is also true that in this way the sense of continuity of the whole is somewhat lacking, also thanks to the fact that narratively Starship Troopers: Terran Command is very committed to clarifying its key elements, less to tell a story that amalgamates everything. Graphics Graphically simple, but successful From a technical point of view and therefore from the graphics, don't expect who knows what from Starship Troopers: Terran Command. The action is viewable at various zoom levels and displays genre-defining detail for both map elements and units. It's true that most of the time you follow the action from the maximum zoom distance, to get a clearer view of the action, so you don't pay much attention to the presence or absence of graphic goodies of any kind. In any case, there is an excellent atmosphere thanks to the apt choice of different color palettes for each mission. In terms of general cleanliness, the action is always easily readable, but we did encounter some problems with the pathfinding of the units, which in some cases literally get stuck. Imagine how nice it was when we found ourselves in front of a tank without our units armed with rocket launchers, stuck on a rock. That said, we haven't recorded too frequent cases where we failed to apply our tactics for reasons beyond our ability, so the overall judgment is still good from this point of view, always considering that the dayco will be updated with time.", "date": "2022-06-16", "grade": "8.0"}
