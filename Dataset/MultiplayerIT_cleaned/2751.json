However, the show must go on: the athletes below know it well contract with Vince McMahon's company, who are doing their best despite the lack of an audience in the arenas, and nWay, the team behind the recent Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid, also knows it, launching this new mobile game on iOS and Android. Gameplay Available on the App Store and Google Play Store in the traditional freemium format, WWE Undefeated is a curious mix between fighting games and card battlers, all projected in the context of competitive online multiplayer. Two players clash in real time, therefore, moving their respective characters and activating the cards of their deck to try to get the upper hand and win the match. Starting from a roster that currently has thirteen wrestlers, including the various Undertakers, The Rock , Finn Balor, AJ Styles, Roman Reigns and Bray Wyatt, with more to come, our goal will be to participate in matches in which the control of the wrestler takes place via swipe left and right, similar to the gestural fighting games in the style of Marvel Contest of Champions, but the attacks depend as mentioned on the cards that are extracted from the deck and that appear in the lower part of the screen. There are the yellow ones, related to direct attacks such as punches and kicks, or combinations of the same; and the red ones, which instead imply the execution of some maneuver: from suplexes to submissions, from bodyslams to DDTs, passing through the trademark moves. Finally there are the blue cards, which can be used as instant counters, and an indicator on the left side of the display that charges as you fight and allows you to unleash a different special move for each superstar. The result of these interweaving is a lively, interesting experience with a non-trivial strategic substrate. In fact, to get the better of the opponent you need to measure the distances and the timing of the attacks well, chain the maneuvers where possible and make sure to reset his vital energy to be able to proceed automatically to the pin in the two times needed to decree victory . Structure The freemium mechanisms of WWE Undefeated appear extremely forgiving, referring to well-proven blockbusters such as Clash Royale. In fact, it is possible to play for as long as you want, without limitations, but the slots in which you can store the traditional chests are only four and once filled, waiting to open them, you will have to give up new rewards.The latter present themselves in the form of gold coins and dollars, the hard and virtual currency of the game, as well as move cards (by accumulating more copies it is possible to upgrade them, thus improving the deck) or the wrestlers themselves. Just play a few hours, without spending anything, to find yourself with a group of not bad wrestlers and therefore be able to count on a certain variety in terms of repertoire. Technical realization Naturally, the bulk of the charm of WWE Undefeated lies in its technical realization, which shows production values substantially above the average for mobile gaming. It's true, some characters bear little resemblance to their real counterparts (see The Rock) and you mostly play on the mix of beard and hair to obtain believable compromises, but the cartoonish style appears decidedly well done and we greatly appreciated the animations and the spectacularity of certain sequences. On the other hand, the sound is not very convincing: unfortunately the game cannot count on the official theme songs of the various superstars and this inevitably diminishes the acoustic value of the experience to the ears of WWE fans, who however are not necessarily the only target user for this production.", "date": "2020-12-07", "grade": "7.6"}
