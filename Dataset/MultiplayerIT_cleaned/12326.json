{"name": "Tornado Mania", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tornado-mania.html", "text": "Yes, because this is precisely the theme of Tornado Mania, produced by that Digital Chocolate author, among many others, also of the slightly overrated Tower Bloxx. It all begins with the will of a mad scientist, disgusted by the decadence of the world, to create an ~ideal city~ in which to live with serenity and joy. To do this, he therefore decided to create a machine capable of creating tornadoes, with which to literally collect houses, shops, industries and other buildings to be able to deposit them peacefully in his brand new city, to the delight of its inhabitants. But if in words such a concept may not seem particularly thrilling, fortunately once you pick up your mobile phone things turn out to be very different. First of all, the control system, incredibly simple and at the same time satisfying; in practice the tornado, by its nature, moves on the circumference of a circle, clockwise. Pressing the 5 key turns the movement counterclockwise, thus allowing you to move and achieve your goals; the latter can be, for example, trees, objects or other elements of the scenario, with which to increase their size and consequently be able to collect buildings. To do this, simply rotate around it until a green bar is filled; around however does not mean passing over it, because in this case the result is damage or even destruction of the precious property. The game therefore has a progression that is fundamentally based on the concept of unlocking new buildings, to be recovered and placed in one's own city. This second phase, as important as the tornado control phase, brings with it a robust management component, since it is necessary to decide with criteria how and where to place the various elements, to give life to an ecosystem that works and above all that makes the own inhabitants. The result is a decidedly engaging title, capable of being simple but not trivial, and always ready to offer new stimuli to keep playing. Even the technical component has a pleasant impact, above all thanks to a colorful, detailed and pleasant graphic system. The defects can therefore basically only be found in a basic repetitiveness destined to manifest itself in the long term.
