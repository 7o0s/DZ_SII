Dragon Age fans, after the previous expansions that were not very incisive and certainly subdued compared to the creative and narrative potential of BioWare, are certainly not thrilled waiting for a new extra content, but rather it is viewed with great suspicion. The latest expansion of Dragon Age II, called ~The Exiled Prince~, is available on Playstation 3 PSN for 6.99 Euros and on PC / Xbox360 at 560 Mp, and sees us take on the role of the noble archer Sebastian Vael through a series of new missions with the aim of avenging the killing of his own family, entirely slaughtered. The Exile and the Return of the Hero All of the missions in this DLC revolve around a coup d'tat that took place in the city of Starkhaven, explained Ferret Baudoin, lead designer of The Exiled Prince. ~During this coup the entire ruling family of Starkhaven was killed in a bloody massacre, except for one person: Sebastian Vael, third in bloodline to claim the throne of the Realm and always overshadowed by his older brothers. For this Sebastian has always lived a life of excess: wine, women, parties, until his father decided that a life of religious contemplation would be better for him, and he was sent to Kirkwall. There he represented an unfortunate arrival for the religious community, but thanks to the patient and wise guidance of Mother Elthina the true faith finally arrived. As a man, Sebastian could never have been ordained (only women had this privilege in the Chantry order), but as a lay brother he became one of the most devoted to the community. That life of his, however, was abruptly interrupted as soon as he learned the rumors about the tragedy that struck his family, entirely exterminated. Thus he broke his vows and decided to reconquer the Crown~. The incipit of the story is certainly exciting and the background narrated in great detail, the ones that then make us love the stories and immerse us in fantasy. Initially the first quests are based on action and the fights against those who have stained themselves with the infamous accusation of having killed our family and many other innocents: a real bloodbath, just to start the adventure well. interweaving that wants us to go back to the instigators of the attack on the Kingdom and it is precisely by ~investigating~ and talking to some NPCs that the pyramid of power slowly comes to light (and to our blade, I would say).Sebastian's role in the party is mainly to inflict damage to single targets, being equipped with a bow as a primary weapon.The effect of his bolts becomes devastating when combined with other offensive characteristics such as magic and spells, for example freezing an enemy and then shooting an arrow at him damage is exponentially increased. BioWare has shown with this DLC that it has learned from its mistakes but above all from the suggestions of its fans, who don't want different experiences from the main story on the DLC, but gameplay and a narrative that expand and integrate the world of Dragon Age, already in itself quite broad and detailed but for this reason ideally expandable to infinity. Xbox 360 goals The Exiled Prince offers 5 achievements for 130 points to unlock. The first four, quite easy, are obtained simply by completing Sebastian's quests, the fifth (secret), is a spoiler and we leave it to you as a surprise. Some Xbox users may experience a problem with this DLC: some released versions do not allow achievements to be unlocked. In this case, try deleting the entire DLC from the dashboard and re-downloading it from the purchase history. The Hero suspended between two worlds Sebastian's profile is very well sculpted between his mystical faith and the desire to regain his throne, a position halfway between the sacred and the profane that accompanies him throughout the adventure, based on action and fighting but also on the search for the perpetrators and the perpetrators. The story unfolds through a series of side quests (quite short, but difficult to quantify in time because it is connected to the main quest) specially dedicated to this archer that each of us will be happy to add to the party (one more rogue never hurts ) regardless of the cost of the DLC: 560 Mp for the Xbox 360 version are not many for all those who want to delve into the Dragon Age II universe with anew character, new quests and new dedicated and unpublished items/weapons. The BioWare philosophy is all here: to implement the world of the main quest with side missions and new ~actors~ in DLC, and that's also what the fans want, a gaming experience that doesn't upset but that manages to reconnect with the heart of the game principal, make it evolve, mature, grow. The BioWare title has been criticized by someone, and Electronic Arts is trying to regain its large audience, which Dragon Age II deserves. Finally, a rumor: it seems that Sebastian's role in Dragon Age III is being studied and that he will surely be part of the story of the next chapter, one more reason to play this Exiled Prince.", "date": "2011-07-04", "grade": "8.0"}
