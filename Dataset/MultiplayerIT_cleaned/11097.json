{"name": "Hellboy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hellboy_a.html", "text": "Created in 1993 by the talented artist and writer Mike Mignola, Hellboy is one of the most popular characters in the so-called independent comic circuit, and his stories are published by Dark Horse Comics (a smaller publisher than giants like Marvel and DC). The demon of the apocalypse Anung un Rama, still in infants, is summoned by the Nazis during World War II to be used as a supernatural weapon against the allied forces. Things don't go according to plan, however, and so the little red creature is entrusted to the care of Professor Trevor Bruttenholm, who establishes a special department for defense and paranormal research in the USA. Renamed ~Hellboy~, the demon grows to develop superhuman strength and endurance, allowing him to face threats against which ordinary law enforcement agencies are powerless. The two cinematic films, the last of which was released only a handful of weeks ago, have contributed in a fundamental way to the popularity of the character, who can now also count on some interesting videogame transpositions. In this mobile reduction, we will find ourselves controlling Hellboy in an action game with numerous platform elements. During an investigation, the red demon discovers the existence of a dimensional rift and decides to enter it to prevent the flow of evil creatures from continuing, eliminating the root of the problem. To get the better of our enemies, we will be able to use the Redeemer (a very powerful gun) or rely on our fists, which in the case of Hellboy can do even more harm. In the upper part of the screen we will be able to check the number of ammunition available (the drum of the gun is shown, after which we will need a few moments to reload) as well as the energy bar, which decreases according to the damage suffered but at the same time fills a anger indicator. When it's full, we'll go into ~crazy mode~ and be able to hit with more power for a few seconds. Within the stages we will find some interactable objects, which it is possible to hurl at enemies: crates, barrels and so on. The control system is simple and refers to the numerous titles belonging to the same genre: Hellboy can move, jump, duck and roll using the d-pad of the mobile phone, while the 5 key is used for the attack (from near or far, depending on the case). In some situations the normal mechanics are varied, with the character having to shoot against enemies in the background in a scoped shooter context. In addition to the normal game mode, there is a nice survival in which we will have to defeat as many monsters as possible by counting on a single energy bar. The technical realization of the game is excellent: Hellboy's sprite is well designed and boasts above-average quality animations, while the enemies are perhaps less cared for in terms of design but make up for their number and variety. The developers have also done an excellent job with regard to the stages, which are rich in detail and are very different from each other, also and above all thanks to a good choice of colors. The sound consists of some good quality MIDI music and excellent sampled effects, which unfortunately cause annoying slowdowns on some terminals. PRO Excellent graphics and sound Tried-and-tested play structure Immediate control system AGAINST Linear and repetitive Level of challenge not very high, indeed Some problems with the sound on some terminals", "date": "2008-10-29", "grade": "S.V."}
