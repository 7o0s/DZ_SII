{"name": "James Bond 007: NightFire", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/james-bond-007-nightfire.html", "text": "A shooter, a driving game or a stealth game? From the first tutorial mission it is clear that Nightfire is not just a first-person shooter: you shoot like snipers from a helicopter, drive Bond's full-featured car and tow charming French spies (especially the latter type of missions would require a good deal of luck and skill, ahem). Proceeding in the game, the initial impression is punctually confirmed, so that the first-person levels alternate with driving sections, not only on wheels, and levels in which one proceeds on ~rails~ in what may seem like a version stripped down to the bare bones of Panzer Dragoon. Furthermore, within the same first-person sections, we find ourselves immersed both in sequences full of furious shootings, and in entire locations in which the use of force compromises our cover, thus forcing us to a more oriented style of play. on stealth games. In short, the problem with Nightfire is definitely not the variety. The shapes of Bond and her fellow agents The first impact with Nightfire's cosmetics is rather disappointing: it doesn't seem to see a big effort on the part of the developers to propose a graphics engine up to Xbox standards. Squared level structures, anonymous textures, rather ordinary animations and not exceptional light effects give the impression of being faced with a decidedly second-rate title. Fortunately, the more advanced levels, from about halfway through the game onwards, have a much more refined aesthetic and are at times very pleasant. Above all, the rendering of the Middle Eastern setting with sand and sheer sun makes a good impression, making the first levels seem like a fortunately distant memory. The models of the enemies are quite spot on even if perhaps not very charismatic, but since we are dealing with secret agents or criminals we certainly would not have expected to see them parading in bright overalls. Overall, therefore, the graphics stand at levels ranging from fair to good in the first person sections, while they drop slightly in quality in the driving ones. Will you grant me this dance, Madame? The famous musical themes, omnipresent in the films based on Fleming's novels, are faithfully reproduced by the speakers of your television or, better yet, your home theater. The in-game voices are excellent, as are the voiceovers during the numerous FMVs that accompany the unfolding of the story. The sound effects produced by Bond's weapons and gadgets are adequate and give their best in the presence of a 5.1 system as almost always happens in Xbox games. Taking up the sniper rifle As a first-person shooter, Nightfire lets itself be played and is quite fun, despite some flaws such as reloading weapons that James performs with the speed of a sloth. It may even be more realistic, but losing a couple of seconds in the middle of a firefight while being pelted by a swarm of enemies is not healthy at all and will test your faith on more than one occasion. The adversaries do not enjoy a particularly strong intelligence, at most they seek protection behind some element of the seabed or run left and right if there are no shelters of any kind. By tweaking the difficulty level you should still find the right level of challenge for you. However, the first-person sections do not require only the quick trigger, but also stealth and eagle eye, given that in some sections we will not be able to injure or kill civilians on pain of mission failure, while they will not hesitate to raise the alarm in case in which they sensed our presence. Luckily, staying hidden is more a matter of timing and patience than tactics and reasoning: the guards follow predefined and always the same patterns, they don't come looking for us and you can boldly walk behind them without being noticed, or even in front of them. them if the distance is high enough according to the parameters of the game. In these cases it is surprising that a guardian turned towards us does not notice our presence no more than a dozen meters away. Ultimately, fans of stealth games can look at many other titles on the Xbox without regretting having overlooked the orb and deaf guards of Nightfire. Still on the gameplay front, it should be noted that it is not always clear what should be done at a given moment and this feeling leads to frustrating repetitions of some levels. Complicit in this is also the spoken in English, whichmakes it difficult for anyone who doesn't speak the native language of James Bond to follow the plot of the game. Furthermore, no emphasis is placed on the use of gadgets, so much so that Nightfire can be terminated by killing anything that moves, without problems and without resorting to the arsenal that made Bond a true legend. This is a nice shortcoming since you get bonuses by immobilizing enemies, rendering them harmless, or by completing one of the ~Bond Moves~ (for example grabbing a cable and sliding on a roof to go around enemies instead of facing them head-on) , but the tutorial does not describe the function and potential of the equipment made available to us at all. The risk is, therefore, that of letting a large number of alternative paths and game possibilities pass under your nose. From the driving sections you don't expect particularly accurate vehicle physics and so it is, but since 007 Nightfire is an arcade where the frenetic action accompanies the player for three quarters of the game time, I don't think anyone who buys it can expect nothing different. Comment 007 Nightfire is a pleasant game, even if not extremely flashy in terms of graphics and despite some shortcomings in playability. It can provide hours of fun especially for fans of the movies and novels and more generally anyone looking for a multi-event game that features some variety and the ability to take on friends in multiplayer battles. If you can, at least take a look at this EA product: you may find it satisfying to play the elegant role of Pierce Brosnan. PS: Speaking of multiplayer, we specify that there is no live support, so there will be no additional materials downloadable from the internet or online competitions. Pros: Faithfully reproduced film atmosphere Sound effect Bond is Bond Cons: Graphics of some missions not up to today's standards Objectives not always clear Use of gadgets not very encouraged The absence of Italian subtitles can make it difficult to understand the plot The adventures of the world's most charming and equipped British secret agent have inspired several tie-ins in the history of video games and this time it is Electronic Arts that gives us the opportunity to impersonate James Bond. As Pierce Brosnan's alter ego, it is our job to save the world from the usual plan of global domination: the Phoenix Corporation has arrived to disturb the peace of Bond's days, which we imagine full of luxury receptions and beautiful women. With the excuse of dealing with a plan to decommission nuclear weapons, this phantom organization instead wants to seize the technology necessary to implement its plan to conquer the world. Let's equip ourselves with gadgets and weapons, a good dose of coolness and begin the mission.", "date": "2003-02-07", "grade": null}
