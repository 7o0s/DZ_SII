Trine? What is Trine? wonders the poor sweaty editor at first glance, completely unaware of the existence of the game he is about to review, before having read its title in the list of assignments of the par excellence bald editor-in-chief. No, we don't want to share with you the internal events of Multiplayer.it, also because the food part has been declared forbidden to minors under 18, but we want you to realize that the hype around this title was close to zero, at least for those who writes. Sure, maybe you readers had Trine on your wish list since time immemorial and you waited for it more than Half-Life 2, going so far as to sexually corrupt the developers' wives to get information about it, who knows. There are some strange people in the world... and incredibly they don't all have the surname Rubbini. The only thing that matters is that this article was born out of absolute darkness (recent storms blew the electricity at the home of the nerd editor on duty, understand it). Same but different The first level of Trine serves as a tutorial and, above all, introduces the protagonists: an agile and determined thief, a loser wizard, Don Giovanni and incapable who can't create fireballs and a knight as loyal and bigoted as he is fat and powerful ( the narrative plays a lot on irony). In short, all three come to touch a strange luminous object at the same time being inextricably linked to each other. How to untie the magical knot that has chained them? But as you tackle fifteen platforming levels of increasing difficulty, filled with undead enemies and puzzles based almost entirely on physics, what questions. The three have heterogeneous abilities and powers: the thief is agile, is armed with a bow and can throw a grappling hook to cling to wooden surfaces; the mage is weak in combat but can create chests, fixed platforms, and floating platforms; finally, the knight is slow and clumsy but his sword makes him formidable in battles and his enormous strength allows him to throw even very heavy objects. During the adventure our heroes will have to take turns to overcome the various difficulties. For example, if you need to reach a chest placed on top of a tree, the thief's grappling hook will come in handy, while having to cross a pit full of sharp spikes, it will be better to create platforms with the magician to cross it without running risks. Cooperative mode With multiple gamepads, you can play Trine with two friends. Everyone chooses a character and works together on screen to solve different puzzles. In this mode Trine expresses its maximum, acquiring all the fun given by playing in company. Thus, while the magician friend creates platforms on which the thief tries to climb, the warrior can defend them by splitting the skeletons with sword or club blows. Undoubtedly the best mode of the game, as long as you have at least two suitable joypads. I will go up What would a fantasy game be if characters didn't level up? In Trine, experience is gained by collecting green vials and killing enemies. By leveling up, characters get points to spend to grow one of the three skills they have. The choices made are very important in terms of gameplay, because expanding some powers, especially those of the wizard, will give more possibilities for interaction with the scenario. Let's take an extreme case, which is a chest placed on a platform too high to be reached with a normal jump. Armed with maximum chest-generation powers, the mage can stack four of them to create a ladder of sorts to coveted loot. This is precisely the beauty of Trine, that is, it gives the player the freedom to develop personal strategies to solve the various puzzles, always guaranteeing him a chance of success, but not imposing a linear and pre-established behavior on him. In fact, having practiced with the intuitive control system, it takes little to master the three characters and experiment with impromptu solutions to overcome the abyss of the turn. Unfortunately there are also some flaws to note. The first is the longevity that will hardly exceed a handful of days for those who don't want to finish it at the maximum difficulty level, finding all the secrets and all the experience. The second is that yes, the control system is intuitive and easy to master, but there are situations where it is difficult to realize what you have in mind, mainly due to the reaction speed required to create certain configurationswith objects. Even the jumps are not very precise and often have to be repeated several times to get to areas that are apparently easy to reach. In the heart of evil Technically speaking we are on very good, if not excellent levels. Essentially it is a two-dimensional platformer with three-dimensional scenarios, but you really can't complain given the attention to detail of the individual settings. For example, wandering through the ruins of an ancient temple there is no shortage of cracked statues, collapsed columns and ancient walls wrapped in vegetation, while the forge visually overwhelms with rivers of incandescent lava and rusty iron. Too bad for some drop in the framerate, noticeable from time to time, even if it should be specified that it does not compromise the gaming experience and that we were able to play the whole adventure at the maximum level of detail. What is lacking is the variety of enemies. Practically you only collide with skeletons, which can be reduced to three types: warriors, archers and magicians. In advanced levels they become stronger, but it doesn't matter in terms of differentiation. If desired, there are also bats that occasionally make their annoying appearance. Occasionally, bigger enemies appear to take down: a giant skeleton and some kind of troll, but that's about it. From this point of view, an extra effort could have been made.", "date": "2009-07-10", "grade": "8.1"}
