It was an accident. Nobody will believe it. But it is said that someone should know and those who live in the Zone know very well what they can encounter. The first safe place on our way is the Skadovsk, a dry ship sheltering a community that can provide us with most of the basic services and, perhaps, some information. Crowded wasteland The starting area is a vast swamp that houses gigantic rusty wrecks and before arriving in Pripyat we will have to cross the industrial area, Jupiter, where large buildings follow one another as far as the eye can see. Three large maps make up the game zone. These are large areas that contain many missions geographically limited to the map itself. It is therefore rare to have to cross stretches that are too long and encounter annoying loading during a quest. The Zone is densely populated and full of shelters, occasional allies, items to sell and points of interest which are often characterized by rather complex and well modeled constructions. The GSC guys have also improved their A-Life artificial intelligence system. Stalkers venture out in search of artifacts and when paired up, they have each other's backs. Companions patrol captured emplacements. Carnivorous animals drag and eat corpses. Wolves attack in groups and flee when alone to charge back once the pack is reunited. All visible from an enviable distance that allows us to fantasize about that light that wanders flickering on the other side of the mountain and to be dazzled by the chiaroscuro shapes that a sudden lightning has imprinted on our retinas. Unfortunately the wars between factions have been eliminated but the inhabitants of the Zone always have some good reason to put their hand to arms. A terrible but alive and vivid world still plagued by emissions. The air thickens. The sky is tinged with unnatural shades. The inhabitants of the area begin to run as the radioactive dust begins to burn the corneas. Undeniably the landscape and the number of people fleeing around us manages to magnify the experience of broadcasts in Call of Pripyat. Tired of the boring routine? The missions are numerous and above all offer varied objectives and are pleasantly seasoned with various cutscenes. It is therefore not recommended to skip them and run towards the epilogue as soon as you get good equipment. In fact, Clear Sky's repetitive tasks seem to be a memory, although obviously some recovery quests are inevitable. Different objectives can be achieved in different ways, for example by informing the target of a murder or theft and obviously betraying the original employer. Instead, we can decide to act as honestly as possible even if most of the positions of honesty have very little. In certain situations Call of Pripyat almost approaches a survival horror. Several creatures, two of which are introduced in this chapter, cannot be dealt with simply by shooting wildly and when one enters the underground tunnels, prudence is worth even more than equipment. In these cases it is essential to keep an eye on the sound indicator to avoid attracting unwanted attention and it is good to remember that crossing a bush or walking in water are actions that cause a lot of noise. The Radiation Beacon is also vital but in Call of Pripyat it has been replaced by a color changing marker. The detection is therefore less precise even if the sound indicator should be more than sufficient to calculate the level of risk. The radiation signal now appears on the right, along with other icons indicating the state of the armor, the condition of the consumable weapons, the bulk of the equipment and miscellaneous such as the need for food. The dress doesn't make the monk, it makes the soldier Call of Pripyat puts at our disposal a wide range of weapons, grenades and medicines to allow us to survive the area. Inevitable is the PDA that signals creatures and points of interest in the circumstances and obviously supplied there are torch and binoculars. These are not simple accessories but vital tools for seeing enemies in the dark or at long distances. Being surprised by heavily armed thugs or mutants with too many teeth in their mouths doesn't make it into the list of pleasurable experiences. Equally important is the detector that we can find in different variants. The better the model, the better the detection of anomalies and the location of artifacts will beti that are often found inside. Most of the weapons are a direct legacy of previous S.T.A.L.K.E.R. while the armor has undergone some changes. Each defensive gear has pros and cons in relation to the model and fabric. The differences concern environmental protection, space and the presence of bonuses such as regeneration. Furthermore, less robust armours, even if equipped with many bonuses, need various upgrades before being effectively effective. Obviously, once the possibility of investing resources to enhance our clothing was introduced, the guys from GSC Game World also gave us the opportunity to talk about it again. The aiming model respects the laws of ballistics and seems to be the same as Clear Sky even if pistols and machine guns seem slightly more accurate. Each projectile has believable physics and long-range shots, subject to the law of gravity, are as satisfying as they are difficult. Frame rate At 1920x1080 resolution, with our test configuration, Call of Pripyat's framerate turned out to be quite choppy. In some situations, the counter flew beyond 160 fps and then dropped to 30 frames in areas particularly rich in vegetation and human or animal life. The fighting in the industrial area has reached its lowest point. But even with 25 fps the title proved to be playable and the slowdowns were almost imperceptible. Not beautiful, charming The only news worthy of note concerns the DX 11 support for those who have purchased a latest generation Radeon and can thus enjoy softer models and more realistic water. The ultra-defined textures of Clear Sky therefore return and unfortunately the washed-out textures that affect the overall visual rendering also return. But it is the tufts of grass, flat and grainy, that represent the lowest point of the engine and unfortunately cover a large part of the territory. The character models on the other hand still defend themselves well, especially considering the free roaming nature of the game, but they are also terribly inexpressive and practically devoid of facial expressions. On the contrary, the models of some mutants are now too poor and ugly to get by at the dawn of 2010. In short, very little has changed from Clear Sky and even the defects are the same, including a depth of field useful for giving depth to the scene but too marked and sometimes annoying. Yet in certain situations the GSC-branded engine leaves you speechless. The flashes cast hundreds of extremely realistic shadows, the rays of light fill the air and every moment of the day has its brightness, its specific atmosphere. In addition, the boundary elements help to distract us from the poor quality elements. Huge fissures in the ground emit exhalations that warp the air, gusts of wind sweep the vegetation, steel monsters tens of meters high fill the gaze and beautifully animated ravens furrow the sky. All obviously supported by the usual, and extremely varied, sound sector. The samplings are credible and accompany counters, detectors, detonations of about thirty different weapons, growls, animal noises, screams and explosions. A few too many rustles perhaps but well hidden by a well-made and contextually perfect soundtrack. Unfortunately, while the most important dialogues are dubbed into Italian, the environmental comments of the characters, at least on our version, remained in Russian.", "date": "2010-02-02", "grade": "8.4"}
