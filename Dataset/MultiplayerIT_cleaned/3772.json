As demonstrated by titles such as Astro Bot, the involvement of the player is in fact the main way to go for those who want to successfully create adventures in virtual reality, managing to make up for the hardware limitations with ideas which, in the specific case of PSVR, are evident . This small preamble to say that The Wizards seems to focus heavily on the validity of the experience offered to the player, a title that is now reaching the PSVR audience after having already arrived on PC months ago for Oculus and HTC Vive. For the occasion, the Polish Carbon Studio team has polished it up, creating an Enhanced Edition that offers some interesting changes compared to the original version. The underlying concept obviously does not change: The Wizards puts us in the shoes of a powerful sorcerer, committed to saving his kingdom with the use of spells. To do this, he doesn't use a wand like Harry Potter or a cane like Gandalf but only his hands, which with PSVR correspond to the movements of the PlayStation Move. We used them to drive away from the lush lands all the beasts that infested them: here's what came of it. Playstation 4 trophies No Platinum for The Wizards, which divides its thirteen Trophies between one of the Gold type, three Silver and nine Bronze. To conquer them all it is obviously necessary to complete the entire main adventure, then also getting busy with the use of trading cards to conquer the additional objectives proposed by the developers. Plot and modes: a kingdom to be saved many times The Wizards takes us to Meliora, a kingdom threatened by a massive invasion of goblins, orcs and other creatures linked to classic fantasy imagery. The presence of strange artifacts and some portals suggests a magical origin at the base of the invasion, to fight which the character we find ourselves interpreting immediately takes sides at the forefront. To accompany us we find only a narrative voice, which has the double function of training us in the use of magic and of making sense of what happens before our eyes, in terms of the evolution of the story. Starting from a basic set of spells, the growth of our wizard takes place gradually, allowing the player to choose which skills to enhance throughout the story. Talking about role-playing mechanics would undoubtedly be exaggerated, but the possibilities that are offered are enough to guarantee a certain customization of one's style of play, favoring the spells with which one feels more in tune. The campaign mode is therefore the main essence of The Wizards, but not the only one. For the benefit of those only looking for clashes, in fact, there is also an arena mode, in which it is possible to launch without wasting too much time chatting. Returning to the main story, approaching The Wizards it is good to keep in mind that we are not ahead of The Lord of the Rings, neither in terms of plot complexity nor in terms of duration. In the latter sense, the Carbon Studio creature is still positioned well compared to the average of virtual reality games, resulting in completion in a period of time that can reach up to five hours. The presence of some collectible cards then makes the replayability index quite high, allowing the player to apply bonuses or penalties to the enemies' skills, which therefore make the game more difficult or easier, respectively. Each card is also associated with a multiplier, used to calculate a score with which the player is positioned in the double classification associated with each level: one global and one dedicated only to friends. Gameplay: higitus figitus, abracaz! The game dynamics of The Wizards can largely be cataloged among those of traditional shooters, with respect to which this game stands out for a very specific additional feature. Instead of being entrusted to the simple pressure of a button, the casting of spells is in fact associated with a series of gestures to be performed with one's hands, from which the mandatory use of the pair of PlayStation Move to play derives. To start shooting darts of frost, for example, it is necessary to move the hands from the outside to the inside, crossing them, while to summon a magic shield it is necessary to move only the left hand to the right. The more powerful the spell we want to use, the more difficult the movement to make becomes. A feature to keep in mind in the most agitated game phases, during which it can caavoid having enemies coming at you from different directions. To ensure that even in the middle of the action the player feels at ease, the developers have made the type of movement completely configurable, allowing pressing the Move button on the left controller to walk freely and with the same button on the right controller to use teleportation (limited during fights). Rotation angle and vignettes are also configurable factors, giving full freedom to those who have PSVR in mind to find a series of settings that can limit motion sickness as much as possible. As far as we're concerned, even though we consider ourselves quite predisposed to this kind of side effect of virtual reality, we have to say that The Wizards didn't cause us any problems even in the moments of greatest tension. For some, the real worry could concern the physical effort, after tens of minutes spent summoning and shooting around arcane missiles, fireballs and more: in the case of long game sessions, a break is necessary every now and then to relax the arms kept in tension. Speaking of the latter, also make sure you have a large enough free space around you to perform all the gestures required by The Wizards, which undoubtedly gives its best when played standing up. If in terms of involvement this game has managed to fully conquer us, the same cannot be said of the variety of the proposed action. After the initial fun, in fact, the gestures with which the various spells are cast continue to be solemnly performed, but one realizes a certain basic repetitiveness in the advancement, consisting of short exploratory phases (complete with small puzzles) alternating with battles which take place within well-defined and therefore predictable perimeter areas. Being surprised by wandering enemies from time to time would probably have added some extra panache. Graphics and sound: inside the magic From the outdoor stages to those in the depths of the dungeons, The Wizards manages to defend itself quite well even on PlayStation VR. Net of the hardware limitations we mentioned at the beginning of the article, Carbon Studio's effort is appreciated for the detail of its settings, even when the field of vision becomes wider. The good level of interaction with the objects around us allows us to collect and look closely at almost all the elements we find around, even if on balance they are often useless. By playing with the spells it is possible to break wooden crates and other elements, appreciating the good graphic effects associated with the various spells, from the shiny shield full of writings to the large pyrosphere to be thrown with satisfaction against the troll on duty. The design of the enemies is of a good standard, even if in the long run the look of goblins and company begins to appear a bit too repetitive, as well as some places. The sound is also well made, mainly as regards the brilliant and never boring narrator.", "date": "2019-03-12", "grade": "8.0"}
