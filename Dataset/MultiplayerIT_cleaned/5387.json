Expansions with a strong narrative and varied missions are not exactly a walk in the park to develop and while their presence is a necessity to keep the interest of the fanbase high, it is impossible to hope that they represent the average quality of all the expected additions. When it comes to season passes, in practice, you should expect ups and downs, and even a house with extraordinary resources like Bethesda can do little to escape this law (especially if it is faced with a tight exit plan). . After a series of extras dedicated to crafting that add very little to the overall experience, however, the fanbase began to heat up dangerously, also because the latest DLC released, Vault-Tec Workshop, once again seemed to belong to the trend of negligible additions to the complex ~do it yourself~ system of the title. And it's the truth: Vault-Tec Workshop is not a memorable DLC, but at least it offers a little more than its peers. Vault-Tec Workshop is certainly not at the level of Far Harbor, but it is not the usual add-on dedicated to crafting Fine interior decorator or mad scientist? The difference between Vault-Tec Workshop and the shapeless mass of objects and circuits for crafting that preceded it is immediately perceived by the presence of a dedicated quest in the player's journal. In fact, the new structures become available only after listening to a radio transmission coming from the mysterious Vault 88, and having freed the place from rather tenacious brigands and monstrosities. As soon as the slaughterable has been slaughtered, you will meet Valery Barstow, an Overseer Ghoul trapped under the rubble for some time, who will immediately express his gratitude by showing you various manufacturing stations that can be used to reproduce the structures that give shape to an underground Vault at will. In short, the basis of the DLC is little more than an excuse to justify the addition of a new type of outposts, however Bethesda has included the ~scientific~ element in this extra that makes the vaults among the most fascinating (and often crazy) places of the colorful post-apocalyptic universe of Fallout. In fact, in the company of Valery you will not limit yourself to building walls and placing generators, but you will be able to carry out experiments on a large group of new inhabitants of the Vault, conveyed there by the same radio signal that had brought you to the place. It will be up to you to decide how and how badly to carry them out, modifying infernal contraptions such as an exercise bike to generate energy and other particularly sadistic goodies. For heaven's sake, the questlines aren't exactly exceptional and crafting lovers can avoid them entirely to feed the super fallout shelter builder in them .... however, it is undeniable that it is still a nice extra touch, able to distinguish Vault-Tec Workshop just enough to make us appreciate it. Attention, however, we do not have the slightest desire to launch into a pure praise of this expansion: the problems are there, they are many and we do not doubt that many people will come out equally disappointed by the experience. Bigger is not always better After all, the possibility of building a Vault had already been offered to PC players by various mods which qualitatively have very little to envy to the work of Bethesda. If you hang out in modding, in practice, for the price of about 5 euros with this DLC you will get very little beyond the experimental questlines, the new underground area and some pleasant decorations. Community members have already included everything else for free in their works (often with some due tweaking to the always clumsy game construction system). It must be said that the Vault 88 area is truly impressive once it is completely freed, and that one feels a bit of a healthy whim to treat one's subjects as laboratory guinea pigs, yet it always seems to us too little to recommend the purchase without hesitation to those uninterested in the customization that Fallout 4 shelters enjoy. Among other disappointing elements, the barber's chair and the available surgical station do not allow you to retouch the non-player characters, and simply modify your alter ego, while the Vault structures, while usable also in other areas, often do not fit well they marry to the pre-existing building blocks of the old buildings (a flaw that we have partly noticed in every DLC Workshop and hoped it had at least been smoothed out on this occasion). Even at the background level, this emphasis on crafting, in our opinion, undermines a story which, if it weren't for Far Harbor, would be somewhat disappointing. Handling a Vault maintainsa certain charm, we don't deny it, and the additional quests are a nice improvement; simply this time too we would have liked to see a little goodwill on the part of Bethesda with a free release, especially when one considers the existence of the mods we talked about a moment ago. We begin to feel the need for a new substantial expansion, to give real meaning to the season pass.", "date": "2016-07-26", "grade": null}
