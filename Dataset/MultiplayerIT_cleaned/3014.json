{"name": "F1 2020: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/f1-2020-recensione.html", "text": "The F1 2020 review begins like all the others that we have dedicated to sports simulations released in recent months, unable to help but detect a situation completely distorted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Given its itinerant nature around the world, the Formula 1 championship was in fact among the events most affected by the uncertainty linked to the lockdown implemented in the various countries, managing to unblock itself only relatively with the first eight races set in Europe during the summer. While everything is still hanging in the balance for real Formula 1, the virtual one has paradoxically traveled faster than ever in recent months. In addition to gamers, the obligation to stay at home has in fact also prompted several drivers to resort to F1 2019 to somehow be able to drive on the circuits, guaranteeing Codemasters a truly exceptional return in terms of image. The anomalous situation has also made sure that the pilots themselves could provide the developers with some extremely interesting feedback, allowing them to better work on some changes for this year's game. All this, combined with the celebrations for the seventieth anniversary of the first Formula 1 Grand Prix, makes F1 2020 once again an event not to be missed for all lovers of the Codemasters series, which to make things bigger has added a new mode and some content dedicated to Michael Schumacher, still holder of the record for the most overall victories. After whizzing back around the virtual Formula 1 circuits over the last week, let's dive into our review! Playstation 4 trophies F1 2020 brings with it fifty-one trophies, the same number as the previous edition. In addition to the inevitable platinum, we find two of the gold type, ten of silver and thirty-eight of bronze. To get them all, of course, you have to climb the tops of the rankings between the various modes, with an eye to the new Team Career. There is no shortage of specific objectives dedicated to the online world or to winning a specific GP with a specific driver. The new My Team mode After having welcomed the cars of the Formula 2 championship a year ago, F1 2020 is enriched this year with the new My Team mode. Translated into Italian with the name Team Career, it is a twin mode to the existing career, with the difference that in the new one we are called to build from scratch what becomes the eleventh team of the championship. A very attractive idea even for those who were so far used to playing the career dedicated to the single driver, given that in the Codemasters design the character played by the player is both the owner of the new team and its main driver. If we want, it is also another way to celebrate the seventy-year history of Formula 1, given that over time similar cases have actually occurred: just think of Jack Brabham's Brabham, or Hctor Rebaque's Rebaque. The creation of the new team passes first of all from the choice of its name, accompanied by that of the sponsor who will define our budget in order to select the engine from those actually available for the F1 teams. In the event that the edition in your possession (here you will find a summary of all those available) is the one named after Michael Schumacher, it will also be possible to choose one of the liveries dedicated to the German driver for the new team, as well as the overalls and helmet for your character. The final step consists in hiring a teammate, initially choosing him among some young hopefuls coming from F2. To help us choose the second guide, Codemasters has decided to introduce some parameters related to the ability of the pilot we are taking on board, also summarized in an overall score which indicates his skill on a general level. During the course of the career we will still be able to make various choices dedicated to our partner, making what we already have grow or going to court the most famous pilots present in the circus with pharaonic contracts, bearing in mind that during the career the older ones will retire to give space to new recruits. To attract Lewis Hamilton or another top player, our team will need to grow in terms of prestige by obtaining successes that increase its reputation, while at the same time equipping itself with state-of-the-art facilities. In fact, the F1 2020 Team Career wants to make us all-round managers, asking us to plan special activities dedicated, for example, to marketing, or allocate funds to develop areas that coThey set up a level team. By pleasing the secondary sponsors with the achievement of some objectives, we will get extra money to spend together with the rest to unlock specific structures, thanks to which we can also gradually evolve from a technical point of view to try to pass from an initial situation that sees us in the rear of the blocks of start up to the first positions. The other modes Even if most of the time you spend playing F1 2020 solo will probably focus on the Team Career, the Codemasters simulation does not forget to provide some alternatives for those who do not want to embark on a long journey. We are naturally talking about the ~quicker~ types of game, thanks to which it is possible to quickly get on the track for a dry Grand Prix on the circuit you want. However, let's not forget the Driver Career, which partially benefits from the innovations introduced by the Team Career. One of the novelties of this year, for example, is the arrival of a second journalist to support the now veteran Claire. The two divide the tasks between the trackside interviews and the questions in the studio, thus offering the alternation that was missing with the possibility of going to parry on a slightly wider range of topics. Jumping from one branch to another, the F1 2020 multiplayer is now a completely separate world, within which, however, we have not had the opportunity to immerse ourselves as we would have liked: we will evaluate in the coming weeks whether to return to the subject with a second article. For the moment we limit ourselves to confirming Codemasters' attention to the eSport world, further accentuated also by the public thanks to the lockdown period. Finally, the developers also wanted to dedicate a small gem to those who want to play in company, but sitting comfortably with a friend on the sofa: F1 2020 in fact marks the return of the split-screen mode, thus dividing the screen of your television in two with some performance compromises. The gameplay Having made the necessary introductions with the elements that make up F1 2020, let's go and see our impressions after a week spent driving single-seaters around the world. The first thing to keep in mind when approaching the gameplay of this game is the intention of the developers to make it as usable as possible by a large audience of people, including those who love Formula 1 due to its popularity but cannot define themselves as a fanatic of the motor world. In addition to the usual driving aids in various ways, with F1 2020 Codemasters wanted to take a step further, proposing a sporty driving model within which steering is also assisted, and any excursions off the track are not punished as in the realistic driving model. If in recent years you have given up trying your hand at the F1 series for fear of running into an unaffordable level of difficulty, now you really have no more excuses. Moving on instead to the driving model that we already knew, the players of F1 2019 will find a feeling very similar to the one experienced a year ago, accompanied however by a series of elements that stand out from the first laps. The first concerns the braking distance: the impression one gets once driving is that the developers have reduced the general inertia of the car, thus allowing it to stop in less time than in the past before taking a bend. Similarly, the feeling of having greater control over traction during acceleration is quite tangible, following what had been the indications provided by riders like Lando Norris over the months. Both things allow you to attack the corners more decisively, without however ignoring the need to be careful with acceleration when exiting to avoid spinning. As anticipated on the occasion of one of our previous F1 2020 tests, the ERS system has also been revised to better adhere to what is the management by the drivers in the race. Faced with some changes in the gameplay which, once absorbed, contribute to to improve our lap times compared to last year, we have an artificial intelligence that seemed even more combative to us, even too much at times. With the same difficulty settings compared to F1 2019, the CPU-controlled drivers seemed more ready to give life to duels and overtaking attempts, even if there is still something to fix. In fact, it has happened more than once that the drivers of the other single-seaters did very little to avoid our car, giving the idea that their trajectory was calculated taking almost no account of that of the player. Forrtunately there is a flashback to bring the situation back, but the behavior of the opponents is still unrealistic, as well as annoying. We remind those who should now approach this series that it is also possible to play F1 2020 with the controller, but the use of a steering wheel is strongly recommended to better enjoy the feedback offered by the cars on the track. Again this year we preferred to use the TV Pod view to play, as the impression is always that of having too little field of view from inside the cockpit to be able to maintain a correct trajectory. The graphics: ready for the generational leap The appointment with the end of this generation allows F1 2020 to sum up the excellent work done in recent years, waiting to see what Codemasters will produce starting from the next edition. Both in the driving phase and in the replays, the general overview offered by F1 2020 is of an excellent level, also thanks to the work started a year ago on the use of lighting. However, those who expected big leaps forward will have to wait for the next generation. As for the details, it should be remembered that for the first time the developers found themselves in the situation of having to create the models of the single-seaters before their real counterparts made their live debut: waiting for a predictable update in the coming days, any shortcomings they can be forgiven. In a similar way to a year ago, the updated F2 championship will also arrive with an additional package at a later date. While in the real world the situation linked to the pandemic has also made itself felt in the choice to postpone or cancel the races scheduled in some circuits , Codemasters' choice was rightly to ignore all this, proposing the 2020 season as it should have been. Therefore, the list of tracks in the game includes those of Hanoi in Vietnam and Zandvoort in Holland, two circuits quite different from each other. Once again the commentary by Carlo Vanzini and Luca Filippi, who have now become a constant presence in the series, returns. As in the past, their intervention stops at the presentation of the race and at its conclusion, thus leaving the radio from the pits during the race but above all the engines of the single-seaters to fill our ears with an audio that overall is very cared for. The real negative side of the technical sector is represented by the uploads: really too many and too long, forcing us in cases where we have to go from several successive screens before entering the track to different ~Stop & Go~ which inevitably end up irritating those in front to the screen.", "date": "2020-07-06", "grade": "8.7"}
