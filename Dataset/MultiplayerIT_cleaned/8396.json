Fatal Frame IV: The Mask of the Lunar Eclipse is in fact a title released in July 2008 in Japan, exclusively for Nintendo Wii, and which incredibly has never been converted for the western market despite the good popularity of the series even outside the Japanese borders . It is, as the most attentive will know, the fourth chapter of the series known far from the rising sun as Project Zero. The reasons for the questionable choice have never been fully clarified, even if there was talk of conflicts between Nintendo and Tecmo in relation to some changes to the control system. What is now certain and evident is that Fatal Frame IV will never reach our stores through official channels, unless sensational miracles occur. A couple of years ago, however, a group of willing users have rolled up their sleeves and created a patch not only capable of translating the otherwise incomprehensible ideograms into English, but also of skipping the territorial blocks of the original DVD without the need to no changes to the console. Considering the recent publication of Project Zero 2: Wii Edition, reviewed by us on these pages, and the poverty of releases in recent months awaiting the arrival of Wii U, we therefore found it appropriate to test the fourth chapter as well, for the curious so they decided to deepen their knowledge of the series. Better late than never, right? Three girls and a detective The plot behind the product once again sees girls as protagonists; in this case they are three young women who survived, 10 years earlier, a kidnapping that took place on the island of Rogetsu during a festival dedicated to the moon. Despite many years later, however, the mysteries related to the episode are far from clarified, and the recent death of the other two companions involved in the same dramatic crime at the time seems to be linked precisely to the cursed island towards which the survivors are heading . Needless to anticipate that the evolution of history soon takes on dramatic, dark and disturbing hues, with the constant and unpleasant company of ghosts who keep terrible secrets. Fatal Frame IV, for those who have had the opportunity to follow the previous episodes closely, immediately reveals itself to be a traditional product in terms of game mechanics; despite the collaboration of Suda 51 and Grasshopper Manufacture, we did not want to make this fourth chapter a breaking point, going instead to follow the path traced in the past with the first three. It is therefore a slow-paced survival horror, which rests on the emotional tension and drama of the progression much more than on the quality of the gameplay in the strict sense. The ~novelties~ in this respect, studied for what was the franchise's debut on the Wii, are for the vast majority precisely those that the aforementioned recent remake of the second episode then recovered; so here is the torch controllable via Wiimote, albeit in a rather incomprehensible way via motion sensor and not with the more precise and reactive infrared pointer. And here is also the solution of collecting objects, which requires you to hold down the A key to extend your hand, making sure to immediately withdraw it in the event that a menacing ghost appears out of nowhere. These are interesting design choices, which however do not scratch the great rigidity of the gameplay typical of the survival horror genre of about a decade ago; at the base of Fatal Frame IV there is always and in any case the usual concept of collecting objects and keys, or overcoming simple puzzles, to thus allow access to otherwise blocked areas, so as to be able to advance in the linear and pre-established progression . Even the control system is the same, pachydermic ~monster~ that characterized the great classics of the genre, and which in many ways also determined their success: controlling one of the protagonists (to which detective Choushiro Kirishima is actually added ) is a real effort, made of low reactivity and enormous woodiness even to perform simple actions such as turning on oneself. But it is also true that this element is now more an essential component of that precise kind than a defect, a necessary ingredient for the success of the recipe; although nowadays they actually represent a sort of retrogaming, survival horrors of this type must necessarily be made this way. And by accepting this reflection, Fatal Frame IV inevitably becomes a wonderful exponent of this trend, a game capable of generating anxiety and fear at every step. Tecmo's experience gained with previous episodes is evident: the right weight given tothe waiting, the ~empty~ moments, the shots and the sound are an expression of an awareness and mastery of the genre that is expressed throughout the entire adventure. Fatal Frame IV is an elegant game, and we are not referring only to the (apparent) fragility of the protagonists even if dressed in improbable little clothes made on purpose to tickle the tastes of the Japanese male; for example, the combat system once again proposes (except for the phases with the detective) the use of the Camera Obscura, a magical camera capable of exorcising ghosts thanks to special films. An instrument light years away from the shotguns and smashed brains of other more popular exponents of the genre. But more generally it is the plot that is brilliant, disturbing, disturbing and oppressive. On the other hand, the graphic component is still appreciable today, despite the years that have passed and despite the limitations of the Nintendo console; the small size of the settings made it possible to increase the level of detail, with well-designed scenarios characterized by a particular variety. The textures and polygonal modeling are also good, while sorry for the significant drops in frame rate on some occasions. But it is above all the quality of the direction that enhances the aesthetic component, with dramatic shots, rarely banal and in any case always functional to the game.", "date": "2012-07-31", "grade": "8.6"}
