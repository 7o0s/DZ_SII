Although it seems like a peripheral aimed at younger players, given the possibility of setting up games that do completely without the pad, apart from Kinectimals, which is truly successful, for this target of players, there is very little available. Just Frontier, the same as the title just mentioned, return with Kinect: Disneyland Adventures which seems to answer a very simple question: why not create a freely explorable amusement park full of ~treasures~, even better if inhabited by Disney characters? It would be fun and, perhaps, it would also help parents to have fun together in front of the TV... Wonder Park The park reconstructed in Kinect: Disneyland Adventures faithfully reflects the typical shape of the large American structures set up by Disney. For those who have never been there, various themed areas, each inhabited by characters from the most famous films, are lined with attractions, some more complex and ~modern~ and others more classic, such as the famous carousel with rotating cups, from the world of Alice in Wonderland. To understand this, in the Frontier game it is both possible, even for two players, to get on the apple caterpillar, which follows exactly the same route as the original, simply to enjoy the ride, and to engage in a series of activities, all themed, which allow you to interact with Kinect in more complex activities. They range from a flight in the company of Buzz Light Year, in which you have to tilt your arms/wings to avoid the seabed and shoot aiming your crosshairs at the aliens who attack us, to Peter Pan's swashbuckling adventure or a race in Wonderland, locked in a rolling sphere, while avoiding the Jacks of the Queen of Hearts or while being invited to tea by the Mad Hatter who challenges us to exactly replicate his poses. Each of these activities, there are 18 different ones, is divided into several subsections, which can also be played all in succession, once they have all been completed individually. To wander around the park, after creating your own avatar, just point the finger of one hand in a direction and you start moving forward. Scattered throughout the areas, dozens of secrets to discover and as many as 35 characters to meet and interact with: buying autograph books and having them signed by Mickey Mouse and company; giving ~five~, making bows and hugging them to see the corresponding animations. Each of the heroes gives the player missions, mostly research ones, which lead both to the completion of special attractions and to the exploration of the park pure and simple. Exploration that becomes more and more interactive thanks to a series of magical objects to play with, such as a camera with which to take pictures of Disney characters, while having to replicate their pose at the moment of the shot, or Buzz's laser gun to shoot a series of sparks in the seabed. All while children, parents and animals enliven the streets of Disneyland. Xbox 360 goals Just as there are many things to do, so to get to the 1000 points, you need to spend some time. Obviously, it's nothing difficult, but it requires a little dedication that maybe even the slightly bigger point hunters will be able to find, in case they are lovers of secret objects and collectibles. So cute! Kinect: Disneyland Adventures is probably the best game made for Kinect for ages 7 to 14. Despite the structure and the many hours that it is possible to spend there, it is good to bear in mind that most of the time is spent exploring the park and interacting with the protagonists of animated films, all dubbed into Italian and excellently animated. The fathers and mothers will have enough to have fun too because the games, in fact, also know how to be well diversified and demanding, the others, despite the look, would do well to decide how much they really love the Disney universe, because in case of negative answer they will soon get tired of the slow pace of exploration and the playful atmosphere. If the answer is yes, here is another title that sees Kinect responding wonderfully, despite the many different movements, in all situations and, finally, a fast and convincing use of voice commands, which can be used clearly and effectively in all the cases in which they are proposed on the screen. Without forgettingre that, apart from some slowdowns, as for Kinectimals, Kinect: Disneyland Adventures is really a beautiful game to see and listen to, full of surprises and catchy music. Comment Perfect for young Disney lovers Lots of activities and surprises Kinect works fine Excellently made Most of the time is exploratory Watch out for your ID card!", "date": "2011-11-29", "grade": null}
