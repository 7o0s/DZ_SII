In short, a historic saga that has managed to reach remarkable peaks, a splendor that has definitely faded from NBA Live 10, which has begun a slow and inexorable decline. One of the causes can certainly be attributed to truly fierce competition, capable of raising the qualitative bar with each release; factor which, combined with a series of technical deficits, has contributed to the decrease in popularity of Electronic Arts titles, so as to lead to two important setbacks. The first, decidedly important, was four years and ended with the return of the saga to the current generation, in 2013. After some unconvincing iterations, we have arrived at another pause for reflection with NBA Live 16, the penultimate exponent of the franchise, whose modest public response has convinced the developers to bring their title back into the pipeline. After a two-year period, which almost presaged the closure of the series, Live has instead returned with a renewed determination: will this new episode be able to recover the scepter of basketball simulations? The importance of being chosen The desire for revenge is always appreciable, but it is not enough by itself to fight a competition that equally relies on many years of experience to improve its product. Probably aware of this factor, EA Tiburon has staked everything on the concreteness for this return, investing in the best things that the series has offered over the years and completely absorbing its history. NBA Live 18 is a chapter with his feet firmly on the ground, except when he has to jump for a basket. The first step was to recover and improve the Pro-Am mode of the previous chapter, a sort of prototype of a new way of considering the player career mode. From this base something even bigger has been created, called The One, and led by a luxury testimonial: James Harden, who with his mighty beard takes on the role of charismatic mentor for the protagonist, created by the player through the editor internal or facial scan (via the phone companion app). It is to all intents and purposes the new single player career, fought between two souls well highlighted after a series of introductory matches, La Lega and La Strada. The first, as can be guessed, is focused on the career of the protagonist, after being chosen in the draft, in one of the teams in the US championship. The second is to all intents and purposes an evolution of the Pro-Am mode, characterized by the possibility of playing games with other human players online through historical playgrounds, introduced by splendid videos full of references and anecdotes. These include Pacific University in Seattle, Venice Beach and Rucker Park in New York. All are beautifully crafted and represent something different than the classic arenas, but The One is so much more than that. Want to grow up One of the most challenging features of The One mode is its structure and its many elements in common with an RPG. Our protagonist is fully customizable in terms of objects and skills through a rich upgrade menu, based respectively on the accumulation of virtual currency and experience points. All this contributes to increasing the player's level, to which specific skills are linked which we will then unlock as we progress in our career. The coin naturally links to the internal shop, which offers a long series of chests containing an item of clothing chosen at random from a defined set. The chests themselves have a link with the level reached, so they will not all be immediately accessible. A detail that many will appreciate is the total absence of microtransactions in this mode: all earnings must be obtained by playing and winning the various games. Even more interesting is the fact of having full freedom of action through the two modes, league and street, regardless of the progress made with our player. A system that stimulates you to alternate The One mode with the others present in the game, considering the fact that there is no real story, excluding the usual incipit of the young promise who aspires to stardom. The few parts of the script are relegated to a few nice scenes offered by a fictitious broadcast within the game, and a series of cellphone dialogues between the protagonist and various peopleToday, including the inevitable agent, friends and even Harden himself who gladly peeps out. These short dialogues are also functional to the development, offering the player the possibility to choose the answer, winning hype points or virtual currency. Here come the women! The news of NBA Live 16 does not stop there: for those who are not interested in investing time in The One mode, the classic franchise always remains, which allows us to face the season with one of our favorite teams. Obviously all present at the call: Celtics, Lakers, Rockets, Miami Heat and company, including the All-Star divisions. In this case we find ourselves managing a somewhat old-fashioned mode, recovered from the previous chapters and which does not really offer the most attractive side of the EA Sports production. For those who are linked to the Ultimate Team, a trademark inaugurated by the Canadian sports production house, the homonymous mode is dedicated, characterized by the management of virtual stickers functional to the creation of one's dream team. In addition to those won in the game, it is possible to win the most coveted packages through a classic system of microtransactions, buying NBA points with real money. The most relevant novelty is instead represented by the inclusion of the WNBA, the women's basketball league, unjustified absent in the sports simulations and which ideally recovers the operation of inclusion of women's football already carried out in FIFA. However, those who follow the pink championship will only be half happy: the 12 teams and their stadiums are faithfully reproduced, including the Washington Mystics led by Elena Delle Donne, but dedicated competitions have not been included, relegating the teams to simple exhibition. The WNBA is characterized by a completely different pace of play, devoid of ferocious attacks on the basket and penetrations in the post, but more dynamism and tactics. All of this is not very dissimilar from what was seen in the college basketball counterpart of Electronic Arts itself, with games where 3-point and medium-range shots are rediscovered. Password: fun On the pitch, the direction chosen by EA Sports for NBA Live 18 is immediately noticeable, that of a ~simcade~ designed to differentiate itself from the competition and be attractive to a group of users less accustomed to basketball. Playability is characterized by great immediacy, thanks to a series of elements studied at the table by Tiburon. The two key points are shots and defense, the former are entrusted to the renewed bar with an ascending cursor that represents the path towards the perfect release. By managing to stop the cursor at the top of the bar, we obtain an optimal launch which, however, does not automatically determine the basket, as the game takes into consideration both individual skills, position and the opponent's marking. In any case, an optimal release ensures ample opportunity to make a basket, an eventuality that transforms into absolute safety in the case of free throws. The system considerably facilitates the attack phase, while for defense the discussion becomes broader, establishing the need for significant help from artificial intelligence. This means that the CPU understands the best positions of our teammates in order not to leave open spaces for attack, lightening the player's task, while the renewed self-defense system through the left trigger allows blocking without the need to calculate the jump. system leads to a series of powerful blocks, sometimes questionable in terms of realism, but tremendously effective and which, together with the rebounds, open up a completely new dimension to the numerous and spectacular counter-attacks. Obviously the most demanding players will turn up their noses, but this does not mean NBA Live 18 presents itself as an easy title. The artificial intelligence is however combative and reacts to inconvenient situations, always maintaining a balance in the score. Too bad for a series of small flaws, now historic for the series, such as players who sometimes lose position, resulting out of the field when receiving a pass, or other incomprehensible behaviors, fortunately still quite rare. The numerous and inevitable sliders, which allow you to customize the game in depth, are only able to partially compensate for these defects. Xbox One goals NBA Live 18 features the usual 1000 player points, divided across 40 goals. Conquering them all will take some time, considering the many things to do in the proposed modes. These include the conquest of the chests in The One, the achievements in the Pro-Am and the conquest of the titlein deductible mode. Good luck! Make up Technically NBA Live 18 is partially affected by a not yet complete transition towards the current generation. The engine still inherits several elements from the previous chapters: among these a series of animations that fail to bind harmoniously, where the competition has reached situations very close to photorealism. In a certain way, the passage between one animation and another is still too perceptible, having to wait for its conclusion to be able to move on to the next, even if the phenomenon is much less than in the past. As far as detail is concerned, the work done by the developers is undoubted, with detailed player models and beautifully crafted arenas. The realization of the audience is also excellent, a trademark of the series, with an enthralling audio that increases in intensity based on the outcome of the match: the tension in the last quarter is palpable, with each basket capable of emptying the spectators' lungs , it follows a great emotional involvement that influences every action. Also worth mentioning is the presentation, which uses the official ESPN graphics to underline the actions and replays, some controlled by the player himself, with a very exhaustive mid-game interlude. The game on Xbox One runs at a resolution of 1080p, with a framerate almost always anchored to sixty frames per second, there is some sporadic uncertainty, but nothing to worry about. The soundtrack is also incisive and categorical, characterized by hip hop and trap songs, which leave no room for pop or electro digressions, rather tying themselves to the culture of street basketball; much less exciting commentary, flat, devoid of bite and with many shortcomings as regards the women's league.", "date": "2017-09-22", "grade": "7.5"}
