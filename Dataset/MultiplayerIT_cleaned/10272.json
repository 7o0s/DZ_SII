{"name": "Invasione estrema", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/73370-space-invaders-extreme-2-invasione-estrema.html", "text": "Space Invaders, or rather the classic video game par excellence: one of the first shooters, released in arcades thirty years ago but featuring a gameplay that is still current, which has inspired hundreds of titles to date and which has rightfully entered the collective imagination with its boxy aliens and strike emplacement tasked with eliminating them before they land on our planet. There are countless re-editions that have featured the game developed by Taito in 1978, but Space Invaders Extreme is undoubtedly the project most in line with the spirit of the original coin-op. It is a techno reinterpretation, created for portable consoles (Nintendo DS and PSP) and Xbox Live Arcade, which brilliantly mixes graphics and sound to offer a fun, engaging and in many ways original experience. The sequel, subject of this review, comes out exclusively for DS and takes advantage of the opportunity to better exploit the peculiarities of the Nintendo platform. If the first Space Invaders Extreme confined all the action on the touch screen, using the upper screen only to view data and scores, this second episode takes advantage of the double display to develop its own vertical dynamics and actually add depth to the gameplay. The last bastion Just like in the original arcade, in Space Invaders Extreme 2 we control an attack post which is the last hope for our planet in the face of invading hordes of malicious aliens. We can move our ~vehicle~ using the d-pad and open fire by repeatedly pressing B or A, trying to calculate the time that our shots will take to reach the objective of the round as the enemies move continuously. The excellent upgrade system seen in the first SIE is re-proposed in an optimized version, which provides for more careful management of weapons and a bar at the bottom of the screen that empties in seconds and indicates the availability of the upgrade. There are four types of power-ups, of four different colors, and they are obtained by eliminating a series of four aliens of the same color (without hitting others in the meantime, otherwise the combo will be interrupted). The blue power-up translates into a spectacular laser capable of disintegrating entire rows of aliens with a single shot, the green power-up gives us a cannon that ~crosses~ the enemies and then makes them explode, the red one makes the shots of our cannon explosive (capable of eliminating entire groups of aliens) and the gray one provides us with a barrier capable of protecting us from attacks. Long eye The most relevant novelty of this sequel lies in the use of the upper screen of the Nintendo DS, where in practice special enemies are positioned that we can only hit if we manage to get the necessary space on the lower screen. Eliminating this type of alien activates the ~fever~, a state of grace in which the aliens all become golden and release cascades of points when we hit them. Since the structure of the stages depends on the points scored and the achievement of certain objectives rather than on a progression of the classic type, it is clear that taking advantage of this situation means getting to the boss fight first. The latter are really well done, both from the point of view of design (with a particular emphasis on their ~pixelated~ nature, as per tradition for Space Invaders) and from the point of view of behavioral routines. Each boss, in fact, has a peculiar approach to combat that must be memorized so that it can be effectively countered. This type of characterization draws heavily from the classics of the genre, and does it with a style and awareness that are truly rare these days: the Project Just team, who worked on Space Invaders Extreme 2 as well as Space Invaders Extreme, also demonstrates in this sense to have clear ideas on how to make an engaging arcade with an exceptional design. Lights and sounds The game has different levels of difficulty: the lowest one sees us face the stages in rapid succession, without being able to choose the path to follow, while the others offer crossroads that not only change the scenario in which we move but also the degree of challenge. The total number of variants is good and certainly helps to improve the life of a product otherwise subject to wear out its charm in a very short time. The main mode is accompanied by a sort of ~time attack~, which reinterprets the stages by setting time limits, and a competitive multiplayer mode both locally and via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection: the goal is to score more points than the opponent, cui performance is played on the top screen of the console. Technically, Space Invaders Extreme 2 is a small masterpiece of lights and sounds, perfectly coordinated to offer a truly one-of-a-kind experience. The sound of our weapons coincides with the rhythm of the excellent music that accompanies the action, almost acting as an impromptu arrangement in key, while different keys alternate on the screen at regular intervals. The elements move in a fluid and convincing way, the solutions adopted all look spectacular and the end result is a real feast for the eyes and ears.", "date": "2010-01-05", "grade": "8.0"}
