Among the few survivors of the accident, the protagonist of the adventure had only the eerie voice of Doctor Wagner to guide him from one room to another, and he had to try to survive the attack of the zombies using various weapons and special abilities. The developers of Badfly Interactive, a team made up of video game industry veterans, have never made a secret of focusing primarily on graphic quality, and this aspect was also predominant in the first chapter of the series, however putting equally important aspects in the background such as the gameplay and the length of the campaign. Well, with Dead Effect 2 it really seems that the authors have learned their lesson and have made a commitment to pack a much richer and more interesting product, equipped with an excellent touch control system (finally with automatic fire, which is activated in moment an enemy enters the crosshairs) and a large number of main and side missions, which together with a couple of extra modes offer something like thirty hours of gameplay. Ten times the first Dead Effect, not bad! Dead Effect 2 is a great sequel, featuring excellent touch controls and a very long-lasting campaign Dead and dead The incipit of the game is very similar to that of the original chapter, with our character awakening from a cryogenic sleep and being guided to safety by a mysterious woman, inside a ship overrun by zombies and other monstrous creatures. After recovering a couple more items, this impromptu team decides to grapple with the infection and tackle the root of the problem, advancing from area to area until they locate and eliminate the source of all the trouble. Before being able to start the campaign, it is necessary to log in to the application via Facebook, Google or e-mail, but beyond this step, the freemium elements of Dead Effect 2 are immediately anything but stringent, placing simply some constraint on progression that can be circumvented by experimenting with the optional internships and climbing up to the level of experience required to be able to move forward. Furthermore, after a few missions, the experience takes an unprecedented turn and we understand why, during the preliminary phase, we were asked to select a character from a shortlist of three, all equipped with different skills and equipment. Of course, the plot of the game leaves something to be desired and the dialogues, in particular, are bad for scripts and acting, but beyond this we are faced with a solid and well-structured first person shooter, with lots of upgradeable weapons and fun use of special abilities such as stasis or shock waves, particularly useful when we are facing tougher enemies than the average zombie. Obviously, the graphics once again take the lion's share, which on the iPhone 6s remain anchored to sixty frames per second and boast a definition well above the average, with relatively complex polygonal models and a good use of effects, although often the locations tend to look alike. The sound design also does a good job of setting the right mood, often accompanying the action with epic and inspired music.", "date": "2015-11-03", "grade": "8.0"}
