{"name": "Asterix alle Olimpiadi - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/asterix-alle-olimpiadi-recensione.html", "text": "Historically, the arrival of the Olympics results in the production of a number of themed sports simulations. Never like this year, however, has there been a particular turnaround: normal Olympic video games have given way to ~alternative~ applications, as in the case of Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games. The strangest thing, however, is that Asterix at the Olympics, despite the title, does not belong to the category of sports games: it is, in reality, the third episode of the Asterix & Obelix XXL series, renamed in this way to recall the film just released in theaters. On balance, it is a choice that on the one hand could increase the appeal of this new product developed by the talented Etranges Libellules, on the other it could only generate doubts and confusion in those who may proceed with the purchase expecting something completely different. Watch out for those two The plot of Asterix at the Olympics is linked to that of the film only for some elements and for the presence of certain characters. The Roman Brutus, intending to get rid of Caesar, relies on the inventions of a sort of mad scientist, and becomes capable of merging different dimensions: that of video games, that of comics and that of films. Asterix and Obelix realize all this after seeing the druid Panoramix transformed into a drawing on paper, and so they decide to combine business with pleasure: they will go to Greece not only to solve Brutus' problem, but also to help the their companion Alafolix to win the Olympic Games and marry the beautiful Irina. The relationship with the episodes XXL and XXL 2 is made clear by the presence of the secret agent Sam Schieffer (parody of the protagonist of Splinter Cell), who on more than one occasion will help the roosters to complete their mission. For the rest, the game presents itself with the same structure as always: it is possible to control both Asterix and Obelix, switching from one character to another thanks to the ~-~ button of the Wii-mote, and there are different sections where the two they must work together in some way to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Compared to the past, the action is placed in the background compared to the solving of puzzles: we will find ourselves having to operate devices of various kinds to open doors and continue in the search for the interdimensional key. And every now and then we can decide to try our hand at the various Olympic disciplines... Otherwise we get angry After a few introductory stages, we'll find ourselves exploring the city of Olympia, trying to gain access to all of its areas. For some doors to open, however, we will necessarily have to face the Olympic Games, setting records and winning against opponents controlled by the game. By selecting a character from those available (initially only Asterix, Obelix and Alafolix, with the others to be unlocked gradually), we will have to compete in running, javelin throwing, long jump, but also in completely original disciplines such as ball frog or the fight. It is during these ~sports~ sections that the Wii control system makes the difference compared to other consoles: to run you have to shake the Wii-mote and Nunchuck alternately, while during jumps or warm-up the controllers must be rotated or moved following the instructions on the screen. All disciplines turn out to be quite fun, even if they cannot boast the thickness seen in Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games. It must be taken into consideration, however, that in Asterix at the Olympics these applications only surround the standard action. That said, during the exploration and combat phases the controls are decidedly more classic, with the Nunchuck analog stick used to move the character, the A button to attack and the B trigger to jump. The motion detection of the controllers comes into play when you need to perform special moves, always demonstrating a certain readiness and a good response. The only thing that is a bit awkward is the management of the view, entrusted to the d-pad. Technical realization Asterix at the Olympics is really nice to see, with very well drawn and animated characters, extremely faithful to the original comics. The game on Wii is also quite fluid, characterized by an excellent use of colors and locations rich enough in detail. Some elements are done really well (see the grass), you end up fighting dozens of Roman soldiers but there is never a slowdown. In short, a truly excellent result, only slightly obscured by some defects in the rendering of the polygons. The amusing gimmicks are few compared to the previous chapter, but decidedly successful (see Asterix who takes off his helmet and throws aheadbutted in the chest by a Roman bully, complete with a referee who takes out the red card...). The impression is that the ~artistic~ level has dropped a bit, however. As for the sound, we have some discreet effects and music, accompanied by a very well done Italian dubbing. It's a shame that the voices and effects are clear during cutscenes and instead feel very ~tinny~ during the actual game. It is possible to play in two at the same time, thus controlling both Asterix and Obelix, while any online mode is missing (but given the lack of importance attributed to the Olympic disciplines, it is not missed). Comment Those who have appreciated the two Asterix & Obelix XXL will be at ease with Asterix at the Olympics: apart from the presence of the Olympic Games in the form of minigames (also playable individually), the game structure is basically the same as we have already been able to appreciate. Technically very well done and equipped with an excellent control system (entrusted to the usual Wii-mote / Nunchuck combination), this third episode unfortunately sees the balance between puzzles and action leaning towards the former, which end up being often repetitive. Perhaps the main problem with this title is the lack of bite: the developers have tried to change things a bit, but it is clear that we are dealing with a subdued product compared to what we have seen so far. However, fans of the series shouldn't miss it. Pros: Excellent technical realization Effective control system Beautiful dubbing in Italian ... Cons: ... ruined by a ~metallic~ effect The Olympic minigames do not shine Not very long-lived, sometimes repetitive", "date": "2008-03-25", "grade": null}
