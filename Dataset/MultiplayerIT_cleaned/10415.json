Alliances are formed and broken, the characters change their attitude from ~face~ to ~heel~, belts change hands and all around there is a real universe that has been consolidated in its traditions for years now. The WWE video game series SmackDown! vs RAW is one of these: over time it has conquered a leading role within the boundless merchandising made up of T-shirts, DVDs, books and action figures, assuming the traits of any sports simulation that presents itself from year to year to the appointment with the enthusiasts, bringing with them a baggage of perhaps modest novelties, together with the usual addition of names and extras. In the case of this 2010 edition, the developers of Yuke's team have focused even more on the features concerning customization. The editor for creating your own wrestler, in the first place, has been enhanced and now allows us to do practically anything, paying only in terms of the quantity of objects used: the number of ~levels~ is limited, therefore one cannot fill the character with clothes or accessories beyond a certain point. The models that represent the body and the face are widely adjustable, so a little patience and commitment is enough to add any fighter from the past to our roster, or those who for some reason have been left out of this episode of the series. Then there is the great novelty of the story editor, which in some ways takes up the old ~general manager~ mode as it sees us build episodes of our favorite show or a PPV, determining the meetings and then playing them in first person or watching them as mere spectators. The difference lies in the fact that we can now create ~angles~ based on something like a hundred predetermined sequences, thus weaving a plot that can then develop over the course of the episodes. The functioning of the editor is very simple and we can add the dialogues to our liking (even if doing it with the Dual Shock is not the best of life - better to use a keyboard), choose the protagonists of the scenes as well as the length of the same. For example, we can briefly recreate the recent story of Matt Hardy's betrayal of his brother Jeff, creating particular events around the latter (the car that explodes, the mysterious assault in the backstage, etc.) which then they flow into a final and decisive meeting. The game already has a couple of preloaded stories, but the most interesting thing is the fact that once you've created your own story, you can upload it to the THQ servers and make it available to the community. This clearly means that we will be able to dramatically extend our gaming experience by downloading stories created by users from all over the world. A feature with incredible potential. Game mode WWE SmackDown! vs RAW 2010 offers a very special start screen, actually made up of a training mode that allows us to become familiar with the controls before jumping into the fray. The game modes available are more or less the same as the 2009 edition, with eight different possible ~quick matches~, the usual career mode and the ~Road to Wrestlemania~ story mode which in this case offers six different storylines starring our custom wrestler, Edge, Shawn Michaels, the Triple H/John Cena duo, Randy Orton or the buxom (also in all the wrong spots) Mickie James. The ~Championship Scramble~ was added to the disputes already present in the past (practically all those possible and imaginable), i.e. a match between several wrestlers valid for the title, in which the belt can change hands several times through pins or submissions, but which remains the property of whoever holds it when the stopwatch marks the end of the dispute. The Royal Rumble, which has always been the most fascinating pay per view of the year, has undergone some changes in particular for the methods that lead to the elimination of the participants. Unlike in the past, this time it is enough for one of our opponents to be close to the ropes to try to throw him out and therefore eliminate him, through an all too simple minigame that involves repeatedly pressing the right buttons at the right time. The impression is that in this sense we could have done better, and therefore also this year the real brawl on the console will not give who knows what emotions. Finally, we need to open a parenthesis on online multiplayer, available for up to four players and open to all possible disputes. Welland, our tests in this sense are unsuccessful: we have never had the pleasure of playing a game that wasn't heavily conditioned by lag, and if you think that to avoid the enemy's moves and shots you have to press the R2 backbone exactly when indicated on the screen, it is clear that things are not all right. We're also talking about just four participants in an overall rather intimate environment, so was it really that difficult to make sure that online worked in at least a decent way? Find the differences We need to open a small parenthesis on the differences between the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game. In fact, the first allows us to upload the replays we have saved to YouTube, which is really interesting if we want to show the world our creations or give history a particularly spectacular encounter. On Xbox 360 this option is not present. On PS3 you have to install the game when you first start it, but the loading times benefit a lot compared to reading the disc on the Microsoft console. However, we should see how the game behaves on Xbox 360 after copying it to the hard disk. Finally, the PlayStation 3 version suffers from some small ~jerks~ that occasionally occur during the fight sequences, not very noticeable but still annoying. Don't try this at home Smack down! vs RAW has already made a fundamental change to the control system for some editions, assigning the right analog stick to the execution of the moves. It is a solution that guarantees a large number of variations (each wrestler can perform something like twenty holds, in addition to all the rest of the repertoire) and which adds ~physicality~ to certain situations, such as when we perform a submission maneuver. In this way, however, the ~fun factor~ has been somewhat lost sight of, which has distinguished the genre since the days of WWF Superstars in the arcade, opening the doors to a series of more or less serious problems. The mere ~button mashing~ perhaps needed to be developed, but eliminating it altogether has moved the needle of the gameplay from intensity to precision: when two wrestlers grab each other, the winner is whoever simply presses the R2 key (in the past it was also necessary to press the L2 key , depending on whether the reaction occurred for a punch or a hold) at the right moment. As already mentioned, during online multiplayer this thing is rendered badly due to lag problems, but in any case it is a too simplistic solution, which satisfies the desire of the developers to offer a product that provides the player with full control of the meetings, but depriving him of the challenge and fun. To confirm, just try to raise the difficulty level: when the moves are no longer easy, the game turns out to be frustrating, cumbersome and very little fun. It almost seems that, as in television shows, the outcome must be predetermined and the choreography carefully planned to produce a positive result. In short, it would be appropriate to reconsider the control system and perhaps return to a solution that provides for the rapid pressing of the buttons, which would also guarantee better management of the degree of difficulty. Playstation 3 trophies A total of twenty-six trophies made available by WWE SmackDown! vs RAW 2010, in this case twenty-two ~visible~ and four secrets. Bronze trophies are the easiest to obtain, and are usually unlocked by completing a story in the story editor for the first time, creating an entrance, etc. The silver trophies revolve around completing the ~Road to Wrestlemania~ mode with the various characters available, but some of them are also unlocked by dedicating themselves to more advanced editing options. Finally, the gold trophies are the more ~technical~ ones and are obtained by totaling a certain number of moves and countermoves. Big boys with abs There is no doubt that WWE SmackDown! vs RAW 2010 visually represents the sum of the work done in recent years. The guys from Yuke's put their passion into it, and it shows: no detail is left to chance, the matches really look like those broadcast on TV (logo at the end of the episode included!), the animations are of good quality and slowly they are losing woodiness and gaining in realism and speed. It must be said that progress, however, is rather slow. The passage of the series on the new generation platforms has led to a greater complexity of the graphics, which is manifested in the skin of the chest that reddens when it is often slapped, or in the cuts on the forehead that bleed dirtying our character and his opponent, or still in the fireworks that are nowor definitely improved (see Batista's entry). Valuable details, but still details. If we go to see the polygonal models, they are practically the same as always and when they raise their arms they show a joint that is not beautiful to see. The fidelity with which the wrestlers have been reproduced deserves a separate discussion: it is understandable that in a videogame the abs are also drawn on Big Show's belly (two meters and twenty by about two hundred and fifty kg), but in this case we have characters who in reality they show a physique that is only the shadow of what it was in the past (Chris Jericho, HBK, Kane and the Undertaker himself), while in the video game they appear big and defined as in the WWE shows of six or seven years ago. Wrestlers like Mark Henry, then, have been represented almost as fat people without any muscles, which is anything but truthful. In short, complaining about the cosmetics of this new episode of SmackDown! vs RAW would be excessive, but if Yuke's goal is to propose something perfectly relevant to reality, it should have the courage to review the polygonal models and to be less generous towards certain characters who no longer rely on physical prowess alone to do your job. In the pause menus you can listen to a soundtrack composed of the ~themes~ of all the WWE wrestlers, as well as a selection of rock songs, while speech and effects are as usual plentiful and of good quality. Unfortunately the voices of the announcers appear too ~dull~ and lacking in emphasis, so they end up taking away the enthusiasm from the entrances rather than emphasizing their spectacularity.", "date": "2009-11-02", "grade": "7.9"}
