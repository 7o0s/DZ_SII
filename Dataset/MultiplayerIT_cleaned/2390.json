{"name": "Castlevania Chronicles", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/castlevania-chronicles.html", "text": "An immortal classic! The title that we are going to describe belongs to the latter franchise, but not before a brief introduction to the saga. Debuted on Japanese computers (like Msx) and seen on coin-ops (Haunted Castle) in 1986, Castlevania was the reason why a nice Nintendo Entertainment System arrived in my living room during Christmas 1989, due to so many rave reviews and for the love I had for the coin-op, however difficult it was for a 9-year-old boy. Imagine (for the times that were) a beautiful graphic, gothic and disturbing, an immediately whistleable soundtrack (what a euphemism for a handful of mono channels, hehe) but above all a simply sensational playability, despite the decidedly high level of difficulty and the inability to save at the end of each area or level (these days it would have been impossible since today's games are all too easy). What was the secret of this gameplay? As a member of the Belmont family (the best known are Simon and Richter), the latest addition to the famous vampire hunting dynasty (thanks to the sacred whip handed down from father to son), you will have to drive the evil Count Dracula back where he came from, strong of your whip and of the weapons that you will find along the way (boomerang in the shape of a cross, holy water, axe, knife) and your jumping skills (it's a platformer, so.), but not before having faced Castlevania, the his gloomy manor. Having said that, I have also practically described a good part of the sequels released by Konami for Nes, Megadrive (impressive zoom and rotation effects, all via software), Super Nintendo (the unforgettable tube effect of level 4.3 of Super Castlevania, fourth episode of the saga), PC Engine and Game Boy. The arcade adventure trio made up of Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest (Nes, 1988 if I remember correctly), Castlevania Simphony Of The Night (Psone, 1996, converted the following year for Saturn) and Castlevania: Circle Of The Moon (Game Boy Advance, 2001), 3 milestones that combine a delicious ~arcade adventure~ (almost RPG) component with the highly tested game mechanics. To which of the 2 categories will the Castlevania Chronicles for Psone belong here? Will it be the classic Castlevania (not that it's a bad thing, mind you) or will it be similar to the recent productions, more complex and based on exploration? Let's dive into the heart of the review to find out. An old acquaintance for the Japanese The most recent episode of Castlevania is not actually a brand new game as one might expect and, above all, it is not the sequel to the story of Alucard, Richter and Maria, heroes of the wonderful Symphony Of The Night. In fact, among the many platforms that have hosted the Castlevania saga, the PC Engine Duo stands out (the most recent version of the powerful 8-bit console, with built-in CD-ROM, gave birth to the beautiful Dracula X) and the Castlevania present here (Vampire Killer) for the Japanese X68000 computer. An old acquaintance for the Japanese What are the differences? Well..almost none! The ~remake~ version has the aforementioned introduction in computer graphics as opposed to the bitmap one of the original, the soundtrack has been remixed but luckily for us the beautiful themes have kept their beauty, with the addition of guitars and hits really wonderful piano (as always); finally there is the possibility to set lives and difficulty level, an unedited feature for most Castlevania episodes. scaling or any peculiarity that makes 3d so much these days (anti aliasing, z buffering, textures, gourad shading, etc). Lots of fun! If most of the gamers of the new generation are already falling prey to despondency, the fans of Castlevania and with them the admirers of the ~old style~ platformers are already bringing out the champagne and Don Perignon: find me, these days, for Playstation (but not only, to be honest) an exciting, adrenaline-pumping and long-lived video game like any Castlevania. Wandering through ruined castles, treacherous forests, crumbling bridges and so on, whipping down hundreds of monsters is simply wonderful and the platform component (which forces you to make well-calibrated jumps) goes well with the ~whip thatit passes you~. Secret areas, as is customary, abound and to reveal them you just need to take a wise look at the somewhat strange walls and experiment (using the whip, in practice) here and there. In addition to your trusty whip, there are many objects that you will be able to use, starting with weapons (knives, boomerangs, axes, etc) reaching hearts (basically the number of shots available for secondary weapons) and passing through chickens (replenish your energy) and crosses (destroy all the enemies on screen). limited attacks to end up with dozens of enemies who shoot continuously, platforms to jump to the limit of human possibilities and final bosses that cannot be more carrion. A game from another time? Surely many will turn up their noses seeing Castlevania Chronicles in action due to the certainly antiquated graphics even compared to the beautiful Circle Of The Moon for Game Boy Advance. One thing that cannot be argued about is the artistic level of the cosmetics: paintings from the Baroque era, muddy forests and limestone caves (with 3 levels of parallax, if the eye does not deceive me) are still delicacies not to be underestimated so like the dedicated artwork by Ayami Kojima (Hideo's relative?). The animations are just passable for the enemies and fair for the main sprite (better than Nathan's on the Game Boy Advance but not like SOTN's Alucard). The musicwell, have you ever heard a Castlevania with realizations that weren't at least gorgeous? Whether you opt for the original version of the game or for the arrangement, you can't help but go to some Japanese site to order the soundtrack, simply beautiful and in line with the graphics, the game and, above all, all the predecessors released so far. A game from another time? Who do you recommend this Castlevania to? To all the fans of the saga who have already bought it imported from Japan without waiting for this article (as it is cheaply sold in Japan, it shouldn't cost more than 100-120 thousand lire through parallel importers) or to those who have booked it in the American, as there is currently no confirmation regarding a possible European release; it is also highly recommended for those who have long dreamed of replaying a captivating platform game, not at all easy and capable of being replayed even many times after purchasing it. To all those who are only interested in graphics, amaze their friends with lots of special effects on the screen and finish everything as soon as possible .... well, I'm sorry for them, not many fun games come out for the 32 bit Sony (and I repeat , not only ..) and it is certainly one of the funniest products among those released during 2001, demonstrating, if needed, that a game, even if technically obsolete, can still have its say, after 10 years. And if you please. Curiosity: generations compared Fans of the saga who, like me, saw Castlevania born, cannot help but notice some gems scattered here and there in the game or to recognize music already heard, later forgotten but not removed from our baggage of memories. Among these memories, Konami has included the first level of the first Castlevania as the initial stage of this episode reviewed therein. Don't believe it? Here it is! Curiosity: generations compared Although the graphics of Castlevania Chronicles is certainly not a miracle, the difference from the original of 1987 is still very high, right? An immortal classic! It is now established that Konami is one of the best software houses in the history of video games: Metal Gear Solid 2, Silent Hill 2 and Pro Evolution Soccer are 3 of the most awaited games ever, not only by Playstation 2 owners but also by any gamer self-respecting (who is content to drool over screenshots and videos of these real works of art). However, few know the background of the Japanese software house, those magnificent 80s in which Konami established itself together with Nintendo, Sega and Capcom. Who can ever forget Green Beret, Track'n' Field, the Gradius saga (with attached Salamander, Parodious and the spin-off Pop'n Twin Bee) and, above all, Castlevania?", "date": "2001-10-05", "grade": null}
