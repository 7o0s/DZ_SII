To know our opinion on The Guild 2 and to introduce you to simulated life in medieval Europe, we therefore refer you to the review of The Guild 2. Pirate dynasties Even those who will try their hand at a game of The Guild series for the first time will be able to quickly become familiar with the basic concepts of the title thanks to the numerous introductory videos that will explain from time to time how to master all the main aspects of this Pirates of the European Seas. This add-on introduces four new maps to the world of The Guild: the Hanseatic League, Great Britain, the North Sea and Pomerania (also called the Goth Coast, where Gdansk is located). Furthermore, if playing without a specific purpose does not help to find the right incentives to continue playing, the 4Head programmers have seen fit to set up a Campaign, divided into several chapters, which will see us committed to bringing our family back into vogue. now reduced to living on humble fishing, to the point of making it one of the most important families - if not the most important - of the entire Hanseatic League and perhaps becoming, why not, real kings. The script of the campaign, as well as the dialogues and its plausibility in general, immediately appears quite poor and not very thorough, however it lends itself well as an excuse to explore the many aspects of the gameplay offered by the game. The old ones and the new ones. In addition to the marginally revised and corrected user interface that will now help us find some information, buildings and characters faster, three of the most prominent innovations of this expansion certainly include the introduction of new titles and professions, as well as the possibility of using different types of boats both as a means of transport and for battle at sea. Besides fishing of course. Naval battles will be managed in a very similar way to what already happened for land battles, i.e. with real-time mechanics. The fact of being able to manage entire fleets made up of different types of boats always makes this type of diversion varied and fun. you can build dens, shelters and even fortresses where you can keep your wealth and hide your fleets Returning to various positions and professions, in the world of the Hanseatic League it will now be possible to earn a living as a fisherman, rather than undertaking studies to become a doctor (really funny, in this regard, being able to invent miraculous cures and then have them sold to our charlatans. ..) or turn to crime and become - of course - pirates! Each of these professions corresponds to a certain number of new objects to trade, buildings to construct and services to offer... by taking the wicked path of the pirate, for example, in addition to attacking and plundering ships and trading posts, it will be possible to build hideouts , shelters and even fortresses where you can keep your wealth and hide your fleets as well as make use of little women of easy virtue useful to be consoled rather than to distract the city guards ... At the same time, it will now be possible to better defend your possessions , thanks to the introduction of watchtowers capable of keeping our fiercest rivals at bay, at least for some time. As already mentioned, the social climbing of our characters can now include new positions, including that of cardinal and supreme commander up to the coveted throne of the imperial capital - provided that your city of origin becomes large enough, of course. All topped off with a slightly modified election system to make things more realistic and varied. And for lovers of role-playing games and multiplayer there are even new accessory actions that help to immerse themselves even more in the game world, especially in multiplayer mode: how about sitting in an inn, in the dim light of a fireplace to have a chat rather than drink yourself drunk? Yes, now in the world of The Guild 2, it will be possible to do that too. My kingdom for some shaders On the purely technical front we have not noticed any particular improvements or changes, although we have witnessed beautiful marine and aquatic visuals in general. For the rest, the graphics engine that moves the game often betrays the close relationship with that of Oblivion (in fact, both titles use the GameBryo coupled to SpeedTree) offering us in every situation visureally effective wings, lending the side to particular slowdowns only in the final stages of the game, when the villages, which have now become cities, begin to swarm with citizens and merchants. In these cases, it will be of little use to play with the numerous graphics options made available by the developers, given that the bottleneck will be our processor and not so much the graphics card. Fortunately, the whole gaming experience now appears much more stable and unlike what sometimes happened to us with the original title, we have never witnessed any crashes. Instead, the various pathfinding problems of our characters and a general ~stupidity~ shown by the artificial intelligence system of the people who populate the game world remain. As well as all those structural problems that make The Guild 2 sometimes too complex and frustrating a game. For this, a data-disk is perhaps not enough, so we will have to wait for the third chapter of the saga. System requirements Minimum Requirements: Windows ME with DirectX 9 Graphics Card with 128 MB RAM 512 MB RAM Processor 1.8 GHz Disk Space 3 GB DVD-ROM Drive Recommended Requirements: Graphics Card with 256 MB RAM and Pixel Shaders 2.0 support 1 GB of RAM 2.8 GHz processor Thanks to the numerous graphics options, even with medium power systems it will be possible to play with dignity. To play at its best, however, a good processor is essential in order not to witness various slowdowns in the most crowded phases. Comment The Guild 2: Pirates of the European Seas certainly represents a well-finished and varied expansion, capable of renewing the interest of even the players who have most stripped the basic title. In the face of various more or less ancillary improvements, the spirit of the game is certainly not unchanged. This is both good and bad. Given the lack of other titles capable of offering even a similar experience and the general quality of 4Head's latest work, we can only recommend it to all fans of the genre. Others should know that The Guild 2: Pirates of the European Seas is still a complex and sometimes grumpy title, beyond the easy label ~The Sims in the Middle Ages~. Pros Doesn't need the base title to be played All in Italian Offers new possibilities and levels of challenge even to veterans Cons Some of the structural problems remain Requires more hardware resources than the base title Although perhaps in Italy it came out without too much fanfare, The Guild 2 represented a very important release for all fans of strategic titles. Welcomed by both the public and critics with always rather positive opinions, The Guild 2 showed its side, more than anything else, to a series of bugs and technical defects which, together with a certain innate complexity, undermined the general judgment. Less than a year after The Guild 2, this new stand-alone expansion comes out which takes us to the North Sea - mainly in the places that saw the famous Hanseatic League thrive - and will allow us to wear, among others, the shoes dirty and smelly pirates.", "date": "2007-07-02", "grade": null}
