{"name": "Goat Simulator 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/goat-simulator-3-recensione.html", "text": "Goat Simulator 3 is exactly what we expected it to be. A suitably enhanced and corrected revival of the same vision that made Coffee Stain so famous (and rich), a software house based in Sweden, which in 2014 won the bet of its life by betting everything on Pilgor, the unusual and bizarre protagonist of a game that , despite the title, had no simulation, and did not want to have anything at all. Goat Simulator 3, to put it in other words, is the sandbox par excellence, a production that in this iteration exploits missions, with often insane objectives and outcomes, such as simple pretext to unleash the user's creativity and destructive yearnings, deliberately involved in an experience without who knows what ludicrous ambitions, but in its own way unique, bizarre, amusing in the most literal sense of the term. In fact, the game must first of all interpret the mood, light-hearted and rough, an inalienable process if you want to compromise with a gameplay that is in itself anything but profound and attentive to detail. Yet, as often happens in experiences of this kind, wonder unfolds as if by magic as soon as you give it the opportunity, that is, not when you choose to turn off the most rational part of yourself and allow yourself the luxury of giving free vent to that sinister inner voice that whispers to us every day to headbutt anything that moves, to steal a car to destroy it a hundred meters away, to generate, we don't know how, a hurricane capable of razing a entire neighborhood in a matter of seconds. We explain why in the Goat Simulator 3 review. Goats with a mission to accomplish The image speaks for itself on the rate of destruction (and insanity) achievable in Goat Simulator 3 For those who were still wondering, the Coffee Stain Publishing production puts you in the shoes of a goat initially with rather realistic features. Were it not that the adventure opens with a clear and direct reference to Skyrim, at first one could almost be fooled into being faced with an extravagant Farming Simulator spin-off. The sensation lasts very little, just the time to find yourself walking around the Pratichiari Ranch, the first scenario of the game, and discover the existence of the Goat Towers, places through which you can access your manor, a castle which, by completing missions and objectives, allows the 'access to new rooms full of unlockables to customize Pilgor. Unlike the progenitor, which in its original release was in all respects a sandbox devoid of any frills, Goat Simulator 3 underlies an evanescent, demented and specious campaign, which can also be tackled in multiplayer for up to four players, both locally than online. The ultimate goal, in essence, is to become something between a deity and the ruler of all the goats in the world, a recognition obtainable by completing a good percentage of the missions available in the scenario. There are many cosmetic items that can be unlocked in Goat Simulator 3. Some you will get by purchasing them from the in-game shop, others by finding them in the scenario Unsurprisingly, these mostly plan to upset the moors, neighborhoods and industrial plants that make up the map, of a moderate but not exorbitant size, made available by the developers. Accomplices the so-called Instincts, shorter-term objectives, such as performing a certain number of jumps on a trampoline, you will be more or less directly pushed to set fire to every place you will explore. Knocking down a certain number of citizens with butts; steal a police car; detonate an atomic bomb; but also recovering some parcels scattered around the city are some of the more basic tasks that you will find yourself completing. Fortunately, there is no shortage of more savvy lenses, some of which wink at other videogame sagas or film brands. In this sense, the on-screen clues that appear whenever you approach the place of interest are useful. By interpreting the message and analyzing the objects with which it is possible to interact, you will often be surprised by the genius revealed by the developers, perfectly at ease in making you feel, often and willingly, in the middle of an episode of Griffin or South Park, for what you will be required to perform as Pilgor. You will experience many wacky moments in Goat Simulator 3 The design of the missions, among other things, ties in extremely well with that of the map as a whole. Thanks to the presence of some collectibles scattered around the scenario (some of which limit themselves to giving experience points for the Towers while others instead unlock new objects andaesthetics), exploration is punctually encouraged by the presence not only of the indicators to reach to start the umpteenth mission, but also by structures, landscape elements, oddities that characterize each place and contribute to intriguing the user. If the progenitor was a sandbox to be filled almost exclusively with the user's creativity and imagination, Goat Simulator 3 proves to be far more multifaceted. Even the slight progression impressed by the Castle, which is enriched with new rooms as the adventure continues, will encourage any gamer to complete the main missions, an undertaking that will commit you for more than a dozen hours or so. Goats. Together. Strong. What if Goat Simulator 3 meets Rocket League? Here's what would happen As we said, however, Goat Simulator 3 remains a deliberately and openly rough and coarse experience, a feeling that is perceived in practically every area. Graphically, to begin with, Coffee Stain has once again opted for a sector that is far from today's standards. Although the glance is sufficient, thanks to a good horizon line and scenarios in any case full of details, going into detail we notice sketchy polygonal models, animations that are not at all realistic, textures that leave something to be desired. Yet, as a whole, everything works great, precisely because the intentionality of the developers, determined to give us a B-series video game, is tangible, palpable, evident. A rhino in Goat Simulator 3 Absolutely similar speech for the management of physics, far from realistic and, in certain situations, understandable. It's not uncommon to see a tanker go airborne in a small explosion, or get thrown hundreds of feet away just by driving over a manhole cover. It is not always clear which elements are destructible and which are not and there is no shortage of totally unexpected and comical reactions. It's part of the fun and from this point of view too everything works as it should, even if it doesn't work (almost) at all. Base the control system. You jump, head butt, drag objects and people with your tongue, you can even bleat. Certain items that can be equipped by pressing a shoulder pad give Pilgor additional abilities. The jetpack, while working terribly, can make you fly around the setting; the chewing gum dispenser can clear many obstacles; stilts are great for getting over lower walls. However, don't expect a particularly precise or responsive control system. Although with a minimum of practice you can become quite skilled even in the platform sections, also in this case the error, the software delays, Pilgor's incomprehensible reactions to the commands given, are all part of the fun and you have to accept the distortions to enjoy the experience fully. Goat Simulator 3 has no limits in trying everything! To make the package even more irresistible, obviously the aforementioned multiplayer for up to four players locally and online takes care of it. It goes without saying that by collaborating with one or more friends, the potential comic scenes and moments of pure hilarity multiply exponentially. Furthermore, it is possible to take part in tiny mini-games, always scattered around the scenario, focused instead on the competitive one. These are small tests, which are also rather sketchy, ranging from a sort of mix between Destruction Derby and Mario Kart to football. In any case, nothing that will keep you more busy than a handful of minutes, unlike the co-op which could instead turn into the only way you will enjoy the title.", "date": "2022-11-16", "grade": "8.0"}
