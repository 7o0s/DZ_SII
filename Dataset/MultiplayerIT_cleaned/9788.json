A choice which, however, after so many years, begins to make each episode more and more similar to the previous ones. How to renew, at least apparently, Ace Combat without distorting or changing it? The answer seems to be in the most popular activity of recent years, the cooperative or competitive use, otherwise called multiplayer mode. And that's how Ace Combat: Joint Assault wants to attract new audiences and win back the old. But will it really be a winning strategy? A new sky Ace Combat: Joint Assault offers a narrative thread that links the various missions without being intrusive: we will find ourselves fighting in the role of a pilot against a terrorist group called Valahia, responsible for various attacks, kidnappings and mass destruction. The main cities of the world are in danger: fans of the series will already have raised an eyebrow, for the first time in the series Namco Bandai in fact offers real locations as the backdrop for our air battles. The Japanese islands, San Francisco, the deserts of the Middle East, London and other cities are reproduced under our planes on the basis of real satellite photographs: the effect is truly realistic and intriguing, also because some details emerge here and there on the geographical surface peculiar to the setting we are flying over, such as the Tokyo tower or Big Ben. The attention to visual detail naturally extends to the aircraft that we will fly and face, mostly polygonal reproductions of really existing aircraft, which we will be able to modify at will in our hangar, between one mission and another, adding components and upgrades that improve their performance . The management component is accessory as always, the real gameplay is purely arcade despite the screens suggesting something much more simulative. Once again it is possible to play with three different views, which can be selected from the appropriate menu when the game is paused, which is indeed not very immediate: outside, inside the cabin, first person. One key is dedicated to activating the machine gun, another to secondary weapons such as missiles or vertical bombs, the right backbone manages acceleration, the left one slows down the aircraft, pressing both allows a 360 view of the outside: manage our aircraft is certainly not intuitive but the control system performs well and responds quickly. The simplicity of the gameplay therefore translates into frantic conflicts in which we'll have to avoid enemy fire, pursue a target and, finally, bring it down with the weapon of our choice. The old and the new As in the previous episodes, Ace Combat: Joint Assault also offers a progression in the campaign for a single player marked through a series of missions, some of which are parallel and contemporary: this means that we will often be called to choose which mission to face and, in that case , our choice will influence the next missions, both narratively and practically. In other words, by eliminating the enemies heading towards the next mission area, you can avoid fighting them to focus on the real objective, often improvised and not described in the mission briefing, as a twist. The excellent sound effects and radio dialogues of the pilots, who comment on the story and the action, make every situation extremely believable. The variety of missions is decent but the arcade setting betrays the repetitiveness of the gameplay, completely based on the annihilation of various air or land targets, sometimes within a certain time limit. The real novelty that in a certain sense increases the longevity of the campaign is the possibility of playing it in cooperative mode locally or through the infrastructure for up to a maximum of four players: the idea is anything but trivial, as it is actually possible to divide teams and tackle missions at the same time, affecting the other group of players' match. Collaboration therefore becomes of fundamental importance if you want to achieve the best possible score. In case you are more belligerent, Ace Combat: Joint Assault also offers a competitive mode for up to eight players.", "date": "2010-09-23", "grade": "8.0"}
