Yet, despite all the hours spent on Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer, we found ourselves in front of the PC screen and a blank Office page for a very long and embarrassing moment, not knowing what to write. This introduction, say, we've written and rewritten half a dozen times. The fact is that, when we published our hands-on a few weeks ago, we hadn't imagined that there would be very little to add during the review: the game, basically, was all there. Therefore this review might seem strange to you, given that instead of analyzing the game in every aspect - which we have already done, practically - we will dwell on the dilemma that led us to give it an insignificant numerical rating that never before rests so much to the personal sensibilities of gamers and, more importantly, Animal Crossing fans. The first Animal Crossing spin-off will only appeal to a small niche of super fans Violent decor For those who missed our trial, it is worth remembering and immediately making it clear that Happy Home Designer is not a new Animal Crossing, but a spin-off entirely focused on one of the most popular features of the Nintendo series: that of the furniture. In the ~original~ Animal Crossing, the player could furnish their home as they pleased, filling it with random furniture, carpets and ornaments, or placing each object with taste and precision, drawing on an immense catalog that was discovered over time. True fans spent their days hunting for the most beautiful pieces of furniture and anxiously awaiting the special days when the most expensive and exclusive ones were sold. There was no precise aim, other than to make one's fireplace more welcoming, but ~hardcore~ decorators could always aim for the prizes of the Accademia delle Belle Case, an evaluation system that was based on very strict and very precise rules . Happy Home Designer revolves around this feature, putting us in the shoes of a new employee of the legendary Tom Nook and tasking us with furnishing the houses of the various inhabitants who will ask for our help. In doing so, the spin-off strips Animal Crossing of every other dynamic that made it so famous and loved: there is no day/night cycle, time does not flow, the seasons are not associated with a calendar but with lots of well-defined terrain, there is no village to explore, there are no side activities, no holidays, no surprises. Our alter ego doesn't even have a home of its own, for that matter, and even the ABC is just a memory, however counterintuitive it may seem. Happy Home Designer only allows you to furnish the houses of the inhabitants or the public buildings that will gradually be unlocked in the only explorable area, the village square (which, for the avoidance of doubt, we do not create and cannot import from New Leaf, in case this question is running through your head). At the beginning everything is very simple: the first inhabitants will ask you to furnish a small room, following their concise indications. Someone wants the house with hearts. Someone else would prefer it to be all red. In the school there must be a precise number of desks and chairs, and so on. You'll soon find that these criteria don't necessarily have to be met. You can leave the house of an inhabitant as bare and empty as you found it, and he will be happy just the same, and even when you start decorating the gardens or more than one room at the same time you will never be forced to follow the guidelines: you will simply include the few pieces of furniture suggested by the client. Freedom is the watchword of Happy Home Designer and, in this sense, the game keeps its promises. The catalog is boundless, and becomes more and more vast with each new ~mission~: the fact that there is no day/night cycle, in this sense, is perfectly logical, and it is enough to save the game and decide to continue playing after having decorated a home to move on to the next working day and meet a new client, perhaps choosing him from among those casually strolling in the town square. Therefore, the question at this point arises: what is the purpose of Happy Home Designer? The 3D effect Without infamy or praise, the 3D effect allows us to better enjoy our creations, but it has absolutely no effect on gameplay. The dilemma of purpose In the life simulator that was Animal Crossing, the day-to-day player created the goalsome day. Someone decided to complete the museum, someone else to get his dream house, there were those who stubbornly caught all the fish in the world and those who absolutely wanted to complete the archaeological museum or their very personal collection of fashionable hats. Each day in Animal Crossing could be different or the same as the previous ones. For a spin-off that focuses on a particular Animal Crossing feature or mechanic, Happy Home Designer is equally devoid of purpose in the sense that the only thing you have to do is furnish the inhabitants' apartments, but since there are no rules to follow it is up to the player to decide what to do with the material at his disposal. Do you really want to arrange every piece of furniture with millimeter precision, looking for the best combinations of shapes and colors? Or will he prefer to hurry up, and limit himself to completely randomly placing a couple of chairs just to make the obtuse citizen happy and move on to the next one? The choice is his alone, and in this sense Nintendo does not set any limits, if not the imagination. And as trivial as this statement may seem, it is absolutely true. As we have said, the catalog is enriched over time, and nothing prevents you from returning to modifying an already furnished pied--terre to enrich or completely change it. Furthermore, the renewed interface makes the operation much simpler than in Animal Crossing: New Leaf, given that you can drag the furniture - and our alter ego - onto the touch screen and even duplicate them by pressing a simple button, avoiding breakage of boxes having to grab and move them manually, an alternative that is still possible. The fact that the Academy of Beautiful Houses does not exist could make Animal Crossing purists turn up their noses, but it is a precise choice that clearly falls within the philosophy behind this spin-off: Happy Home Designer wants the player to be free to furnish - or not to do so - as one pleases, and an evaluation system would have obliged one to submit to certain rules, to choose precise furniture and to place it accordingly. In short, thanks also to the Internet, players would all end up copying the best templates with the sheer purpose of winning in a game where winning doesn't matter at all. In short, every counter-current choice seems to be determined by logical reasoning that respects the spirit of this spin-off, but this still creates problems, if not on one side, at least on the other. Animal Crossing fans who care little or just about furniture, for example, will struggle to find a reason to play this spin-off which, mind you, offers practically nothing in addition to the huge catalog. In this sense, in short, Happy Home Designer is a game conceived for an extremely narrow niche of players, who must not only be fans of Animal Crossing - which is already a niche brand in itself - but who must also appreciate this particular dynamic of the gameplay. Which makes Happy Home Designer more of a kind of mini-game than a real game, that is, a ~piece~ of Animal Crossing ... sold at full price. amiibo for everyone? Impossible not to discuss the other very important feature around which this Animal Crossing spin-off was developed (specially, perhaps?). Indeed, Happy Home Designer supports amiibo cards that will be distributed together with the game in the coming weeks. Ironically, although the interface constantly reminds us of their existence and their compatibility with the software, the usefulness of this function immediately appeared to us a bit forced and indeed rather dubious. We remind you, of course, that to scan amiibo or amiibo cards you don't necessarily need a New Nintendo 3DS: Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo 2DS owners can purchase the NFC Reader/Writer device to interact with the figurines and cards sold separately . Although the cost of the accessory is quite low, it is still an additional expense to be added to that of the game and amiibo cards, which inevitably affected our final judgment of the Nintendo proposal. Once the appropriate phone is unlocked, it will be possible to scan an amiibo card to invite the corresponding villager to Tom Nook's office. Happy Home Designer ~contains~ all the inhabitants seen in the previous Animal Crossings, plus some brand new ones, for a total of over one hundred citizens, but it is very clear that none of them are closed to the player: sooner or later they will all show up, in the office or in the square, and the possession of an amiibo card simply anticipates the meeting, allowing you to access the apartment of a certain inhabitant and change it immediately, without waiting for it to bethe game to offer it to you, as well as to save the template on the card itself to physically exchange it with friends. For fans who, over the years, have grown fond of the various inhabitants, it is certainly a small incentive to buy the card packs, but their usefulness essentially ends there: the player, at most, can use an amiibo card to invite the corresponding citizen in the house of another inhabitant so that they can interact, but it will always be a limited and uninteresting interaction compared to what was seen, for example, in New Leaf. Amiibo cards also allow you to assign the corresponding characters to specific public buildings, so that they work as clerks at the supermarket or teach at school. Each pack also contains a special card depicting an iconic character from the series, such as K. K. Slider, Tom Nook himself or the irascible Resetti: amiibo cards are the only way to interact with these characters and furnish their homes, which it's a bit daunting since it basically crosses the very fine line of microtransaction. From this point of view, it is very probable that the Animal Crossing amiibo figurines that will be released in the future will also unlock something in Happy Home Designer, although at the moment the only amiibo figurine capable of doing so is the Super Smash Bros. ., which adds its golden monument to the catalogue. In other words, even from this point of view, Happy Home Designer seems to address an even more restricted niche of players, that of super fans willing to buy packs - and maybe spend a little more on rare cards, as happens with trading card game - just to be able to fill their photo album with screenshots taken in the company of the inhabitants or mascots they love the most.", "date": "2015-09-22", "grade": "6.5"}
