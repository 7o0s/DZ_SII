{"name": "Assassin's Creed Director's Cut Edition - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition-recensione.html", "text": "Let's take it from afar. Taking a tour of the forums, discussion groups, chats and anything else dedicated to Assassin's Creed, an almost complete split in judgments appears evident: on the one hand there are those who deeply hate it, finding it boring and repetitive, on the other there are those who they love it and praise it in no uncertain terms. In between there are, however, those who have enjoyed it discreetly but, although they cannot be expressed in too negative terms, they are not even able to exalt themselves that much. Those who make peremptory statements like: ~I played it twenty minutes, it bored me and I gave up~ let's not even consider them because they have probably seen at most a few videos, since it takes more than an hour to fully enter the game and begin to see how much it really has to offer. This introduction serves not so much to soften spirits or prevaricate, as to affirm that we are talking about a complex game that can be looked at from several points of view, all valid even if very distant from each other and not automatically contradictory, especially if placed all together on a bigger picture. But let's go in order that there are really many things to say. The beauty of slipping inside strange machines Altair's adventures begin without Altair. The whole game is justified and driven by an intuition that we don't hesitate to define as brilliant: the different missions are nothing more than memories ~extracted~ from the head of a contemporary assassin, from a mysterious society that we will learn more about by playing. In reality, the narrative cue is not very original, but it is the implementation that suggests how much attention has been paid to justifying each element visible on the screen without making it heavily alien to the context: in the phases that take place in the present there is no interface, if not the writings that appear from time to time and that could have been avoided. In the game phases, which as already mentioned are memories, the interface visible on the screen is actually the result of the computer that is ~reading~ the memories of our contemporary. What may seem like a secondary element is actually of primary importance for understanding the level of involvement produced, which in this way justifies one of its essential elements, making it structural to the very likelihood of what is being narrated. This all-narrative expedient allows you to curb the inevitable estrangement due not so much to the interface itself, but to the continuous messages that appear on the screen to guide the player's deeds. the developers have created a combat system that allows you to use a single move to win each fight The beauty of slipping inside strange machines Altair is a talented and undisciplined assassin who must regain the trust of his lost sect after an unfortunate fact caused by his ruthlessness. From this point on we will have to relive his adventures which will lead him to carry out some excellent murders in the three cities reproduced by the developers (Damascus, Acre and Jerusalem). Our hero can jump, cling to ledges, hide, blend in among groups of scholars and fight with various weapons (a short sword, throwing knives and his fists, as well as a hidden knife with which he can kill his victims by stealthily attacking them). The inevitable contrast Breathtaking What Assassin's Creed excels in and far surpasses any competitor is not so much in its spectacularity, which in any case is at the highest levels, as in the ability to represent living and pulsating cities, perhaps a little too populated, but which make the idea of the image that a thousand stories have formed about the great oriental cities of the Middle Ages. In fact, from the point of view of environmental reconstruction, fantastic but plausible, Assassin's Creed is second to none. Just as it does not fear comparisons in the interaction between the character and the surrounding environment. We are not talking about things to do as much as the responses of the characters to the conformation of the play area. Altair reacts in real time to environmental stimuli and always produces coherent responses without offering absurd and far-fetched outputs Breathtaking Altair runs, jumps on fences, climbs buildings, clings to small ledges, lets himself fall, hangs on wooden beams and performs dozens of other actions with a naturalness never experienced in a video game. In this sense, it is fair to speak of an evolution of what has already been seen in the recent Prince of Persia trilogy, albeit with due proportions because those titles were extremely more linear in the composition of the scenarios, not too muchor structurally different from the original Prince of Persia. Here, however, Altair reacts in real time to environmental stimuli and always produces coherent responses without offering absurd and far-fetched outputs. From this point of view, we consider the criticisms made of too many automations quite senseless, given that we do not see other ways to create something similar but more ~manual~. Agreements and disagreements Another of the criticisms leveled at the game is that of the lack of variety. Ubisoft has tried to remedy by adding four more tests: one in which you have to kill archers without being seen; another in which you have to destroy the stalls in the market; yet another in which you have to escort an assassin and, finally, a race on the roofs. These are interesting additions but they certainly don't distort what has already been seen in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions. However, let's say that adding new things is always nice, especially if it is well integrated into the game as in this case. The most appreciable change is instead the one that allows you to travel in the various cities without having to pass through the intermediate connection area. But this only after having visited them at least once (therefore from memory block 4 onwards). This is a very welcome little change, especially for those who are not flag hunters. For the rest, everything has remained the same: the panoramic points are there, as well as the inhabitants to be saved, the aforementioned flags to be found and the various missions to be carried out to get information on the main objective of each mission. From a technical point of view Assassin's Creed is truly impressive and the graphics engine is capable of producing some of the most beautiful views ever seen in the history of video games. From this point of view, one can only applaud the work done by the developers, even if such grace costs a lot in terms of performance and if you don't have a fairly pumped computer, you will be forced to curtail many details. On the computer used for the test (which you will find detailed in the specific box) the game did not cause fluidity problems, but tested on a 3.4 GHz P4 with 2 GB of RAM and a GeForce 7800 GT the situation worsened dramatically forcing us to set the details to a minimum. Comment It's difficult to rate Assassin's Creed, which is why we decided to confirm the grade given to the console versions when evaluating this PC conversion. On the one hand, you are bewitched by the impeccable construction and attention to detail, on the other, you remain dumbfounded by some design choices that greatly penalize the game (especially the ease of fighting). For the rest, it is a product that certainly deserves to be played, even with all the controversies that such a statement could generate.
