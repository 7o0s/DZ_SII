It seems as if there is a mad desire to take the industry back in time, going to work on those now abandoned or marginalized genres. These small titles, often painstakingly edited by solitary authors, true enthusiasts arguing against what video games have become in recent years, now represent a genre in its own right, which, if desired, can be divided into as many sub-genres as there were those that populated the NES first and then the Super NES, which is the starting point of the thread of nostalgia that leads to this evident and splendidly decadent rejection of the modern. Sean Hogan and Jonathan Kittaka are two huge fans of The Legend of Zelda series, to the point of having wanted to make their own version. Anodyne is the result of their joint effort and it is not difficult to see echoes of Link's Awakening and A Link to the Past in it. In short, the ambition seems really big. It remains to be seen whether the fruits of so much love are excellent, barely edible or totally rotten. In dreamland Anodyne begins with an incredulous protagonist, a certain Young, who has to fight enemies with a broom in his dreams. From the initial phases, surreal and unconventional, a plot will unfold that will see him face a world full of pitfalls and Zelda-like dungeons, made up of levels linked only by a hub area that guarantees access to the different fragments of the dream world of the game. In his dreams Young seems to have to save the world, but soon we are faced with the fragments of what his real life is, shown through cartoons, in which sequences apparently not related to the game appear. In short, we are faced with a turnaround, heroism becomes escape, pure action takes on a vein of horror and unexpected questions begin to emerge from the narrative fabric, brought by seemingly meaningless characters, capable of building a plot that thickens strongly in the end, where every choice finally finds its place in a more coherent context, which still leaves different openings for the player to interpret. Someone might find some advanced moments of the story meaningless, but in reality it is enough to make a minimum interpretative effort to discover that every single cartoon is part of an overall design that takes on more and more strength and feeds on contrasts. Of course, if you are one of those who expect pre-chewed interpretations of everything and who panic if some details remain obscure, it is better that you avoid Young's adventures completely. As in all the best works, even here a certain mental investment is required to be able to understand the meaning of what is being told. Vintage If we deprived Anodyne of its fascinating plot, there would be nothing left but a clone of Zelda that follows all the game mechanics quite slavishly, both in the fights and in the construction of the levels. So expect to have to take down a number of enemies with sword (broom) blows in dungeons crammed with puzzles to solve to get ahead. Nothing very complicated, but more than a few minute is lost looking for a way to overcome some sections. There is no shortage of explicit quotes, just as there is no lack of new equipment that accompanies the growth of the hero in his adventures, even if basically the upgrades do not involve major changes to the general mechanics. Among the various things to do, you also have to collect fifty cards scattered throughout the levels. Unfortunately, this is the weakest content of the whole game, capable of breaking the rhythm forcing you to retrace your steps several times to go hunting for the precious objects (essential to move forward). A mechanic that lengthens broth like this does not go well with the narrative density of which we have already spoken to you extensively, which is somewhat weakened, especially in the event that you end up going around in circles looking for a missing card. However, this is a minor flaw that can annoy, but that doesn't ruin what remains an excellent game sold at a budget price and packaged in truly valuable pixel art graphics. Obviously you will technically appreciate it if you are among those who love the style of 16-bit Japanese RPGs, otherwise you will hardly be able to digest all those colored pixels.", "date": "2013-04-25", "grade": "8.0"}
