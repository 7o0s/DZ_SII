Contrary to expectations, Grido di Libert instead proved to be a rather substantial content, which certainly cannot be accused of dishonesty towards the buyer, moreover not without content and narrative merits. Yet, ironically, it fails to totally convince, above all due to a fundamental antithesis with respect to the considerable progress made by Black Flag compared to its predecessor. In fact, if there is a feature that made Edward Kenway's adventures particularly enjoyable, it is the great sense of freedom that accompanied his raids, combined with a good number of side activities to the main story, and these peculiarities are mostly put by part of this expansion. On the other side of the coin, however, we must give credit to the developers for having made an effort not only to write a story worthy of being told, but also to have based the peculiarities of the gameplay firmly on it. As will become clear by now, Freedom Cry is not an easy expansion to evaluate, and is almost certainly destined to divide both critics and fans. Cry of Freedom is certainly a quality content, yet destined to be discussed Adwal We had already stated that the Jackdaw quartermaster was a very interesting character in the Black Flag review phase, and choosing him as the protagonist of Freedom Cry is undoubtedly a good choice on the part of Ubisoft. Fifteen years have passed since the raids of Kenway and Thatch, but the Caribbean Sea is still shaken by deep conflicts. From humble quartermaster, Adwal has risen to ship captain and member of the Assassin cult, although his personal aims are decidedly different from Kenway's. Although his ship flies the black flag, raids and raids represent the least of his interests, aimed instead at the fight against slavery. As easily understood from the title, the plot of the first Black Flag DLC is entirely dedicated to the horrors of the slave trade, with the new protagonist seriously intending to undermine the status quo with subterfuge, and, on occasion, cannon fire. In fact, the delicate narrative theme becomes important also from the point of view of the gameplay, with the approximately five hours of plot dotted with activities concerning the liberation of the prisoners. From the new city of Port Au Prince (Haiti) to the plantations that dot the unprecedented archipelago proposed by the DLC, the player will find himself constantly called to free as many slaves as possible, both by attacking the mansions, with the task of eliminating, silently or blatantly , a certain number of guards, both targeting the vessels dedicated to the transport of slaves, which will naturally be left unharmed, and instead attacking the military escort ships. The number of slaves freed from the beginning of the plot will be constantly controllable in special menus, and small additions can be made simply by wandering around the city of Port Au Prince, where it will often happen to come across prisoners chased by slavers, or in sales of laborers to auction, which can be blatantly interrupted by releasing the inmates from their cages. As it is easy to understand, the emotional side is very strong in Cry of Freedom, and represents a non-negligible enthralling element throughout the plot. Although not as talkative, Adwal therefore proved to be fully capable of holding his own against Kenway, while it must be recognized that Freedom Cry lacks a good supporting actor, of which the original game abounded. Xbox 360 goals Cry of Freedom allows the unlock of 6 achievements, 4 normal and 2 hidden, for a total of 170 Gamerscore points. Some are related to the completion of the plot, but to have them all it will be necessary to free many slaves and kill in particular ways. Freedom? As already mentioned, the liberation of the slaves is the theme around which not only the plot revolves, but also the gameplay itself of all the DLC, to the point of also affecting the unlock system. In addition to any raw materials and money, to buy equipment, weapons and upgrades for the ship it will also be necessary to have freed a certain number of slaves, up to several hundred. The narrative forcing is evident, and perhaps not too elegant (it almost seems that Adwal frees the slaves for personal gain), but looking beyond the surface, the ploy is functional to the gameplay, also considering the fact that the mechanics linked torelease of prisoners do not bore, especially in the case of plantations. Some news also from the point of view of the equipment, both purely aesthetic (Adwal's main weapon is a machete, and some animations have been revised accordingly), and with practical implications. At the disposal of the former quartermaster there are in fact some new tools, such as firecrackers, excellent for distracting even large groups of guards for some precious seconds, and, for the first time in the saga, a weapon very similar to a shotgun. Devastating from close range, the blunderbuss is not exactly a refined diversion but, used at the right time, it can make a difference compared to traditional methods. As for the design of the missions, with the exception of the activities related to the slave trade, the approximately five hours of duration of Cry of Freedom do not reserve any other particular surprises. We note the attempt to propose some indoor activities, such as listening to conversations, but without particular verve. And here we come to the main defect of Freedom Cry, namely the lack of that remarkable sense of openness that had characterized, and made Black Flag unique. Confined to a small archipelago stingy with secondary activities, and mostly forced to follow the plot (unless it's about freeing slaves), the player feels, if anything, a certain constraint, which has little to do with the spirit of the main game. It's a shame, especially if you consider the efforts made, successfully, to give Adwal his own dimension in which to move, and, above all, the emotional drives that manage for once not to be cloying or artificial. From a technical point of view, the game has the same characteristics as Black Flag, although the optimization has not turned out to be as good. Some bugs, both related to artificial intelligence and of an environmental nature, accompanied the short adventure, certainly to a greater extent than seen in the original game. The autosave system with close checkpoints saved us from great frustrations, allowing us to easily return to a slightly earlier point, but we are still confident in the release of corrective patches. Assassin's Creed IV: Freedom Cry is a controversial add-on. On the one hand there is an excellent quality creation, capable of staging a credible story, an interesting and very different protagonist from its predecessor, and above all of aligning the narrative expedients with those of the gameplay, in a remarkable and successful amalgam. In all this, however, one of the most important elements in relation to the success of Black Flag is missing, namely the great freedom in the hands of the player. By force of circumstances, the purchase advice is therefore limited to those accustomed to even more linear experiences, who, in this case, will discover a good story accompanied by the classic gameplay of the series, alongside a pleasant and engaging mechanic linked to the slave trade. On the other hand, those who find that Black Flag could not even exist without the sense of freedom that accompanies its adventures will hardly be able to fully appreciate Freedom Cry, beyond its undeniable merits.", "date": "2013-12-23", "grade": null}
