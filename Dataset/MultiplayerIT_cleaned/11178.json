{"name": "Dewy's Adventure", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dewys-adventure.html", "text": "Video game enthusiasts can now say they've seen it all: mustachioed plumbers battling turtles, hedgehogs running at the speed of sound, cities infested with zombies, you name it. Yet Konami has managed to amaze everyone with Dewy's Adventure, available for Nintendo Wii for several months and just translated into an interesting mobile version. The protagonist of the game, in fact, is not an anthropomorphic animal or some bizarre humanoid character, but a drop of dew, which must ~slide~ through the various levels and possibly defeat the enemy on duty. Dewy can count on the ability to change shape according to its temperature, passing from the initial liquid state to the solid (ice) or aeriform (cloud) state, in accordance with the temperature of the state: if we are on a snowy expanse, our little drop will be forced to turn into ice, just as it will become a cloud if the place where it is located is very hot. The multiple value of such a particular character has also been maintained in the mobile version of the game, which however relies on simplified mechanics compared to what was seen on the Wii: the control of the setting via the inclination of the Wii-mote has been replaced by a system of inertial movement, which however concerns only the Dewy. Our drop can move by acting on the directions of the d-pad, jump and attack using the 5 and 0 key, while the * and # keys are used to change shape into ice or cloud, depending on the case. Passing from the liquid composition to the solid or gaseous one does not translate into a simple aesthetic factor, but brings with it important differences: in the form of ice, Dewy is heavier, it can count on a sort of ~dive attack~ (button 0) and can rotate on itself to eliminate enemies, becoming a kind of drill; as a cloud, on the other hand, it is clearly lighter and less affected by slippery surfaces, while it can fight by throwing lightning. Each stage is organized to contain a certain number of objects, the collection of which goes hand in hand with the percentage of completion of the level. It is possible to reach the exit without collecting practically anything, or to seek access to all objects, even when it results in a long research and study operation. The game puts us in front of a series of enemies, which must be eliminated in different ways depending on the form we assume, and which alternate with big bosses at the end of each ~world~: defeating them is not a very complicated operation, even if you have to pay attention to their modus operandi. For the rest, it is the inertial system that dictates the law, with its ascents and descents, which can slam Dewy to one side or the other and make him fall into bottomless abysses. You have to pay close attention to the most inaccessible areas, acting on the d-pad only as strictly necessary to produce the movement we need to overcome a certain area... The graphics of the game are excellent, above all for the fluidity of scrolling, among the best that have been seen in a mobile video game. And the rest doesn't disappoint either: the sprites are very well drawn, and Dewy himself can boast three different shapes and as many sets of animations. The enemies are all very basic in appearance, apart from the bosses, and the use of color overall is great. The stages suffer only in a limited way from a certain repetitiveness of the elements, and make up for it with a good diversification between the locations. The sound consists of a series of good MIDI music, a pity that the volume is not adjustable independently from the phone. PRO Colorful and fluid graphics Gameplay with a certain thickness Good number of internships AGAINST The inertial system can give some problems Cumbersome fights Sometimes frustrating", "date": "2008-09-23", "grade": "S.V."}
