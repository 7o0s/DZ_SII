Announced at the beginning of last year, it is in all respects a Collectible Card Game, a completely free collectible card game based on the Warcraft universe (more specifically, on that of World of Warcraft). The excellent work of the Irvine software house is all poured into the excellent gameplay design where the player is taken by the hand and guided through a long tutorial to become familiar with the mechanics and peculiarities of this card game. In fact, Hearthstone tries to differentiate itself from the great competition represented not only by the heavyweight of the genre, Magic the Gathering but also and above all by a series of titles which, especially on the iPad, have seen the light and conquered important market shares thanks to ideas and solutions very interesting gameplay. Let's talk about the various Shadow Era rather than SolForge which on tablets have managed, in some cases, to be even more attractive than the Duels of the Planeswalker series by Wizards of the Coast. However, in this review we will not focus on the functioning of Hearthstone, on its mechanics and on the peculiarities of the gameplay, as well as on the actual quality of the balance and of the whole product: for all this information, we refer you to the articles that you find a little further down, in the box. In the article we will instead focus on the characteristics of the iPad version and therefore on the quality of the conversion. Hearthstone also comes to iPad and of course it was love at first sight! For all information about the game If you want to deepen your knowledge of Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, we refer you to our in-depth review of the game where we explain in detail what are the strengths and the inevitable defects of this production. Furthermore, we recommend that all those intending to try the game take a look at our special guide with the most useful tips to familiarize yourself with the gameplay and avoid the most common mistakes. Portable quality Let's start off by saying that Blizzard has done a perfect job of porting Hearthstone to the iPad. From a technical point of view, graphics and sound the game is practically identical to the PC and Macintosh versions. Of course, we must take into consideration that the game, by its very nature, cannot be considered a production of incredible technological depth, but nevertheless it is always positively surprising to see a product running on a mobile platform with such a result. And among other things it must also be recognized that a tablet, for a game of this kind, is practically the perfect platform both for its great portability (and we know well how much a card game can be enjoyed in the best possible way around or in ~ less usual than a classic desk) both for the support of a touch-type interface and in card games it is a natural evolution of what happens with ~physical~ card games. As if that weren't enough, Hearthstone is perfectly cross platform and this means that you can easily challenge all your friends and a huge number of strangers, regardless of the system they are running the game on. Cross platform nature that also extends to the management of Battle.net, Blizzard's digital delivery and social interaction platform, which is perfectly integrated into the iPad version of the title and allows you to chat with friends on the list at any time, start the fly a game with them if they're already playing Hearthstone or see what other title from the house of Irvine they're spending their hours with. Wanting to be really picky, there are some small aspects of this version that have not convinced us to the end, but these are clearly microscopic details that for many may seem insignificant. First of all Heartstone on the iPad mini Retina test takes quite a long time to load, especially when starting the game and starting a match. Nothing extreme but you will certainly notice a difference if you have already played extensively on PC. At the same time we must always keep in mind that as soon as the Apple device goes into stand-by (the time obviously depends on the setting that has been set in the device system preferences), Hearthstone instantly disconnects interrupting any game that was being played and effectively forcing you to start over from the beginning. It is obvious that a ~problem~ of this kind is extremely dependent on the habits of using the iPad, but it happened quite often that we were absent for a few minutes, perhaps during a game oftraining or during the preparation of a deck, to promptly find ourselves in front of the error screen. We would not have minded having some additional settings to configure the game interface and touch management to a minimum. In fact, most of Hearthstone's mechanics provide for the ~dragging~ of the targets or areas of effect of cards and spells and on some occasions we have happened to get the target wrong, especially in conditions of great crowding of the board. For example, being able to set up the interface in such a way that it becomes possible to select targets with single touches, rather than moving the finger along the screen, could solve a certain type of ~fatigue~. Similarly, it seems that the appearance of a card's information, its special abilities for instance, has been designed for left-handed users since the pop-up always happens to the right of the selection. And not infrequently we have had to move the fingers or change the angle of the right hand in order to read what had appeared written underneath it. But, as also mentioned above, these are small flaws that do not alter a top-level gaming experience in the least and which seems to have been designed from the first minute to give its best on tablets. The Curse of Naxxramas This is the title of the first add-on pack that Blizzard has announced in recent weeks and which will probably be released within the next two to three months. The add-on will contain a sort of single player mode called Adventure which will see the player challenge real computer-controlled bosses with the aim of unlocking new cards (which will be between twenty and thirty). Apparently there will also be some new features that will be implemented in the gameplay. The Curse of Naxxramas will be released in episodes: one wing of the dungeon per week with the first wing free and the other four must be purchased with in-game money or real money. Finally, we remind you that Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft will also be released in the second half of the year on iPhone and Android.", "date": "2014-04-22", "grade": "8.8"}
