Sequel to that Monster Hunter Stories released in 2017 on Nintendo 3DS, the new game is a turn-based RPG that offers a different perspective compared to the traditional hunts to which we have dedicated hundreds of hours, drawing heavily on the mother series in many aspects, from gameplay to design of monsters, weapons and armor. The first episode - which spawned a spin-off for mobile systems and an animated series - was a very solid RPG that challenged the technical limits of the old portable console and now Capcom is trying it again with the same formula: it's been almost five years, it will work too this time? Find out in our Monster Hunter Stories 2 review. History and technical sector If you have played the demo or even seen the trailers of Monster Hunter Stories 2, then you know that the protagonist is a young man - or a young woman, the character you create at the beginning of the game - Rider of the village of Mahana who inherits from the deceased grandfather a strange puppy of Rathalos. In what is a kind of extravagant retelling of E.T., ours will have to prove, together with a brave Wyvernian named Ena and the bizarre Felyne who calls himself Navirou, that the razor sharp is harmless and is certainly not the prophesied monster that will cause a catastrophe with its infamous Wings of Destruction, although every indication suggests otherwise. We tell you right away that it is not necessary to have played the first Monster Hunter Stories to understand the plot of this sequel, but it certainly helps: as you continue in the game, the references become more and more frequent and many characters from the past return, including some that that naughty Capcom didn't show you even a glimpse in her highly spoilery trailers. Monster Hunter Stories 2: what Monstie will be in this egg? Monster Hunter Stories 2 will never make you weigh these connections and, indeed, sometimes the characters themselves will tell you the background through dialogues or flashbacks. The Capcom title will certainly not win a Nobel for literature, but it is damned well written and, above all, it characterizes the characters around the silent protagonist with care and delicacy, without falling into the usual stereotypes of Japanese animation. It has only one problem: the structure of the campaign tends to dilute the narrative into blocks of missions that at times seem just to take time. Each time you reach a new hub city, you'll find yourself solving a series of tasks that take you to explore all the relevant areas of the region before the story twist that takes you to the next city, where you start this cycle all over again. Monster Hunter Stories 2: These Mysterious Riders hunt Ratha Ratha. The missions in question, although fully justified by the script, essentially serve to make you fight new monsters in the different maps, a bit like it happens in a traditional Monster Hunter, but they are also an excuse to get to know better the characters who will accompany you from time to time. time. Here, it's worth mentioning that Monster Hunter Stories 2's story starts off stealthily, then picks up momentum and slows heavily into a central tranche of Avinia-focused missions that players of the prequel will be familiar with. It is probably the weakest chapter of the game, but also the only one in which the flashbacks are not animated cinematics, but still images described by a narrative voice that immediately made us think of the problems that COVID must have caused to the development of the game. Monster Hunter Stories 2: The maps outside are huge. After that short parenthesis, however, Monster Hunter Stories 2 resumes an excellent pace up to the end credits, which we reached after about forty hours of play. What surprised us positively were not only the twists and turns that follow one another in the second part of the adventure, but the quality of the direction in the many interlude cinematics, which really does a lot in terms of involvement. In those moments, it almost seems like watching an anime, the shots, angles and expressiveness of monsters and characters are so accurate. It's just a pity that on Nintendo Switch these films run at 20 frames per second: they are stable and there are no slowdowns, but they are not as fluid as we would have liked. Frame rate is an issue that the game drags on throughout its duration. It's stable in combat, where you can even speed up animations by up to two times, but Capcom doesn't.it locked to 30 frames and this is reflected in a general feeling of heaviness as you move around the vast and complex maps in which the world is divided. Monster Hunter Stories 2: the protagonist and Alwin against a Nargacuga. Despite this, Monster Hunter Stories 2 is also a pleasure to play in portable mode, but it is yet another demonstration that the Nintendo hardware is on its last legs. In this sense, the recent announcement of an OLED revision that does not improve the machine's performance appears even more controversial. In any case, thanks to an amazing artistic direction and obsessive attention to detail, Monster Hunter Stories 2 is a game with extraordinary eye. The maps are huge, colorful and geometrically complex, and the animations of monsters and characters show off an excellent quality especially in the fights, where the Capcom artists have really worked hard, continually winking at the mother series, but contextualizing every skill, attack or situation in the dynamics of a turn-based JRPG. The circle is closed by the beautiful music and the good level dubbing in English. Of course, the game is subtitled in Italian, but it's a pity for some typos that escaped the quality control. Combat system Monster Hunter Stories 2: One of the first fights in the game. If you've played the demo or read our previous sample of Monster Hunter Stories 2, then you should know the basics of the combat system that Capcom has focused on a Chinese pen-style balance of forces. Monster Hunter Stories 2 may seem like a fairly simple game at first. After all, you just need to choose the right Monstie to oppose to your opponent: if the latter uses Power-type attacks, for example, it will be appropriate to deploy a Monstie that uses Speed-type ones, so as to win head-on battles, also called Head to Head. head or TaT, cancel the enemy attack and charge the bond gauge faster which allows the use of more powerful special abilities. The Monstie usually acts on his own, but we can give him orders if we don't like his intentions, before giving away to the next turn by choosing not only the type of attack our Rider will launch, but also the weapon he will use. The different parts of a monster's body are more or less vulnerable to the three types that weapons are divided into: cutting, piercing and impact. Monster Hunter Stories 2: Tsukino is a Felyne ninja. They are introductory JRPG rules that the most experienced fans of the genre will assimilate in a few minutes, but we can assure you that Monster Hunter Stories 2 is not a title to be underestimated, and the combat system has reserved us quite a few surprises. As the adventure continues, things get more complicated. The monsters, especially the bosses, tend to alternate different phases in which the types of attacks completely change, following a pattern that somehow recalls their behavior in the mother series, and which will force us to continuously replace our Monstie on the field to adapt to the situation. Some monsters are made up of multiple body parts that you will need to destroy to weaken or even damage them, not to mention that most of the fights will see us face a large monster together with one or two smaller, but no less annoying creatures. We will then have to start taking elemental weaknesses into consideration, choosing our weapons and protections accordingly, and resorting to useful tools such as traps or bombs to interrupt the most lethal attacks. Monster Hunter Stories 2: Kyle is a novice hunter. The introduction of the battle partner or partner then further enlivens the situation, and the different game dynamics begin to intersect more and more, forcing us to strategically evaluate each turn. We can't control the partner at all - who if he's a Rider he'll fight together with a Monstie, otherwise he'll be alone - and so we'll have to take into account his intentions, the weapon he's wielding and his fighting style. If we see that it targets a certain target with a specific type of attack, we could decide to do the same to trigger a Double attack that will inflict much more damage, while our Monstie deals with another enemy or focuses on the same one. In some cases, we will have to choose whether to stay on our Monstie for a few more turns or immediately consume all the accumulated Bond to launch a devastating combined Bond Ability together with the partner. Monster Hunter Stories 2: Ena entrusts you with the sharp Ratha egg at the beginning of the adventure. The combat system of Monster Hunter Stories 2, as you may have guessed, divasnt deeply strategic, especially in the last chapters of the game where the monsters beat very hard and it is not enough to upgrade weapons and armor to win. The clashes last much longer than in a normal JRPG, and it is for this reason that the maps are not teeming with monsters that continually block our way, slowing down or frustrating exploration. Capcom has even implemented the possibility of instantly concluding fights against low-level enemies in order not to bore players who perhaps want to collect rare materials or complete side missions that have been pending for too long. This approach makes each fight more compelling and meaningful, especially when facing the bosses: often we will have to decide whether to get around the visible enemies or prepare for the fight in the best way, perhaps by manufacturing useful tools or changing the formation of the Monstie in the city stable, also because there is no real Game Over. Whenever our Rider or Monstie is defeated, they fully regenerate health but lose a heart, and once all three are lost they automatically return to the nearest town. Exploration and extra activities Monster Hunter Stories 2: riding a Tobi-Kadachi. In Monster Hunter Stories 2 there are essentially three types of explorable areas, outside of cities. Regions are open-air macro areas that connect every other type of map: they usually branch out into a multitude of exits that lead to smaller areas, basically what in a common JRPG we would call dungeons. Then there are the dens, which are divided into two types. The common and rare monster lairs are completely procedural: they appear randomly in the maps - sometimes only after we have forced a monster to retreat during a fight - and are made up of a random combination of rooms that form a cave in which we will find random monsters, chests, and collectibles. The named lairs are instead characterized by a rectangular entrance and are predefined both in the position on the map and in the internal structure. In these dungeons we will find chests that contain bottle caps, a currency to be exchanged for items, equipment and useful bonuses such as extra spaces in the city stable. Monster Hunter Stories 2: your grandfather Red in a flashback. While the other dungeons are mandatory to explore to continue the story, and often end with a specific boss to defeat, the lairs are completely optional. Inside them we will always find a nest from which we can steal at least one egg: characterized by a smell and a weight that determine the quality of the monster inside, the egg can then be hatched later in the city stable. The Monstie are not only used to fight, in fact, but also to deeply explore the different maps. Most species have one or two field abilities that allow them to reach otherwise inaccessible places: amphibians like the Zamtrios or Ludroth, for example, can swim across bodies of water, while more agile monsters like the Velocidrome or Zinogre can perform prodigious leaps and reach distant platforms. Tigrex, Kecha-Wacha and others can climb specific rock faces, while the Diablos family can dig a hole in specific spots to respawn elsewhere, leading us to chests and other collectibles. Monster Hunter Stories 2: a combat in multiplayer mode. Forming a balanced team of monsters doesn't just mean choosing them based on the types of attacks, but also on the usefulness they can have during exploration. Considering that you can only take six monsters with you, and one of these is mandatory Ratha Ratha for most of the game, you will certainly have to return to the dungeons with the right Monstie to open all the chests that you have not managed to reach. Fortunately, Monster Hunter Stories 2 relies on a very comfortable rapid movement system. In each map you will always find one or more Gattovane that will allow you to save the game and change the time of day between afternoon and evening, thus also altering the monsters that wander around. Above all, after unlocking a Gattovana, you can reach it at any time simply by opening the game map and choosing it from the list of those you have already discovered. Moving from one end of the world to the other is therefore very simple, even if not exactly very fast since you will always have to load each new area.
