{"name": "Il boss dei sotterranei", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/156234-dungeon-boss-il-boss-dei-sotterranei.html", "text": "A team of heroes and a series of dungeons to conquer, all with a view to a turn-based combat system borrowed from classic RPGs: this is the idea behind Dungeon Boss, the new title developed by Boss Fight Entertainment and produced from Big Fish Games, available in the traditional freemium format for iOS and Android devices. It is a game that takes you by the hand during the first missions, which act as a quick tutorial, and then leaves the user free to select the party members, upgrade them using the gold collected during expeditions and gradually face increasingly more enemies strong and determined. The experience is very simple, very ~compact~, and characterized by a surprisingly clear interface, which from the main screen allows you to access hero profiles to make any upgrades, collect the rewards of completed achievements and use a portal to evocation of objects and/or characters. Considering that the slots available for the team are far from numerous, almost immediately you find yourself having to make some difficult choices: do you carry the healer or the support unit that energizes your teammates? Confirm the mighty hammer-wielding Viking and bow-wielding warrior, or replace one of them with the slow-but-deadly Dark Reaper? Dungeon Boss is a simple and immediate RPG, fun for a while but with too many limitations Final clash! The scenarios change and the paths that lead us to face the bosses of each area gradually lengthen, however in terms of a structure that offers little else besides the fights: in Dungeon Boss all we have to do is take advantage of the available shifts to eliminate opponents and move on to the next wave, up to defeating the boss (or bosses). The basic attacks of each character are accompanied by special moves capable of inflicting serious damage, but which require a few turns to be able to recharge once performed. To accompany the expeditions there is the management of one's dungeon, which is activated after reaching level 10 and sees us organize the base to best accommodate any invaders, a feature now all the rage in the mobile sector. The formula works very well for a couple of hours, despite the obvious limitations of a gameplay that grants little even to strategic possibilities (the turn order is fixed, with few exceptions), but the problems of Dungeon Boss are others. With all the freemium titles that are on the App Store and Google Play, in fact, a quick look at the new Big Fish production is enough to understand where it is going: where victory or defeat in a fight depends exclusively on the strength of the characters in field, it is clear that a certain type of balancing of the difficulty is destined to drag the experience on the tracks of the most boorish monetization. Even more so considering that you manage to collect much more gold than you can use to upgrade your warriors, which after a while proves frustrating. However, the pleasantness of a simple and colorful RPG remains, very nice from a graphic point of view, certainly immediate and fun until you hit the paywall.", "date": "2015-09-19", "grade": "7.0"}
