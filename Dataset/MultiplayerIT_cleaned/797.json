{"name": "Burnout Legends", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/burnout-legends.html", "text": "A portable compilation This Burnout Legends, as the name itself suggests, is therefore a sort of tribute to the series, an unpublished episode by setting, but certainly not by content. The game structure, although all the tracks and cars of the first three incarnations of the popular franchise are present, faithfully refers to that of Burnout 3: Takedown, not only in terms of gameplay, but also in terms of menu and various sub-aspects. The fulcrum is therefore represented by the World Tour mode, that is, a series of races, set around the world, each of which is associated with particular objectives, which completely will yield the player a medal, which can be gold, d silver or bronze depending on the results obtained. The range of objectives is quite wide: it starts from having to complete a race, or a mini-championship made up of a handful of them, finishing third at most, or having to complete a lap through a circuit within a set time, however it is not certain this is what makes the Burnout series so special. Where the game really makes the difference is in fact the particular importance that is given to accidents: some races, very appropriately called Furia Stradale, for example will require us to cause a certain number of them to the other competitors in the race to be completed successfully, through furious sessions at the counter or any other sneaky trick we can think of. Crash-type tests, on the other hand, provide us with a particularly crowded stretch of road (usually an intersection), leaving us with the task of planning a way to throw ourselves into the middle and cause as much damage as possible, making the most of the aids (such as turbos and explosions, but the multipliers have fortunately disappeared compared to the past, guilty of making life too much easier for the player) scattered along the route. As an incentive for the player to abandon fair play and indulge in destructive behavior even in the most ~classic~ races, the appropriate bar obviously could not be missing, a true symbol of the series, which gradually fills up with each criminal maneuver performed , and which can be exchanged at any time for a few seconds of extra speed. The work done in the adaptation was certainly excellent, and the feeling of the series has remained practically unchanged in the transition to a portable console, however it should be noted that this process was not painless, and some compromises were necessary to create the title on PSP hardware. The most important undoubtedly concerns the decrease in the number of cars that participate in the races at the same time, now down to four compared to the originally planned six, with rather obvious consequences on gameplay. Finding yourself competing with only three opponents, in fact, significantly lowers the frenzy of the race, especially in some types of races (Furia Stradale above all), an element that is actually fundamental for a title that makes accidents its strong point. Furthermore, the same idea of proposing a ~compilation~ episode may be unattractive to all those who have already thoroughly explored the previous Burnouts, and the possibility of having all the tracks and cars available in a single title for the first time ( considering that some tracks, especially the first episode, are not exactly the best) may not represent a sufficient stimulus to justify the purchase. Faster than light! The control system offers the player the ability to use both the analog stick and the digital cross to command the car, with the latter option proving to be by far the more efficient, overall ensuring faster and more responsive response. The layout of the keys is comfortable enough, however the obligation to associate the acceleration or the turbo to one of the backbones can lead to finger fatigue in the case of too long sessions. The graphic sector, on the contrary, is absolutely amazing, to the point that you immediately forget that you are playing on a portable console. The settings are the faithful re-proposition of those already seen on home consoles, very rich in details and quite varied in terms of assortment, able to whiz under our wheels at frightening speeds, especially once the fastest classes have been unlocked; for the cars, however, the remodeling work is more evident, but with excellent results nonetheless. The graphics engine moves everything at 30fps with some rare slowdown during the most agitated game situations, however it is afflicted by an annoying bug in the management of collisions with the seabed (in some, albeit rare, occassionsWhen the car crosses the backgrounds we find ourselves curling up in a greyish ~nothing~ which frankly we would have gladly done without. Finally, the small size of the screen does not compromise the experience as feared, generally allowing us to identify any obstacles that stand between us and victory quickly enough. As for the sound, it should be noted the presence of a rather full-bodied musical accompaniment and with rock themes as per tradition, although lower in quality than that of Burnout 3 and a little sacrificed if reproduced by the console speakers. The effects are normal, certainly not shining for variety, but at least there is no longer a trace of the unbearable spoken commentary of the previous episode. Longevity is guaranteed by the very high number of races that make up the World Tour mode, and the possibility of trying each of them individually still keeps interest in the game high, even after all the competitions have been successfully completed. Furthermore, the presence of a particularly rich multiplayer mode via wi-fi (unfortunately, no internet support), accessible even with a single copy via game sharing, can only confirm the excellent value of this portable debut of the Burnout series. Burnout Legends is an excellent title, in all probability one of the best purchases available for the portable jewel of the Sony house, however it fails to be that absolute masterpiece that many expected. The decision to lower the number of cars in the game to four, in particular, is the element we liked the least, and we would certainly have preferred to deal with a completely new episode rather than a compilation, however valid and complete , from previous incarnations of the series. In any case, it is an absolutely highly recommended purchase for every PSP owner, able to give hours and hours of healthy portable fun, both alone and in multiplayer. Pros: Graphically outstanding It's 100% Burnout, for the first time portable Very long-lived and replayable, especially in multiplayer Cons: You only compete against 3 opponents It's not a new episode, but a compilation of the previous ones A few bugs here and there in the engine graphic As per the now famous (and often discussed) Electronic Arts tradition, the arrival of a new incarnation of the Burnout series promptly turns into a multiplatform event, also touching the shores of mother Sony's new portable gem for the first time . However, unlike its ~little sisters~, which with Burnout Revenge saw the arrival of a completely new episode, the PSP sees itself dedicating a title that is a sort of collection of the previous Burnouts, Burnout 2: Point of Impact and Burnout 3 : Takedown, with the addition of some small innovations to adequately exploit the portability factor. Given the quality of the ~raw materials~, the result could only be top-level...", "date": "2005-10-20", "grade": null}
