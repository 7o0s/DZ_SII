Between the 90s and the beginning of the 2000s there was a broad movement which evidently saw a close connection between technological progress, speed, competition and anti-sporting violence. The origins of this wave go back almost thirty years ago, when F-Zero showed a stunned world the wonders of the Mode 7 fired at thousands of kilometers per hour, but since then the same concept has been used in other cases too, often to stage notable technological evolutions such as Crash N Burn on 3DO or Megarace at the dawn of the CD-ROM. The game that has perhaps enjoyed the greatest following and which still has its rivals is probably Wipeout, but there is a line of products that is less glamorous but no less appreciated by gamers, decidedly rougher in terms of aesthetics but all based on gameplay and competition, which could be defined as a sort of parallel and darker version of the aseptic titles that emerged from the tradition of Psygnosis. Just under the same label, Rollcage saw the light at the end of the 90s, developed by Attention to Detail and becoming a sort of cult game, certainly less popular than others but characterized by a hard core of enthusiasts who has further strengthened (and perhaps expanded) with the subsequent release of Rollcage: Stage 2, which emerged the following year also on PC and on the first PlayStation. The mention of these two titles is mandatory to introduce GRIP: Combat Racing, because the latter is not simply inspired by the series in question but is its real ~spiritual sequel~, a definition that has become increasingly common lately with the productions that have emerged in crowdfunding precisely because, often, these are projects carried out by the same authors of the original titles but forced to apply different names to the games in order not to run into copyright problems. GRIP: Combat Racing is to all intents and purposes the heir to Rollcage, developed by some of the authors of the original reunited in the Caged Element team and initially proposed through a crowdfunding that ended badly but fortunately taken up and completed with the support of Wired Productions. The racing of the future The idea is the classic one: in a more or less distant future, racing can no longer be based on strict regulations and fair play, because apparently the public needs something more sanguine. The races then take place on tracks characterized by various settings, aboard vehicles still on wheels but capable of reaching absolutely insane speeds and with the possibility of being able to destroy each other, to spice up the situation a bit. The selectable cars differ in shape and stats, offering as usual different options in terms of acceleration, maximum speed, armor and heaviness, while the power-ups are directly linked to the Mario Kart tradition, obviously with a more ski-related style. fi gloomy and destructive but remaining tied to the by now canonical effects of arcade racing (accelerations, simple missiles, homing missiles, mines, shields and among the alternatives also the equivalents of the ~blue shell~ and ~lightning bolt~ of the Mariesca tradition). Everything remains rather standardized on the typical canon of the genre, therefore, beyond the particularly heavy look of the technological elements proposed in this vision of the future, except for some peculiarities of the guide system which in fact influence the whole gameplay a bit. The peculiarity of GRIP: Combat Racing, borrowed from the Rollcage tradition, is the possibility of continuing to run safely even with the car overturned, since the top and bottom of the vehicle are symmetrical and the wheels are huge, therefore the direction in which find is not exactly influential with respect to continuing the race. This feature fits perfectly with the design of the tracks, which offer large tubular sections, parabolic curves and ramps capable of enhancing the possibility of tipping during the race. For those unfamiliar with the previous titles, imagine the scene: you are running beyond the speed of sound inside a tunnel, turning on the walls until you no longer realize which side is up and down, until get to the exit and realize that you are upside down, running on the ceiling. Not bad, if you manage to maintain a fairly regular trajectory (and it is possible to correct it even in flight, by deactivating the accelerator) you can simply launch yourself at full speed in upside down flight, with the possibility of continuing the run once landed, even if overturned . This feature intersects perfectly with the high speed that is possible ragearrive in the race and with the fast pace of the challenge with the competitors to the sound of power-ups, giving a very particular tone to a game that otherwise could be a bit flat and not very original, if seen only in its basic racing characteristics arcade game with power-ups in a futuristic setting. So many ways to crash There's a nice mix of game modes in GRIP: Combat Racing, and they really go out of their way to offer variations on a theme and alternatives to keep things interesting and avoid falling into monotony early. In addition to the Campaign, which arranges the races according to a progressive sequence to be followed, but without particular narrative meanings, there are a wide range of types of race to be undertaken both in single and in multiplayer, which in turn vary quite profoundly with the activation or otherwise of a series of options and regulations (especially for multiplayer games) which can lead to even profound changes to the gameplay. In principle, the subdivision is typical of arcade racing from the time of Mario Kart onwards between race and battle: the first takes place on a track based on the order of arrival, while the other takes place within various arenas and it is based on the physical destruction of the opponents in a sort of destruction derby, with a series of intermediate modes in the middle that favor one or the other characteristic gradually. The Corsa and Arena macro-modes are in turn divided into a series of different options, which reproduce some standard settings such as the simple race, the time attack, the elimination race, the one in which points are also awarded based on the destruction of the opponents in the first category or deathmatch, the time bomb or ~steal the loot~ in the Arena. There is also another particular sector, called ~Carkour~, which focuses on vehicle driving and aerial handling skills, offering various challenges that add almost platform elements to the standard racing dynamics, similar to Trackmania. Considering that all these modes can be tackled in both single and multiplayer, with the latter including online and split-screen for up to four players, it is easy to see how the possibilities of choice are truly vast and that GRIP: Combat Racing really does everything possible to offer a wide variety of alternative experiences around the classic racing game core. Obviously, the multiplayer is the real soul of the game, also due to an artificial intelligence that doesn't seem particularly advanced. Each completed race allows you to earn a certain amount of experience points which increase the player's level: this is mainly used to unlock new cars, with their peculiar statistics and additional customizations. However, the latter remain above all of an aesthetic nature, therefore there is no possibility of customizing the vehicle by acting on its basic characteristics and making it progress in terms of racing or battle capabilities, which makes the advancement between levels important experience especially to expand the available garage. Visions of the future The indie production is evident in the relative simplicity of the graphic system compared to titles from very different contexts, but in the arcade world the Caged Element game defends itself very well, also managing to propose its own particular style, capable of giving a certain identity to the game, especially as regards the dirty, heavy and ~material~ technological vision that emerges especially in the construction of the vehicles. The tracks may be a little simple compared to those found in realistic car racing games, but they are intended to allow you to reach supersonic speeds, not real driving experiences. In this sense, the track design is well studied to take advantage of the peculiarities of GRIP: Combat Racing driving, with ramps, tunnels and jumps strategically positioned to make the most of the overturning of the cars as an active element of the gameplay. There may not be a precise futuristic aesthetic, nor a design study to stimulate the choice of perfect trajectories as in the tradition of Wipeout, but the tracks here constantly offer detours, shortcuts and alternatives that adapt to different riding styles, resulting in a perhaps more confusing approach to the race (at least on some tracks) but also more varied and stimulating. Based on Unreal Engine 4, GRIP: Combat Racing exploits the typical effects of the Epic graphics engine but clearly prefers speed and fluidity to the complexity of the settings. The relative simplicity of thescenarios it then allows impressive speeds to be reached, while maintaining a certain consistency in terms of frame-rate: in the test configuration, which is not exactly high-end, with the frame-rate unlocked, the 60 frames per second are maintained rather convincing, although some dip is visible in stages with multiple vehicles on screen. As for the soundtrack, the game takes up the typical tradition of Rollcage and the like with the usual techno and drum n bass accompaniment, with choices that will probably make traditional fans of the genre happy.", "date": "2018-11-02", "grade": "8.0"}
