{"name": "Need for Speed Underground 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/need-for-speed-underground-2_a.html", "text": "2 Need 2 Speed The game puts us in the role of a tamarro expert in clandestine races who, after various triumphs, is cut out of the loop due to an enemy who causes him an accident. Some time later you will find yourself in the city of Bayview having to start over from scratch. This is, broadly speaking, the plot of Need for Speed Underground 2 which is narrated, as the game progresses, by comic cutscenes that vaguely resemble those seen in Max Payne. Furthermore, on the occasion of some races, in addition to comic-style films, some animations and game sequences are also presented, useful for better understanding the story. The big news this year is an entire city with over 200km of roads to explore, in a mode that is very reminiscent of Midnight Club 2. Wandering around you can find shops where you can buy car components (this time divided into categories and not all available in the same place), find other drivers to challenge in the chase mode (useful to raise money quickly), sign up for the different types of competitions and find any bonuses (such as money, useful information and other little things ...). The idea works well thanks to a very useful GPS system that allows you to choose your destination and thus be guided by an arrow on the screen that points the way. Ideal for not wandering for hours looking for the required shop. Added to this is the mobile phone on which you receive calls and SMS messages from the characters in the game. Then there is a slightly more simulative imprint on the entire production, with the introduction of a test bench for the machines and modifications to the individual components (such as the gear ratios) even if the racing remains distinctly arcade. The fleet has been expanded by a few models, for a total of about thirty cars (those who expected more will be disappointed) many of which are recycled from the first episode, but this shortage is partially compensated for by the enormous amount of additional elements. We are talking about billions (!) of combinations that hardly allow you to create two identical cars. This time the list of parts is very long: doors, mirrors and headlights of different colors have also been added in the external areas; inside we have stereo systems, colored neon, odometers! Plus the addition of hydraulic suspension to blow up our racing car! The big news this year is an entire city with over 200km of streets to explore 2 Need 2 Speed It will then be possible to go to photographers for a complete service on the car (in which all the doors can be opened to admire it completely). New modes have also been added: in addition to the classic races, the speed tests (renamed ~Shot~), we find the street X (a race on closed and narrow circuits in which you have to play dirty to win) and the downhill drift ( skid down hills). But interesting for general entertainment is a new artificial intelligence that finally makes mistakes and doesn't just go straight: the opposing pilots make mistakes, hinder each other and allow unexpected recoveries, increasing (when least expected) the chances of victory. Each race will therefore never be the same and fortunately you will not be forced to repeat too difficult races dozens of times. THX GAME vs. EAX extension The audio of the title is as exceptional as that of its predecessor: engines, rumbles, skids and above all accidents implemented in a more than realistic way. Once again the stringent criteria of George Lucas' THX were exceeded to ensure complete audio immersion. Passing at high speeds near objects or cars produces the classic hiss. Stupendous! The musical part is entrusted to more or less famous artists thanks to the support of EA Trax which sees the inclusion of songs by Snoop Dogg, Queen of the Stone Age, Xzibit, Ministry etc. for about thirty tracks. Unfortunately, even this time it is not possible to insert your own Mp3s during the races and there is no car radio mode to change tracks during the race. Sin. The only unconvincing thing is the noise of some cars (example above all the Pegeout 206) which, without any elaboration, show engines that are too gritty. Give me the damage The issue of damage to officially licensed cars remains one of the biggest controversies in the universe of driving games. According to programmers such as Poliphony (Gran Turismo), car manufacturers do not want to see their jewels fall apart or make people believe that they are not safe. Strangely, Project Ghotam 2 shows us that even Ferrari, if it wants, allows you to implement visible damage on the cars, albeit within certain limits. It goes that there is no officially licensed game in which cars disintegrate (Flatout uses invented cars) but theThe now desired damage model appears in all major productions. If you then make a comparison with the two direct competitors of Underground, or Juiced (now past) and Midnight Club 3 (coming soon) you notice a resounding defeat. Furthermore, both titles offer a much higher fleet of cars. So a question of money or time? It's okay that it's an arcade game, it's okay that Gran Turismo doesn't have one either (but it has 500 cars), but one can't help but criticize EA for this choice (which probably would have required more development time). The only breakage is that of the glass which, in the event of a collision, fills up with holes and then magically repairs itself a few seconds later. EA Online: I need more speed! The multiplayer provides the classic LAN or the game via the Internet, provided you register on the EA Online site. From here it will be possible to find and create servers where up to 4 players can challenge each other in all the illegality of night racing! Competing with human opponents is priceless and the unexpected is always lurking. The variety of elaborations will let you see hundreds of models decorated in the most different ways and it is practically impossible for someone to have a car that is the same as another! The huge variety of routes then makes the challenges always different and never boring. Fun and infinitely long-lived! Obviously it is a must to have a fast connection, otherwise there are very high lag and jerky races with cars that vanish into thin air. However, EA's support has improved and it has no difficulty finding suitable servers. Comment Despite certain similarities with its predecessor, NFS Underground 2 introduces fundamental innovations to refresh the series but leaves out some elements that partially undermine its fun: reduced fleet of cars and inferior to the competition, racing exclusively at night and total lack of damage, even just aesthetically. Apart from this we have a graphically satisfying and overall very enjoyable title. The huge amount of pieces allows unlimited customizations and the career offers a very welcome freedom of choice. The plot is certainly not fundamental but still enjoys excellent dubbing and some interesting developments. If you add an infinite multiplayer and variety of environments you will see that the longevity is very, very high. Recommended for all fans of tuning and arcade racing, while owners of the first version do not expect drastic changes but a package that is still worth buying. Pros: Fun and long-lived Graphically satisfying Almost infinite modifications Cons: No damage model Limited fleet Some flaws inherited from the first The reflection in the exhaust The excellent graphics are very reminiscent of the first NFS Underground, even if this time we have a very distant horizon and some more graphic effects. While running you try to enjoy every detail of the track even if you often notice the paucity of certain textures and some unfortunate choices that were also present in the first episode: the hopes of running at different times of the day have vanished, yes in fact, it always and only travels at night and in the long run the black gets tired (despite the effort of the programmers to vary the environments); also you don't see a soul in the city apart from the fans and pretty girls at the start of the competitions. It was not expected to invest passers-by as in GTA but at least some NPCs for a walk would have helped the general feeling. The only presences are the cars of the civilians (which could have been done without) which are basically the same as the previous game: the same taxi, the same milk van and the same blue car! Of course, wandering around you can find other tamarre cars but a little more variety would have helped the context. For the rest we find huge polygonal structures such as buildings and casinos, bridges and stadiums, all spectacular to see and more or less intricate roads, with jumps, ascents and descents. Worth mentioning is the useless Fantozzi rain effect, which like an office cloud produces water only on the car and the wet road does not make driving absolutely precarious. The heavy motion blur effect which at high speeds blurred the image too much was then reduced; now it appears in a less invasive and lighter way for the joy of our eyes. The cars, on the other hand, are as majestic as ever, reflecting all the surrounding environment and showing their nastiness especially in the case of large additions to the lighting and bodywork. Finally then you can see the replays of the races (but don't save! Why?), with the possibility of using a couple of truly choreographed cameras. You will feel like you are watching The Fast and the Furious. However, the engine proves to be heavy and offers slowdowns in the most agitated phases on mid-range computers: on a Pentium 4 2400 with 512 of Ramand GeForce 4 Ti at 1024 x 768 (where the first Underground was fine) with all details maxed out and no filters the shots are sometimes remarkable.", "date": "2004-12-17", "grade": null}
