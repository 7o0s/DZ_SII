{"name": "ONI", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/oni_b.html", "text": "It's all about control What makes Oni absolutely original, and different from what has already been seen in similar titles, is the fact that during the course of the game the weapons available to the protagonist Konoko will mainly be her own arms and legs, since the use, during the of the whole game, martial arts in close combat, will prove to be absolutely predominant compared to the scarce use of firearms. In fact, Konoko is capable of performing a series of ~ moves ~, of attack movements, quite varied, and on these she will base her ability to get the better of the numerous opponents she will meet. However, if during the first missions we will not be able to make the protagonist perform a few simple combinations of punches and kicks (while the enemies will immediately be equipped with pistols, rifles, cannons and company), during the progress of the game Konoko will learn increasingly powerful and effective combos, combined with some holds worthy of the best American wrestler. The control system adopted by Bungie is certainly original and well thought out (even if some flaws take it away from perfection); with the movement of the mouse we will address the camera and the main view of Konoko, with the left and right keys we will perform the punch and the kick respectively and with the central one some dodges, while with the pressure of A,E,D, and S we will move the protagonist forward, backward, left and right. If such a control method may appear awkward and impractical, a little practice (there is a fairly explanatory tutorial that must be addressed before starting the game) reveals instead that it is the most comfortable and functional one. The absence of the controls configuration menu on one side, and the total impossibility of using a Joypad on the other, are however inexplicable (also because the game will appear in a few days also in its Playstation2 version, of which this one for Pc seems to be a very successful port) and represent a rather negative element, which could even distance a certain number of players from the title. To tell the truth, there is a possibility of configuring the keys, but you have to edit a text file present in the main directory of the game, as if we were back in the days of DOS: it is not enough and it is probably a symptom of a certain superficiality of the programmers (perhaps the need releasing the title prematurely was once again more important than completing it in an ideal way). After all, the most important element of the game, i.e. the control method, proves to be spot on despite the above flaws, and more importantly, effective on most occasions, offering the player the feeling of an immediate response of the protagonist to our solicitations, making the fights absolutely fun and full of satisfaction. Japanese animation? If since its first appearances to the public Oni had convinced everyone with its clean graphics, the feeling that comes from the full title does not differ from the above. In fact, the animations of the characters are really convincing, and they manage to reproduce the numerous fights on the screen in an absolutely appropriate way: even greater is the care for the main protagonist, who manages to perform a series of moves that are always varied and fluid. When Konoko is also faced with two or more opponents, it is a pleasure to see her (under our commands) punch right and left, and perform somersaults of all kinds; light years away, luckily, from that Final Fight 3d to which some magazines inappropriately compared it. Indeed of Final Fight 3d, Oni retains only the general approach (call it a scrolling fighting game or whatever you want), but fortunately the whole context in which the game is set, and consequently the action, is really much more refined . Thanks to a more than discreet programming of the enemy's AI, Konoko is never allowed to enter a room and face her opponents head on, as she would always come out as a loser from the confrontation. In most situations it is necessary to advance very slowly (there is a key on purpose so as not to be heard by the enemies), perhaps trying to attract the attention of some guards and move him away from the group of his companions, perhaps to try to ambush him behind a corner and take possession of his firearm. Colliding with more than three enemies at a time means inexorably bringing an end to our adventure; it cannot be denied that this represents a subtlety of the game, bringing to mind that masterpiece that corresponds to the name of Metal Gear Solid. However, as mentioned before, in this case firearms do not represent our primary arsenal, as not only are they scarcely present in the levels (and the ammunition really seems to be countable on the fingers), but if we consider that it is NOT possible to carry If you have more than one weapon at a time (when you take one you automatically drop the one you have), you quickly draw conclusions. But this is certainly not a defect, but a clear choice of the programmers who have rightly chosen to focus the action of the game, mainly on close-range battles and white weapons: if you still don't believe me, think it's Konoko that enemies always have the option to disarm the opponent, while taking possession of his weapon. In spite of a rather accurate animation and AI of the enemies, however, the almost total absence of Textures to embellish the (vast and numerous) levels that make up the game should be reported. In fact throughout the course of the game, despite the setting of the same repeatedly varies (laboratories, roads, airports, roofs, even a level set in the dream world), the common factor that will bind them, is that of traveling in environments almost entirely bare, made up only of walls and floors without significant textures, and without any kind of objects. If you add the fact that it is not possible to interact with the elements of the environment in any way, the regret is strong (imagine how nice it would have been to throw tables or chairs at opposing guards, or attract their attention by smashing something) : the only interaction chance left to Konoko is to be able to break the windows (in a couple of cases it will be necessary to make her continue in the level), but it's really too little. A very clear concept The game concept of Oni is clear right from the start, right from the succession of the first levels: beat, beat, beat. Konoko is left with no other possibility than to make her way by eliminating the numerous opponents who are against her, even if sometimes thanks to a more accurate planning of the movements, it will be possible to avoid the clash with the guards: to tell the truth more once the setting of the levels forced me to find an alternative to the fight (either for the too imposing presence of the guards, or for the total lack of firearms or for the scarce vital energy left), but for the most part in some cases this was not possible. Precisely this seems to be a somewhat foggy point of the game: why offer the player the hope of being able to avoid armed confrontation... when instead in the end it will be the only possibility to continue in the game? It seems that the programmers did not fully feel like favoring Konoko's Stealth aspect over her martial abilities, making the concept sometimes a little undefined. On the other hand, unfortunately for us, the process of Konoko's journey through the levels is too defined, since in 99% of cases we will be forced to find the right switch to open that door and to be able to continue, following verbatim a concept that by now has done its time; let's consider that the missing 1% consists of those times in which we will have to kill all the guards before the door opens, and we will have a very clear picture of the situation... Don't get me wrong: Oni is really fun, and the part dedicated to clashes is not only made very well technically, but is capable of instilling adrenaline at every turn: mine is a small regret, because if the title had dared more, it would certainly have contributed to the evolution of the genre. Shall we save him or not? Yes, here we are talking about that design choice that programmers insist on making despite the fact that it can annoy a fair number of players. In fact, leaving out the general setting of the game, absolutely so console-style (but Oni does not hide behind strange definitions and clearly presents itself to the public for what it is) that purists might not like, what is absurd is the impossibility to save at any point in the game. If any of you followed the screenshots I sent Pucci during the progress of the title, you will surely remember how I defined this experience when talking to Pucci: disconcerting. In fact, right from the first missions the game is very demanding (considering the scarcity of firearms, ammunition and energy supplies), and more than once you have to start over just because you have found yourself facing three enemies instead of two. Not only are the Save points distributed throughout the levels in areas that are absolutely distant from each other, but at most there are then number of five, when it takes a couple of hours each to complete the levels: add to this the high difficulty of some clashes and draw the sums. I remember that when I was forced to repeat for the twentieth time (you read correctly.....) the second half of the third level, only because the autosave had been performed with Konoko practically out of energy and faced with three enemies, the only word that came to my mind (the only referable one, let's face it....) was disconcerting, and I understood that only a madman could have thought that the absence of infinite saves can make it less fun a game. I won't hide from you that at that moment, if I hadn't had to go ahead in the game to write the review, I would have uninstalled Oni without batting an eye. And you know what? I would have regretted it. In fact Oni has been able to give me many hours of fun, and if it hadn't been for the defects mentioned above (among all this issue of the bailouts), combined with a setting that didn't convince me that much, at this moment Oni probably would have become the Benchmark of third-person action games, taking the scepter away from Rune. However, this is not the case, also for a factor of no small importance: the total absence of multiplayer. Although at the various game presentations the programmers have always talked about multiplayer support, in fact Oni does not have this mode, and the only possible explanation is, as always, the need to release the title within the set time frame. And it's a shame, because probably the title would have gained, and not a little, from the introduction of multiplayer, especially the cooperative one (there are indeed moments in which Konoko is held by a guard and attacked by another - even if it happens probably unintentionally - and it wouldn't have been bad to be able to do the opposite), making it all the better. Conclusions I mentioned that the concept of the game is revealed from level to level exactly the same, and this might seem like the most negative side of the game. Little would have been enough, perhaps the introduction of some missions with objectives (it also helps to give Oni that console-style cut that could alienate potential players), but in the long run, it becomes repetitive (you enter the new level, follow the story, kill almost everyone, open the switch, enter that door... and start over), and a few clashes with some ~bosses~ are not enough to make the action more varied: however, what saves Oni is the extraordinary playability that sets him apart for most of the game. The controls (which, although not customizable in the long run, become the best choice) so immediate, the technical realization and the enemy AI are nothing compared to the fun that comes from facing the guards and trying to kill them with new moves or with increasingly complicated combos: this is why Oni fully captures the prefixed objective, giving the player a frenetic, fun, long-lasting experience, without however offering anything revolutionary. In the near future... Concluding the article dedicated to the best action games of 2000 (of which Rune was the undisputed winner), I underlined the fact that perhaps the most titled game to win the category title was missing; and that game was exactly that Oni that we are going to review today. Oni, for those who don't know yet, is a third-person action game inspired by the world of Japanese Manga, in which combat with white weapons (the one that made people like Jackie Chan famous in the world), i.e. based on martial arts reigns supreme. Set in a near future where tech megacorporations seem to be hiding something more important than their business, the game stars a young girl, Konoko, whose role as a special agent in the police force will soon lead her to uncover disturbing truths about her past. In fact, in the role of Konoko, our task will be to investigate the shady dealings of one of these corporations, which somehow seems to be linked to the terrorist activities present in the city, but as the mission progresses we will discover some disconcerting revelations that will light on our past, and on our true identity. Leaving aside the lack of originality of the plot (which seems in some way to follow what has already been seen in the award-winning Deus Ex), it must however be said that it unfolds in a truly convincing way, through the use of the numerous cutscenes that accompany the passing of the missions, and that as the game progresses the plot will acquire more value than in the first half of the same, dive", "date": "2001-04-30", "grade": null}
