His goal is simple: to face forty-four levels, including some spectacular boss fights, in order to collect objects and save his little friends, scattered within the scenarios and at the mercy of large predators. There are quite a few platformers on the App Store, this is the first consideration that comes naturally when you try the game for the first time, but it must be said that in this case we have sought a different approach to the genre , introducing some small puzzle element into the action and focusing on a dual-purpose gameplay, which can both lend itself to quick use and more patient and reasoned sessions to try to squeeze the most out of each stage. Let's start with the controls, which are based solely on pressing the touch screen with a finger, like in the best mobile ~ultra arcade~ games: you have to touch the screen briefly for Mr. Crab to make a small jump, keep pressing for the jump to be more wide and finally make a double tap in the presence of walls to perform a ~bounce~ and thus reach otherwise inaccessible platforms. The movement of the character is automatic, an element of strong characterization, for better or for worse because it sometimes happens to miss a jump and not be able to reverse the march, with the obligation to wait for the impact with an obstacle for this to happen. Given the ~circular~ structure of the levels, which mimics that of the 1987 classic Nebulus (as well as the tower level of another 1994 classic Mickey Mania), this approach is flawless: Mr. Crab moves in one direction or in the ' other, so it's up to us to time the jump well and thus allow him to climb onto the next platform, continuing to circle until he reaches the top. Think & jump The reference made previously about the puzzle elements is easily explained: considering that we cannot manually determine the direction of movement of our character, some maneuvers must be weighed on the fly and performed promptly, thinking about the area towards which we are projecting to understand if the path is the right one. This mechanic undergoes some variations when it comes to tackling boss fights, in which case the question of platforms and movement remains, but the inevitable head jump is added (the same one used by Mr. Crab to get rid of any enemies along the path) to weaken the opponent's defenses until his final defeat. The choice to manage the movements in this way unfortunately also generates frustrating situations, in which we may miss a jump several times and end up very low in the level, practically starting it all over again. Fortunately, this is one of the few negative aspects of the experience, which even in the event of unwanted contact with a hostile creature only produces a momentary ~stun~ of the protagonist and the descent of some platform, therefore not the game over. We must also add that the developers have done an excellent job with regard to the design of the scenarios, all of which are diversified in terms of appearance, color tone, structure, enemies and complexity. The offer also appears generous and, also considering the degree of difficulty, will only commit us for quite some time.", "date": "2013-04-22", "grade": "7.8"}
