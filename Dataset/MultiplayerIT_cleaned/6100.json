The complete series consists of five episodes in English. Rhys, Fiona, Sasha and the two robots that accompany them aim for the stars in the penultimate episode of the series. The group is in fact directed towards Hyperion, headquarters of the mega corporation that hides the component necessary to open the Vault, a kind of post-apocalyptic vault that should contain all sorts of treasure. At the end of the episode our heroes are in a key position to complete the mission successfully, but their main antagonist makes a decisive move and foils all plans. Unfortunately, Handsome Jack's coup takes place during a rushed ending that didn't leave us one bit apprehensive about Rhys and Fiona's fate, also because we see them remembering their deeds in the present, so it's certainly not on Hyperion that one of them will die. Setting aside the episode's bumbling conclusion, on paper Escape Plan Bravo could have been the best episode of the series. There's a crazy plan to execute, a slew of new locations to explore, and finally some serious character insights just waiting to be enacted. Lots of sequences to stitch like Telltale knows how to do very well. Instead, the narrative thrust fails and the story gets lost in jokes for their own sake, accumulating scenes that tell us nothing new about the protagonists. The abuse of irony to cover the gaps ends up removing even the smile from our lips, thus leaving the series with no more strings to its bow. When the episode ends, we can only wonder once more if those who don't have a particular passion for the Borderlands setting can really get excited about the story of Rhys and Fiona. Tales from the Borderlands Episode 4 has big plans in store that sadly only half realize Adrift The first chapter of the episode takes up the threads of the story and explains the plan that our heroes will have to carry out. The player may or may not reveal the presence of Handsome Jack in Rhys' head and that, whether or not it changes the story, is a major fork. Especially if we remember the brief flirtation between Rhys and Sasha, on which it is good to pause for a moment. At first glance we would have said that the one between Fiona and Rhys would have been the love story of the game. Something like haters love. The fact that instead an understanding has struck between Rhys and Sasha, Fiona's younger sister, has opened up new scenarios. Maybe a jealousy conflict? It could be, but even just the beginning of a turbulent union would be enough to give depth to the characters, who always remain too much the same. So let us return to the moment of revelation, which we now see in a different light. Will Sasha change his attitude towards us? Better to lie? Well, here's the big disappointment: Sasha and Rhsy's flirtation is gone in this episode. Whatever we do or say, the matter has been set aside for now. However, considering that this is the penultimate episode of the series, we doubt there is still room for who knows what evolutions. A good missed opportunity, in short. The second chapter of the game contains another surprising choice that made us dream in vain. For the first time Tales from the Borderlands tears a tear. The event is sudden and is hastily set aside, but it shows that it is possible to leave the jokes aside for a moment to strike some deep chords. We therefore expected an epic continuation that exposed the characters, instead the execution of the plan is a sequence of moments without significant choices that fail to accumulate the tension necessary to keep the story in orbit. The passage where Fiona has to steal a badge twice before time runs out is one of the silliest gameplay moments Telltale has churned out in its new adventure series. There are still brilliant gags, and the mock account battle itself is a peak of irony and imagination, but the sum of the parts amounts to nothing major. When Handsome Jack takes over and Rhys sits like a puppet on the boss's throne, we are left with the distinct feeling that too much history has been left out.", "date": "2015-08-25", "grade": "6.4"}
