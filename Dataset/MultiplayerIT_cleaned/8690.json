{"name": "La rivincita dei mostri", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/99308-monster-wars-la-rivincita-dei-mostri.html", "text": "Tested version: iPhone and iPad The clever trick of changing the point of view of a battle can make the creation of any kind of sequel simple and incredibly intuitive: in fact, in every strategy or tower defense there are at least two sides facing each other, each with very valid reasons that push it into battle and each with its own story to tell. However, in these cases we are faced with a problem: this sort of parallel story, which does not take place after but mostly during the events of the previous episode, is to be considered an effective sequel or more than anything else an antithetical clone of the original? The answer to this question is by no means simple or obvious: if in fact from a chronological setting point of view there are no differences, the parameter to be evaluated could be the technical realization which, at least in theory, should benefit so much the episode more recent enough to consider ~ipso facto~ a sequel, at least a spiritual one. In the case of Monster Wars, all the discussions mentioned so far must be related to the previous title, created by the same development team, or Legendary Wars; the comparison is therefore, inevitably, inevitable. Find the differences Just like its predecessor, Monster Wars combines several different genres: it is certainly a strategic one, because it is necessary to accumulate resources and carefully manage the forces in the field; however, it is also a tower defense, because your castle / base must be defended from waves of enemies that arrive from three distinct tracks. Finally, both RPG and hack'n slash elements cannot be denied, the former especially present in the management of the characteristics of each individual unit and the latter during some interlude levels, in which a character is personally used by attacking opponents and objects. Even the structure of the gameplay does not differ at all from the choices present in Legendary Wars: instead of the miners who recover resources in the form of gems, here we have the goblins who descend into a crypt, always going back up with the precious stones. The units available are then the exact dark transpositions of those evoked in the prequel: the skeleton corresponds to the simple knight, the dark knight to the armored one, the elf archer the skeleton with the bow, the poisonous zombies to the violent dwarves and so on. this step, all following an almost perfect parallelism. Once the necessary gems have been collected, it is thus possible to summon the favorite monster, placing it on one of the three defense lines; depending on the predefined objectives, you will have to defend the position to the bitter end or attack the enemy base or, in some cases, face waves of enemies up to the end-of-level boss. Each victory provides experience points, which can be spent to increase the characteristics of the units, and any bonus stones and gems, to be used to strengthen the castle's defenses. There are also escort or destruction missions using catapults and other war machines; finally, in some stages, a poisonous river that flows in the exact center of the level will take away the health of anyone, friend or foe, who tries to cross it, thus adding a pinch of unpredictability to the challenge. Even talking about the technical aspect of Monster Wars is redundant: it would be enough to refer to the review of the previous episode to get a complete picture; the only difference, in truth marginal, is given by the gloom of some locations, such as the cemetery or various crypts, inevitably in keeping with the protagonists of the story. It must be said that even most of the animations are ~recycled~, so to speak, starting with those of the goblin-miners and ending with those of attack or movement. It remains to be noted that the title suffered from some balancing problems and scattered bugs, correctly fixed after the very recent update.", "date": "2012-03-09", "grade": "7.4"}
