{"name": "Ristar", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ristar.html", "text": "The Shooting Star Almost all the companies at the time tried their hand at creating platformers, so the competition was stiff: among the many, Nintendo, SEGA, Treasure, Konami, Rare and Capcom stood out. It was the time of icons, of Mario and Sonic, both protagonists of extraordinary games, but it was also the time of an immense group of mediocre platformers, from which it was not easy to emerge; it could be done in two ways: one was to develop a game with a classic concept like Mario's, doing it so well as to differentiate itself from the crowd; the other consisted of creating a protagonist with new abilities, in such a way as to build a title around him which, at worst, would still have been original. Ristar undoubtedly belongs to the second category: released in 1995, born from one of the characters candidates to play the role that would later be Sonic, it can be defined without exaggeration as SEGA's Yoshi's Island. The protagonist, who also gave the game its name, was a star with extendable arms: all interaction with the environment was based precisely on the use of the upper limbs. The latter could be oriented in all eight directions allowed by the cross of the Mega Drive pad, and were used to do anything: destroy objects, kill enemies, cling to the many beams present in the stages. Ristar was an anomalous game, definitely fun, with exceptional design gimmicks, but it couldn't count on valid controls like those proposed by the best exponents of the genre: the jump, essential for any platformer, was not very sensitive to the intensity with the which one pressed the button, let alone the gait of the protagonist. Falling stars As we specified in the introduction, at the moment there are not many Wii platformers to play: it is therefore inevitable that if you are a fan of the genre, or simply want to get to know it better, you should forcibly choose a title from the Virtual Console (or buy one for Gamecube) . Ristar certainly represents an excellent candidate, both because not many were able to play it at the time - unlike Mario and Sonic - and for the high quality that distinguishes it. The SEGA platform is undoubtedly an old-fashioned game: saving is entrusted to passwords, it can all be completed in one long session, it values points much more than secondary objectives; therefore it will not last you as long as Donkey Kong Country, to name one that is already available on Virtual Console. Ristar is divided into six planets, each consisting of two levels and two bosses: it's not easy, but once you've finished it there's no incentive to replay it, other than the desire to repeat the adventure at a higher difficulty level. Highly recommended to fans of the genre who didn't enjoy it in 1995. It is useless to deny it: in recent years the platform genre has undergone a great crisis. Apart from some very welcome exceptions, a slow but constant decline also began with the beginning of the 32/64 bit era; if at the beginning the Nintendo / Rare duo had managed to mask the situation through a series of games of a certain caliber, the truth came out forcefully when the collaboration between these two companies was interrupted. Ristar, a Mega Drive game recently added to the Virtual Console, belongs to an opposite period, that is to the golden age of platformers: that of 16 bits.", "date": "2007-01-22", "grade": null}
