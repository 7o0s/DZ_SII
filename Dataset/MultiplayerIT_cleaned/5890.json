We've already talked about it several times in the past, but the Japanese company's strategy when it comes to new releases appears almost schizophrenic. We are still talking about a colossus with a myriad of projects headed by as many development teams, which often ends up spilling a cauldron of minor projects onto the market, perhaps in the hope of seeing a small cult emerge from the heap. a period full of important releases, such an approach rarely bears fruit, but this does not mean that among the products less supported by Square Enix there cannot be pearls worthy of attention. And this seems to be the case with The DioField Chronicle, a curious tactical RPG, which since its presentation seemed to want to distinguish itself strongly from the great classics of the genre. The DioField Chronicle is developed largely by Lancarse, a veteran Japanese team with several well-known games under their belts (including Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey, for those who remember), and we've been playing its campaign for about 30 hours with great interest these days, trying to understand if, even though forced into the sea of outings of the festive period, it actually had the strength to stand out. The answer? Of course, you can find it in our review of The DioField Chronicle today. Matsuno flavored fiction The DioField Chronicle: this is Waltaquin, a sorceress with... peculiar tendencies We actually made a small mistake at the beginning: when we discussed The DioField Chronicle's desire to detach itself from the classics of the tactical JRPG, we should have specified that the game tries this difficult path only from a mechanical point of view, because as far as the narrative, the influences of the heaviest names in the genre are nothing short of crystal clear. In fact, the game has obvious ~Matsunian~ traits to say the least (for those who don't know who we are talking about, Yasumi Matsuno was the director of Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre, and is known for his mature stories full of intrigue and politics ) and, while putting the player in the role of a warrior of few words and many thoughts named Andrias, his story develops together with that of the island where it takes place, DioField in fact, resulting overall in a long succession of geopolitical landslides of which the protagonist's group represents the balance. The DioField Chronicle: After centuries of peace, the island of DioField suddenly finds itself faced with a myriad of internal and external conflicts. You'll have to go a long way before setting things right However, Matsuno here has not contributed in any way to the writing of the game, therefore the approach of Square and Lancarse to the narrative takes several liberties with respect to the classic formulas. First of all, the story of DioField is less verbose than in other games with similar universes, and tries to outline what happens in a more precise and direct way, mostly with short briefings before the missions. Furthermore, much of the characterization of the characters is entrusted to simple dialogues inserted into the game as side missions, in which the motivations and desires of the Blue Foxes are learned in a short time, the organization of mercenaries of which Andrias and his companions are part . This approach is partly a double-edged sword, as it obviously tends to trivialize certain themes and flatten some of the more important members of the cast, yet overall we really appreciated the work done on the plot. The Lancarse, after all, have clearly made a considerable effort to shape a universe in continuous conflict, and the sociopolitical tensions of the single island of DioField, combined with the threat of two neighboring kingdoms with clear expansionist aims, represent in our opinion a counterpart perfect to the story of the young and gloomy Andrias. The apparent flatness of certain characterizations is then paradoxically ~calculated~ within the narrative, and supports some twists more than capable of gluing us to the screen with a fair cunning until the end of the campaign. The efforts of the developers in this aspect have therefore undoubtedly paid off by raising the quality of the game, also because, overall, they diminish some defects that will inevitably be discussed shortly. Strategy and gameplay The DioField Chronicle: DioField's tactical pause gives you plenty of time to calculate your next move, but don't underestimate the importance of positioning DioField's real innovations are all in the real battles, since, as already mentioned, the developers have moved away from the classic grid and turn formula that we are used tobeen seeing you for decades. No, The DioField Chronicle features a hybrid system with clear influences from Western RTS, and is in all respects a variant of a real-time strategy with tactical pause. But be careful, this type of mechanics could immediately make you think of series like Total War, while DioField is actually very far from that type of philosophy, and does not allow you to use entire armies to be divided and positioned accurately: during the clashes you will only have four units maximum, each accompanied by another supporting fighter (for a maximum of eight characters overall) and equipped with a class with very specific skills and roles. The limited number of units does not mean that their placement is negligible, given that DioField's enemies are quite varied, they often have area abilities (the activation of which is always evident) and their presence in the maps is carefully thought out so as to always make the approach dangerous (or due to the presence of long-range attackers distance, or enemy patrols that can be added to clashes that have already started). Managing such a limited ~army~ therefore leads the player's tactics to focus on two other primary factors: the use of skills and the maintenance of resources. Now of the end, in simple terms, DioField is a title where to truly dominate it is necessary to maximize the synergies between the available roles, always use the best techniques to quickly clear the field while limiting the risks, and avoid wasting precious mana between fights. The developers, however, have chosen to regulate each fight on a rather limited scale, to avoid excessively long and tedious missions (very common in other similar titles); there are even time limits to be respected in order to obtain additional prizes, further demonstrating how here the optimization of times and moves are central. The DioField Chronicle: Those red areas show the area where an enemy is about to attack. Get up, because they don't joke about damage To be honest, we found it to be a great system, which once you get some of the best skills in the game transforms the missions almost into pleasant war choreographies. The ability to instantly use the most devastating abilities by pausing the game and to combine classes to add abilities commonly absent to a character are very rewarding, and in general Square and the Lancarse have managed to craft battlefields complex enough to offer a fair level of challenge even for fairly experienced players... at least until the final stages are reached. Yes, because if we have to find a fault in this work, it is unfortunately linked to the progression, cross and delight of almost all the titles with marked RPG elements, but here perhaps left a little too much to itself in the last third of the campaign. Classes and progression The DioField Chronicle: The maps are small but very enjoyable. They resemble dioramas The DioField Chronicle proposes once again a class system, but it is not the case to expect in this game something comparable in complexity and flexibility to the Job System of Final Fantasy Tactics or Disgaea. During the adventure, in fact, you will not be able to change the specialization of each character, but you will be relegated to what is offered by the main story, since each personality present in your army of mercenaries has an already decided and immutable class. Of course, this does not mean that variety is lacking, however the number of warriors at your disposal is rather limited (now of the end you will literally have two characters of each type, for a total of nine classes) as well as fairly basic are the options to upgrade each of They. Outside of global skill enhancements, in fact, you will have limited development branches for each single choice (whose diversification in statistics, indeed, has little effect, given the immoderate strength of certain obtainable passive abilities), and to really decide the power in battle will mainly be equipment. The DioField Chronicle: Summons are super useful, and a great way to turn a problematic situation around It is not a badly made structure, for heaven's sake, but its limitations are clearly put in place to give a precise gradual progression to the player, who with a little experience can almost immediately understand which are the best ways to develop the his team, and focus on leveling only the most influential characters (if they are not brought into battle, the warriors do not level up). Therefore, much of that freedom is losttypical of the genre, which usually makes the free management of powers and specializations one of its main strengths. Furthermore, even if only in the last chapters of the story, once you reach the maximum level of your base camp, devastating accessories and skills are unlocked, which still break the system easily and make the management of the characters' resources trivial. A pity, because since then the only motivation that leads to continue is, as we mentioned at the beginning of the review, the story. Honestly, the team could have done more from this point of view. The limited number of classes should have ensured a better balance (and some specializations, especially that of the protagonist, are anything but balanced) and in our opinion it would have made perfect sense to even eliminate the summons or the presence of health spheres in the maps. The former are really all too useful (and all too often usable) mystical beasts that can be summoned, while the presence of the latter greatly facilitates that recovery of life points and mana which often represents the only real challenge in every mission. With these solutions, on the other hand, the level of difficulty only holds up to a certain point, partially nullifying the sense of a development system thus defined. However, we don't want to be overly critical, because the game remains excellent even with these weaknesses, and it took over 20 hours before the missions became repetitive and too easy on average. A bit of a disappointment, however, remains, because with some additional foresight DioField would in our opinion be a true gem of its kind. Technical and sound sector The DioField Chronicle: the look of the characters is clean and quite particular. Reminiscent of early 2000s CG We also find a certain refinement in the technical sector, given that DioField even in this field tries to stand out from the crowd. The game world is a mix of fantasy and advanced technologies that clearly takes its hands full from many other JRPGs, but the aesthetics of the title are more striking than usual due to the apparent desire of the developers to give the graphics a look close to the computer graphics. However, we are not talking about modern CG (also because if that were the case we would be dealing with a super production, of course), but about the more plasticky one of the late 2000s, for a truly distinctive general effect. The extreme cleanliness of the three-dimensional models and maps - these the latter are almost reminiscent of dioramas - it will certainly not go down the same way to everyone, but it has personally conquered us, giving further charm to everything. Good, without any excess, the animations of the skills and characters. Nothing particular instead to say about the artificial intelligence of the enemies: their ability to maneuver and adapt are rather limited - because in this game the opponents represent more of obstacles to overcome than minds to beat on the field - although in general they are aggressive and do not fail to continuously use powers that require some kind of reaction from the player. Not bad, finally, all that concerns the sound. The soundtrack of the game is pleasant, even if it is repetitive after a few hours due to the small number of songs; however, the English dubbings seemed to us to be of generally high quality, and the narrator during the interludes adds a lot of pathos to the events.", "date": "2022-09-26", "grade": "8.0"}
