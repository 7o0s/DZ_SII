As in the first episode, in fact, we will take on the role of 3 soldiers ~ simple belonging to the armed forces of Russia, England and the United States. What changes is the order of the campaigns since this time we will start our adventure with the Red Army and end it with the stars and stripes infantry and in the middle we will be engaged in Africa with His Majesty's troops. This time the possibility of being able to start the campaign with another soldier even before the conclusion of the previous one was introduced, after having completed only some of the missions of the other campaign. Perhaps someone will opt for a patchy experience but the writer has found it more logical and immersive to conclude a soldier's campaign and then move on to the next one only after. I no longer throw your holy bombs at them (Pel, Ligabue, Jovanotti) As written at the beginning, the basic structure of Call of Duty 2 has remained similar to its predecessor: we are facing an FPS with immediate gameplay in which together with our fellow soldiers controlled by artificial intelligence we will have to deal with the Nazi troops in every corner of the world and complete the various objectives that will be given to us from mission to mission with only two weapons available (good variety in the arsenal between pistols, automatic machine guns, sniper rifles and so on) as well as grenades and smoke bombs. As in the first COD, the behavior and attack sequences of the enemy troops are scripted but the main novelty of this second episode lies in a greater general complexity of the game maps: if Call of Duty was accused of excessive linearity, the second episode has been enriched with possibilities and alternative ways to solve a particularly difficult passage. It will thus be truly fascinating and full of adrenaline to find the right alley in the abandoned city to organize an attack from behind the soldiers of the Wehrmacht, thus catching them by surprise and therefore having a particular advantage in the firefight. We are certainly not talking about a title with a particularly high freedom of play but in any case it will be much more difficult to find more or less invisible obstacles during the levels (which happened not infrequently in the first COD) and the alternative possibilities given increase greatly the sensation of realism and interaction is long lasting. As regards the use of the means, however, the novelties are really just a flicker. There will be some missions in which we will have the command exclusively of the machine gun placed on top of an armored vehicle that will move completely independently of our will while in the African campaign with the British troops we will instead be able to maneuver a powerful tank in the dunes of the Sahara. To be honest, however, the parts with the means are perhaps the least inspired and engaging that Call of Duty presents in the single-player campaign. We are certainly not talking about a title with a particularly high freedom of play but in any case it will be much more difficult to find more or less invisible obstacles during the levels Still with regard to the more strictly interactive component, forget about a ~wild~ use of the quick save: COD 2 is based on a system of pre-established checkpoints which absolutely never make the experience frustrating (indeed, at the second level of difficulty among the 4 present, the game tends to be slightly too simple for those with minimal experience in the field of first-person shooters). Another element that directly affects the gameplay concerns the energy of our alter ego: a bar will never appear on the screen to indicate our status since the end of the game will occur when the soldier is hit by a certain number of shots (or even by only one in case he is hit on the head or by a grenade) in a limited period of time. In fact, if we have been wounded, it will be sufficient to find a hiding place to recover the lost energy and then return to the battlefield as vital as before. Perhaps someone could criticize the system adopted and consider it unrealistic but in the end finding medikits scattered around the world capable of healing us from all evil is not an equally very likely experience. Nothing to kill or die for (J. Lennon) As written at the beginning, the great strength of Call of Duty was and even more in this second episode, the immersive capacity given by the audiovisual realization. Infinity Ward after squeezing the engine to the maxgraphic designer of Quake 3 in COD, has decided to create a proprietary engine and given the results obtained, one can only rejoice at the choice made. We are undoubtedly facing one of the most beautiful productions ever seen in the videogame field with an unprecedented realization as regards the detail of the textures of the faces and bodies of each soldier: a three-dimensional solidity of the kind had never been seen before, not even in Half-Life 2 and Quake IV and the praise continues also with regard to the perfect animations with which our fellow soldiers and enemy troops move and act. We are equally pleasantly amazed by the detail of the buildings and of all the background components (and the latter are really very varied) as well as the visual effects for the representations of the weather effects (the Russian levels with snow make you shiver! ) and other elements such as smoke from smoke bombs or grenade explosions. Moreover, Call of Duty 2 is not even too expensive in terms of hardware requirements: the minimum ones indicated in the package speak of a 1.4 GHz processor, 256 MB of RAM and 64 MB of video memory. From what we can see, perhaps with these characteristics the game moves minimally but on the test system (3.5 GHz processor, 2 GB of ram and 256 MB of video memory) we were able to move away without problems from the parameters set by the bad autodetect , increase the resolution up to 1280x1024 pixels, insert the trilinear filter, put practically all the visual effects to the maximum and note only very sporadic drops in the frame rate which has remained in the vast majority of cases at more than acceptable levels. Infinity Ward, after squeezing the graphics engine of Quake 3 in COD to the max, decided to create a proprietary engine and given the results obtained, one can only rejoice at the choice made If up to now we have praised Call of Duty 2 excessively, there is unfortunately also another side of the coin represented by the almost total lack of interaction between the environment and soldiers. How not to be a little disappointed to see that even when shooting a vehicle or a building with a bazooka they are almost not scratched in the slightest and, even worse, not even seeing a glass break when we shoot from inside a building through a closed window? From this point of view, Call of Duty 2 is a real disappointment: we didn't ask for an interaction like Half-Life 2 or F.E.A.R. but those minimal elements capable of not resulting in some embarrassing situations such as those just listed. A real shame this stain for an absolute masterpiece, a stain that we hope will be washed with a hypothetical third episode. Minor flaw but still worth mentioning is the total lack of cut scenes in the game with the exception of the splendid movie made with the game's graphics engine at the end of our adventure. For such a cinematic and spectacular title (some situations really make you shiver but emotional in this case) seeing as interludes only archive footage of this Military Channel or the letters written by soldiers to tell their feelings is really a bit too little. Blow those bridges down, burn that jungle down (N. Young) Let's go back to praising Call of Duty 2 when it comes to sound. The title produced by Activision undoubtedly represents one of the best videogames ever heard to date thanks to a perfect combination of excellently sampled environmental effects that fill the sound spectrum completely as well as giving a sensational surround effect in all the speakers of the 5.1 system (strongly recommended to better enjoy the game). From time to time, epic-war musical motifs also appear, painstakingly placed at the right moments to enrich our multimedia experience with pathos. Fortunately, the dubbing work was also masterfully done without any fall in style in not even a single sentence (which sometimes repeats itself slightly too much but this is not the fault of the interpreters). Let us therefore congratulate Sinthesis International hoping that the quality of Call of Duty 2 will become the norm in terms of localization for Italy.

Make Love, Fuck War (Moby, Public Enemy) One of the most criticized aspects of the first Call of Duty was certainly the longevity. Indeed, the single campaign lasted less than 10 hours and it was probably no coincidence that an expansion disk came out a year later. Fortunately this time, things arego very differently: the three game campaigns divided into 27 missions, require approximately 13-15 hours of gameplay to be completed (clearly the more you play it at a higher difficulty level, the more the game will require a few additional hours to be completed), thus settling on a medium-high duration compared to its reference genre (for example a Quake 4 lasts a few hours less). Make Love, Fuck War (Moby, Public Enemy) Clearly inevitable then a substantial multiplayer component which provides for the simultaneous participation of up to 64 players. The three key modes for FPS (deathmatch, team deathmatch and capture the flag) are joined by two relatively more peculiar ones: ~Headquarters~ and ~Search and Destroy~. The first is a reprise of a mod already seen for the first episode and involves maintaining a position on the map for as long as possible while ~Search & Destroy~ is a mode in which you have to place or prevent the placement of explosive charges. Then there is the killcam or the last seconds of your digital life from the point of view of your ~killer~. The browser for multiplayer is absolutely clear and it is equally easy to turn your PC into a server by setting the various parameters present in a single page. In multiplayer, there is also the killcam or the last seconds of your digital life from the point of view of your ~assassin~ Final comment By changing the order of the addends (in this case the sequence of soldiers that we will have as digital alter egos) the result does not change, on the contrary, as regards Call of Duty 2 it improves the qualitative peaks of the first episode reaching the status of a masterpiece in many respects starting with the audiovisual impact that is hardly comparable to everything we have seen to date. COD 2 immerses the player even further in the drama of war thanks to a proprietary graphics engine capable of handling very high resolution textures, fine graphic effects (the smoke bombs are so realistic that it almost makes you feel like having to cough) and very large settings without taking away nothing to the general visual detail. Even more convincing praise for the sound thanks to a perfect combination of very well sampled environmental effects, epic-war music and a dubbing that remains at very high levels without any flaws. And as if the single-player campaign wasn't enough, in addition to presenting less linearity, it also reaches a good number of hours of play from a quantitative point of view. So, in the face of so many positive aspects, it is sad to have to note only one structural defect: the interaction with the absolutely disastrous environment. It's not that COD 2 can't keep up with Half-Life 2 or F.E.A.R. but it is also lacking in those minimal elements such as seeing a glass break if we start shooting from behind a window. The programmers of Infinity Ward don't want it: we point out this aspect because from a masterpiece like Call of Duty 2, because this is what it is about for everything else, we would not have expected such a defailance. But despite this limitation, COD 2's status as a masterpiece is absolutely not in question. Pros Monumental audiovisual impact Longer and less linear than the first episode Refined artificial intelligence Cons Very disappointing interaction with the environment Some minimal graphic bugs Lack of Cut Scene Strengthened by the unanimous approval received from critics and the public with the first episode, Infinity Ward returns to the trenches of the Second World War with Call of Duty 2. Certainly the programmers have made some changes and notable improvements in the playful and audiovisual system of their title but the strong point of their brand has remained the same but increased to the nth degree: the immersive capacity of their work. If someone still has doubts about the drama of a war conflict, about what war really means, COD2 is probably the best surrogate to be able to understand what it means to participate in such a situation. No other title before has ever brought the gamer closer to understanding the total loss of humanity when facing the enemy, having to shoot a wounded enemy soldier to finish him off because he could always shoot us before expiring, talking to a fellow soldier and a second later to see him dead in a pool of blood. Despite being a war game, perhaps the deepest meaning of the title of the Infinity Ward programmers is a pacifist message or in any case of understanding of what war really means, far from the propaganda that has always filled the mass media, which were yesterday's newspapers, radio and posters", "date": "2005-11-14", "grade": null}
