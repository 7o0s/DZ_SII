{"name": "Arkadian Warriors - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/arkadian-warriors-recensione.html", "text": "The idea didn't seem bad at all: to bring a completely new 3D hack and slash to the Live Arcade platform, which combined the immediacy of titles generally downloadable on Xbox 360 with the depth of the various Diablo and Baldur's Gate, albeit with due proportions. Unfortunately, good intentions were not followed by a realization up to par, making this Arkadian Warriors only a shadow of what it would have liked to be. In the role of an unspecified character, the player must carry out without any choice the dozens of missions assigned to him within the village in which he mysteriously finds himself. However, each quest turns out to be a simple collection of a certain number of objects within increasingly long and articulated dungeons, making variety a concept absolutely foreign to the Wanadoo Games title and guaranteeing a growing sensation of monotony. The biggest flaw, however, lies in what should have been the absolute strength, namely the random generation of levels. An idea that is not new and very rarely well implemented, which once again demonstrates its fragility: it often happens to find oneself in the presence of senselessly articulated structures - so much so as to make orientation difficult even with the map always on the screen -, or as opposed to running into the exit near the entrance, so as to frustrate the exploration of all the other game areas. If we add the total absence of puzzles other than ~the blue key in the blue padlock~ to what has just been said, the bleak picture is soon served. The very progression of the plot, entrusted to short text boxes that appear when each task is assigned, is not convincing, lacking any depth and often losing the thread of an overall picture that ends almost without giving the possibility of understanding how we have reached the final boss. When coop means last hope The first and only choice linked to the customization of your alter ego is that of the class: warrior, archer or witch, there is no need for special introductions for three categories that perfectly embody the spirit generally associated with each of them. Pad in hand Arkadian Warriors manages to demonstrate some appreciable qualities. With the left trigger it is possible to lock on to the closest target and, although only one button is used to attack, the fights are all in all fun, especially when you get hold of the more complex skills and you are able to understand the best timing for use the animalistic transformation that each character has. Role-playing elements are not lacking on paper, but it is their limited accuracy that does not make them particularly attractive. In fact, when in possession of more weapons and armor, one soon realizes how it is always possible to choose one better than all the others, leaving no particular space for the usually interesting considerations of a strategic nature. For those with an internet connection and a friend willing to jump into battle, the cooperative covers the whole campaign and certainly adds more than one stimulus, if only for the company factor and the easier resolution of the never impossible challenges proposed. Overall, longevity is therefore more than good, as it takes several hours to complete the story and maximize one's statistics. Technically the preliminary impact is really positive, with many details on the screen and excellent dynamic lighting. Unfortunately after the first sessions, when the screen begins to fill up with opponents, there are very visible drops in frame rates and some imperfections in the collisions. The sound itself is disappointing, with very little varied and inspired music and effects. Comment Arkadian Warriors is a title suitable for absolute beginners of action-RPGs, who will be able to find immediacy and satisfaction in it at a good price, as well as a cooperative mode and three different classes. All the others will have to surrender in front of the inconstant level design and excessive repetitiveness of the missions. In any case, a short test before buying is mandatory to avoid nasty surprises. Pros Simple Online co-op Cons Repetitive Random level generation unconvincing Poor story poorly told Xbox 360  Achievements The 200 points up for grabs are pretty easy to win, while requiring a certain amount of time in front of the console and a lot of dedication. Requests such as defeating the final boss or certain amounts of enemies should be met during normal sessions, while reaching the twentieth level will be the most difficult, forcing thethe player to repeat the same dungeons over and over.", "date": "2007-12-21", "grade": null}
