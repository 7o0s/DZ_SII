How long on Xbox and Xbox Live? What do you think of online gaming?Manuel Voltolina: My name is Manuel Voltolina, I'm 21 and I live in Sottomarina (VE). I started playing video games from the tender age of 5 thanks to a bar near my house and since then I have become a huge fan. The Xbox entered my home on the first day of its release in Europe, i.e. March 14, 2002. The first Xbox Live games were in April 2003, a month after the Microsoft online service had been launched. Since June of the same year I had finally created my personal account choosing the name of Manuel84, which is still my tag. M.it: Was it hard to become Italian FIFA champion? Approximately how many hours a day did you spend with the pad in your hand? M.V.: Of course, climbing up to 1st place in the national rankings wasn't easy, and only my perseverance in continuing to play and win made me reach the goal I've been aiming for since the beginning. In those two and a half months of the tournament, I played FIFA 06 for two or three hours a day. M.it: So tell us how the finals went? We know that while you failed to become world champion you held our nation's flag high by winning yet another prestigious award. M.V.: It all took place in one very intense day, Sunday 18th December, in London where a fabulous stand was set up just for us players and the spectators. The responsibility was as high as the emotion, knowing that I represented Italy and obviously I didn't want to leave the competition immediately, but the tension gave me the strength to give my best and try to become world champion in Fifa 06! In the morning, only two out of twenty-two players could advance to the big final in the afternoon and I did, I qualified by becoming an Xbox Live finalist and thus secured the win of 2 tickets for the 2006 World Cup Final in Germany. In the afternoon unfortunately not I managed to confirm myself and qualify for the semifinal and eventual final. However, I have no regrets because I know I gave the best of myself and honestly the first 4 places in the final tournament are right. So once again my congratulations to these very strong players who are also excellent people live. On the official website of the tournament, as you will see, I too am mentioned between the lines and on the video I appear twice as I rejoice: I am that boy in the red shirt. M.it: Even though the London competitions involved the FIFA 06 champions for Xbox, they took place with FIFA 06 Road to World Cup on Xbox 360, how was the first impact? M.V.: Fifa 06 Road to World Cup luckily I already had it at home together with the new Microsoft console, so I was able to train a bit and get used to the new standard, especially the graphics which really left me speechless. M.it: Technically, the generation passage is noticeable at first glance, but in your opinion, playability has changed a lot? M.V.: In my opinion, playability has been significantly retouched to notice it, however, you have to play for a long time, however, you notice that now the game is more accessible to everyone and is slightly easier to play and learn the basics. M.it: Do you think there is any ~move~ that has taken on more importance or has lost any? It seems to us that the feints that can be performed with the right stick have lost some effectiveness. M.V.: I immediately noticed the enormous difficulty of scoring goals from outside the box, compared to the last chapter on Xbox. In my opinion, the right stick has remained unchanged as a feint, only now you need to have more timing while executing them and hopefully you can elegantly pass the opposing defender. M.it: You've already played FIFA 06 for a long time now, how did you find the artificial intelligence of the game? M.V.: I've played very few games against the CPU, because I've always liked playing against real players. This is the beauty of online, you always find people more or less good than you with their personal style of play and no game is ever the same, as it could be by playing dozens and dozens of games against artificial intelligence, which advanced always performs the same tactics. M.it: As a player and as a ~champion~, how limiting is the fact that club teams are missing from this version of the EA title? M.V.: Obviously, I would have liked club teams to be present, but then if you think about it the game would no longer be called ~Road to World Cup~, but simply Fifa Next Gen for example. However it is a big gap that I hope will soon be filled by a new chapter in the series. M.it: The online game, your battlefield, how do you think FIFA has changed from the previous year's version?M.V.: Unfortunately we touch a sore point here, in fact I was very disappointed by the online section of this new Fifa, starting from the menus and the little information on Live matches (what happens to them made for example the last ten games that could be consulted in a special menu up to the previous episode of the series?) up to the presence of a constant signal delay. M.it: Are online matches more playable than FIFA for Xbox? Unfortunately the signal delay problem seemed to be particularly present during our tests.M.V.: Unfortunately no, online matches are really unplayable, the constant lag problems show us the game jerky, hindering our game actions several times . Let's hope they fix this annoying handicap soon. M.it: How do you think the global experience of the new Live?M.V.: The Xbox 360 Live is something spectacular, I'm really excited about it. The possibility of speaking in voice chat with a friend who is playing for example Project Gotham Racing 3 while I am competing on Fifa 06 Road to World Cup or I am in the dashboard is wonderful. Then the wonderful idea of downloading the demos, trailers and entire games of the Live Arcade for free or for a fee directly from the Marketplace. M.it: Finally, FIFA 06 Road to World Cup is present exclusively on Xbox 360, what do you think?M.V.: It was an excellent move for Microsoft to grab this exclusive, after all the 2006 neighbors and the fever of waiting is rising. We really needed a football game that would make us enter the next gen and Microsoft has given us a really nice gift. M.it: At this point we just have to say goodbye, we thank you on behalf of all Multiplayer.it readers and we hope to meet you soon perhaps for a few games on Xbox Live. M.V.: Thank you and everyone for your attention. If you want to meet me on Live, to play 2 games and chat in friendship, this is my Gamertag: Manuel84. See you soon! Football in Europe is more than just a sport, it is a passion, a drug to be ingested in massive doses and at constant intervals so as not to leave the ball players in a crisis of withdrawal. We talked about Europe but the Italian people are no less, indeed probably in our country the level of exasperation for this sport and consequently the continuous need for football is even greater. Electronic Arts as always is ready to satisfy our desire in a timely manner, FIFA 06 Road to world cup is in fact the first next generation football to land on the market, ready to quench the thirst of all fans. The World Cup is not far away... As you may have guessed from the Road to FIFA World Cup subtitle, this version of FIFA is dedicated exclusively to the qualification path leading up to the 2006 World Cup in Germany, it is the only official product dedicated to this competition and it is developed exclusively for Xbox 360. The other side of the coin is certainly less rosy and manifests itself in the lack of many modalities and in the forced absence of the club teams. We too were negatively surprised by this choice, but certainly influenced by the very tight deadlines to return to the days of the launch of the Microsoft console. As in NBA Live 06, also in FIFA 06 we will be immediately catapulted onto the pitch, a virtual gym in which to make the first contacts with the controls and make the first shots on goal. With a touch of the D-pad or by pressing the Start button we will be able to access the general menu, start a friendly, a quick tournament, a game on Xbox Live or the qualifying path towards the World Cup. Qualifying for the World Cup is certainly the ~heart~, albeit limited, of the game: we will take one of the 72 available teams and through the qualifying rounds and some mini-tournaments we will fight to get to the World Cup. Where are all the modes we used to? The create-a-player? A management method that allows you to lead the team in view of the World Cup? Not insignificant shortcomings that unfortunately made us pass the exaltation felt by inserting the game into the Xbox 360, seeing it run without problems of fluidity at 720p, or when we saw Ronaldinho's terrified face after missing a goal or the grass polygonal during replays. Where are all the modes we used to? The World Cup is not far away... The game is fun and quite realistic even if a little simplified compared to the previous episode of the saga. Some ~stops on the fly~ even by non-technical players leave the tempo they find a little, as well as the contact between the player's foot and the ball, a relationshipa little too close to be true. The players without the ball move credibly on the turf, a good construction of the actions, perhaps often using the side bands is essential to defeat the opposing teams. The tricks that can be performed with the right analog stick have been appropriately scaled back and it is now more difficult to be able to pass more than one opponent with the same player, Ronaldo is not the one to care. We occasionally encountered some defensive amnesia and sometimes we took advantage of a rebound on the defender to increase the goals, but these are things that also happen in football and then, as mentioned, these were sporadic episodes. During our tests, an important fact emerged that we cannot fail to point out to all aspiring players and that is the importance of the side bands much more than in other football titles; well-executed crosses are essential to undermine even the toughest defences, a very high percentage of balls poured into the opposing area turn into very dangerous opportunities for defences. Nonetheless we must point out that in this version of FIFA scoring is particularly difficult, certainly not impossible, but complicated and as mentioned before it will be important to orchestrate a good team game with two offensive wingers capable of delivering numerous balls to the center of the area for our strikers . It will also be important to vary the tactical structure of our team during the matches, passing from a 4-4-2 to a more offensive 3-4-3 or to a more attentive 4-5-1, we will be able to make the changes in time real with the push of a button on the d-pad. The Theater of Dreams The technical sector is indeed particularly impressive, the players have been faithfully recreated and, with rare exceptions (Gilardino?!), resemble their real counterparts in every detail. The number of animations has been significantly increased compared to the previous version of FIFA and above all certain falls on the ground after a foul are very ~scenic~ and spectacular. The physics of the ball is good, the much feared beach ball pinball effect has been avoided and indeed now the sphere is particularly heavy, and in some aerial parables it even descends too vertically. There are six different camera management systems, from television, to action-focused or pitchside. They are all very effective and obviously, apart from the very close one, they frame the action from afar allowing you to see a large part of the playing field. By selecting the very close view, a rather evident graphic defect emerges, the lack of the faces of the footballers who are similar to many mannequins, without eyes, nose and mouth. The defect is evident but also very relative, given that the nearby camera is practically unusable if you want to build valid game actions, while if we use the other available shots, all set at a greater distance, the problem does not recur. The presentation of matches and the playing of national anthems is goosebumps, with a quick overview of the stadiums complete with a polygonal audience The Theater of Dreams The game engine is very stable and remains anchored to 60 frames per second, ensuring good fluidity except for some small uncertainty every now and then, especially during replays which are sometimes unwatchable. The presentation of the matches and the execution of the national anthems is goosebumps, with a quick overview of the stadiums recreated to perfection, complete with a polygonal audience, albeit inexplicably afflicted by an annoying flickering. The interlude cut scenes between one action and another are very effective, EA wanted to insist on making the expressions of joy after a goal or disappointment after a trivial mistake perceptible by framing the faces of the players and their grimaces. The result is certainly not perfect and some faces look a little too plastic but if nothing else it is a first step towards increasingly televised football. So let's come to online gaming, a strong point of Microsoft hardware but not always exploited properly by developers. The ~management~ part of the live is well structured with the possibility of choosing whether to play a game in the ranking or free from statistics, it is then possible to enter the lobbies separated by nationality and by skill. The online part played, on the other hand, is unfortunately insufficient, the signal delay has characterized every game played during our tests and we hope that EA will remedy these problems in a short time. It would then be necessary to update the roosters that make up the national formations, in Italy, for example, Cor", "date": "2006-01-05", "grade": null}
