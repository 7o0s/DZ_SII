{"name": "E' una Troika!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/91567-supreme-ruler-cold-war-e-una-troika.html", "text": "The Supreme Ruler series has stood out in its various episodes mainly for the complex reconstruction of the various difficulties that may arise in governing a nation during particularly complex historical moments, however created at the table by the developers. In this third incarnation there are no basic upheavals to the game mechanics, which mainly remain those seen in the previous chapters, while the real novelty is in the setting. Leaving aside the political upheavals of the alleged 2020, Supreme Ruler Cold War, as the title suggests, will propose a reconstruction as faithful as possible of the international political and economic situation at the dawn of the Cold War, leaving the player the possibility to choose not only the faction to lead, but also what type of policy to develop both in internal development and in relations with the opposing bloc. I must destroy capitalism!! Reconstructing the fears, paranoias and risks run by the entire planet in the last 50 years of the twentieth century in a playful context is certainly not an easy undertaking: a situation of perpetual tension, with two opposing blocks perfectly capable of destroying each other each other in a few moments to contend for military, economic and even spatial domination, often acting indirectly in other conflicts, is not the ideal atmosphere to reconstruct in a video game, where the average audience requires frenetic action even at a strategic level, always leaving less room for reasoned approaches and diplomacy. In his search for realism, Supreme Ruler Cold War does not differ from its predecessors, giving the player too many situations to control, from the development guidelines of individual cities (where to build factories, where schools, where military structures) up to GDP of the various nations, the infrastructure network and the actions of the various ministers that make up the government. All this in high-level English and without a minimum tutorial to explain how to move within graphs and screens (which won't change much for the veterans of the series but for any newbies it would have been extremely useful). The representation of the world remains somewhat spartan, with the usual google maps globe to be zoomed freely up to the most unknown countries (even Guidonia has been slipped in), with generally anonymous counters indicating artillery rather than infantry, navy or air force (each single squadron can controlled individually, all over the world, and they all need functioning supply networks behind them!) and rather annoying sounds to underline war actions and troop movements (little more than a blurry cacophony of explosions and engine noises or tracks). Everything is developed on the screen with a real-time system that storms the player with reports, requests and problems one after the other, to which he contrasts almost biblical times for the execution of each single order (think of moving a armed from one nation to another), an inconvenience that could be resolved by increasing the speed of the passage of time, were it not that in doing so one would run the risk of losing some important report/alarm: during the test it happened that one did not notice a nuclear bomb dropped on St. Petersburg, which, as a side effect, had the collapse of the supply lines and consequently the failure to supply the armies at the front in France, leading ~quickly~ (a few hours of agony) to the game over. I long for America! In such a complex and demanding product, intended for a rather demanding niche audience, it is right to expect coherent answers from Artificial Intelligence, not only when speaking of the war front, in which the average reaction is rather immediate (relative to the times of the game) and solid, but also in diplomacy and social development resulting from the player's economic choices. And it is in these two points that some logical shortcomings show themselves, not just, with absurd peace proposals and even more improbable requests, not to mention senseless responses to the motions proposed by the player and street protests that spring up for no obvious reason here and there , just to make the picture even more complex and unmanageable. The problems of the AI are obviously taken into the background during the multiplayer experience capable of supporting up to 4 opponents at the same time, even if there is an evident difficulty in finding players, stable servers and spare time needed to challenge each other in campaigns definitely longer than a quick game of Starcraft 2 or Call of Duty (and dare we say even more boring).and less stimulating).", "date": "2011-08-03", "grade": "6.0"}
