{"name": "Super Monkey Ball Adventure", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/super-monkey-ball-adventure_a.html", "text": "Gnomeo and Juliet The story on which the adventure of the four monkeys Aiai, Baby, Gongon and MeeMee is based begins on a sunny summer afternoon in front of a succulent banana barbecue that the four monkeys are about to enjoy; suddenly in the sky they see a plane in a free dive and the village bells begin to ring. The bells, the King assures, only ring in moments of maximum crisis in the country, and this is one of them: in fact, the prince and princess of two neighboring kingdoms in conflict for a long time have escaped, it will be up to the four monkeys to find clues to discover the refuge of love of the two fugitives to avert a dangerous enemy invasion. The pretext on which the story is based is freely inspired by Romeo and Juliet and is the background in a very marginal way to the actual adventure. The main mode of the game is represented by the story mode, in addition to this it will be possible to participate in a series of mini-games that will help to significantly expand the longevity of Super Monkey Ball Adventure. The first minigame is called Monkey Race and is nothing more than a race between monkeys in a desperate attempt to reach the finish line in the lead; as in all games of the genre, there will be a whole series of bonuses and objects available to the player to use along the way to hinder the opponents. The second minigame is the so-called Monkey Target, where using the flight it will be necessary to guide the monkey on different islets to conquer precise objectives capable of giving a certain amount of points. Third in the category is Monkey Fight, the classic monkey ball 'fighting game', where players in an arena will compete to the last punch. The Monkey Cannon closes the list of mini-games, a sort of strategy game in which the monkeys are fired from the cannon to conquer bricks from the opposing walls: the better the launch, the greater the chances of conquering the enemy outpost. The list of modes in this new Monkey Ball chapter ends with the classic challenge, in which the player will face all 100 puzzle levels of the game in a mad race against time and against himself. Yai hey hey The principle on which Super Monkey Ball Adventure is based, absurdly, is much closer to an RPG than the classic platform: to continue during the game it will be necessary to help the inhabitants of the visited worlds, each of which will give the monkey a a very specific task such as waking up the guards in the trees, recovering such an object or going to a certain place in a certain time, once the mission has been completed, the player will be given important information as a prize to continue the search. To move from one world to another it will be necessary to complete a certain number of quests and to open doors for which it will be necessary to turn a kind of large key ten times (the operation is slow, tedious and frustrating in a way that is difficult to describe) . Some special areas will instead be openable by completing a series of classic stages a-la Monkey Ball, and will give access to areas full of bananas and bonuses. During the adventure it will be possible to learn four special spells capable of destroying (or avoiding) the obstacles along one's way; these spells will be evoked by pressing the directional key like a musical game: in the four directions there will be a word, to complete the spell it will be necessary to select the words suitable for the evocation. Unfortunately, the game lacks precision both in ball control and in collisions, which causes a dangerous chain reaction for which it is very easy to die falling from any platform and thus be forced to restart the mission you were following. In addition to the inaccuracy of the controls, the camera does not help create a good game experience: sometimes the monkeys seem too fast to be followed by the view and often you find yourself not knowing where to go or blindly heading towards a certain direction. The game, while presenting itself as a platform, subverts all the rules of the case by paying more attention to the aspects related to the resolution of the stage puzzles; the action is practically nonexistent and the missions wear out even the most tenacious player very soon. Graphically well done, Monkey Ball, while presenting a vast and diversified setting, does not exploit it if not minimally, leaving many empty and unused spaces. The attempt to detach itself from the original series remains in all respects a misstep: the game is inaccurate, sometimes frustrating and with few real motivations that drive the gameer to continue the adventure. However, the rejection remains halfway, Super Monkey Ball is saved due to the presence of the puzzle sections and mini-games, much more congenial to rolling monkeys. Pros: Really fun minigames. The puzzle component is always intriguing and well thought out. Cons: Bad control system. Frustrating and little additive. Cross-platform monkeys Although the ps2 and gamecube versions are almost similar in all respects, it is the PSP version that is the worst of the lot mainly due to the amplified camera control and management problems caused by the lack of the second analog stick. One of SEGA's most prolific series ever (at least as regards the last few years) is undoubtedly the one linked to the craziest monkeys in the world, capable of running inside a plastic ball for kilometers and kilometers just to reach the finish line . After various appearances on consoles and laptops, with games always veering towards the true nature of Super Monkey Ball, the puzzle games derived from Marble Madnessiana, the time has now come to give a twist to the saga of rolling primates, in an attempt to include them in a different videogame context, that of platformers.
