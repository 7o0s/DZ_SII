In reality, after having sifted through Bayonetta well, we can immediately state that the theory has already been put into practice, and that even the action game quartet that will arrive between now and March presents itself with a title of indisputable value. It's good to immediately clarify the pedigree of this game, developed by Platinum Games on behalf of Sega, after the half-successful experiment with Madworld for Wii. The project director is certainly not the latest arrival, but that Hideki Kamiya who has put his mouth in productions such as Resident Evil 2, Devil May Cry, Okami and so on; the rest of the team is also made up of departments of the never too late Clover Studios, another developer who has collected much less than he deserved. Here we are finally talking about Bayonetta, whose homonymous protagonist with very long legs and equipped with a latex suit had aroused some perplexity in terms of good taste and the aims of the developers. In reality, the game has a style to sell and never goes out of the ordinary, it is an expression of a Japanese culture often criticized for its immobility, but which in this case represents something new and fresh that leads the genre of action games without concessions out to a new level. Bayonetta is a witch armed to the teeth, even equipped with a set of guns anchored to her heels, who has awakened after a sleep of over 500 years and finds herself having to face angelic creatures of all sorts, roaming the game map in search, among other things, of one's past. The basic substrate takes up the classic concept of Light, Darkness and Chaos (the world of men), where the first two, represented specifically by the Sages of Lumen and the Witches of Umbra, have always guaranteed the cosmic balance with their struggle which, guess what, seems to be compromised in the game and absolutely needs to be restored. Playstation 3 trophies Bayonetta offers 51 trophies, of which 2 are gold and 10 are silver. Even their description takes up the goliardic and exaggerated style of the game, just think of the names of some of these, such as the one called ~I'm a str....ehm a witch~. To get the coveted Platinum you have to finish the game three times, due to the trophy linked to each unlocked difficulty level. For the rest, the others are obtained at the completion of the Alfheim portals, at the medals acquired after each verse and thanks to the use of all the techniques and combos available. Long live Latex! The setting, although not shining for originality, allowed the developer to indulge himself in the creation of enemies and game situations, seasoning everything with a healthy humor that never falls into the banal and which, paraphrasing a little the Dante of Devil May Cry, sees a protagonist never afraid of danger and always self-confident, brilliant dialogues and explosion of situations that often elicit a laugh and visually satisfy. That Bayonetta is out of the box can therefore be seen already starting from the narration, always proposed with the game engine but which alternates sequences identical to those of the gameplay with other proposals in the form of film, where there are static frames and the characters do not move their lips , finally returning a peculiar and personal style. You can see it in the musical accompaniment (we'll come back to it later), which offers an absolutely perfect mix of J-Pop and Jazz, with the much-loved and inflated ~Fly Me to the Moon~ which initially appears out of context, but which in reality it is extremely coherent with the type of gameplay that is proposed. In short, the ingredients for a title with its own personality are all there, but in Bayonetta the Platinum Games have not only racked their brains around their own genius or an exercise in style as an end in itself (criticisms that have sometimes been pointed out to previous works of its members, see God Hand and Madworld) but in the end it is the gameplay of the game that represents the major factor of the vote you see at the bottom of this review. No concessions to variations on the theme, Bayonetta is a bare-bones action in the third person, supported by the aforementioned narration and which focuses entirely on the combat phase and on the protagonist's incredible athletic skills, capable of performing devastating and lengthy combos disproportionate, provided you are capable of it. Deeper than you might initially think, the combat system designed by Platinum Games provides in the combinationof the keys and above all in dodging its fundamental element, where all the gameplay rests. The X key (square on PS3) is responsible for using the pistols, Y (triangle) for the punch, B (circle) for kicks and A (x) for jumping in all its forms. The combination of these keys allows access to a large number of combos, fleshed out by the techniques that can be acquired in Rodin's bar, a supporting actor who carries out his activity directly near the gates of hell. It goes without saying that the various objects to restore energy, momentarily increase power and so on are represented by some lollipops of different colors, which goes perfectly with the main protagonist and the goliardic atmosphere of the title. We were talking about the dodging element, which can be activated using the lower right backbone and which probably represents the most used element: it allows you to dodge any enemy attack and if performed just before being hit, it allows the activation of the so-called Temporal Sabbat, that others is nothing more than a slowdown in time during which it is possible to attack enemies with ease, perhaps by positioning oneself from behind. It is also essential to acquire the technique not to interrupt the combos when using this dodge, with the result that in the game, especially in the advanced stages, Bayonetta seems to dance from one point to another, to the rhythm of extremely devastating combos and spectacular fights. In fact, think of the possibilities offered by the combinations of guns, punches, kicks and then other weapons such as swords and claws, without forgetting the magic bar under the vitality bar, which allows access to further techniques that can end with torturing attacks, true and own final combos that involve the repeated pressure of the keys indicated on the screen to inflict greater damage. Still from the point of view of the concept of exaggeration, low profile enemies are just a diversion, a minority. Bayonetta is in fact the fair of medium and large bosses, with battles always at the limit and even chapters dedicated entirely to opponents who transship from the screen, and which make the fight a psychedelic party. The most important clashes can be ended by releasing the protagonist's ~Inner Beast~, which uses her hair and her latex suit to summon enormous demonic beasts capable of annihilating the unfortunate person in a spectacular and visually satisfying way. To name one of many, one of the funniest moments we had when after defeating a stone golem, it was reduced to a volleyball, with demonic hands that first made it a baker, then a lifter and finally a missed dunk, to then make him explode with four punches from all sides, due to the resulting piss. There is not even a lack of variety, which, although it relies on a well-defined but constant progression, offers an always high climax, seasoned with running sections, some transformations (such as the panther) for Bayonetta herself, literally 360-degree fights and passages where everything around collapses or affects the movements of the main protagonist, with the result that there is enormous satisfaction in tackling each section of the game. This climax remains high until the final boss and offers interesting notes even in the credits and immediately after, a symptom that Platinum Games are certainly not poor ideas. Finally, the camera follows Bayonetta directly but is also fully controllable with the right analog stick. Also in this case the work was painstaking, and we have one of the best realizations in this sense. Xbox 360 goals On 360 the exact same speech made for PlayStation 3 is valid. Bayonetta offers 50 objectives, with the most rewarding ones linked to the Alfheim portals and the completion of the game at the Climax difficulty level. Also in this case to get the 1000 points you have to finish the game three times, unlocking most of the techniques and accessories. Make me yours! The game structure is divided into sixteen chapters in addition to the prologue and epilogue and offers 3 initial difficulty levels, with the first two, novice and easy, which provide an automatic mode for some types of combos. Bayonetta can be completed between 9 and 11 hours of actual play, which therefore does not take into account any sections or bosses repeated several times, which can happen quite often. At this point it is possible to access a new difficulty level (and then yet another called ~Infinite Climax~) and the Bayonetta gallery, where there are many sketches of the characters, the soundtrackand game progression. A case that is not very common in video games today, the replayability of the title is not derived mainly from the extras unlocked or from the sections to be completed, represented in this case by arenas called Alfheim, but from the actual gameplay. By completing the game once, in fact, it is possible to access only a part of the techniques and combos that the title makes available, and it is therefore desirable to complete it again, also to accumulate a greater number of halos (basically the game's currency) to spend for above accessories and techniques. In fact, in each chapter there are verses that represent the various sections of combat, at the end of which a score and a bonus based on the number of combos, the time taken and the damage suffered are given. The same treatment occurs at the end of the chapter, with a statuette indicating the degree of skill, which we are sure will many times be stone until you begin to use dodging effectively. As they say, the classic phrase ~Easy to learn, difficult to master~ applies, where in Bayonetta if you want to access all the available paraphernalia and excel in the available online rankings, you have to almost completely avoid being hit, and ring combos with a high number concentration. Therefore, it is difficult to find obvious defects in the gameplay, if not those that the type of pure action based on combos and more can more or less like, because everything else is really calibrated to the thousandth. On the other hand, the choice of not giving the possibility to change the mapping of the keys and in attaching the dodge to the lower right backbone which, especially on PlayStation 3, does not shine for sensitivity and is not the most suitable for constant and continuous pressure, can be criticized. The technical system of Bayonetta follows hand in hand what has been said in the narration and gameplay phase, exceeding in the visual representation to the detriment of some rather crude elements. The audio dubbing is English with subtitles including Italian. More often than not there are rather hilarious but not easy to interpret slang meanings, as well as puns (Bitch/Witch) that have not always been translated into our language. The soundtrack, as mentioned, boasts of famous songs and music with a J-Pop orientation with Jazz influences, not even the quotation part is missing, with different levels that see, remixed or not, songs from Sega classics such as Outrun, After Burner , Space Harrier and Fantasy Zone. An excellent job has also been done in terms of sound effects, where explosions, slashes and so on are reproduced with good fidelity and bass power on dedicated systems. The graphic part is based a lot on the artistic side, where the programmers have indulged themselves in creating the game world, the paradise and the huge bosses in an always interesting and varied way, with peaks represented by absolutely enjoyable views to see, and the aforementioned variety of situations, intermission sequences and chaos present on the screen. The animations of Bayonetta could only be excellent as one of the foundations of the game, and in general the impact is excellent thanks to the aforementioned artistic system and the personal and uncommon vision that Platinum Games have of the creation of a video game . There are obviously some flaws, represented by some rather rough settings and not in line with the rest, the presence of particle effects that can be improved, the creation of revisable water and shadows and lights that are not always as precise as one would expect. For the rest, the graphics engine is quite solid and offers a frame rate that often reaches 60 frames per second, albeit with the necessary drops that never expire in the sphere of slowdowns. This is true at least for the Xbox 360 version, developed directly within Platinum Games. Sega took care of the conversion for PlayStation 3, with results that were at times truly incomprehensible. The frame rate is in fact practically halved compared to the Microsoft counterpart, the tearing is more marked, the texture resolution suffers in several cases from a greater use of blur, denoting a less defined image in the most chaotic situations. Let me be clear, the exceptional playful qualities of the title remain (almost) intact and the technical sector does its duty also on the Sony console, but owning both consoles or throwing an eye on both versions, never the difference (and consequently the choice) between the two counterparts was so egregious in favor of the Xbox 360. Beyond the chronic cross-platform PlayStation 3 problems due to different architecture, lack of resources and more, and the fact that it seems", "date": "2009-12-22", "grade": "9.5"}
