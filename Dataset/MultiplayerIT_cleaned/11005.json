After the unsuccessful interlude of Pro Street with Undercover, the developers of Black Box are trying to bring the series back to the glories achieved by Most Wanted. In this new chapter, the pillars of Need For Speed will not be overturned, Breathtaking races await us, challenges with the police and lots of new racing cars to drive, whizzing through the crowded streets of a new virtual metropolis. Obviously undercover Not even on purpose, you find yourself in the role of an undercover agent engaged in the fight against crime that revolves around clandestine racing. Together with Inspector Chase Linh, played by the beautiful actress Maggie Q, who is our only contact with the Tri-City police, we must try to break down the criminal gangs that infest the city. To analyze this new automotive title, we cannot ignore the initial impact of the game, since after a very short film that simulates a chase, we are immediately catapulted aboard our car while we try to outrun several police patrols. Let's stop here and analyze what can be seen above the bonnet of our car. A large American metropolis with its skyscrapers that stand directly on a beautiful bay, with the sun's rays reflecting everywhere and with a color tone of the entire scene that reminded us very closely of what we saw in the film Miami Vice directed by Michael Mann. But this is only the beginning, and the short clips of films that act as an interlude between the various competitions and above all between our successes in the world of illegal racing, are made in a very cinematic way and allow us to get to know the different protagonists of this extremely dangerous world. Obviously women and engines is a combination that always works and therefore one of the greatest gratifications is given by the possibility of enjoying beautiful girls who, as always, revolve around the racing champions. Throwback with few differences Coming to speak directly of the gameplay, it should be emphasized that, unlike the previous chapter which made us compete exclusively in already pre-established tracks, here you can instead freely explore the different areas of Tri-City. You enter the different competitions directly by simply pressing down on the d-pad of our joypad, and in doing so you take part in the challenge closest to our position or the one recommended by the developments of the plot. Alternatively, you can view the entire city map and choose individual competitions even if they are far from our current position. This structure chosen by the Black Boxes, although very immediate, risks making it practically useless to roam freely around the metropolis, unless you want to challenge the policemen face to face. The challenges are of different types, from the obvious and immediate one against other road racers, to highway races, circuit competitions up to the most exciting challenges against the police, perhaps after stealing a car, or trying to escape and causing as much damage as possible to city structures. The modality that has favorably impressed us is that of the challenges on the highways, five-lane motorways in which an opponent is faced in rush hour traffic, and where the winner is whoever manages to distance the other by a few hundred meters. Obviously in all competitions you are hindered by the intervention of the police, but there are two types of competitions in which the challenge will be aimed at the forces of order. Usually, on commission from one of the bosses of the EA title, a newly stolen car must be brought to a body shop to make it disappear from circulation, obviously first of all ~the cops~ must be sown, who will try to stop us by any means, from normal patrols, to the helicopters to the always numerous checkpoints. You also need to be very careful about the damage you incur, given that you cannot take a car that is too damaged to a trusted bodyshop, otherwise you will fail the test. The other very interesting mode is the one in which to create several thousand dollars of damage in the city, destroying parts of the roadway, damaging vehicles and above all knocking out. the police cars. To do this, just let yourself be chased and bring the fight to the ground that is congenial to us where scaffolding and various supports collapse directly on the cars of the fearsome cops. Every time we manage to recreate one of these situations, a movie will start showing us the bad end reserved for the pursuers, unfortunately the times don't always coincide perfectly and alsoif the opponents are far away, the collision system attributes the dollars earned from the destruction of the police cars and eliminates the pursuers. We will be able to disintegrate the opponents by dominating the competitions or win the different challenges normally, in the first case we will earn more skill points to increase our characteristics and our ability to better optimize the vehicles. You start by driving a very normal car, and after a few races you win the ~registration documents~ so that soon the cars of our dreams appear in our garage, from Audis to Ford Mustangs. A block has been inserted on the purchase of cars in correspondence with the skill level of the driver, in practice even if the sum necessary for the purchase has already been raised, it cannot be carried out until a certain level of skill has been reached ability. Each car can be modified both in appearance and performance thanks to a few steps and by spending the dollars earned by winning. One aspect that we have not digested very willingly is the possibility of buying cars and ~improvement packages~, by spending not virtual dollars but real Microsoft Points, the expense therefore becomes real for our pockets. Xbox 360 goals The usual 1000 points this time has been divided into 50 achievements, and you have to dig deep into the EA game to get them all. We are required to interact with the online and EA servers, not only win challenges, but actively participate in the community, and above all you have to beat all the different characters in the game such as Zack, Carmen and Hector and escape the police several times . A tough task. Lights and Shadows From a technical point of view, the Electronic Arts game has a fluctuating performance. First of all, the sensation of speed is very good, the driving model seemed valid to us, decidedly arcade and very simplified, the car is glued to the ground and it is difficult to spin it out of control. A further facilitation is given by the X key which gives the possibility to enter a sort of bullet time, perfect for dodging cars in city traffic. The level of challenge seemed too low from the beginning, it is not possible to win almost all the races at the first opportunity without knowing the tracks, which however happened very often during our tests. In practice it is impossible to mistake the path to follow during a competition, all alternative roads are closed, so forget the freedom of Burnout Paradise, with respect to which Need For Speed Undercover has very limited free roaming. As far as the construction of the city and the car models are concerned, we can only be satisfied, the cars are bright and colorful and very defined in every detail. The city is quite varied, featuring skyscrapers and construction sites alternating with elevated roads and five-lane highways, but what is really missing is the sense of ~lived in~, since there are no pedestrians on the street and the city looks more like a film set what a metropolis. One of the aspects that we liked the most is certainly the one related to the lighting: the Black Box technicians did a great job and the refraction effects are excellent, with a continuous alternation of light and shadow. The real sore point is that relating to the stability of the graphics engine, the same one actually used in the previous chapter, which however here more than sometimes inexplicably suffers from heavy slowdowns that negatively affect the gaming experience. The audio sector is very accurate, with music that goes well with the setting and above all with a very good dubbing, both of the protagonists and of the police in general, it is really exciting to hear the ~cops~ exchanging information about our escape at the same moment in which they try to intercept us. The online part can certainly not escape our comment, and in summary we must confirm that we were satisfied with what was prepared by the Black Boxes. There are three modes in which to challenge each other, the most important is certainly Guards and Thieves, the other two offer nothing more than quick races on a linear path or more laps on a circuit, and are called Sprint and precisely Circuit. Guardie e Ladri is a sort of ~capture the flag~ on board the racing cars, the thieves will have to deposit the stolen goods while the police forces will have to prevent them by blocking them in all ways. Nothing particularly new but certainly an exciting challenge.", "date": "2008-11-28", "grade": "6.8"}
