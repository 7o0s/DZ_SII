The announcement of Dead Rising 4: Frank's Big Package was therefore welcomed with some enthusiasm: Capcom Vancouver's latest effort arrives on the Sony platform exactly one year after its debut on Xbox One, but with a complete edition, which includes natively both the new free Capcom Heroes mode, and the DLC Frank Rising and Super Ultra Dead Rising 4 Minigolf, along with lots of extra costumes with which to transform the good old Frank West into a cosplayer as ridiculous as it is lethal. Back to Willamette After the attempt to expand the Dead Rising universe with new protagonists, the fourth episode puts us back in the shoes of Frank West, a former assault reporter now a night school teacher. In one of his recurring nightmares, Frank finds himself in the Willamette mall, where it all began, surrounded by zombies and finally ferociously bitten by an undead version of him. Not even the time to recover from yet another bad night and is contacted by Vick, a student of his, who with the excuse of a game of mini golf leads him towards what could be a sensational journalistic investigation: a military organization in the pay of the government of the The United States is conducting experiments to develop the ultimate zombie weapon, and it's doing it right in Willamette. During the introductory phase we are presented with one of the novelties of Dead Rising 4, namely the investigative mode: thanks to some modifications made by Vick to our camera, we will be able to use its lens not only to capture images of various kinds, but also to scan and hack electronic devices. During the campaign, this feature is repeated several times to find out details about what is happening, together with frankly unsuccessful and equally undervalued stealth sections; but in the initial phase things don't go the right way, Frank and Vick are discovered and they separate. When the former photojournalist returns home, with a nice arrest warrant issued by the government on his shoulders, he is contacted by Brad Park, a ZDC agent who wants to clarify the matter and is looking for an ally to return to Willamette. Frank doesn't want to start living that nightmare again, but after learning that Vick is still in place and is conducting his own investigations at the risk of his life, he decides to accept the mission... All mine the city Apart from some inaccuracies in the direction, the opening sequences of Dead Rising 4 put us in front of a really well written script, with hilarious jokes and skits (Park showing his cell phone to Frank saying ~Is this familiar to you?~, but by mistake the photo he shows him is a selfie he took shirtless in the bathroom), as well as a perfect characterization for the protagonist, who from personal experience has learned in spite of himself to appreciate the smell of roasted zombies and to have very few problems with respect to the fact that those undead were previously humans. The excellent dubbing in Italian manages to enhance this vision, a pity only for some unbalanced volume levels during the cutscenes. In any case, once back in Willamette we will be able to explore not only its newly rebuilt shopping center (and immediately victim of another zombie invasion: a record on which Frank himself is ironic with an employee of the facility), but also the areas of the city that surround it, from the point of view of a generously sized sandbox. Moving through the streets avoiding the thousands of zombies that crowd them often depends on the use of vehicles, less emphasized than in Dead Rising 3 and seen in this case more as a ~service~ practice than a combat one, although armored vehicles and In general, you can iron hundreds and hundreds of undead just by driving around the city. It is at this juncture that the ability of the graphics engine to handle so many characters without giving in to drops in frame rate and keeping the thirty frames per second stable, although this consistency is paid for in terms of effects and detail: the shadows are of low quality , the secondary polygonal models appear not very detailed and several glitches are noticed. The art of killing The key element of the gameplay of Dead Rising, namely the combat system, has been redesigned in this fourth chapter to be more immediate in the selection of weapons. In fact, it is enough to act on the directions of the d-pad to equipquickly re throwing, melee and fire tools, which can be collected around the scenario together with the inevitable supplies of food or medikits for restoring health. Unfortunately, however, when you get to the point, you realize that many of the original limits of the franchise are still in place: managing the view during the most agitated situations is problematic, but above all the variety of attacks is assigned solely to the type of tool used, given that for the rest it is enough to repeatedly press the Square button (Triangle to repel), raise the combo indicator and then perform a spectacular finisher with Square and Triangle together. The emphasis on impacts is less marked than in the beginning, probably due to the fact that it is no longer Capcom in the first person who deals with the development, and this inevitably makes the clashes less pleasant. Added to this is the fact that the boss fights are very approximate due to the limitations to which one must submit, which translates into the possibility of winning only if one has effective weapons (especially those built thanks to the inevitable projects scattered around the map) and a supply of medicines to remedy the damage that we will inevitably suffer. In reality, this aspect of the experience does not differ much from what the first Dead Rising had accustomed us to, but it is true that many years have passed since then and it would have been reasonable to expect a solid evolution of those mechanics. From this point of view, it is surprising that so many uncertainties in the interaction system with the scenario (see the collection of objects) have not been fixed in the transition from Xbox One and PC to PlayStation 4, almost as if the developers did not perceive these elements as of the defects. Instead, we continued to appreciate the character upgrade system, which based on the experience points earned allows you to improve your skills within four different categories: Fighting, Temperament, Shooting and Survival. To raise the level of the experience we think a structure full of situations and surprises, including the unfailing psychopaths who hide within thematic areas, but which this time constitute a side dish rather than a real narrative element; as well as the inclusion of some interesting innovations (see the possibility of using a powerful exoskeleton) and the aforementioned plot, although in the end about ten hours are enough to complete the campaign: not a lot for a product of this kind. Playstation 4 trophies The fifty-eight Trophies of Dead Rising 4: Frank's Big Package can be obtained by completing the various chapters that make up the campaign, but also and above all by dissecting the contents of the game in terms of collectibles, costumes, crafting and photographs. There is obviously no shortage of achievements related to the DLCs and those unlockable by making Frank grow based on his skills. The big pack The Frank's Big Package edition, as mentioned at the beginning, natively includes a series of extra contents that undoubtedly make the game more full-bodied and varied. In addition to the interesting cooperative multiplayer, equipped with its own progression system and very tantalizing mechanics, already present on Xbox One and PC, it is in fact possible to try your hand at the Frank Rising expansion, which however is not the case to talk about since it takes place after the end of the campaign and therefore contains some rather heavy spoilers, and the Super Ultra Dead Rising 4 Minigolf. The latter, which can be played in single or multiplayer, offers a decidedly crazy vision of the traditional minigolf, with courses dotted with zombies, spectacular evolutions and rules that in the end are based on the real counterpart of this discipline. Equipped with an exoskeleton, we will be able to literally blow up the undead hit by our ~ball~, but the goal remains to pocket with the fewest shots possible. The end result is fun and carefree, but what really makes the difference is the free Capcom Heroes mode, which basically allows you to replay the entire campaign, counting however on a series of transformations that lead Frank to acquire the features and abilities of some of the most famous Capcom characters: from Mega Man to Ryu, from Viewtiful Joe to Dante, from Cammy to M. Bison. This peculiarity, which transforms the story into a sort of ~dream mode~, actually makes the game's combat system more multifaceted and fun, with spectacular and special combos that reflect the repertoire of each fighter.", "date": "2017-12-07", "grade": "7.5"}
