{"name": "Ultimate Ghosts'n Goblins", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ultimate-ghostsn-goblins.html", "text": "The Return of the Spotless Knight (on long johns) First of all, a dutiful clarification: this Ultimate Ghosts'n Goblins is certainly not a remake of the first episode, as the title could, moreover, erroneously imply, but neither does it represent a complete renewal of the saga. It is actually a kind of dutiful tribute from Capcom to the historic admirers of the series, in the form of a skilful amalgam of new and old, classic and modern elements that blend successfully, characterizing a product that succeeds in the difficult trying to please everyone. The game mechanic is therefore absolutely the ~historical~ one, being a platform with a two-dimensional structure (and, mind you, only structure, because as we will see in reality the graphics engine is entirely three-dimensional), in which we will have to help the good Arthur to overcome horizontally developed levels, making his way through hordes of spirits and undead to save the poor princess, kidnapped for the umpteenth time and kept segregated in the Dark Realm. Just the enemies that stand in our way represent one of the first elements of distinction of this chapter, standing out compared to the past not only for the variety and number of presences simultaneously on the screen, but also for the attack patterns, now much more irregular and unpredictable. Furthermore, the introduction of the end-of-level bosses is particularly apt, absolutely sensational in terms of characterization and proved to be a very tasty diversion between one level and another when tested. Inevitably, precisely to adequately deal with these renewed threats, Arthur's offensive capabilities have also evolved hand in hand. In fact, now our hero enjoys the possibility of throwing his weapons also upwards and downwards and is equipped, at least for the Novice and Standard difficulty levels, with a real energy bar for his armor, which will not break more on the first try leaving him clad only in the now legendary long johns. Even the arsenal has undergone a substantial revision, in fact there are many new entries alongside the inevitable spears, torches or daggers: in this case the work done is convincing but with some hesitation, since some weapons actually turn out to be very little useful to the cause (for example the whips, even if they can be useful for collecting apparently unreachable objects), while others are too effective (the darts with automatic target search). The introduction of spells (complete with a bar that limits their use) and special abilities that the good Arthur can learn during the adventure ends, to the full advantage of the variety of fights. Surely, however, one of the aspects that most interests lovers of the saga is the control system, a real characteristic element (for better or for worse) of the series. Well, the path taken by Capcom for this new chapter faithfully respects tradition, since in practice the original control has been re-proposed with very few modifications: therefore be prepared to find an Arthur with somewhat awkward and nervous movements, equipped with an directional in flight that you will end up cursing several times after the umpteenth fall from a platform. It is a courageous choice in some ways, certainly appreciated by long-standing players who are a bit purists (and the writer is certainly part of this category), but which nevertheless could risk displeasing those approaching a game for the first time. title of the GnG series expecting a product equipped with a control system in step with the times. Remove the armor from the mothballs So if this Ultimate Ghosts'n Goblins from the gameplay point of view can all in all be considered as an old-fashioned title, as far as the technical sector is concerned, instead we are on decidedly current levels. The PSP hardware has in fact been adequately squeezed, and the results can be seen: the levels, entirely made in 3D, overflow with details and polygons, and the engine grinds everything to practically granite 30 frames (some occasional slowdown occurs in the most chaotic), making us often forget that we are playing with a portable console. The artistic direction is, as per the good tradition of the series, very well-kept, which translated means an amazing design of levels and characters, although the animations are not exactly the best. Thumbs up also the audio sector, especially as regards the musical accompaniment, probably the best of the series, while the effects have proved to be a little too limited. As for the longevity discourse, the title played on the Standard difficulty level riesce to guarantee from 6 to 8 hours of fun, however this value rises drastically if you want to try your hand at the Ultimate level (in which you have fewer lives available, you start over from the beginning of the level every time you die and the armor you break with a single blow) or you want to dissect every secret and recover every item. This is an option that, if you really want to relive the feeling of a Ghosts'n Goblins, we obviously cannot fail to recommend warmly. Gentlemen, a round of applause to Capcom. It is never easy to fish out a franchise that has been out of the market for years, because you run the risk of not knowing how to adapt the game mechanics and the technical sector to the new videogame canons, yet the Osaka house has done it, indeed it is perfectly successful in the enterprise. This Ultimate Ghosts'n Goblins is in fact a perfect mix of old-fashioned gameplay, in order to satisfy fans of the series, and technique in step with the times, but expertly crafted so as not to distort anything. In short, perfect for nostalgics and lovers of the saga, but equally recommended for anyone who wants to enjoy some healthy fun with such a splendidly retro taste. Pros It's 100% Ghosts'n Goblins Technically very accurate and well made Challenging and long-lived... Cons ...but certain passages are bordering on frustrating The retro control system may not appeal to everyone It's always great to meet an old friend after a long time. We had left the good Arthur in the 16-bit generation, at the height of his success, with his presence on practically all the platforms available for the time. We considered him a gaming icon by now, without knowing that in the following years he would actually disappear from circulation, relegating his presence to quick appearances in a few titles here and there (someone remembers him in Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes ?). Let's face it, after seeing him also supplanted by Maximo, in the first 3-dimensional incarnation of the ~Double G~ series, we really feared that the time for definitive retirement had inexorably arrived for Arthur. But we were wrong, and how if we were wrong", "date": "2006-10-05", "grade": null}
