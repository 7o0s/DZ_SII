{"name": "Resistere  l'unica opzione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/resistance-retribution-recensione.html", "text": "We are in an alternate 1951, and World War II never ended. Coming from Russia, a new force has taken the field and has literally conquered the world: it is the Chimera, an alien species that settled in the territories of the Soviet Union at the beginning of the century and which now has the necessary means to implement your own plan of conquest. All nations are quickly subjugated, with the only exception of England: from there a resistance movement starts which over time finds a way to eliminate the enemy, above all thanks to the efforts of a single man, a sort of patient-zero in able to survive despite the alien contamination that normally turns men into Chimera soldiers: Sergeant Nathan Hale. Protagonist of Resistance: Fall of a Man, Hale succeeds in destroying the alien outposts and in particular blows up the Chimera tower located in central London. A heavy blow for the enemy, but only a beginning for the resistance: there is still the rest of Europe to be freed, to build a small hope of defeating the Chimera forever. It is a war that mankind was unprepared to fight, and which is claiming millions of civilian and military casualties. Lieutenant James Grayson knows something about it, who finds his brother missing in action only to then have to kill him with his own hands, since he had been transformed into a Chimera. This personal tragedy drives Grayson mad, and he deserts from the British Army to engage in a series of one-man operations that lead to the destruction of more than twenty alien conversion centers. Arrested by British troops, he was sentenced to death but saved in extremis by Lieutenant Raine Bouchard because he was the only connoisseur of alien conversion centres. Bouchard, daughter of a French researcher, wants Grayson to join the Maquis army to show them the way to the heart of the Chimera structures. The objective of the mission is to put into circulation a serum capable of blocking the reproductive functions of the aliens... portable resistance Developed by Sony Bend, team responsible for the Siphon Filter series, Resistance: Retribution tries to translate the gameplay of Resistance: Fall of a Man into a portable context, trying in some way to overcome the technical limitations of PSP, and to connect to the second chapter recently released for PlayStation 3. Firstly, the game no longer presents itself as a first person shooter, but becomes in third person: our view is behind the protagonist, James Grayson, and in the center of the screen we can see a viewfinder moves using the Square, Triangle, Circle and X buttons instead of the Dual Shock 3's right stick. It is a solution already seen on the Sony portable console, which in this specific case, however, is supported by an automatic lock-on system that hooks the enemies and therefore does not force us to act continuously on the buttons. It is possible to open fire with the backbone R, while the backbone L activates the secondary function of each weapon. The left analog stick clearly allows us to move the character and to take advantage of any shelters to position ourselves behind: near barriers and walls, Grayson automatically lurks and it will be up to us to lean out just enough to score a few bursts. Finally, the four directions of the d-pad are used to interact with the environment (down), reload the equipped weapon (left), switch to the next weapon (right) or activate manual aiming (up). The latter proves necessary in the presence of particular enemies such as the ~Racchie~, Chimera females characterized by a skin as hard as leather: to kill them you have to hit them on the head before they get too close, because at that point they will explode like kamikazes, causing us non-negligible damage. By holding down the d-pad to the right, you can access a more reasoned selection of weapons, which pauses the action and through two screens provides us with the eight weapons that we can collect and use during the game. An absolutely indispensable solution when you need to change weapons on the fly... James Grayson's Arsenal Although the references to the weapons present in Resistance: Fall of a Man are clear, the arsenal at our disposal in Retribution is fundamentally different from that seen on PS3. The basic weapon, the Tempesta .303 rifle, is very similar to Resistance's M5A2: it is an accurate, fast and quite powerful machine gun, equipped with a grenade launcher. The second weapon that we will come into possession of, the BM003 Razor, on the other hand, appears only as a pale imitation of the Bullseye, as it does not have the enemy tracking function and itshe secondary function is a ~blade~ that must be loaded and which, once launched, bounces off the walls in search of the Chimera present. There is always room for a sniper rifle, in this case the Fareye FR-1, equipped with the classic power to ~slow down time~ which allows us to aim in complete tranquility to place headshots (and, more importantly , you can move the crosshair with the stick instead of the buttons). Alongside the fragmentation grenade, very powerful and useful in desperate situations, we find a really effective shotgun during close combat (even with bigger enemies) and a missile launcher to be used when the bosses are very big and very slow. The Auger rifle closes the circle, which as in Resistance: Fall of a Man allows you to shoot through walls and identify the Chimera stationed, and an IWAO-R large-caliber machine gun, slow to engage but effective and precise. Both of these weapons offer useful barriers to avoid taking damage when out in the open: in the case of the Auger, it works ~by shots~, while for the machine gun there is a bar that determines the duration of the protection. Also part of the arsenal are the turrets that from time to time we will be able to use in some stages, really powerful even if equipped with single shots instead of bursts, and obviously the huge TANK, a Chimera destruction machine that we will have the opportunity to pilot in a couple of occasions and which has an extraordinary power between missiles and machine guns. In the locations we will find plenty of ammunition and energy packs, to make up for an energy bar always organized on four ~cells~ which, however, are not restored in moments of tranquility: the loss of health is clear and incontrovertible, unlike in the first episode of the PS3 series. Extra game modes Unfortunately Resistance: Retribution does not have an online multiplayer, which is really a shame given that such a mode would have exponentially increased the longevity of the product. It is possible to challenge friends locally, however, for up to eight players. And if you own a PS3 and Resistance 2, plugging your PSP into it will unlock the interesting Infected mode. This is not a simple sop, but an entire alternative story mode in which characters and situations change, and which added to the already very long and demanding single player mode significantly increases the duration of the experience. Technical realization It was not easy to downgrade Resistance: Fall of a Man to meet the technical possibilities of the PSP, and it is clear that those who have tried the game on PlayStation 3 will find graphics that are certainly more modest, less rich and less spectacular things. The main difference lies in the polygonal models, which are too simple and angular as usual, with woody and sometimes rough animation. The Chimera soldiers have almost all already been seen, with simplified forms for the occasion, and the novelties are unfortunately not exciting in terms of number and design. The game abuses the classic ~glow~ effect, seen very often on PS2, and fails in special effects such as explosions, which are really disappointing. The cutscenes are pre-calculated but do not differ much from what was seen during the action in real time, with the only advantage of some filters to improve aliasing and light management. It must be said that a great job of diversification was done for the internships: the six areas that we will have to clean up are divided into an enormous number of internships and boast peculiar characteristics both in terms of the shades used and in terms of the landscapes . Where power did not reach, therefore, it was remedied with imagination and ingenuity. The graphics engine manages every situation without problems, maintaining a good frame rate (unfortunately you don't get to 30 fps, but the distance isn't abysmal) apart from during the final stages of the adventure, where you notice more than one uncertainty. As far as the sound is concerned, unfortunately, there's nothing to go crazy about: the music is discreet but far from epic, it doesn't involve enough and the quality of the effects (too ~soft~) does the rest. The game is dubbed in Italian, but the level of acting is honestly insufficient: the characters speak without conviction, out of context, and the general quality of the localization has the only merit of reminding us how many steps forward have been made from this point of view with the advent of next-generation consoles.", "date": "2009-04-13", "grade": "8.0"}
