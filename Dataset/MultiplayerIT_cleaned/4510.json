Ubisoft continues to confirm itself as a company that is very attentive to its productions, determined to support its titles even in the long term. In fact, Steep has always been a rather niche product and it is surprising to see so much care put into a video game intended for the hands of a few players, pampered exactly like the huge army that instead enjoys Far Cry or the current Assassin's Creed every year . However, we are not faced with the usual load of additional challenges to face or new dresses to decorate our virtual alter ego, a choice that would have made most people turn up their noses, but rather a new adventure to be experienced in the first person, with lots of plot, if we can define it that way, with linear development. The main argument? Obviously the Olympics! Playstation 4 trophies By completing the PyeongChang Olympics and winning gold in the three available disciplines you will have already completed almost all the available trophies, with the exception of the medals for the disciplines in Japan which will require you a few extra minutes. In total we find one gold, two silver and three bronze trophies, completionists will have no difficulty collecting them all. Welcome back to the snow Even if you have put Steep aside for the whole summer period, maybe enjoying yourself with something more suited to this year's Saharan temperatures, you don't have to worry: once installed, Road to the Olympics is easily distinguished from all the contents previous ones, taking the right space in the global world map of Steep. From the practical menu you can thus reach the Asian mountains and the challenges prepared for the occasion with just a few clicks. The new DLC, as we said at the beginning, lays its foundations, however, on a much more linear development by proposing as the main experience the dream of a perfect stranger to become a triple Olympic gold medalist in the 2018 PyeongChang competition. Thus you will begin a whole series of challenges in sequence on board the snowboard that will lead you to learn the basics and tricks to impress the public and the jury in the various categories available. They range from Big Air to freestyle obviously passing from halfpipe races, for a variety that is certainly not the strong point of the package. The beauty of Steep remains engraved in the possibility of moving freely through the mountains, of flying over the snowy expanses with our suit or of inventing new trajectories every time, while in this latest vision everything is reduced to elementary competitions and structured in a rather superficial way. In fact, there are a couple of elements that we just couldn't digest, first of all the decision to maintain pre-established figures for the results of the other contenders in the race. In fact, each challenge has a fixed value to overcome, passed off as the score achieved by your opponents, but which in reality represents only a mere number to beat. Thus the sense of live and real competition vanishes and one remains trapped in what on balance is an unsuccessful simulation of a real race, completely tearing away the main challenge component: unpredictability, and with this also a large part of the emotions . In Road to the Olympics regardless of the result of the heats, you will always start last with the classification already ready and, what is even more serious, from the first session you will know if the session is in your hands or if you should directly repeat the challenge . We have more than once achieved an amazing score on the first go and descended the other slopes in a straight line only to cross the finish line quickly, knowing that the artificial intelligence would never beat our result: a decision we cannot promote . Luckily there is much more If it is therefore true that the competition itself leaves the time it finds and is exhausted in about three or four hours, the packaging with which it is presented is in any case of a good standard. The story and progress of our adventure are told through the use of interviews with real ski and snowboard champions, who tell the various emotions they felt and what it really means to participate in such a competition. The whole atmosphere is excellent and it's a pity that it's the gameplay that doesn't satisfy. In this particular mode, forget your precious bizarre clothes worn during the main adventure: here you are at the Olympics and there is no way that a moose head or a trunk on your shoulders can make their appearance on the official slopes. Road to the Olympics is herethen a DLC that tries to take itself more seriously than the adventure offered by Steep, only partially succeeding. It is certainly something new but we are not sure that it can be appreciated by all players of the old guard, also due to a price that is not exactly suited to the proposed contents. Fortunately, the DLC also brings many interesting things, especially when the challenge is put back into the hands of the players and the disciplines start to vary more. The introduction of the Asian snowboard cross, downhill and giant slalom competitions, both on skis and snowboards, is certainly a big plus as they are fun and in first person they give a sense of speed and a really excellent adrenaline. Too bad then that we have chosen to bring only one race per type to Steep, accompanied among other things by a fairly boring and repetitive commentary that will soon bore you with its extremely limited range of jokes. If you loved the exploration of the base game you can still forget what has been said up to this point and leave it completely. In addition, new competitions have also been implemented in the Japanese regions of Deisetsu and Sapporo to increase the number of hours available to you.", "date": "2017-12-06", "grade": "7.0"}
