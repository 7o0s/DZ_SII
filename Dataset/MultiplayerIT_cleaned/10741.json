{"name": "Elfi in battaglia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/elven-legacy-recensione-rev.html", "text": "With Fantasy Wars of 2007, the Russian developer Ino-Co introduced an unprecedented variant in the stagnant landscape of turn-based strategy, enjoying some success with critics and audiences; hence the decision of the new property - the publisher 1C who acquired the company a few months ago - to re-propose an updated version albeit with a different title under the Paradox label. Elven Legacy, as well as its predecessor, is a curious mix between Etherlords and Ground Control: the fantasy settings and even some units have been taken with full hands from the first; of the second the game structure in which everything is decided on the battlefield. There is no resource gathering, no upgrades to discover or buy in strongholds. These, while continuing to exist and essentially representing the only buildings on the map, serve exclusively to allow the insertion or replenishment of troops, while providing a certain amount of gold essential for recruiting new militias. There is no shortage of unique units such as the heroes of WarCraft III and a thousand other titles, but these represent only a small addition on the balance of the clashes, and those who think they can use them as war machines will have to change their mind after a few games played even at the level of difficulty lower, thanks to a refined artificial intelligence that demonstrates its skills from the very first skirmishes. These few lines could already be enough to describe how much care is needed even just to place one's ~tanks~ on the virtual chessboard, which is divided into hexagons. The view adopted is the classic isometric; depending on the zoom level, the troops are represented by the individual warriors of which they are composed (if you get very close) or by a single and larger unit. Style made in USSR Elven Legacy is the classic title that is as easy to learn as it is difficult to master. Let us raise a demerit note for the sterile tutorial, the most crude we have seen in recent videogames: beyond a localization problem (a part of the speech was in his native Russian), it was tedious and not very instructive to be forced to watch a low-resolution introductory video (YouTube style) before practicing with the mouse, a necessary and sufficient device to fully control the interface. Once you understand the game mechanics, you will have to think about how to make the most of the peculiarities of your men and the morphological characteristics of the map. Of course, placing a catapult on top of a hill will increase its range and accuracy, while moving with knights in a forest will dramatically slow down its movements and defensive capabilities. The sacred rule of the Chinese pen also applies in Elven Legacy: for example, air units such as griffins have among the highest attack values yet are extremely vulnerable to even fragile archers. The tactic of the few but good therefore almost never pays off and makes the strategic aspect more refined. With the experience gained on the war field, the troops increase their level, and the player can choose with which modifiers to enhance them: it is interesting to note that the improvement is not always one-way - magicians, for example, can prolong the effects of certain spells but having to sacrifice some defensive capabilities. From the main menu it is possible to choose whether to face an interesting campaign, in which all five factions present in the game will be known, as well as obviously scenarios to be played against the computer or on the internet. The single-player mode is noteworthy not so much for the story, obvious and with little bite, rather because in Elven Legacy the need to increase the level of one's units is not marked at all and the possibility of tackling missions from time to time is more demanding represents its real added value. In fact, it is not enough to annihilate the enemy factions: in some cases it is required to do so within a certain limit of turns (and whoever takes the least turns will be rewarded with gold or other bonuses), or to reach an area of the map unscathed, a task that it might appear simple at first glance, considering that the dimensions of the levels are always small, but it hides more pitfalls than you think. The fact then that the heroes who accompany the player from the beginning to the end of the adventure are always the same allows you to create that pleasant virtual bond and helps to make you think twice before sending your alters to slaughter. ego, favoring the reflexive approach to battles. In total there are 18 levels in the Out-Run: if you choose to take one path, the others will automatically be closed, thus giving lifeto different endings and increasing replay value. The technical realization The graphics engine is the same as the previous Fantasy Wars, and barely manages to hide the wrinkles of age. Used for the first time by SkyFallen for the bad hack and slash Dawn Of Magic (but also for the much more valid King's Bounty), TheEngine, dated 2005, still uses the DirectX 9 libraries and therefore can reach the maximum detail even on Windows XP. Essential graphics can be useful, especially for titles that, like Elven Legacy, don't make the visual sector one of their priorities, but it is equally true that the current standards are quite different. The tested version was not free from some flaws that will certainly be corrected by a few small patches. Even the sound sector remains in the most absolute anonymity, both as regards the music, not particularly inspired as far as it is suited to the fantasy atmospheres of the game, and for the dubbing, which is really bad. The longevity factor is guaranteed by the aforementioned single player campaign, while we raise reservations on the actual goodness of the multiplayer title, where a good dose of atmosphere is lost that only the single player can offer. We at Multiplayer.it weren't lucky enough to find other players on the net, but we made up for it with a classic LAN session and we must admit that the enthusiasm was certainly not at the levels of more famous titles.", "date": "2009-04-26", "grade": "6.7"}
