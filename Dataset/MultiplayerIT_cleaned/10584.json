After almost ten years of interspersed appearances on PlayStation 2 and Xbox, new generations of enthusiasts can now experience what remains one of the most enjoyable experiences of the genre, sold via Live Arcade, since last July 29th, and PlayStation Network, since August 13th , for about 15 euros. Street Fighter light? Marvel vs Capcom 2, like all the other three chapters of the series to which it belongs, was born from the desire to take the mechanics at the base of each Street Fighter and make them more accessible and spectacular, dramatically increasing the size of the combos and levels, making this case also select teams of three interchangeable characters during the clashes. The need therefore remains to control the space and to know the virtues of one's fighters, but the request for maniacal precision in the execution of the moves decreases, with two fewer keys - the medium intensity buttons are lost, even if the relative blows are equally reproducible - and an upward development of the action, with a huge amount of moves that can be performed even when in the air. In this sense, the conversion is perfect, the gameplay unchanged and each of the fifty-six characters inserted the same as in the past, making it possible to perfectly reproduce the incredible variety of situations offered by a gameplay that is rarely so frenetic, with the super bar almost always full and a number of different possibilities to coordinate the characters that you have available, enough to make it perhaps the best team fighting game ever created, certainly the most accessible and visually satisfying. ~Easy to play, hard to master~, in short, with the firm need, before jumping into the online fray, to scrape together a good number of hours of play, a sensible team and maybe some challenges in the company of a friend of the same level, in order not to risk remaining motionless suffering a hundred consecutive blows. Xbox 360 goals The usual 200 points, with some focus on winning online multiplayer, executing combos from a given number of hits and using certain teams. Not easy to obtain Backbone security This new conversion was handled by Backbone, former authors of SSFT HD Remix, a software house that in its Californian office in Emeryville is specializing in this type of production, also working on titles such as Mortal Kombat 3 and Cstlevania: Symphony of the Night . The result, starting from the Dreamcast version, is good and, unlike the previous work, no rebalancing was necessary. The changes have been minimal to the single player mode - solo, now there will be no more points to obtain and then spend to earn certain characters, they are all immediately available - while a fairly well-made online multiplayer sector has been included, fluid during games even if not free from some bugs, especially within of the lobbies prior to the meeting. Graphically, support for 16:9 was guaranteed without however modifying the playability, with the hit boxes unchanged and the three filters applicable to the characters, so as to display them as the original or more defined, not penalizing in case of use. Great fidelity has therefore been maintained to the original, adding, without surprise, what is necessary to make the cost of fifteen euros appear balanced and the package in step with the times.", "date": "2009-08-07", "grade": "8.6"}
