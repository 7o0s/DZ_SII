Probably not, but Straka Studio did it for us, an independent Slovak team that, in its first ~important~ production, certainly wants to demonstrate that it has extraordinary intuitions. But is the unusualness of a content sufficient to make a videogame truly significant? Let's find out in the Loot River review. Inspiring explorations Loot River: the ~headquarters~ where our adventure begins, again and again Loot River isn't a game that relies so much on the story it wants to tell, but instead relies entirely on the atmosphere it intends to create. There is very little information provided to the player, so much so that it is essentially suggestions useful for creating that aura of mystery necessary to immerse the player in this gloomy and austere universe. The game takes place in the narrow alleys and intricate corridors of a city invaded by water, where the only way to move is through the floating platforms that make up the sporadic and ever-changing battlefield, on which countless clashes with formidable enemies take place. The player is therefore called to venture through the various environments of the urban space, so as to obtain knowledge (not only linked to lived experience, but also to a real game currency) and various types of rewards, from weapons to useful amulets to overcome the recurring game areas. Recurring, yes, because Loot River marries the roguelike philosophy, leading the player to start his journey over every time he falls in battle. Not only. The other peculiarity of Loot River is its procedural nature, which promises to change the playing field with each new attempt. From how it was presented, this feature seemed to be really relevant for the exploration of the environments, but we found with some disappointment that, in reality, they are large recurring patterns that are randomly joined together, leading to a new backbone of the levels, but which begin to become familiar after a few hours of play (a necessary condition, most likely, also due to the puzzle structure of mobile platforms). A fusion of mechanics Loot River: the platforms, the real protagonists of the game Loot River seems to be above all an action game, very technical, but we soon realize that the puzzle variant is an integral part of it, if not the real driving force of the scene. The mechanic of moving platforms that become little exploration puzzles works very well, but the ~revelation~ comes during the combat phase, when your wits are all about taking down the enemy. Much more than in other similar cases, you can effectively strategizing, isolating enemies, bypassing them, but also hitting them relentlessly without giving them a chance to counterattack in any way. Loot River: Taking advantage of platforms in creative ways is an integral part of the experience The interesting fact is that, initially, there is a tendency to have a ~classic~ approach to the game, only marginally using the possibilities offered by the movement system. This allows you to learn how to deal with enemies individually and understand their behavior, but it also takes up a lot of time, incredibly slowing down the pace of progress. However, from the moment you start using the environment to your advantage, the game seems to change, becoming not only extremely interesting, but also quite fun. At least until repetitiveness comes into play. Repetitiveness, between life and death Loot River: very slow progression greatly affects the perception of repetitiveness Being a roguelike, in Loot River it is good to expect to die (and a lot). The game gives you nothing. Indeed, the unpredictability of the positioning of the enemies makes everything even more precarious, transforming every corner into a potential point of no return. Obviously, once dead, everything we collected during the previous game disappears permanently, with no possibility of going to recover what was lost. Which is written in the actual soul of this type of video game, so nothing out of the ordinary. The problem occurs when the possibility of progression is provided to the player with a dropper: Loot River falls right into this category. Loot River: the equipment and stats, the two elements that ~reset~ every time you die Being able to actually wrap up anything other than exploring the first two stanzas over and over again is a process that brings via many hours of gameplay. Which pushes the player to slow down and get to know the environments and places (as it should be, at least when this procedure is implemented sparingly), as well as collect as much as possible and then buy objects at the ~headquarters~ (which will be made available immediately and then added to the rewards that can be obtained randomly from enemies or from chests scattered throughout the various levels). Loot River: often feels like dj-vu The effect of ~going in circles~ and never getting anything done becomes very strong after the initial excitement begins to wear off. Even by unlocking a large number of weapons, spells, equipment and modifiers (the latter the real elements of variety), your success or your defeat will always be guided by an old friend of these video games: luck. This is one of those unknowns that are either implemented very well, or only frustrate the player. In the case of Loot River, if you don't get the right item at the right time it is practically impossible to go far, as it is likely that a stroke of luck will advance very quickly from the first minutes of the game. Although it seems to want to reward the player due to its technique, the title rewards those who have not had enough luck with fights that are not difficult (at least once you have learned the movements of the enemies), but extremely long, exhausting and mostly repetitive. We've encountered more than one opponent characterized by monotonous, almost rhythmic fighting styles (including one of the main bosses of the game, who can be defeated by using the same ~trigger~ over and over again without ever seeing a change in the approach from the latter, resulting in insanely monotonous combat). This, at least, when the clashes flow smoothly, without unwanted ~hitches~. The critical issues of a changing world Loot River: in addition to the repetitiveness of some clashes, several blocking bugs often get in the way What has been said so far paints a mostly intriguing overview, characteristic of a type of game that you may like or not. So far we have left aside the real problems of Loot River, those that undermine the player experience in a negative way. The fact of having to start ~all over~ is already a prospect that intimidates the user, so imagine what it means to have to start the game again due to an inevitable error. Loot River is a game studded with technical problems. There are simple glitches of a visual nature, mostly harmless, but it also comes down to the likes of bugs that crash the game irreversibly. And, coincidentally, they come from one of the greatest unknowns of the game: the mobile platforms. Loot River: A technical error can undermine several hours of gameplay in seconds It has happened to us several times that our or other characters get stuck between the platforms, unable to move or receive attacks. When this happens to minor enemies, you put your soul at peace and proceed, but when it affects your alter ego or some boss, there is no doubt that you are practically faced with a ~game over~. Imagine starting over a very successful game that has been going on for over an hour because the current boss has gotten stuck somewhere and won't let you deal damage to him in any way anymore. These problems are just the kind of thing that they destroy the structural value of a game like Loot River. You pass luck, you pass the difficulty, you also pass the repetitiveness (if exploited properly), but the computational error is something that cannot proliferate to such an extent within a similar title. Audiovisual fascination Loot River: the audiovisual sector is undoubtedly the spearhead of the game The other side of the coin is represented by the audiovisual sector. If the technical dirt does not take long to appear, it is bizarre how in a short time the game is able to ~heal itself~, making the player forget the misadventure he has just experienced only by proposing the same visual and sound elements, in a sequence that should be stale , but which tastes more like an aphrodisiac. The encounter between pixel-art and realistic lighting, as we had already stated in our test (where you can also find a more focused study of the game system), is capable of creating a familiar visual universe (it doesn't seem rash to say that titles like Dead Cells and Blasphemous have influenced the team's creative process a lot), but still very peculiar and recognizable. However, the real highlight is the soundtrack, probably the most successful element of Loot River, main proponentof the atmosphere that underpins this game full of mystery, yes, but also full of shrewd tactical fury.", "date": "2022-05-03", "grade": "7.0"}
