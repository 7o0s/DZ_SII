{"name": "WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2009 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2009-recensione.html", "text": "WWE wrestling, needless to deny it, hasn't been doing well for a while: the rosters are only now emerging from a dark period, characterized by more or less serious injuries; and ratings have been declining for months, with bookers unable to come up with a story that will catalyze audiences' attention once again. In Italy, around thirty deputies have even presented a bill to ban minors from watching wrestling, with the aim of eliminating the show from television schedules. Who's going to explain to these gentlemen that Raw, Smackdown and ECW have only been airing on satellite for quite some time now? I don't know. But let's not digress: we are almost in the Christmas period and the new edition of Smackdown vs Raw is already available in stores, also in the Wii version. Last year fans who expected a more ~physical~ wrestling game were satisfied in many ways, but to the detriment of substance: on the Nintendo console, in fact, Smackdown vs Raw 2008 offered a brand new control system, but left a lot to be desired in terms of thickness and longevity. Let's see if THQ has learned from its mistakes... The presence of the rather long-lasting 'Road to Wrestlemania' mode is in itself a substantial improvement over what was offered by the 2008 edition. Road to WrestleMania The first impact with the game is decidedly good: apparently the developers realized the obvious limitations of the 2008 Wii edition, and they remedied it by first inserting the same ~story mode~ present in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions , or the ~Road to Wrestlemania~. In this mode we will have to choose our character from Triple H, CM Punk, John Cena, Chris Jericho, Undertaker or the couple formed by Batista and Rey Mysterio, then face the period that goes roughly from January to April, or from the Royal Rumble at Wrestlemania XXIV, passing through the pay-per-view No Way Out as well as for all the weekly shows of their own roster. Depending on the wrestler chosen, we will be faced with a completely different and rather interesting story from the point of view of wrestling fans, which develops match after match and is presented to us in an incredibly realistic way: the superstars (sorry, the ~entertainer~...) challenge each other, provoke each other, collide and then move on to the next opponent between dialogues and shots in perfect WWE style, even complete with a logo and copyright information at the end of the ~episode~. Each session opens with the initial theme song of the show and with the classic fireworks (much improved compared to the previous Smackdown vs Raw), then with a summary entrusted to the couples sitting at the commentary table (not updated, unfortunately: Jim Ross sits still next to Jerry ~The King~ Lawler, etc.), and then we move on to the show between backstage situations, run-ins, dialogues and meetings. The wrestlers lent themselves as usual for the speech, always excellent and abundant, and it's nice to be able to hear their voice from the Wii-mote speaker when it comes to a phone call or a recorded message on the answering machine. I could slam a tornado! The presence of the rather long-lasting ~Road to Wrestlemania~ mode is in itself a substantial improvement over what was offered by the 2008 edition of Smackdown vs Raw for Wii. Yet the news does not end here: we will be able to play single matches (drawing on the entire WWE boundless repertoire both in terms of special disputes and in terms of locations), choose a character to face an entire season in his roster or create a fighter from scratch. In this case, the possibilities are numerous and we will have the usual freedom in choosing the appearance, moves and so on, with the only limitation of not being able to create our ~finisher~ from scratch as is the case on PS3 and Xbox 360. The online multiplayer takes care of closing the picture of the modalities, finally available also for the Nintendo console and based on a system studied by THQ that seems to work quite well: it is possible to organize matches for up to four players, find a quick game or customize the search criteria, as well as (in this case too) use all the possible variants of the ~standard~ encounter between cages, chairs, ladders and so on. Now I'll come over there and suplex you Last year we were faced with a brand new control system, specifically designed for the pair of Wii-mote / Nunchuck controllers, and a gameplay that adapted to the situation as a result, unfortunately losing depth and challenge. Has anything changed this year? Well, let's say that we limited ourselves to smoothing out some problems, creunfortunately leaving the others or avoiding to remedy situations that are however quite serious. Once the gong has sounded, we will be able to strike our opponent by shaking the Wii-mote, with the direction of the Nunchuck's analog stick dictating the type of blow. By holding down the A or B buttons we will have the possibility of performing ~fast~ or elaborate grips respectively, also in this case influenced by the direction of the analog stick but in combination with the movement of the Wii-mote, for a total of at least eight different solutions for part. Once we've grabbed another wrestler, icons will appear on the screen to show us the possible moves from that starting point, so we'll have to move the controllers further to get the desired result. The energy is managed ~in toto~, therefore without damage to the various parts of the body, and under the health bar there is that of ~rage~, which fills up according to the hits scored or by inciting the public: when it is full , we will be able to press A and B at the same time and shake the Wii-mote to execute our character's finisher. Among the things that needed reviewing there is certainly the throwing of the opponent towards the ropes or towards the corners, which must be done with a shake of the Nunchuck while we press a direction on the analog stick (awkward and inaccurate solution), or the management of running (which takes place automatically, according to mysterious rules) or even the engagement of a single ~target~ when we find ourselves in a meeting with multiple contenders, which is truly problematic and badly managed. On the other hand, the ~surrounding~ movements have been significantly enhanced: when our wrestler arrives, to the sound of his own music, we can pilot his gestures to more or less warm up the audience and get more applause. Nice, isn't it? Technical realization From a technical point of view, Smackdown vs Raw is unfortunately one of those series that never completely renews itself, and this in particular if we find ourselves analyzing the Wii version, which has practically the same polygonal models used by THQ in the very old WWE Day of Reckoning for GameCube, with very little modification. As far as the rosters are concerned, there's nothing to complain about: the ~roses~ are updated to the last draft (therefore we find Batista on Raw, Triple H on Smackdown and so on) and the ~alignments~ are correct, apart from some ~turn~ that the developers may have learned about too late (see Chris Jericho). The animations are good in quality and quantity, but they too are affected a bit by the passing years, while the locations are usually reproduced with great detail. There are numerous people in the audience, the problem is that defining them ~polygonal models~ would be at least courageous, given the terrible realization: they are practically silhouettes with low-resolution textures, which all move in the same way. Perhaps a different solution could have been opted for, at least for the front rows, given that the show on offer is very unsatisfying. The sound is excellent as usual, with a large amount of speech (subtitled in Italian, with some blunders here and there) and all the original music of the various wrestlers (too bad that Chris Jericho's theme is the old one, which is inexplicable). Uploads are a little less intrusive than usual, and thankfully always come out reasonably short. The Nintendo DS version In its Nintendo DS version, Smackdown vs Raw surprised everyone last year. The developers, in fact, opted for a radical change compared to the other consoles: different graphics, different modes, different approach. The encounters were, in practice, a set of minigames based on the use of the touch screen and the action, while not extraordinary, certainly had the merit of bringing a breath of fresh air to the series. The wrestlers were not controlled directly, rather they moved according to the instructions that were ~drawn~ on the screen, with the strengths and weaknesses of a choice of this type. For the 2009 edition, it's time for experiments again: the previous structure has been set aside, we return to direct control of the character and the control system is revolutionized again, which does not depend on the standard buttons but on the touch of the stylus: a ~tap~ to hit the opponent (with the direction of the d-pad to determine the type of attack), a circle or a double circle to grab him and perform a move. Unfortunately, this does not work very well, the ~circles~ are not detected precisely and too often it is not clear which wrestler is prevailing over the other: the result is endless, tedious and frustrating encounters, in which perhaps one suffers without being able to defend oneself . Wrestling fans toothe most diehards will find themselves in great difficulty with this product, technically average for the Nintendo DS and which, moreover, has little-updated rosters. The ~career~ mode can offer enough lasting entertainment, but in the face of such a cumbersome and complicated game action one really wonders if it was not the case to opt for a normal control system. VOTE: 5 Comment This new edition of Smackdown vs Raw for Wii cuts ties with the past a bit, in the sense that last year we only witnessed a first contact between the historic THQ series and the Nintendo console, and the result was a title really too simplistic and limited. Now we finally have a proper ~story mode~, which alone pushes longevity substantially, flanked by equally significant and interesting secondary modes, above all an online multiplayer with great potential. In short, there is no doubt that WWE fans will have bread for their teeth, thanks also to the three updated rosters of Raw, Smackdown and ECW. The control system is valid and the action is fun, but some maneuvers are still entrusted to an awkward or cumbersome combination and, most importantly, the difficulty in general is too, too low: even passing to the ~legend~ level, we will succeed to land all the moves with ease and with very little opposition, finishing matches in minutes. A far better edition than last year's, therefore, but there is still a lot of work to do: luckily, the road taken seems to be the right one. Pros A large number of modes, including online Excellent sound Immediate and fun... Cons ...but too much, too easy Sometimes cumbersome and imprecise control system The graphics feel the weight of the years", "date": "2008-11-26", "grade": null}
