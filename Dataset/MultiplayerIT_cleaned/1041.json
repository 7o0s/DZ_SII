{"name": "Street Racing Syndacate", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/street-racing-syndacate.html", "text": "Women and Engines SRS combines various elements of popular games, such as ~Need for Speed Underground~ or ~Burnout~, managing at the same time to deteriorate the fun, also thanks to a not too demanding level of challenge, and some flaws at the level of the opposing AI, which in fact, in clashes it often penalizes the human player. If we combine the lack of attractiveness of the game with the frustration caused by the loading times during the modification/purchase of the car, the desire to turn the console back on diminishes after a few sessions, to the point that the most tantalizing thing in the entire game will be the videos ( intended as video footage) of the ballets of the various girls you meet in the game. Once you get into the spirit of the game, you may be wondering how these blocks are unlocked. The videos will be accessible from the warehouse, once you have completed the tests that the girls will submit to you. These tests are called ~Respect Challenges~, and after the first ones which will be available immediately, they must be unlocked by winning the ~Crew Meets~, or rather three-race tournaments, where you can also accept bets from your opponents. By winning these contests, you will also unlock more videos of the girl who is currently accompanying you in the contests. The goal of these races is not only to finish in first position, but also to earn the highest number of points, which will then allow you to gradually access all the tournaments. Respect points are earned by doing a little show with your car during the race, a bit like in Burnout, but less fun. So down with skids, jumps, slipstreams, and dodges at the last moment. If you carry out several maneuvers at the same time you will multiply your score (up to a maximum of three times), but be careful if in the meantime you acquire a penalty, such as losing your position, or scraping a wall, you will lose all the points in progress at the moment. An undoubtedly interesting structure, wasted by all the carelessness surrounding the game. The races, just like the showroom, the garage and the various girls, are scattered around the map and, fortunately, they are also easily accessible via the menu, a sign that even the developers have found it boring to wander the city streets, escaping the hateful machines of police ready to jump on you as soon as you try to exceed the limits. After a while you'll realize that it's better to pay the fine than to crash the car trying to evade the police, and after a while you'll realize that it's better to skip straight to the tournaments. joy and pain! Earlier we talked about frustrating wait times. Clarify, we add that it is not only about their duration, but their frequency, so much so that during the machine modification phase, you will have to wait more than a second each time you scroll through an item in the menu, and only to update a few lines of text . You find yourself moving through this list of changes by fumbling through the various icons, and with the uncertainty of being reading the corresponding text. Pretty nerve-wracking, even considering the GameCube's data access speed. The thing that gets loaded instantly not even on purpose are the videos of the girls. However, passing over this first obstacle we will discover a good number of modifications to be made to our car, even of a cosmetic nature. In short, buy a car among the various official manufacturers such as ~Nissan~, Toyota~, ~Mazda~ and ~Subaru~, and bring out all the ~tamarraggine~ that is in you. Technically the game is rather underwhelming. Starting from the poorly compressed opening movie, and with an annoying crackling audio, up to the actual game, the game denotes a general sloppiness. The city lacks detail and textures are average. Not deviating in the slightest from the dictates of the genre, the city design recalls what has already been seen in ~Need for Speed Underground~, complete with wet asphalt, sparkling lights and shiny surfaces. The soundtrack, with hip-hop and similar themes, respects the spirit of the game, and is generally appreciated precisely because it is in line with the game's claims, while not deviating too much from the sufficiency. The driving model can be saved: the differences between car and car are recognized, and the changes made to them due to the modifications. Unfortunately, the results of collisions with cars and walls are often penalizing and irritating for the player, who sometimes sees himself deprived of all the advantage due to mistakes that are not his own, or marginal. Overall, however, the work done on the physics and on the driving model deserves encouragement, and stands out above all the rest. A little more speed would have helped. The level of challenge ovvimente increases with the continuation of the races, even if overall it is quite accessible. Once you've found the car with the answer you're looking for, making your way through the various tournaments will take a couple of tries. If you want to make them Comment Street Racing Syndacate is a difficult game to recommend, even in view of the competition, albeit more limited on GameCube, still present with several popular titles. The videos of the girls (also dressed!) are not enough to compensate for the deficiencies of the title, which in any case lacks stimuli and bite. Although the number of various tournaments is rather limited, it is plausible that most players abandon it even before completing them. The only positive thing is the physics of the cars, and it is also the reason, together with the work done on the front of the customization of the car, for which SRS reaches the sufficiency. On paper it could have been a good product, but from the final result it seems that even the programmers didn't believe too much in the project. Pros: Functional physics Presence of official licenses, and customizable parts Cons: Technically poor No bite Occupies a space on the DVD box Glitter, modified cars, beautiful women, and clandestine races on city streets. What more can you ask from a game? Well a little bit of bite, maybe. When Namco engages in a production it is legitimate to create some expectations, and when the result is what you have in your hands, the disappointment is even stronger. Dull in technique and design, this SRS immediately proves to be unconvincing and does nothing to change our minds for the rest of the game.", "date": "2005-02-11", "grade": null}
