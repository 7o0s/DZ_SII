{"name": "Spiderwick: le Cronache", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/spiderwick-le-cronache.html", "text": "For those unfamiliar with the film or the book it is based on, here is a very brief description of the plot: Spiderwick Chronicles tells the story of the Grace family (made up of a mother and three children) who, after moving into an old in the countryside, she finds herself catapulted into a magical world. The game opens with the arrival of the protagonists in their new home, within which the young Jared soon finds a book capable of revealing the secrets of all the fairy creatures normally invisible to the human eye: from here, it will be up to him and the brothers Mallory and Simon to prevent an evil ogre and his armies from getting their hands on the precious tome. Spiderwick: the Chronicles presents itself as a two-dimensional adventure of a classic nature (vaguely similar to Zelda, to be clear), framed from a bird's eye view which highlights its good graphic qualities: the sprites are large and well defined, the animations are convincing and the scenarios are distinguished by a remarkable wealth of details and a good use of colors. Too bad that the strengths of Spiderwick: the Chronicles end here, considering how the actual game turns out to be really slow, devoid of bite and in some ways cumbersome. The user commands the character on the screen by moving it in eight directions and using the '5' key to interact or launch an attack with the equipped weapon: at any time it is possible to take control of one of the other Grace brothers, in order to exploit their unique abilities. Unfortunately, Spiderwick: the Chronicles is essentially reduced to a sterile wandering from one location to another, collecting objects, solving very simple puzzles and having a chat with the NPCs on duty. The situation worsens if we consider the very frequent loadings that continuously interrupt the already sleepy game action: the passage from one setting to another in fact involves a loading screen of about five seconds, a really annoying thing if we consider how much the adventure requires in terms of travel. Even inventory management makes you turn up your nose: the backpack available to the three brothers is limited to four slots, after which it is necessary to make room for other objects by moving the less useful ones inside various chests. A really irritating operation, and completely useless since it adds absolutely no value to the gameplay. Spiderwick: the Chronicles also has the problem of not making the objectives clear to the user, who often finds himself wandering around the house and surroundings without knowing what to do, in a plethora of endless loading screens.
