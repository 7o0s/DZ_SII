Docomodake DS - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/boing-docomodake-ds-recensione.html", "text": "What can be the expectations for a title whose protagonist is the mascot of a telephone group? Docomo is in fact one of the largest Japanese telephone companies and the likeable mushroom protagonist of the title is its symbolic character. A bit as if a well-known house were offering us a title starring Megan Gale! contains mechanics that a little more refined would have led to a small masterpiece How cute is this mushroom! Just to keep you reading, know that this title is not bad at all and indeed contains some mechanics that a little more refined would have led to a small masterpiece. Boing! In fact, Docomodake recalls in several points a small jewel of the DS toy library, that Mario vs Donkey Kong 2: The March of the MiniMarios that has so fascinated those who have tried it. Also in this case the protagonist is followed by a group of small beings, represented here by mushrooms, which can be used to proceed along the levels of a puzzle platform. Also in this title the little ~Minis~ can die, but they are not actually to be saved all, but rather an indispensable tool to carry out the mission. In fact, they can be used to create stairs, fill empty blocks, throw at enemies, use as counterweights, form special shapes in certain grids, press switches and much more. In fact, all levels have a very specific arrival point, not at all easy to reach, and are littered with collection boxes, some containing an additional ~mini~, others simply multiple points, and a more or less large number of coins. At the end of the level, the now canonical score is attributed based on the bonuses collected and the time in which we completed everything. The traps that are found can be quite varied, using tricks related to the weight, size and strength of the Docomodake. In fact, as ~mini~ characters are extracted from the protagonist, he gradually loses the characteristics shown. A small mushroom can slip into narrow passages, but it is difficult to move large blocks or to lower platforms to levels low enough to be used. But the trick isn't bad either... All this is managed with a fairly functional control system, even if sometimes a little imprecise. In fact, you use the directional cross, or the keys if you are left-handed, to move the character. Pressing up performs a jump, it's very ~old school~, while pressing down allows you to ~dig~ certain blocks. All the other operations are carried out, as is now the practice on the DS, via the stylus. In fact, by touching the protagonist, he emits a ~mini~ which can then be grasped at will and used for all the purposes listed above. By ticking twice on the ~mini~ it turns into a throwing ball, while placing it on a partner creates a ladder, which may not even be completely vertical. Everything works very well until you find yourself in narrow spaces, which is also very frequent in the game, in which being able to make the respective mushrooms perform the desired actions is sometimes difficult and requires several attempts. Pleasantly complicating the control system is the fact that the ~minis~ are not indestructible even when they are at the mercy of the stylus. This involves the presence of amusing and nice paths to be tackled with the utmost precision by perhaps more than one mushroom. The structure of the levels is still based on the more classic puzzle game scheme, while not missing a good dose of platforms and various jumps. It often happens that you have to start over after running into the classic dead end especially in the more advanced levels. Docomodake has to go through all these difficulties, distributed in five worlds, divided into eight sections each, to find all the members of his family, but to tell the truth, history and narration are the least and decidedly most marginal aspect of the game . ... too bad it always remains a game. Summing up Boing! Docomodake surprisingly presents itself as a solid and fun title as well as full of fresh and innovative ideas. All levels are pleasant and well built even if there are some ups and downs or small qualitative drops. Structurally it is therefore very well cared for and always presents very intuitive and almost never frustrating puzzles. This also in light of the fact that the title is aimed at a fairly transversal target, it seems dedicated to the little ones, but precision and analytical skills requiredthey definitely wink at a more adult audience who, if they like the genre, will also appreciate this title. Graphically it is nice and pleasant while never going to squeeze too much the technical sector of the DS. Always very clear and pleasant, the levels never make the mistake of confusing or hiding important elements for continuing. On the other hand, the seabed is so poor that you can hardly see it. The animations are nice even if very limited in number and variety, for example when you jump Docomodake's hat rotates, but otherwise it just does its job without going too far. The music, on the other hand, is few, monotonous and after a while they really make you want to turn down the audio volume. In short, if we are at very good levels in terms of gameplay and game structure, the technical sector brings the game back to mediocrity by not going further than I have to do it and therefore I do it. Among other things, there is also the need for a few more elements that break up the monotony and the action. It wouldn't have been a bad idea to insert some bonus levels or some end-of-level monsters or some secondary mode to vary the action. All these small defects do not allow this title to go beyond the average and become something more than a game, however pleasantly well done, dedicated to the mascot of a telephone house. Comment As already mentioned, it is a bit of a shame not to have found a greater commitment and refinement in this title. Many ideas are really pleasant if not brilliant, but a certain lack of linearity and that continuous aftertaste of ~I'm still a B title, what more can you expect from me?~ they can only give hope for something more for an (improbable?) sequel that tries in some way to move up the category. However, it deserves a try if titles such as the aforementioned Mario VS Donkey Kong have been appreciated in the past. B Flat technical realization", "date": "2008-08-11", "grade": null}
