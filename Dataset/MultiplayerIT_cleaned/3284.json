Find out with us in the Journey to the Savage Planet review. What can I say? These teams, mainly made up of developers fleeing the electronic entertainment giants, have been coming up with some pretty interesting stuff lately, demonstrating a clear difference with the typical independent and often fledgling companies you see around. Today we are going to tell you about Typhoon Studios, a group made up of former EA, Ubisoft and Warner Bros Interactive, but a few months ago it was the turn of Blu Manchu and their hilarious Void Bastards. Just like the latter, Journey to the Savage Planet is a project developed in record time, around simple but extremely effective concepts. These are games designed and built by professionals who know how to assemble a product around a small workforce, with pre-established budgets on which it is good not to risk too much This color makes you laugh Journey to the Savage Planet, consequently, is the perfect example of this highly calibrated modus operandi: a fun and sufficiently deep game, creative within the limits of a rather canonical structure, beautiful to see and listen to thanks to a well-drawn style, instead who paid so much per kilo thanks to a bottomless wallet. Practically an excellent starting point for a group that has chosen to dance alone, finally far from the ganglia of the big players who give so much, in terms of resources, and take away as much, in creative freedom. As a game, Journey of The Savage Planet is pretty much all about exploring a strange, floating alien world; the rest of the mix is entrusted in order of importance to combat and the resolution of various environmental puzzles. The glue of the whole work is instead an effective and at times irreverent comedy, capable of giving this first work by Typhoon Studios a rather rare character these days. The very colorful Journey to the Savage Planet offers a rich variety of puffer birds (very salty inside, the game hastens to tell us) as many decidedly bizarre creatures, like a sort of two-headed star turkey so vile as to scream at the top of its voice in fear every time he notices our attempt to approach. The incipit of the game is no less bizarre: we were paid to explore a new world by the fourth best company specialized in space travel (note that we don't know if there is a fifth and sixth...), and by way of of major budget cuts we have not been provided with any type of equipment which can however be built on site thanks to a futuristic 3D printer. The real luxury is an automatic cloning system that will allow us to come back to life (99% the same as before, the instructions say) whenever something bad happens to us (such as being eaten by some fantasy beast or when we fall into the void or into lava ). I want to go back home! Our mission is made up of several objectives: for the company that sent us here the most important is to understand if the planet we landed on is habitable or has resources to exploit, while for us it will be to put the spaceship back in order to have at least a chance to return safely home to planet Earth. Completely optional, but absolutely recommended, to study the different creatures and animals present, even by carrying out various experiments such as making puffer birds explode while they are in the air, or by taking samples from subjects who are still alive, therefore approaching us at our own risk. During the adventure we will also soon discover the presence of another civilization on which the company we work for will want to know more at all costs. All optional objectives are of course optional but it is only by completing the various secondary missions that we will be able to unlock all the available equipment improvements. Even if once obtained, these will have to be built with the appropriate printer, which will require some raw materials to complete the process. Each creature will release carbon and other substances necessary for the purpose, thus allowing us to create modifications to our weapon capable, for example, of shooting blobs that will amplify our jumps, giving the ordinance backpack the ability of a small jetpack or, even better, providing a comfortable and versatile grappling hook to reach less accessible areas. Journey to the Savage Planet is a continuous introduction of new mechanics that will function as access keys for the different areas into which its four biomes are divided, at the qto which are added the secondary accessories that are usually used to access the numerous secret areas scattered around the map, as well as to help us in the fights. Sparkle with me The first biome is quite peaceful, like a sort of Eden, but already in the middle of the second area, populated by several types of creatures at the same time, things will get decidedly dangerous at intervals. In fact, it is one thing to shoot two shots at a flying octopus, another to have to face five and more powerful than the previous ones, while another dozen beasts charge us from behind, running, flying and shooting at us. If the situation were to take a turn for the worse, you can always count on a surprise friend: Journey to the Savage Planet in fact can be played totally alone or in the company of a friend (the progression of his character is linked to the host's game), for a totally unexpected coop in a title of reduced magnitude like this. But what in the first instance is clearly a special game, full of inventions and irony, after the first explosive hours tends to flatten out in its own particular linearity, partially throwing that peculiar and amiable character to the wind. Journey to the Savage Planet doesn't suddenly become a bad game, it is clearly and from every point of view a solid and fun product for its entire duration, only that it irrevocably loses some of its charm and its invaluable initial freshness. And this slide towards normality damages it particularly, after all we are talking about an extremely compact game which, aiming at the end head down, can be completed in a dozen hours (there is a trophy/achievement even for those who manage to get to the end credits in less than four), longevity that can be easily filled with interesting content. However, Journey to the Savage Planet remains a small but effective pearl capable, before convincing its potential audience, of attracting the attention of a giant like Google which, given the quality of this first work, immediately bought Typhoon Studios to make them an integral part of the future of Stadia.", "date": "2020-01-27", "grade": "7.7"}
