It is a real money machine that in the premier class, or rather the Sprint Cup Series, for the thirty-six races that make up the entire season provides a prize fund that exceeds four million dollars in each Grand Prix. It is therefore no surprise that the NASCAR license is one of the most desired and expensive in the videogame sector, and although the official productions signed by Eutechnyx in recent years have not been exactly exciting, some contents have successfully merged into high-level productions such as Forza Motorsport and Gran Turismo, through the introduction of tracks, cars and collaborations with the best drivers in the category. Surprisingly, thanks to the discovery of a cryptic advertising flyer, in recent weeks the development of a NASCAR-themed expansion dedicated to the excellent Forza Motorsport 6 has been leaked, landed on the Xbox One Marketplace on May 17 at the (substantial) cost of 20 EUR. We tested it thoroughly and here is our report. Licensed cars, a circuit and a dedicated World Tour for the NASCAR expansion of Forza Motorsport 6 At a high price Between the Season Pass, the VIP package, additional DLCs, various editions and real expansions, such as the one dedicated to the Porsche brand launched a few months ago, there is no doubt that in order to enjoy the complete Forza Motorsport 6 experience it is necessary to shell out a rather high amount , to which NASCAR enthusiasts cannot avoid adding this additional expense. Before going into the analysis of the package, remembering that it includes twenty-four cars (actually three models in different skins), a brand new track in various configurations, a dedicated ten-hour campaign and new multiplayer events and exhibitions, it is necessary to spend some line about code update for all Forza Motorsport 6 players. As NASCAR lovers well know, the trails on the very fast American ovals (but not only) play a particularly important role in the racing economy, and in this regard the Turn 10 have revised the HUD of the title by inserting very useful arrows that indicate with accuracy the distance and position of following vehicles. Also introduced to help players who prefer internal views, this feature (which can be deactivated in any case) is very useful for preventing accidents, especially in heavy traffic conditions and in tighter head-to-head matches. Another new feature translated from the Stock Car races is the optional rolling start, the very famous ~Rolling Start~ with the starting grid in motion, which helps to further limit the possibility of collisions in the very early stages of the race, traditionally the most chaotic above all playing online. For those who love Endurance races, a new option linked to tire and fuel consumption has been introduced, as well as a brand new race mode called ~Quick Stop~. It can also be set for short races, it provides for the need for one or more mandatory transits to the pits, which, depending on the circuit, require about 35/40 seconds of time between entry, exit and intervention by the mechanics. Mandatory Pit Stops, indicated by a special entry on the HUD, introduce an additional level of strategy into the competition and can significantly influence the progress of the races. As for the NASCAR expansion, as specified, it introduces an unprecedented World Tour, accessible from a new label located at the top right of the main menu. The campaign is divided into five ~expeditions~, namely Nascar Icons Tour, Passport to the World, A Lap of America, The Road to Le Mans and The Road to the Ring, which, proposed in about ten series, take the player around the world to challenge not only other Stock Cars, but also cars from other categories; from racing GTs such as the Lamborghini Gallardo and Ferrari 458 Italia to the WEC prototypes, passing through the Indycars, the Australian V8 Superstars sisters and Touring Cars of various classes. This somewhat forced potpourri, considering that in certain tracks and against specific vehicles the ~rustic~ Stock Car with stars and stripes in reality would not have a chance, nonetheless offers stimulating and fun races. Sometimes a pinch of dise emergesbalance precisely due to the presence of such different cars, and with the same level of difficulty the challenges with other NASCARs are generally easier, while against other models there are always a couple of cars that manage to detach the player and require a greater commitment to be reached and overcome. The races of the new World Tour last about ten minutes and are accompanied by ten new performances, such as challenges against the famous The Stig and a two hundred lap Endurance on the new Homestead-Miami Speedway track, there are also leagues and events dedicated multiplayers. Before getting on the track, it is sometimes possible to listen to catchphrases and more or less useful advice from the three drivers hired by Microsoft as consultants for this expansion, namely Jimmie Johnson, Kyle Busch and Chase Elliott, whose cars, together with those of other NASCAR champions, are sometimes offered to the player for certain challenges. Not just ovals Although twenty-four new cars are indicated in the promotional material of the expansion, in reality, as already specified, these are only three distinct models divided into numerous aesthetic variants, namely Chevrolet Chevy, Ford Fusion and Toyota Camry, moreover, due to the very strict regulations of NASCAR on chassis, proportions and power, these cars are practically identical to each other in terms of performance and behavior on the track. In short, the player will be prompted to choose his favorite based on affinity with the manufacturer or perhaps on the peculiar design, which ranges from gaudy to ~tamarro~ depending on the numerous sponsors who cover almost every square centimeter of the bodywork. From a purely technical point of view, the cars are all R-Class(833) with rear-wheel drive and four-speed manual gearbox, with a score of 7.7 in speed, 6.9 in handling, 8.7 in acceleration and 6. 8 under braking. The 541 Kw (over 700 horsepower) of the powerful V8 and the 611 Nm of maximum torque push the NASCARs to a maximum speed of 320/330 kilometers per hour, while the slightly understeering behavior is influenced by the 1,500 kilograms of weight and the balancing. Although in some cases the opposite is intended to be perceived, these are technologically simple vehicles designed above all to bite the asphalt of the ovals, while being fun to drive on other types of tracks. Among the various innovations introduced in the 2016 cars are the digital displays integrated into the steering wheels, and the models are all perfectly made and appreciable in ForzaVista mode. For the more established teams, a brief description in Italian dedicated to the victories and prestige accumulated within the NASCAR circuit is also available in the showroom. In addition to the licensed racing cars, the new Forza Motorsport 6 expansion offers the Homestead-Miami Speedway circuit, a track located a few steps from the beautiful Florida coast and which has traditionally become the closing one for the Sprint Cup Series season. It was built in 1993 to revive the area economically after the devastating Hurricane Andrew caused the worst damage in US history, causing more than $26 billion in damages. The Homestead-Miami is available in six variants with or without rain, namely Speedway (the classic oval), Circuito Stradale, Stradale Alternativo, Speedway Alternativo, Mini Circuito and Super Mini, ranging from 1.55 kilometers of the shortest to 3 67 of the Alternativo Stradale, enclosed within the oval of which it embraces some stretches. From an aesthetic point of view, this is not a particularly scenic and evocative route, however it is fun and technical to tackle, especially with the Stock Cars found here in their natural habitat.", "date": "2016-05-25", "grade": "7.8"}
