This is the adventure to live in Marvel Super Heroes 3D: Granmaster's Challenge for Nintendo Wii, where our task is to face the pitfalls of Grandmaster who forces the five superheroes into a cage with a terrible ruse, manipulating them at will in his intergalactic base. The title offers the interesting 3D novelty that develops through the use of superhero masks with red and blue lenses contained within the package. Essentially Marvel Super Heroes 3D: Granmaster's Challenge is intended for a teenage or even pre-teen audience, given its features such as masks with the faces of the characters and the storyline that involves action and twists to the detriment of the Grandmaster and his Thugs. The multiplayer mode gives us the possibility to play up to a maximum of four players at the same time with the possibility of playing the favorite hero with two phases of the game: one board game style and the other action game. Fight! It goes through two phases: board game and action. In the first, a real board game, you move inside Grandmaster's intergalactic base with the aim of defeating him and his followers with strategies worthy of heroes! The action game phase gives the possibility to interpret the favorite hero through a first person view, exploiting and managing his powers. In fact, by choosing one of the five heroes you can test their singular peculiarities: the protective shield of Captain America, Spiderman's web, Thor who evokes the power of thunder giving vent to the use of his famous hammer, the strength of Iron Man or In short, Wolverine's blades will be like living inside comics, only that here we are the protagonists! The enemies are led as the Marvel saga really tells, by Grandmaster and under him his evil companions in misfortune: Dr Doom, Lizard Man, Juggernaut and Red Skull forced by the great boss to fight against the superheroes. Full of twists and turns, the title rediscovers the old Marvel glories by connecting the historical legends with the virtual reality of today, 3D and thus allows to increase the imagination of the little ones often stopped at action games only but not d interaction, as in this case. The possibility of being able to play Marvel Super Heroes 3D: Granmaster's Challenge even as a ~grown up~ certainly cannot be ruled out! The game obviously gives greater enthusiasm to those who experience super heroes or believe them to be ~real~ as in the case of children, but it does not prevent those who have experienced them perhaps in their childhood from having fun. In fact, the fight between several users at the same time is very exciting because it manages to involve more and the game does not risk falling into monotony. The 3D function is compatible with all televisions and through the use of the supplied superhero masks, players can feel the thrill of battle thanks to the very realistic first person view. The title may have the purpose of uniting the family in a moment of leisure, it is precisely the theme that unites the present and the future, thus establishing a strong link between past and present eras, through these timeless superheroes. In fact, it could be an excellent solution to spend some time ~with men~, in short, those typical father-son moments, which would finally make even the grown-ups fly with their imagination!", "date": "2011-01-27", "grade": null}
