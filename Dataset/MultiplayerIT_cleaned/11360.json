{"name": "Simon the Sorcerer 4: Chaos Happens - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/simon-the-sorcerer-4-chaos-happens-recensione.html", "text": "The saga of the adventures of the magician Simon began in 1993 by Adventure Soft (which will also produce the second and third chapters). Those were dark and stormy years in which the graphic adventure genre was at its peak and several titles worthy of being played were released every month. Above all, the demented trend saw the release of some products still imprinted in the hearts and minds of those who had the good fortune to run them on their computers (in 1991 the first Monkey Island was released, while in 1992 its sequel was released just to mention two masterpieces that are always nice to remember). The magician Simon managed to carve out a place in the hearts of fans, although not particularly original or innovative, neither in terms of gameplay nor in terms of graphics. In 1995 Simon the Sorcerer 2 was released, another beautiful graphic adventure that slavishly resumed its predecessor... and it is since then that the gaming community has been waiting for the third chapter. Why are you shaking your arms? Did we write something wrong? Did we get the dates wrong? Is there a three-headed monkey behind us? Ahem, sorry, that's right. We were forgetting something. Actually this Chaos Happens is the fourth chapter of the saga. The third we had voluntarily removed. We address it as ~ugly~, using a euphemism, so as not to offend anyone. Someone has come to define it as one of the signs of the imminent apocalypse (who knows if it comes before the trumpets or the seals). In fact, in bearish memory it is difficult to remember a series that has been so badly updated as it happened for that of our Simon, made to turn towards action in an inopportune and poorly realized way. But let's not continue the invective and get to the fourth episode, which is the exclusive subject of this review (for further information on the series, consult the box below). The other chapters of the saga Simon The Sorcerer (1993) The first chapter of the saga clones Lucas' graphic adventures perfectly. Simon, an unlucky and a little clumsy boy, must save the sorceress Calypso from the evil Sordid. To do so he will have to face a series of zany adventures, of course. Simon The Sorcerer II: The Lion, the Wizard and the Wardrobe (1995) Another SCUMM-style adventure, with slightly improved graphics compared to the previous episode. Simon ends up in his wardrobe and is transported back to a fantasy world full of zany creatures (like him, after all). Will he be able to return home by defeating the evil Sordid again? Simon The Sorcerer's Puzzle Pack (1998) It is not a real chapter of the saga, but we include it for completeness. It is a collection of puzzle games set in the world of Simon.Simon The Sorcerer 3D (2002) The chapter of the turning point towards 3D and, surely, the worst of the series, above all because of the bad action sections. Seven years after the events of the second episode, Simon will once again have to stop the evil Sordid who wants to dominate the world by selling a highly harmful drink. Forget it. Back to the near past Fortunately, the developers (Silver Style) have chosen to revive the series by bringing it back to the canons, perhaps more antiquated, but certainly more appropriate to the genre it belongs to. Let's say fortunately because, despite the not exactly exciting result, which can be guessed from the vote, the qualitative step forward has been significant compared to the third chapter. Simon The Sorcerer 4: Chaos Happens is a traditional graphic adventure that does not seek to upset the world and is based on the stylistic features of the genre, trying to arouse the interest of that niche of players still eager to understand how to combine a flannel shirt with a cake in an attempt to open a door (it's not a puzzle in the game, don't worry). In this sense we cannot say we are disappointed. The puzzles are not insurmountable and are well thought out. They don't shine for their complexity, also by virtue of the few locations that make up the magical world (which can be reached quickly using a handy map), but they are well intertwined and offer more than a few hours of intelligent entertainment... provided that, those few times when you get stuck , do not decide to use the help system included in the game. the puzzles are not insurmountable and are well thought out Back to the near past The idea of helping the player not to stop so as not to frustrate him is becoming an obsession. Basically Simon the Sorcerer 4: Chaos Happens is sold with the built-in solution: the internal hint system, working on three levels, helps never get stuck. When you don't know exactly what to do, just ask for help (by consulting the diary) to receive general advice first. If you are still stranded you can get un more precise indication asking for help for the second time. At the third request comes the masterpiece, or the solution of the riddle... but aren't we the players? Having said that, it should be specified that the use or not of the suggestions is totally optional (God forbid). Hormonal problems? So far we have neglected to talk about the more properly narrative side because it deserves a separate discussion. Unfortunately it is really mediocre. Starting from the characterization of the characters, all rather anonymous, Chaos Happens does not offer interesting narrative cues. The story begins with Simon being hit by his TV remote control, thrown at him by his brother while they are arguing on his sofa. The blow is very strong and causes him a vision with which he is summoned back to the magical world to put an end to yet another catastrophic threat. Obviously there will be bizarre characters to talk to and ridiculous situations to overcome. the first big criticism that can be made of the game is that it's not funny Hormonal problems? The first big criticism that can be leveled at the game is that it's not funny, a marked defect for a demented game. Simon has no verve. Perhaps it was because he was characterized as the typical eighteen-year-old American situation comedy, perhaps because the authors of the game have changed, but one cannot feel the slightest sympathy for him. The same goes for the secondary characters who only managed to make us smile in very rare moments. Compared to the recent Jack Keane, full of jokes and hilarious situations, Simon comes out with broken bones. This wasn't enough, on more than one occasion he even gets to feel annoyance for the character. For example, meta-videogame jokes abound with direct references to the world of graphic adventures in general. Nothing wrong, one might think, especially for lovers of quotationism. Unfortunately, when similar jokes are repeated throughout the game, it is very easy for them to get bored and alienate the user. For the rest, as already mentioned, it is a very classic adventure with well-designed, albeit not very inspired, 2D scenarios and well-modeled and animated characters. The contextual interface is very simple and similar to what has already been seen in dozens of other adventures. Nothing fancy, but definitely functional. Comment Simon the Sorcerer 4: Chaos Happens has the good fortune to be much better than its predecessor, but the bad luck to have come out in a time rich enough for graphic adventures. Unfortunately the presence of much more convincing titles (the aforementioned Jack Keane, but also Overclocked or Culpa Innata) relegate it to the background making it a second choice. But, if you are a fan of the genre and, above all, if you are a fan of the first two episodes, keep it in mind anyway.
