{"name": "Mortal Kombat Armageddon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mortal-kombat-armageddon.html", "text": "The old man who advances? The combat system does not differ much from the previous episodes seen on Ps2, even if new situations have been implemented to improve playability a little and give more depth to the title. For example, compared to the recent past, a more effective parry and counter-move system has been introduced (in this sense, Armageddon technically tends to reward the gamer who is skilled in waiting, in waiting for the right moment to hit the open opponent), and a greater emphasis on dogfights, where it is now possible to launch an opponent high and fill him with kicks and punches before he touches the ground again, thanks also to the new system of rapid execution of moves, which are now implemented with the pressure of only four keys. Even the fatalities, or the ultra-violent final moves that have always distinguished Mortal Kombat from any other fighting game, have been reworked by the programmers, and now it will be possible to chain them in series to literally quarter your defeated opponents piece by piece. Too bad that overall the gameplay improves a little and always remains quite woody. As for the modes present in MK:A, there are many, and in addition to the always interesting, classic ones such as ~Arcade~ and ~Versus~, we point out here the one called ~Konquest~, a sort of Adventure Mode obviously set in the world of Mortal Kombat, a ~quest~ where, at the helm of Taven, it will be possible to face multiple opponents at a time, like in a scrolling fighting game, and collect credits that can then be used in the ~Kripta~ option, an area of the game where it is possible to buy new moves and Items for wrestlers. Another method to collect credits to use in the Krypt is the unusual, for a fighting game, Kombat Motori, a driving game inspired by Mario Kart, where the characters from Armageddon race aboard absurd vehicles. However, don't expect who knows what: it's just a diversion from the usual fights, nothing more. Finally, it is worth noting the online mode, with which you can challenge yourself with friends from all over the world in exciting one-on-one battles with no holds barred. Sixty characters, a good editor to add others, an online mode and pure violence: Midway seems intent on making the many MK fans scattered all over the globe happy, and to push the longevity of the fighting game genre to heights never reached before. passed by no other title. Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, while not bringing any real innovation to the category, but rather an upgrade to its series, and not thrilling too much the avid fans of ~beat em up~ used to those jewels called Tekken 5 and Soul Calibur 2, appears however the right episode, the best, to worthily conclude a saga which, willy-nilly, has left an indelible mark on the history of video games, on a par, albeit with all the necessary distinctions, of the aforementioned Namco or Street Fighter titles. However, we recommend it mainly to fans of the series. Pros: Very long lasting. Lots of characters to play around with. Options for 16:9 and Progressive Scan. Cons: Graphically improved. Gameplay not up to par with the competition. Level design not always inspired. Even before Tekken or Soul Calibur, immediately after Street Fighter, the world of ~1Vs1~ fighting games was dominated by the presence of a title that, in the early 90s, was very popular in arcades, and later, consoles, all over the world , thanks to innovative graphics for the time, and an ~ironic, macabre~ playability. We are talking about Mortal Kombat, and the last ~born~ of the series, Armageddon, the final chapter, it seems (but is it true?) of one of the longest-running video game sagas ever. For the occasion, Midway seems willing to offer us an almost complete title from every point of view, even if, let's face it, little in terms of gameplay. In Armageddon we will find for the first time all the characters of the entire saga, from those present in the first arcade cabinets to those of the ~recent~ Ps2 versions. Kano, Johnny Cage, Raiden, Scorpion, everyone, absolutely everyone, will be available to stage fights to the death with us, in the true sense of the word. Each character is equipped with personal moves and weapons, interchangeable during meetings at will. However, if we wanted to customize them even more or add new ones, there is an option called ~Create a Fighter~, which we will go into later. With it we will be able to create a new fighter practically from scratch, characterizing him to our liking physically, in the clothing and in the actions he will be able to perform, including the fighting style.", "date": "2006-11-16", "grade": null}
