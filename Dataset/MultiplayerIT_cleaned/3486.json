{"name": "The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-recensione.html", "text": "The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening was released in 1993 on Game Boy, and is unanimously considered one of the best games of that platform; what you are reading the review of is its remake, developed by Nintendo in collaboration with Grezzo, who had also dealt with the remakes, for Nintendo 3DS, of Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask. It's crazy to think how in twenty-six years we have gone from playing - on the move - with the Game Boy, with its characteristic greenish screen, to Nintendo Switch Lite: an extraordinary leap, far greater than the one, however large, that home consoles made in the same period . The contents of Link's Awakening have been faithfully transplanted from a very limited console to one running Breath of the Wild: seen this way it is a huge demonstration of esteem for the game design of the game. An estimate, as we will see shortly, that is anything but misplaced. In this process, one element must be kept in mind, which also explains the graphic style adopted: Link's Awakening, compared to the other The Legend of Zelda, is small, compact and dense. But it is because, given the potential of the Game Boy, it could not have been otherwise. This is so due to the technological limitations of the time. However, no child who started Link's Awakening in 1993 saw it that way: it was probably the largest, and certainly most complex, world to be found on that pocket console. Nintendo and Grezzo had two options: to create a remake that remained faithful to the soul of the game, in Resident Evil 2 style, or to perpetuate its contents, consequently altering the aesthetic identity of the work. If Link's Awakening on Game Boy was huge, with an overhead shot to simulate three dimensions, on Switch it's an adventure with a miniature world, using the same shot, but this time with the opposite goal: to present two-dimensional gameplay. Style and frame rate From this point of view, the graphic style adopted, in addition to being delightful, is also sensible. The need was to give the work a new visual identity: the developers became aware of the compactness of the adventure, and rightly thought that a diorama would have been the ideal solution. A diorama composed and inhabited by plasticine toys: the effect is truly wonderful, and it is the most striking element once the adventure has begun. You really want to insert your fingers inside the screen, lift Link by the cap, carry him out of there and place him on the coffee table: such is the delight, such is the consistency of the characters. Even the water, almost always shining - there are no atmospheric changes in the game - seems to have just been poured, from a tube of cyan-coloured tempera, very diluted. It's hard not to fall in love with this new Koholint, and its wacky inhabitants. Yeah, weird: Link's Awakening, inspired by the atmosphere of Twin Peaks, is the closest the series has gone to Alice in Wonderland. Perhaps even more than Majora's Mask, which had decidedly more macabre hues: they are here too, but to a lesser extent. The main characteristic of the inhabitants, and of some enemies, is precisely the bizarreness (it is no coincidence that it is full of crossovers from Maria, and not only). The graphic style adopted in this remake is so graceful that there was a doubt it could limit this feature which, we repeat, is absolutely central to Tezuka's work: in fact, something has been lost, but much less than we feared. The atypical nature of certain creatures, although translated into a different graphic context, has remained intact. Especially some macabre traits have been lost, but they weren't so relevant as to represent a defect. Although the leap between the animated introduction (which looks like an 80s anime) and the graphic style of the game is very large, the events themselves, which we will not reveal here, justify it: the transition could have been more elegant, but also in this case, fidelity to the original introduction was privileged. Link's Awakening's visual problems certainly don't reside here, but elsewhere; we refer, unfortunately, to the framerate. During the exploration of the overworld the drops are frequent, well below 30 FPS, and very annoying: never to the point of making the action difficult, but still annoying. Moreover, they are even more marked by playing in portability, the ideal condition to appreciate Link's Awakening: it is possible that they will be removed with an update, perhaps even on day one, but we must stick to what we saw in our copy. And our copy slows down dramatically. The game and the story The adventure begins when Link, after a violent shipwreck, is found and taken care of by Marin, a beautiful inhabitant of Koholint, the island where he isset the whole story. Although our hero speaks little, and you never know exactly what he says, the feeling is that he has a crush on Marin, who is also a gifted singer. Gossip details aside, as soon as he wakes up Link has to recover his sword, lost on the seashore: once found, he is joined by an owl, his mentor in this adventure in a foreign land, which begins to show him the path to free the island from monsters. The question does not end with this task, but we prefer not to reveal further: the ~battle for Koholint~ has simple but profound nuances, and it is good that, if you have not already played the original, you discover them for yourself. It surprised us how perfect this game is still. On Game Boy it was divided into quadrants, which have been removed here (apart from in dungeons), yet everything is remarkably composed. Replaying it we realized how Link's Awakening is, together with A Link to the Past, the most balanced The Legend of Zelda: if you are passionate about a single chapter of the series, it is impossible that you do not like this. It balances all the souls of the saga in a surprisingly harmonious way: there is action, there are puzzles and also a lot of exploration. We are not saying that it is better or worse than other episodes, but simply that it is more careful in mixing the various souls of the series. And, we repeat, it is incredible that the game design, carried over without modifications (except for a few minimal tweaks) directly from 1993, still proves to be so perfect. The first dungeons and the quests that lead to them seem pretty basic; but from then on things get complicated, the secondary events intertwine, and prove necessary to continue. It's not linear like Skyward Sword, but neither is it free like Breath of the Wild: it's a good middle ground between the two, with the main events that must be performed in order, with the secondary ones much less constrained (time-wise), and especially with certain missions, apparently irrelevant, which prove to be essential to continue. And so many places accessible at the ~wrong time~, which is a key feature of The Legend of Zelda, too long kept out of the three-dimensional series. Controls and Dungeons The control system is also very similar to the original, decidedly softer, but identical in essence: the movement of the character itself is limited to eight directions. A decision that does not create problems, after all it is not a title that requires pressure or millimeter movements, however it is strange to turn the character in circles (with the control stick) and see him rotate in a segmented way; even more strange is the fact that the d-pad is not supported, which on the normal Switch is not very comfortable, but on Lite it could represent a serious shortcoming. Not having tested the game on the new laptop, let's postpone the matter for a few days. In any case, the greater availability of buttons makes the adventure much more fluid than in the past: now you can carry two other items in addition to your sword and shield. Some that once required equipping (such as bracelets) have wisely been automated. Apart from the inventory changes, we have noticed small tweaks to make the experience smoother: the thrown vases can destroy other vases still on the ground, thus speeding up their breaking. Some doors exhibit an amphora, so as to indicate the method of opening, overcoming an illogicality of the original. Certain enemies, in particular a mini-boss, have been weakened but, at the same time, made more difficult to hit: a twist in line with Aonuma's The Legend of Zelda, which however will not be noticed by many. In essence, the cerebral part of certain fights has been emphasized, in spite of the purely action one. Even some puzzles - few - have been changed: we were particularly annoyed by one involving horses (chess), because it seemed rather senseless to us. It was already weird in the original, but maybe that's the only time this remake, instead of making the elements more readable, complicated them. Certain situations also seem a bit anachronistic. We are referring to the geometric intersections of certain dungeons, but above all to the objects that block the exploration of the overworld: it is clear that they are arbitrary constraints, not even questioned at the time, but now they are actually strange. Like the plants that prevent Link from jumping a cliff, because they push him back towards it, or the poisonous sprouts, less tall than the character, which manage to prevent him from passing. However, they are details. As we said before, the way Link's Awakening has aged is almost miraculous. Longevity and Dungeon Maker Many feared that the gameor it would prove too short. It's actually quite short: knowing already what to do, and not wanting to complete it one hundred percent, you can finish it in a few hours. However, it would not be right to evaluate the question from this perspective; Link's Awakening is a complex game, with some very difficult puzzles, and it's not impossible to get stuck for a long time. As an indication, we could tell you that it lasts between ten and fifteen hours, but a lot depends on your ability. It is very strange, and anachronistic, to find yourself unable to continue: in Link's Awakening, especially inside the dungeons, it may happen that you have to solve a puzzle to leave a room. You can stay closed there for minutes, if not hours, without having alternative routes. In general, the typical maze-object structure of the maze-boss hasn't aged badly; it is no longer original, but still works great. If you are tired, it is only because you have played too many The Legend of Zelda, and because many subsequent episodes have recycled it: it is certainly not the fault of Link's Awakening, which was the second episode of the series to adopt it. Longevity is therefore acceptable even by today's standards, but it would have been much better, as well as the work as a whole, if the advertised Chamber Dungeon mode had been ... a mode. Instead it is ~only~ a complex mini-game, accessible from the hut of Danpei (the undertaker), in which labyrinths are built, and subsequently crossed. Labyrinths made up of various rooms addressed in different dungeons, which must be completed, following Danpei's instructions, respecting certain constraints: taking into account the introduction of several floors, the number of chests in relation to closed doors, the presence of a boss and of an entrance. You can use amiibo to unlock new room tiles to add, but the benefits are limited, except for the one (published together with the game) which introduces Dark Link: an enemy absent from the main adventure, which pursues the hero along the path, and generates an interesting variable. In general, Danpei's is a fun mini-game, but that's all. And it's well done enough for us to imagine the untapped potential. Like unedited rooms or rooms that can be compiled in detail; mazes to be tackled in multiplayer and to be shared online. The future of the ~two-dimensional~ branch of The Legend of Zelda could be just that.", "date": "2019-09-19", "grade": "8.8"}
