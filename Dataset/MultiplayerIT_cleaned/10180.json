The beauty is that the title developed at the time by Time Warp Production was really well made, it had some success even though its publication was then blocked (~continued~ then on pirate channels) and could boast, among other things, the music by Chris Hlsbeck, a well-known composer who came to prominence for the Turrican soundtrack but who began to make himself known in the videogame scene with Great Giana Sisters. Giana Giana Giana... After a conversion for DS and mobile phone we come again to Giana Sisters for iPhone, passed into the hands of Bad Monkee but who fully manages to ideally continue that line traced by the original title, proposing an updated version in all respects, not least the graphic one. All iPhone and iPod Touch users therefore have at their disposal, at a cost of 3.99 euros, a platform that offers 80 unpublished levels divided into 8 worlds, in which the main protagonist finds herself having to go through various settings according to the classic ~jump and run~ between platforms on a horizontal plane, watching out for enemies and collecting diamonds to increase your lives and score, not to mention the coveted red diamonds. Game progression is definitely the best balanced thing; in fact, we start from short and simple levels to face, with enemies that can be eliminated by jumping on them in full Nintendo style, or after acquiring the power-up that transforms the protagonist into her red-haired sister, capable of throwing fireballs to get the best of opponents. As the adventure continues, the complexity of the platform sections increases, which also extend vertically especially to reach the diamonds, and the resistance of the enemies, with some that can only be avoided to move forward. As an additional gem there is the possibility, once the game is finished, to also face the 32 levels of the original title, certainly a heartbreak for the most nostalgic. For the control system, the developer has opted for two alternatives: the classic one, where movement, jumping and shooting are activated using special icons on the screen, and the touch one, where instead it is possible to use entire areas of the iPhone display for purpose above. The first works much better, the response to the commands is good even if there are still some problems, mostly intrinsic to the touch screen, in the most agitated moments or when it is necessary to make decisive changes of direction, as in the case of the inevitable end-of-the-world bosses, clear Bowserian inspiration. In general, the controls never add elements of frustration, but forget the millimeter precision of the greatest platformers of the genre, who have made their fortune. To further entice the player to collect red diamonds and face all the levels, we think about the support for Open Feint, a social network that provides its own Gamertag and specifically 29 objectives, a friends list and the inevitable online rankings. We have left the graphic sector for last, which in Giana Sisters is truly a jewel for cleanliness and style, suitable for today's standards and pleasant to look at thanks to the stroke and use of colors. The various levels are made with different layers of parallax, i.e. background elements that move differently to simulate depth and to remind us of their use in the golden age of two-dimensional productions. The animations and fluidity are also excellent, but strangely in some levels the lateral scrolling (movement) becomes more uncertain and not as fluid as one would expect, undermining the final result. The music is a mixture of new and old, based on Hlsbeck's originals and accompanied by sound effects rearranged from those of the time, which work very well in the context. The tested version is 1.0.1 Apple Store Links", "date": "2010-02-23", "grade": "9.0"}
