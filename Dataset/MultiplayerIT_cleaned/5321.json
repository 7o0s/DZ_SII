Space Marshals 2 fits perfectly into this category, arriving after a first chapter that we had promoted with full marks on these pages: the Pixelbite developers decided not to distort a formula that had proven to work very well, instead going to work on the amount of content and some minor gameplay improvements. Space Marshals 2 plays it safe by offering again an adventure of the highest quality Marshal who wins doesn't change The first hallmark of Space Marshals 2 compared to the prequel concerns the abandonment of the episodic formula to embrace the more traditional system of the complete package: the game therefore immediately offers all the expected material, which consists of 20 action-packed levels, with an even more marked stealth nuance than the first chapter. This while keeping the basic structure unchanged, with the usual isometric view that frames the space sheriff Burton engaged in making a clean sweep of the hordes of villains that appear in front of him. It must be said that the motivations of the protagonist and his supporting actors are not particularly explored by a plot left in an absolute second-rate position, which serves as a mere pretext to justify the clashes that take place within the various scenarios. Not bad, because Space Marshals 2 manages to stand very well on its legs even without the contribution of a solid narrative sector: in fact, the game fully confirms the qualities shown by the prequel, from the very precise control system to the balanced level of challenge up to to arrive at a gameplay capable of alternating an action register with a stealth with equal competence. In fact, you can decide to face the adventure with guns blazing, and in this case Space Marshals 2 behaves in a way not unlike a twin stick shooter, but the best of the Pixelbite product comes out if you adopt a more reasoned and silent approach. As in the prequel, by tapping on the screen Burton crouches, allowing him to find shelter behind obstacles and to approach enemies without being heard: this time, however, the protagonist sheriff can also count on a melee attack to combine with this practice, which allows him to knock down an opponent without firing his weapons and thus attract the attention of the surrounding outlaws. A function that further increases the range of moves available to the user, completed as usual by the possibility of launching grenades or devices with the most disparate effects. Then there is the tasty section dedicated to customizing your alter-ego: before each mission you can equip Burton with weapons, armor, hats and tools unlocked up to that moment during the campaign, obtaining related changes to the character's statistics. The lion's share is once again carried out by pistols, rifles and beautiful companions, which can boast over 70 specimens to be recovered during the adventure and which also prove to be very well differentiated from each other. While not proposing anything really new, therefore, Space Marshals 2 is as fun as and more than its predecessor, also thanks to some filings which taken individually may seem insignificant but which put together contribute to making the experience even more enjoyable: we are talking above all about a level design that has been able to remove the most frustrating and cumbersome aspects of the prequel and a player performance evaluation system that takes the time required to complete a mission out of the equation, leaving more freedom for exploration and experimentation. Consistent with the rest of the production, even the technical sector of Space Marshals 2 avoids major upheavals, proposing already known music and sound effects and a new very accurate graphics especially as regards the amount of detail and the use of colors. We can only complain about one thing: just like the first chapter, Space Marshals 2 also causes rapid battery consumption and -in the specific case of our test on an iPhone 6S- also a considerable overheating of the device, especially after rather prolonged sessions .", "date": "2016-09-01", "grade": "9.0"}
