{"name": "The Sims: Vacation", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sims-vacation.html", "text": "A real family The user-videogames relationship has also been significantly improved and the more curious will in fact be able to read the nice and detailed advertising description of the objects that they will make their characters buy or ask the village chief for very useful information both of a general nature and on what is happening in that precise moment. In fact, if you see a member of the village staff scolding a child, you can't understand much from the strange language that our Sims use in their conversation, but you can ask the village chief why he scolded and he will be ready to explain the reasons. As often happens to us, you will make the Sims relentlessly play the various attractions, spending capital in order to accumulate points to receive the desired puppet ... this fever will assail you too: remember that after a while even the Sims can run out of money if they exaggerate too much! This is one of the many educational messages that the Sims game sends us (just think of the social worker who, in the basic version of The Sims, takes the baby away if it is not properly cared for): there are rules and they must be respected ! Precisely for this reason in Vacation, if our characters have behaved as model guests, they will receive a nice prize from the village chief. Everything is taken care of down to the smallest detail and not just in the graphics! In fact, when you book a hotel room you really receive a key, while when you accumulate points by playing the various attractions, a receipt will appear in your inventory. The conclusions If you don't leave your hotel room in the morning, no one will let you go: the price of the extra day (or half day) you will spend will automatically be charged to your account. Furthermore, based on the place where they are, the Sims can wear specific clothes, already divided into categories, and have at their disposal wardrobes and dressing rooms to change ... in short, you will not see a Sim running around the edge of the pool with your ski if the latter had left the house dressed like this! They are small things, but they are greatly appreciated by the critical eye of an enthusiast. The new music deserves a special note: they are very pleasant and catchy you will easily find yourself whistling them in the shower! This great video game, one of the best-selling in the world, is aiming more and more to get closer to real life and this is most likely one of the reasons for its success, in addition to the fact that countless add-ons can be downloaded every day that make the game practically infiniteso be careful not to be too tyrant with your creatures, or one day or another they could come off the screen and take your place! ;) What more can I say? Vacation offers so many things and it is certainly not an expansion that you can miss from your collection, trust me: you will not regret it! Is the expansion final? Fans of this game have always wanted an expansion that allowed them to follow the characters away from home and this has partially come true previously with Hot Date. It must be said, however, that with Vacation our sims will be able to go not only to the city centre, but also to places that are far different from the normal city life that bores them so much: with this new expansion, the sims will finally be able to go on vacation! As always, your imagination will be the protagonist and you will have the green light (and therefore unlimited money) to create and customize the lots in which your sims will go on vacation: will you be good administrators of the Holiday Island? The various environments of this island of fun (mountain, camping and sea) are truly realistic and this is due to the numerous and innovative furniture, attractions and decorations that Vacation offers by responding to the needs of the players. I was able to see how the new animations of the characters mirror the movements of human beings in an impressive way: just see how agility they play volleyball. There has also been a marked improvement in the various options for Sims to interact with each other. In fact, the fact that there was only one type of kiss, hug, greeting or other social interaction in the game was not considered fully acceptable: with the previous expansion this had been partially overcome, but with Vacation the new interactions have increased and extended even to the children. If before adults were bored spending time with their children, now they have more topics to share and can choose to play wrestling or Chinese vise.", "date": "2002-12-11", "grade": null}
