Obviously this can only happen with ~minor~ products and that perhaps this type of management can instill some doubts about the actual quality, but with our review of The Stretchers for Nintendo Switch we will try to reassure you: in this case, in fact, the surprise is not only welcome, but also completely advisable if you are interested in an experience preferably to be shared with another player, strictly in local cooperative on the same sofa, like in the good old days. Better in company than alone The developer behind The Stretchers is Tarsier Studios, a Swedish team with a lot of experience alongside Sony gained by contributing to the development of the Little Big Planet series and the conversion of Teraway on PS4. However, the main projects so far have been the beautiful Statik for PSVR and the excellent Little Nightmares, which evidently gave credit to Tarsier for giving life to a game produced directly by Nintendo itself. The Stretchers, as mentioned above, clearly has the primary objective of offering a ~family~ game specifically aimed at being enjoyed in doubles. Although in fact the single player is also possible, it is extremely evident a fallback alternative, which does not allow you to fully appreciate the gameplay as it was designed. The protagonists are two stretcher bearers. Yes exactly, the ones that carry the sick and wounded. In this case the two heroes, who can be either male or female, find themselves having to face a health emergency: most of the inhabitants of the country town where they work have in fact been struck by a mysterious form of stunning, which requires a specific treatment using a futuristic medical machine, the Cur-o-matic. The objective is therefore to collect all the patients present in a given area on the stretcher, preferably together and at the same time, load them onto the ambulance and take them back to the operational base to allow them to receive the necessary treatment. Of course, not everything is as easy as it seems. The various areas in which the individual missions take place are in fact full of dangers, setbacks and traps, and it is up to the players to be able to manage everything in the best possible way to bring home the best result. In the economy of the gameplay, a fundamental role is played by physics: The Stretchers in fact exploits this aspect to propose a fresh and fun formula, with the ragdoll who manages the behavior of the inert bodies of the unfortunate poor and with the objects to interact with that they respond in a realistic way to the solicitations of the stretcher-bearers. Open world and ambulances The gameplay basically consists of two distinct phases: the one on board the ambulance and the one during the actual missions. In the first you have to drive the vehicle within the playing area, essentially a small open world, to reach well-marked points on the map in which to tackle the various tasks. Only one of the two controls the ambulance, but the companion can take an active part by managing, for example, the turbo, which can be unlocked soon. Humor, nonsense, the over the top are the basis of the experience of The Stretchers, as well as a fundamental component that shines through at all times: the rides on the litter ignore any rule of the road inviting you to tear down walls, fences, trees and whatnot, take ramps at full speed making jumps to make K.I.T.T. of Supercars, obviously all at the tablet. The main missions then take place in compact and delimited areas in which the various stunned people to help are found: the areas themselves are a small condensation of game design with puzzles and elements to discover and interact with, often with the need to activate in pairs. It's just a pity that the locations are reused several times, and despite the fact that in any case there are variations in the development of the individual missions, a bit of repetitiveness ends up showing through. This is however mitigated by the secondary missions, which require you to abandon the use of the litter to face different tasks, but always in coordination between the two protagonists: perhaps sawing some trees, planting flowers or carrying explosive devices, just to understand each other. In short, The Stretchers is undoubtedly a successful product, with some imperfections that however do not compromise the final result too much: for example, the detection of interaction with objects is not always perfect, especially if there are several close to each other and some slowdowns and frame drops, albeit with a complexpolygonal sity far from impressive, they denote an improvement that can be improved. However, the graphic style is good, colorful and captivating; from our point of view only the character design could have been more accurate, but it is a fairly subjective factor. The overall duration of the adventure, around 6-7 hours, seems appropriate compared to the sale price of 19.99.", "date": "2019-11-19", "grade": "8.0"}
