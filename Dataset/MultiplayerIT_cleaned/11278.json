{"name": "Ferrari Challenge: Trofeo Pirelli - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ferrari-challenge-trofeo-pirelli-recensione.html", "text": "On the back of the horse The Ferrari Challenge system, developed with the help of professional driver Bruno Senna, is an excellent hybrid between arcade and simulation. On a general level and on equal terms, i.e. with the steering wheel and all the aids disabled, the System 3 game seems slightly less simulative than Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, especially in some car behaviors (analysing the individual aspects, however, there are also some much more realistic implementations on Ferrari Challenge, for example collisions). To give a practical example, in Ferrari Challenge it's easier to tame a car that starts in countersteer, and you feel a bit magically ~helped~ by the computer. However, this does not affect the driving model, which remains fairly challenging and satisfying, undoubtedly much more than any purely arcade title. There is damage to the cars, and they are also done in a rather skilful way, but unfortunately these remain in the cosmetic area only, not affecting performance in any way. The artificial intelligence is far from perfect, which despite making a good impression compared to the low shot of Gran Turismo, discovers the side on several occasions, with drivers who are not very aggressive and too ~on the tracks~. One of the most annoying flaws of Ferrari Challenge is given by bugs of various magnitudes that affect different aspects of the game, from graphics to replays. Just replays, for example, sometimes go crazy after a few seconds of playback, crashing the car. There are also problems of interpenetration of polygons during the tightest overtaking, with the bodies that ~mix~ slightly when too close and the guardrails that on certain occasions become ~transparent~. The car customization system is very rich, inspired by that of Forza Motorsport 2 but even more complete and profound. By getting used to the tools and having some time to devote to creating new motifs, car bodies can be covered with real works of art. Naturally it is highly recommended, if not practically obligatory, to own a steering wheel. In our test we used a Logitech Driving Force Pro, which despite having a few years behind it remains the best in its price range. The behavior of the steering wheel, the force feedback, and the response of the car were very convincing. Graphics and sound Graphically Ferrari Challenge: Trofeo Pirelli has very little to envy even to more famous rivals. The polygonal reconstruction of the various cars, including all the cockpits, is undoubtedly more than good, as is the choice of color palette and lighting. We certainly don't have the fantastic real-time shadows of Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, but we certainly can't complain. The tracks and trackside environments are not up to the cars, and are slightly sparse and not very detailed. Comment Ferrari Challenge is a pretty solid game, with a very interesting driving model, perhaps among the best arcade/simulation hybrids seen so far. Its main flaw, as already repeated several times in the body of the review, is unfortunately something independent of its System 3 developers, and is called Gran Turismo 5 Prologue. However, anyone who wants to have a valid alternative from a simulation point of view, or wants to combine the Polyphony title with another game of its kind, should hold Ferrari Challenge in very strong consideration. Pros Quite interesting hybrid driving model Demanding at the right point for enthusiasts but also accessible to newbies Cons It has too fierce competition Too many bugs of various kinds", "date": "2008-07-29", "grade": null}
