At first glance, the new title from the Swedish developer is reminiscent of card games like Hearthstone or Gwent, but it's an illusion: SteamWorld Quest is mostly inspired by lesser-known RPGs like Slay the Spire or the very old Baten Kaitos. In our review, we'll explain how this little gem works and why you should definitely play it if you own a Switch and like turn-based combat or the wacky SteamWorld universe. A story of courage and bolts Set in the remote past of SteamWorld Dig, SteamWorld Quest tells us the misadventures of a strictly mechanical trio of friends who find themselves facing a mission that could decide the fate of the world. Let's say that the protagonist Armilly even went looking for it a bit: she is a real nerd who dreams of joining the Guild of the strongest warriors in the kingdom, even if no one queues up because of her humble origins. To support it there are always the rational sorceress Copernica and the massive and naive Galleo. While counting on a fairly stereotypical cast, the Image & Form guys manage to tell us a genuine and not at all obvious story that speaks of courage, altruism and personal growth: they do it through sparkling and lively dialogues, imbued with that subtle but intelligent humor that distinguishes the SteamWorld series since the first release. The plot unfolds through skits and dialogues completely in Italian that interrupt the exploration of the various locations in an organic way, without being too heavy or frequent. The structure of SteamWorld Quest is extremely linear: even if it is possible to replay the already completed chapters to earn more experience points or find all the hidden chests, the structure remains essentially the same act after act, even when the other characters are recruited to the party that make up the diverse cast of protagonists. It is in fact possible to change the character we control and who represents the band during explorations, but this does not affect the gameplay in any way: at most we can launch an attack, the same for all five heroes, which guarantees us a small advantage to the start of the fighting. The areas are therefore divided into rooms with one or more exits leading to other rooms, sometimes so well hidden that it will be necessary to start the acts over to find them all. Fortunately, SteamWorld Quest guarantees the possibility of skipping narrative interludes and accelerating the speed of animations during fights, in case you want to ~grind~ money or experience points. Not that it's necessary, mind you: playing on the default difficulty level, we never felt the need to find every chest, level up before a boss, or scrape together extra cash. The latter is actually bestowed with a dropper, even if there is a card capable of stealing from enemies, and we often found ourselves broke in front of a copious amount of overpriced weapons, accessories or cards. However, the Image & Form title is so well balanced, from this point of view, that you really don't need to try too hard to complete it in fifteen hours or so, unless you play on the highest difficulty level that , in fact, it gives a lot of trouble especially to the bosses. And even in this case, it is possible to change the difficulty level at any time or abuse the save statues that restore the health of our heroes and regenerate enemies in the area. Card fights As we said, SteamWorld Quest uses a card system during fights, but it's actually very different from titles like Hearthstone. The basic mechanics are extremely simple: the player deploys up to three characters and each of them has access to a sort of personal deck, made up of up to eight cards which essentially determine the skills they will have access to during the fight. This means that the player faces each battle with a total deck of twenty-four cards, only that he can keep a maximum of six in his hand per turn, after having drawn them randomly. It is possible to change at least two of them, but in general you have to make do with what you have in hand. The problem is that the cards essentially fall into two categories: one generates steam, indicated by the gears on the upper sideking of the screen, and the other category, however, consumes it. It goes without saying that the cards that consume steam are the most powerful or useful ones, therefore it becomes essential to navigate with a bit of strategy between the generation and consumption of steam, always keeping in mind that a maximum of three cards can be used in turn. If the cards of the same character are played, then the latter will be entitled to a fourth special card, determined by the weapon he is holding and which does not consume or generate steam. Some cards also reward mixed actions and, if played after those of another specific character, inflict damage or additional conditions. There are no packets or other random factors that intervene in the construction of the decks: the cards are found in the chests, they are bought - and strengthened - from the seller who appears in each act, they are obtained automatically at the end of some contextual narrative interludes. SteamWorld Quest floods us with cards right from the start, but it does so gradually and without ever overwhelming us: thanks to the fact that each character can bring a maximum of eight into battle, managing the individual decks remains easy and intuitive for the duration of the adventure. Despite this, the Image & Form title succeeds in the difficult task of guaranteeing an enormous variety of situations, synergies and strategies regardless of the characters deployed. If it is true that some of them respect some predetermined archetypes - Galleo, for example, is mainly a healer, while Copernica is an attack mage - it is equally true that some cards can significantly change their role in battle, and thus compose decks that transform Galleo into a real tank, for example, or orient Tarah and Thayne (who are actually a single character) more towards the magical attack than the physical one and vice versa. The possibilities are countless and this makes every fight unpredictable, but never frustrating. Indeed, the player is driven to develop new combinations and strategies to defeat enemies and bosses, constantly changing not only the formation of the heroes, but also their own decks. In this sense, it is a pity that SteamWorld Quest does not offer the same variety in terms of bestiary as well. You fight, and a lot, but often against the same enemies, distinguished by different colors and new cards in their arsenal. Despite this sensitive repetitiveness, which makes prolonged sessions a bit tiring (also due to a not exactly memorable soundtrack) SteamWorld Quest is a colorful fresco that recalls the illustrations of fairy tales: the character design is inspired and original, the curated scenarios, fluid animations, and playing in portable mode you miss absolutely no detail. From a certain point of view, SteamWorld Quest is a title particularly suited to the hit and run experience that only a handheld can grant, but played on the TV screen it still remains a little gem.", "date": "2019-04-29", "grade": "8.5"}
