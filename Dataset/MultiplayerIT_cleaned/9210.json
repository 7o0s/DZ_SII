The protagonist of the game is Henry Blake, a former British naval commander, eager for revenge against the one who betrayed him and even killed his girlfriend. A terrible crime, second only to that perpetrated by Gameloft in releasing such a crude and buggy product... Blade your neighbor BackStab immediately starts off on the wrong foot, showing off a boring narration from the very first lines, devoid of bite and delegated to a tragicomic dubbing in English in its being involuntarily caricatured. The lackluster cutscenes created with the game's graphics engine still prove to be suitable for at least one purpose, namely that of mercilessly highlighting all the numerous graphic imperfections of the Gameloft title. Which, contrary to the vast majority of the transalpine software house's productions, puts on the plate a disarming technical, as well as artistic, paucity: the characters are angular and their animations jerky and unnatural, while the scenarios are poor in details and the special effects seem almost the result of an amateur job. Not to mention the infinity of bugs that can be found: interpenetrations and clipping are the order of the day, but it is not uncommon to see real pearls such as characters floating in the void or literally appearing out of nowhere. Things aren't much better as far as the actual game is concerned, starting from a control system that oscillates between the imprecise and the cumbersome: the classic virtual analog stick is used to move the protagonist, with the keys placed on the right side and the camera that must be managed via a swipe of the finger anywhere on the screen. On the iPad the situation is more manageable, but on the iPhone we often find ourselves inadvertently pressing a key in an attempt to move a shot that doesn't want to know how to resume the action as God intended. Furthermore, in an attempt to emulate Assassin's Creed, Gameloft has equipped the game with a mechanism similar to Ezio Auditore's acrobatic race, with the character who should therefore automatically perform the jumps: the conditional however is a must, given that the good Henry often drops on deaf ears for no apparent reason. The combat system presents a situation, if possible, even worse: in addition to being reduced to a mere button smashing of the attack key, BackStab's white weapon duels are an anthology of bugs and a couple of animations that are repeated throughout 'infinite, elements that make them a tiresome practice to do rather than a moment of fun. Under such a thick blanket of defects, it becomes almost difficult to discern a play structure that had excellent potential on paper: the adventure unfolds inspired by free roaming titles, with the user free to explore the settings by completing missions and sub -quest, talking to NPCs and collecting various treasures and bonuses. Too bad that the programmers seem to have done everything to dissuade the player from going forward: the main story, already insipid in itself, becomes absurd and illogical as the events progress, and the sub-plots are the most out of place can imagine. In short, for the moment BackStab is a good idea implemented in a completely inadequate way: the hope is that the French software house has the good heart to release an update that fixes the many (too many) production defects of a title which, for the moment, unfortunately it is not worth the money it costs.
