Inverted magnetic fields, suspensions from the ground due to special ultra-powerful motors, absolute domination of gravity: these are the conditions that make the races more and more interesting, although devoid of any realism. In fact, thanks to the undoubted fame achieved by Wipeout, no one is surprised anymore to see similar futuristic vehicles driven in a videogame context; however, today, and we will never get tired of being disappointed, the technical link that makes these vehicles reproducible in reality, in defiance of the numerous tire industries, is missing. Here Repulze joins, albeit with some novelties, the large group of titles inspired by the masterpiece Studio Liverpool, in a certainly less obvious way than the recent Flashout 3D but with some certainly unmistakable references. But never a whole game? In the analysis of Repulze, we will start from the end for once: the game belongs in fact to that odious category of titles released ~in installments~. In these cases, as is known, in a completely meaningless way, a ~piece~ of the game is released by the developers with the first purchase and then, calmly and with the right time, the remaining parts through subsequent planned upgrades. The problem, however, is that often these secondary additions are in reality nothing more than fundamental pieces of the game, very important modalities that greatly lengthen its longevity and in any case the general variety. Their absence, in the analysis phase, is felt all right and the promise of future updates also takes on the taste of mockery on certain occasions. Returning to the title in question, in fact with the initial download you will only purchase a Time Trial mode. Well done, well implemented with online, but still only one game mode. In practice, for the perfectionists of the best weather, the choice could not have been more apt, thanks to the absence of competitive races with several ships on track. Together with the other ships, you will no longer be able to use power ups and weapons (having no targets), outside of a turbo, whose collection method seemed a bit bizarre to us. In essence, red and green portals are scattered along each track, some paired, others placed in very specific positions but without an apparent criterion. Licking or passing through the appropriately colored portal (indicated by the triangles at the top) three times will build up a boost charge. The obligation to go through the portals is certainly the biggest novelty that differentiates Repulze from Wipeout for example. However, we fail to understand the meaning of this choice. Let's try to venture two hypotheses, the first linked to maintaining more correct trajectories on which the portals are located, or in a negative sense, forcing the player to exit the right part of the track to try to touch them. In both cases, the result is a dull, useless feature that could have been replaced by other, certainly more fun, modes. For the rest, the actual gameplay of Repulze will certainly not surprise: anti-gravity ships (with a level design that is not beautiful but at least original), articulated tracks (again, as in Flashout 3D, no sharp or too tight curves , but there are numerous ~loops~), very precise controls both with the accelerometers and with the digital arrows, thanks also to the recent small update. Worth noting is the automatic restart of the last 5 seconds in the event of too violent frontals. Always according to tradition, to unlock other ships and other tracks you will have to proceed by winning the awards of each race, marked with 3 stars, which can vary from the minimum time to beat to the number of hits received, etc. Finally, the work done from a technical point of view was very good, thanks to the very well-defined ships but above all to great fluidity at all speeds.", "date": "2013-01-15", "grade": "7.6"}
