That man is Barry Steakfries.~ This is the incipit of Monster Dash, an arcade game with many platform facets in which we control a character who runs faster and faster and who, using various weapons, must free his way from monsters of all kinds. The typical elements of the so-called ~ultra arcade~ are all there: the ~dry~ game, the terribly intuitive control system and the impossibility of continuing after game over; after all, our goal is to cover as much road as possible, assisted by an ~odometer~ that allows us to compare our results with friends via OpenFeint. The new title from Halfbrick Studios therefore distances itself from the albeit discreet Fruit Ninja, introducing some interesting variations on the theme to the ~survival~ type structure to which we are now well accustomed. Firstly, Barry's movement increases in speed as we travel meters, but with each kilometer it ~resets~ as a flash of light hits the character and transfers him to a different scenario. At that point the acceleration starts again, gradually transforming the ride into a real challenge based on reflexes, especially after the fifth kilometre. Duckula Castle... As we said earlier, every thousand meters traveled the heroic Barry is transported to another scenario. At the moment there are four: the mountains of Transylvania, with Dracula's castle in the background, in which hordes of vampires face each other; Egypt, complete with pyramids, where we have to deal with an army of mummies; the Great Wall of China, crammed full of oriental devils; the great metropolis, land of the living dead. Apart from the substantial aesthetic variations, in the end there are no real differences between one location and another, but the change undoubtedly benefits the variety of the action and together with the ~odometer~ sets very precise stakes to which we can refer to during the game, even if only to put a little more effort and attention near a checkpoint. The default weapon is a powerful shotgun, capable of literally wiping out enemies, but along the way we will also find a light machine gun, a particular jetpack that shoots downwards (and proves to be essential when we get the wrong size of a jump), a powerful motorcycle, an electric rifle and a large-caliber pistol. The control system, like this type of product, is extraordinarily simple: you have to touch the left side of the touch screen to jump and the right side to shoot. We have mentioned the presence of various platform elements, and in fact the good Barry has to leap often and willingly to avoid getting injured on the traps or falling into the ever more numerous chasms that will make the race more difficult for him (and which translate into an instantaneous game over). Together with the change of scenery and the ~reset~ of the speed, another element of detachment from the usual ~ultra arcade~ is the presence of an energy bar, made up of little hearts, which can even be recovered along the way (by collecting a heart) and which therefore allows us to face the challenge in a more relaxed way than a ~touch and die~ approach. Graphics and sound are of excellent quality: the first stands out for the nice design of the characters, as well as for the beauty of the backgrounds, while the second moves between good music and convincing effects.
