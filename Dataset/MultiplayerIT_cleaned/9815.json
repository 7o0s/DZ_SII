{"name": "Un nuovo RTS su console", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/80528-ruse-un-nuovo-rts-su-console.html", "text": "Version tested: Xbox 360 It's a very good period for all PC users who love strategic games, after Starcraft II the release of the new chapter of Civilization is imminent, but how is the situation on consoles? Luckily, after the experiment attempted with Endwar, Ubisoft tries again with a setting more in the wake of tradition but with a pinch of innovation (in addition to the various aspects in terms of gameplay, we remind you that PlayStation Move is supported on PlayStation 3). which will make every ~consular strategist~ happy. The plot is decidedly well narrated through clips of films between one mission and another, with a valid dubbing capable of restoring the right feeling, the sensation of witnessing unrepeatable events is present, and there is no need to get bored since the sequences are rapid and the search for Prometheus (a spy capable of revealing all the plans of the allies to the Axis forces) becomes increasingly spasmodic. As you all know by now, R.U.S.E. is set in the Second World War and sees us fight in the role of the Allied forces against the fearsome Nazis and their supporters, including the Italians who are faced many times, and from the very first missions, not only on the lands of the beloved boot but also in Africa . As a major in the United States we will make a career in a short time, so as to annoy other generals thanks to our skills in the field. RTS of course R.U.S.E. is in every sense a strategic in real time, we can arrange the troops on the battlefield and give the different orders not before having set up a headquarters and managing the supplies, present in the game in the form of storage depots from which they leave at a rhythm constant number of convoys heading right to the HQ, each convoy that arrives safely at our depots increases the available resources indicated here in the form of money to spend on new structures/units. These storage platforms cannot be built, but you must either occupy the few that are ~free~ on the playing field or conquer the enemy ones. After a few games you realize that it is necessary to have at least one other base placed as close as possible to the deposits in order to speed up the time between loading resources and earning money. The resource collection phase has obviously been reduced to a minimum to speed up the battle, but the fact that the deposits are limited and that they run out over time forces you to always move with caution and not waste money. The birth of the units works in the same way, they leave the structures after they are built and after the relative price has been paid. On the front of the troops there is certainly no lack of variety since in addition to the infantry, there are both ground troops such as light armored vehicles, tank destroyers, lee tanks, assault guns but also air troops such as bombers and paratroopers. The missions all start with a short briefing in which the main objective is explained and the battlefield is revealed, further secondary objectives are unlocked during the fight and contribute to increasing the points obtained by winning the battle. The points earned increase the player's level as a strategist (some objectives are linked precisely to this ranking). PC version The PC version of R.U.S.E. it's identical to its console counterpart, save for a couple of factors. The first concerns the technical aspects. At a high level of detail, the visual feel is definitely better and there is less loss of detail, with larger textures and more refined models. In terms of gameplay, it is not that the graphic improvements are decisive (indeed, they have no effect at all), but they are there and should be noted. Moreover, R.U.S.E. manages to be fluid even on machines that are not exactly very recent. The second and most decisive factor is the greater practicality of the control system. The combination of mouse and keyboard is irreplaceable in strategic games. Thus, the talk about the clumsy controls valid for the console versions, for the PC version decays. The control system, when mastered (it doesn't take much practice), is great and zooming with the mouse wheel is much more practical than doing it with the joypad. In general, you manage to be much faster and control your troops better, which is no small thing. Let's say, if you play R.U.S.E. on PC, you can add half a point to the article's final grade. Zoom IN/OUT Moving troops on the battlefield is very simple and just press the A key to select them and a further pressure in another area of the map to make them move. At this point the real val enters the sceneadded hours of the Ubisoft game and that is the possibility at any moment of the game, through the movement of the right analog stick, to bring the view closer and further away at will. This allows a different approach to battles, on the one hand with the maximum zoom we will have the continuous feedback of our troops and we will see them in detail facing the enemies and the roughness of the terrain, on the other hand with the medium-far view it is possible to manage them like pawns on a chessboard, trying to anticipate the opponent's moves. In our opinion, the reference to the chessboard is also fitting because with the maximum distance view, tanks, infantry and all vehicles are reduced to a single pawn (a bit like the party of several players of a Jrpg is reduced to just the protagonist in the exploration of the play area) which is added to the other pawns a bit like a game of checkers, complete with circular bases colored green. Managing the troops in this way, even if our preferred view is the intermediate one, is easy and immediate, for the assembled troops it is then always possible to split using the two back buttons LB and RB. The real flaw of this system is that it does not allow a precise selection of the units, we will often find ourselves moving them all together unless we zoom in and choose the most suitable ones. In our opinion it is not a big problem, certainly solvable by working with the proximity to the playing field, it is then possible to select all the units of the same type, or to surround the troops with a circular selector which allows a wider selection and varies in the type of unit. It is necessary to give the right interpretation to this enlargement/reduction system of the playing field, as well as providing a valid aid to quickly recover troops further away from the hot area, it is essential to have perfect control of the map and not only to understand the enemy movements but also to discover the tactical points to be defended through ambushes. This strategy is immediately taught right from the first games, some units, including infantry and anti-tank guns, if positioned in the forests, are capable of keeping the convoys of heavy vehicles of the opponents in check. The correct exploitation of the different troops is essential to be successful in battle, for example tank destroyers fear infantry, as infantry fear armored vehicles, assault guns are weak to frontal attacks, that's why planning must be absolutely preventive. In this the certainly not high game speed helps, in fact the troops move slowly on the map, a defect for someone, it could in fact make waiting for the clashes too boring, but as far as we are concerned we found it spot on. given that in any case the fights with the enemy are decidedly very frequent, favoring those players who love strategic planning. Xbox 360 goals Never like this time getting all 1000 points available will make you sweat seven shirts, not only it is necessary to complete the game, with main and secondary objectives, but also all the cooperative missions and clashes on Xbox Live in different modes. Not a small commitment to unlock all 50 achievements. Deceptions and possibilities Returning to the playing field, it is set up in sectors, visible through the farthest shot, and this division has a specific purpose and that is the possibility of using the different RUSEs, precisely the deceptions. The developers are proud of the inclusion in the game of these excellent alternatives to the gameplay of destruction, to make a long story short, during the missions the intelligence service provides bonuses to play against the enemy, for example the interception of communications makes the screen highlight with red arrows the advance movements of the opponent. It is also very useful to send a spy beyond enemy lines to find out which vehicles are placed on the battlefield far from our troops (the enemy units are in fact distinguished only by the size between infantry and heavy vehicles but until you get close you he is unaware of which unit he is going to face). Excellent is the possibility of moving in radio silence, without communications our forces move without being seen by enemy units, a valid means to go unnoticed until the decisive attack. The attack with the baits is also fantastic, perfect for moving the bulk of the opposing units and then hitting them in another area with our real means. These bonuses, which are temporary, make the gameplay very varied and there are situations in which it is necessary to use these tricks to avoid enemy counterattacks or to hit opponents almost undisturbed. If the campaign in is the cAt the heart of the single player we cannot forget that it is possible to play both skirmishes and operations, in which real battles and invented but decidedly intriguing situations are reproduced that we will be able to face both against the a.i. than on Xbox Live. The online is decidedly full-bodied as regards R.U.S.E. and it is possible to face the challenges not only in the classic deathmatch but also in coop for up to 4 players. From a technical point of view, the graphics engine makes its figure without problems, we will not be at the top of the generation but it is not necessary for this type of game. We would have liked a few more details during the zooms on the units and on the battlefield which to be honest appears a bit bare, but just play with the right distance to enjoy the battlefield to the fullest. The framing passages are always fluid and as explained allow perfect management of the clash thanks to a perfectly studied control system, even if more complex orders are foreseen for our troops and the need to always select them manually to move them to the objective.", "date": "2010-09-10", "grade": "8.3"}
