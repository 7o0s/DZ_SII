After all, they are big interactive stories (often not too much) that have as their raison d'tre the desire to surprise with intricate and exciting stories. Anyone who knows them knows that seeing us represent love stories between homosexuals is not a rarity. Especially in Japan, many yuri (stories between women) and yaoi (stories between men) visual novels come out, some of which have also reached our parts. However, the recent diffusion of very simple development tools, which really allow anyone to create a visual novel, has also increased its production in the West. At the beginning of the adventure you have to create a dad using the included editor In particular some authors, such as Christine Love, have exploited the genre to create original and profound works, often centered on sexuality, such as Ladykiller in a Bind (or ~My Twin Brother Made Me Crossdress As Him And Now I Have To Deal With A Geeky Stalker And A Domme Beauty Who Want Me In A Bind!!~ if you prefer). Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator, the first title of the Game Grumps duo, follows this creative trail, while failing to touch the same qualitative levels. Let's try to understand why. Dream dad Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator tells the story of a dad and his daughter, named Amanda, who, after moving house, are eager to get to know the neighborhood. The two have a very good relationship, but it is the little girl in particular who is the most responsible and who cares about her parent. From the very beginning of the story, decisions have to be made regarding their past. Doing so is easy, given that the game implements a simple system of multiple choices, identical for dialogues and narrative twists. In short, every now and then we are asked how to proceed and we have to choose between the different possibilities listed. Do we want to go to a bar or take a walk in the park? Are we tired and head to bed, or do we prefer to spend the night somewhere to hook up with someone? Usually every decision made corresponds to a different man met. To pick up some dads, you have to get to know them first In what sense? Well, the goal of Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator is to get to know your neighbors, flirt with them and maybe end up in bed with them. There are seven in total, all with different characters that we need to understand and humor in order to impress. In fact, by talking to them we will have to try to make them fall in love with our answers, aligning ourselves with their tastes. On some occasions, for example during appointments, which we will be able to fix via email, mini-games must also be overcome. There are several, bland in substance, but overall funny and full of quotations. For example, a confrontation with one of the other men on the abilities of their respective daughters is represented as the fight of a Pokmon for Game Boy, while an evening at the disco becomes a fast arcade in which we need to find our partner avoiding being dragged by the crowd. The smell of success Despite its underlying superficiality (or perhaps because of it), Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator proved to be a huge commercial success, quickly becoming one of the best-selling visual novels in the West. Steam Spy tells us that it has placed almost one hundred and fifty thousand copies (at the time of writing this review), largely due to the resonance between streamers and youtubers (given the topic covered, they went to a wedding). Consider that among the game's options there is one designed specifically to hide all content that is controversial or at risk due to copyright issues, so as not to cause problems during live shows. Too many dads The big problem of Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator is not the assumption that animates it (a dad who picks up other dads), also by virtue of the choice of the Game Gumps guys to completely avoid vulgarity and explicit scenes. The tones are those of comedy, as evident since the creation of the father, who can be completely modified in appearance to be more attractive or funnier; and as is confirmed by the first exchanges with Amanda, who never lets us miss a joke or some nice notes. Unfortunately, the script itself takes care of sinking the experience, really weak in some moments. The characters seem like walking captions that always address the various topics with a strongly detached attitude. They never seem like real people talking about topics that are part of their lives, but like printed books describing points of view on the most disparate issues. Complexesthey are false and stereotyped, despite the fact that some flicker of humanity transpires from time to time in some dialogue. Another big problem concerns love stories, which are never really explored. Unfortunately, the eight hours it takes to see almost everything the game has to offer aren't enough to delve into the relationships between the characters and make some of the situations that arise interesting. Some of the stories told are simply dismissive and the theme of homosexuality does not enrich them in any way. The quality of Christine Love's writing is far away, as is that of Gone Home (which is not a visual novel, but is still a title completely focused on storytelling). The minigames are nice From a visual point of view, however, the designers have done an excellent job, with well-crafted and varied characters in appearance. Even the animations are spot on and, despite being stylized, they manage to highlight facial expressions. A few more poses wouldn't have hurt, but given the production level of the game, you can stay with it. Of course, the references to a certain type of characterization, visible above all in the line and in the colouring, are really evident, but overall the artists (the drawings were made by a group of friends, apparently) have shown great competence and ability.", "date": "2017-08-03", "grade": "6.8"}
