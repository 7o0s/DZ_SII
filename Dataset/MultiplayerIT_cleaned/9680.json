The mind immediately goes to the various Tetris, Columns and possibly Puzzle Bobble, but after? Apart from the numerous modern reinterpretations of the same titles, there are really rare cases in which some developer has managed to offer us a product that is both engaging and fun and completely original on the other. The risk of such an operation is obvious, especially in a market, the video game market, which has always been based on more or less successful sequels and clones. For these reasons, we found ourselves a bit taken aback in front of Chrominance: it is an ~action~ puzzle game in which we control colored bubbles, but our goal is not to put the same ones in contact to eliminate them, nor pursue this aim by taking advantage of more or less marked ~tracks~. In the game the backgrounds play a leading role, because they dictate the color that must be obtained to make a ~valid~ explosion, and also indicate the portion of the screen in which this explosion must take place. The bubbles, which move in an inertial context very similar to water, can in fact be combined with each other to obtain specific colours, just ~throw~ them with your fingers to make them collide. The point is that the ~paint spot~ resulting from such an impact must be on an area of the background of the same color. A practical example: the seabed is divided into two parts, one green and one orange, and the bubbles placed on the screen are red, yellow and blue. It will therefore be necessary to make sure that the blue and yellow bubbles collide while they are in the green area, and in the same way to make the yellow and red bubbles impact in the orange area. Five or more valid eliminations, according to these criteria, will allow us to move on to the next stage. On the contrary, the uncoordinated explosions of color will result in a loss of vital energy, signaled by the appropriate icon located in the upper right part of the screen: too many errors and it will be game over. Rainbow and the colors of the rainbow Born on the iPad but also available for the iPhone and iPod Touch (with support for the Retina Display), Chrominance is perhaps less comfortable with a small screen, but a little practice is enough to overcome the initial difficulties. There are two game modes available: in the first you have to overcome the various stages and gradually face more complex situations, with the backdrops divided into increasingly smaller and smaller colored portions; in the second the focus shifts to the time available, in what ultimately stands as the most classic of ~time attacks~. In both cases it is hard to speak of a ~survival~ type structure, given that on the one hand the game is unique and cannot be continued, on the other hand the presence of a vital energy indicator (which can be restored by collecting special bonuses) allows us to recover from seemingly desperate situations. Speaking of bonuses, there are four of them and they also come in the form of a colored bubble: lightning simply allows us to eliminate a bubble in any portion of the screen, the bomb blows up everything in the playing area without consequences, the heart gives us back a ~life~ and the white bubble finally splits the bubbles it comes into contact with in two. The inertial environment, which undoubtedly gives Chrominance its own personality, ultimately proves to be the most difficult element to digest in terms of playability: the bubbles must be ~thrown~ almost as if they were marbles along the background, but often regulating its speed proves difficult and one has the clear sensation of having very little control over the movements. The technical realization is good, but pays the price as regards the font used, too thin and therefore often not very legible (a black border would be enough to solve the problem, however). The mode selection screen also appears decidedly immature. The tested version is 1.0.1 Price: 2.39 App Store links", "date": "2010-11-03", "grade": "7.7"}
