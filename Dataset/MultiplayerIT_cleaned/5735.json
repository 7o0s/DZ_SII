The genre has found a second youth thanks to digital delivery and the choice, between new and old titles, has become truly wide. In the last few months alone we have had major releases such as Chaos Reborn, Thea: The Awakening, Hard West, Sorcerer King, Rising Tide (the expansion of Civilization: Beyond Earth) and several others. The developer who most of all helped to restore luster to shifts is Firaxis. Not only with the aforementioned Civilization series, but above all with XCOM: Enemy Unknown which in 2012 demonstrated how it was possible to combine a modern and dynamic interface with one of the most reflective genres, definitely rejuvenating it. Of course, there were many risks, starting with the decision to revive a series considered untouchable by many enthusiasts, but the final result rewarded courage. XCOM 2 arrives just over three years after the first chapter. The challenge in his case is very different, but equally demanding: managing not to rest on his predecessor's laurels. Discover the beauty of XCOM 2 in our rich and comprehensive review Scenario and base of operations The story behind the action of XCOM 2 kicks off from the end of the first chapter. The Earth Defense Forces thought they had won the war against the aliens; unfortunately this is not the case and at the beginning of the game we find the planet completely subjugated, with humans playing the undesirable role of cattle for the dark purposes of the unwanted space visitors, who now call themselves Advent. The new basis Unfortunately, few are aware of the situation, because the aliens have set up an incredibly powerful military and propaganda machine: on the one hand there is the threat of weapons, on the other the controlled media continuously send messages favorable to the occupiers and opposed to any form of resistance. The player has the task of leading the resistance. The tutorial, in which the basic mechanics are explained, is also the story of the liberation of the rebel commander, who is none other than the commander who led the XCOM base against the aliens in the first chapter. Many of the other members of the base come from that era (or are children of it) and have a clear understanding of the threat they are fighting against. The base itself is similar to how we remembered it, but also slightly different. One of the areas of the base Meanwhile it is self-propelled, in the sense that it is no longer placed in a fixed area from which all operations start, but moves to different territories according to needs. Internally it has areas similar to those we already knew: therefore we have a large area dedicated to scientific research, which allows you to study the alien artifacts found on the battlefield (objects, corpses and so on); another area, equally large, dedicated to military engineering, where objects for soldiers are built, including equipment; then there are the military quarters, those of the commander and the tactical map, which we will discuss in the next paragraph. In the central part of the base there are also the rooms occupied by the debris, which can be cleaned up to build other useful infrastructures, such as an experimental research area to obtain advanced equipment; a medical area to speed up the healing of wounded soldiers on the battlefield; the so-called Shadow Room, which is used to conduct in-depth research on aliens; a kind of military school in which to learn new combat techniques, including the essential increase in the slots of soldiers to take to the battlefield; a room for developing the soldiers' psychic powers; various energy nodes and more. Tactical map and resources In the previous paragraph we mentioned the new tactical map, decidedly different from that of the first episode. It is one of the most evident reflections of the changed conditions in which we find ourselves operating: while in Enemy Unknown the world was united against the aliens and the XCOM base receives support from all continents, in XCOM 2 we must act with more circumspection and be able to establish a network of contacts among the rebels scattered throughout the planet, who must be sought territory by territory, without being intercepted by enemies. Who will this mysterious figure be? Therefore, initially we act only on a small portion of the world, to gradually expand to the rest of the planet. Even resources accumulate in a different way: if before we received wire transfers, more or less substantial based on the behavior held, now our lenders will leave the supplies in safe places, visible on the map, where we will have to go to search for them by scanning and recover themthe. In short, the base of the resistance will always be on the move, moving from one part of the globe to another to recover resources, make purchases on the black market and carry out the missions that will be assigned to it, which we will discuss later. Another of the novelties of XCOM 2 concerns precisely the resources. In addition to the money and the alien remains, in fact, we must also worry about the Data, which are exactly what they say they are, that is, the alien data that can be spent as currency in some circumstances, for example to obtain more money, or to build special objects . The data also have another fundamental function: they are used to get in touch with the nuclei of the resistance scattered throughout the globe. This is the only way to create a network of contacts that can increase the scope of our maneuvers. Sometimes it will be necessary to come into contact with certain territories to carry out specific missions that will advance the plot. Soldiers and missions Obviously the whole planning phase has a specific purpose: to carry out missions to strike the aliens directly in the heart. The missions of XCOM 2 are apparently very similar to those seen in Enemy Unknown, but in reality they have more than a few differences. One of the new enemies This is big, and it hurts! The interface and basic mechanics remain the same: with a squad of soldiers, which can consist of four to six members, who take turns tracking down and killing aliens, moving from cover to cover and using their specific abilities. Each soldier begins as a recruit, and then specializes in one of the four available classes: the Rangers, excellent in assaults and, in general, in close combat; the Specialists, soldiers equipped with a bot useful for violating alien electronic systems, including combat units; the Snipers, perfect for ranged combat; and the Grenadiers, soldiers with heavy weapons useful for dealing big damage and removing enemy cover. Growing in level, each soldier can choose from time to time between various skills, which more specialize the classes. By adding the other customization elements, much more present than in Enemy Unknown, such as weapon attachments, battle tactics, the greatest number of buildable support objects, the special abilities that each soldier can have and so on, you they manage to form much more varied teams than in the past and much more in line with their own style of play. As we said, the missions are similar to those already seen in the 2012 chapter, but there are also new ones. For example, objectives such as the protection of civilians return, or the recovery of alien artifacts from fallen UFOs, but there are also new ones such as the protection of resistance communication systems, the attacks on enemy bases to be blown up, the recovery of alien resources by land transport and so on. In short, there is certainly a greater variety of things to do, which is also reflected in the greater number of settings, now much richer in biomes and scenarios. So, despite the similarities to the previous chapter, it's really difficult to run into some dj vu. Obfuscation One of the most important innovations concerning the missions is the obfuscation system, which we had already talked about in a previous test, but which deserves to be explained again. Mission successful, but with many wounded In Enemy Unknown the aliens were immediately aware of the presence of the player's team on the battlefield; when they were flushed out they would activate and start fighting. In XCOM 2 the so-called Obfuscation phase has been added, in which the team moves stealthily around the map trying to avoid ending up in the enemy's field of vision (represented by red eyes that overlap the boxes). What is it for? In the meantime, study the situation better before acting. This way you can choose where and when to start fighting. That's quite a difference, as it allows you to set up ambushes and try to attack by first positioning your squad members in vantage points (better cover, elevated sniper positions, and so on). It also allows you to take advantage of some class-specific skills. For example, a Ranger skilled in hand-to-hand combat, much improved compared to the past and much more useful, can carry out real obfuscation massacres, or simply cause great damage to enemies before they notice his presence. Of course, it is not possible to solve entire missions while remaining hidden, given that one of the fixed objectives, or almost so, of each map is the elimination of residual threats (after all, it is not an RPG),but it is a successful system that dramatically changes the beginning of each mission and adds an extra layer of planning to the action. The customization options in XCOM 2 are much more pronounced than in Enemy Unknown For the rest, the firefights remain similar to those seen in Enemy Unknown, with each soldier having at his disposal a primary weapon (rifles of all sorts and heavy machine guns), a secondary weapon, different depending on the class (swords, bots, guns, and grenade launchers) and miscellaneous items such as grenades, medkits, shields to protect against mental attacks, body armor that improves health or protects against altered states, such as poisoning, and more. Speaking of armor, here too there is much more variety than in the past, with armor of different classes and others with more specific functions. For example there is a heavy armor with a missile launcher attached, or there is another light one with a grappling hook that gives enormous mobility. Also from the point of view of the enemies the variety is greater. For example, the basic alien soldiers have been replaced by Advent troops, more similar in characterization to futuristic soldiers, while there are new features such as the Faceless, large beasts that attack by surprise by developing from human beings, or the Codex, agile and ethereal capable of teleporting and cloning when hit. There are also special enemies, such as the terrible Avatars, which cause immense damage, are very resistant and, in general, when faced with them they are capable of putting even the most experienced and equipped of teams in difficulty. The sequel we wanted In short, XCOM 2 is indeed a sequel, but one of those capable of showing off for the high number of innovations it offers. In some moments the battles can become complex Starting to play we thought we could behave more or less like in Enemy Unknown, instead we had to change our mind on several occasions and we were forced to develop specific strategies in order not to succumb to the enemies. For example, we learned how to take advantage of the aforementioned hand-to-hand combat of the rangers, which gives an enormous tactical advantage, especially in the advanced stages; or we have learned to evaluate the hacking skills of the specialists, which have proved to be fundamental on more than one occasion to take control of mechanized troops, to be used against their own masters. The greater customization of the equipment has also contributed to the strong feeling of freshness that the game communicates. If in Enemy Unknown the progression was in fact linear, with the player setting himself the ultimate goal of having as many as possible a team of psionic warriors in order to be able to defeat any resistance, here there is a greater variety of choices and, composing a team in the final stages of the game, it is impossible not to notice the greater number of options, all equally valid, available. In short, we could give other examples, but you will surely have understood that XCOM 2 is what all sequels should be: it remembers the previous chapter, but it has no problem changing the cards on the table to offer something different and new. Graphics and some problems Also from a graphic point of view Firaxis has done a good job, improving all the models of humans and aliens, making the maps more varied, while having maintained the procedural generation system, increasing the destructiveness and adding effects galore for attacks and explosions. Boom, baby, boom! The base has also been revised and is now less static and more detailed, with the various areas enriched by animations and objects. Of course, all this translates into a greater overall heaviness, especially by selecting the highest levels of detail, but it is also pleasant to see the work done to refine some aspects of the graphics and make them more in line with the times. Unfortunately, however, there are also problems to be noted. In the first place the management of the camera in moments of action, ie when, given an order, the shot changes in search of the most spectacular cut. Sometimes it happens that the system doesn't work as it should and the shot freezes on points that show badly what is happening or, worse, that show nothing at all. For example, it may happen that you find yourself admiring a wall, or you can see the off-screen action finish at the last moment. The second problem to report concerns some blocks that occur during the turns of the aliens. Also in this case it doesn't happen often, but it can happen that the execution of some extra terrestrial actions is not shown, or that it is shown in jumps. Thus, you find yourself having to check the results of the enemies' actions at the beginning of your turn. As we mentioned, no", "date": "2016-02-01", "grade": "9.1"}
