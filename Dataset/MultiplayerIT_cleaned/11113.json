{"name": "Crysis Warhead - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crysis-warhead-recensione.html", "text": "Warheads to give, take and drop Narrated through seven intense missions, the plot of Warhead moves in a parallel but decidedly synthesized way compared to what was seen in Crysis and this time the player will be made to wear the futuristic suit of Sergeant Sykes, better known to veterans of the series as Psycho, the soldier who accompanied us in the original Crytek shooter during the very first missions and then escaped our sight entangled in a rescue mission. Warhead is therefore set in another portion of the familiar tropical island, to be exact the opposite coast, a strip of land that acts as the theater for a decidedly more frenetic gameplay where the action component is the protagonist in a much more incisive way , pressing and adrenaline-pumping compared to what we had experienced with Crysis. Call of Duty 4 and any additional Half-Life 2 Episodes; the comparison flashed into our minds after a few minutes immersed in the single player campaign. Not so much for the setting, conceptually close to that of Valve's masterpiece, much less for the scripted sequences, exaggeratedly evident in the Infinity Ward sequel, but much less incisive (indeed, it would be fair to say, better hidden) in Warhead. The link with the two games mentioned above catches the eye for the intensity of the gameplay: in fact, the new Crytek project is played in one breath, it leaves no breath so much the player is tossed between one scenario and the next without a moment parking; there are no moments that are thoughtful, slow, or likely to halt the intensity of the gameplay. The approximately 7 hours in which the game can be finished (at the third difficulty level of the 4 available) fly away in an instant, thanks to a succession of events that make Warhead move away from the first Crysis. On the one hand, the interlude scenes created with the game engine and third person view add that touch of narration to a certainly more developed plot which practically immediately makes the player collide with the aliens about to conquer the Earth; on the other hand almost a downside due to a linearity that apparently leaves the player a little less freedom but completely eliminates the long periods of stasis that characterized Crysis, especially in the shifts between one mission objective and the next. Everything is summarized here, the clashes are constant and the gameplay always leaves the glimmer of stealth action open (in particular, the mission set in the abandoned mine almost seems to force the player in this direction) but it is now time to go on with the shotgun leveled. much more exciting and in line with the obstacles and enemies that block our way. In a spasmodic search for novelty As mentioned above, the action takes place on the same tropical island as Crysis. We will therefore find ourselves facing the Korean army about to control the nerve centers of this natural paradise and a large part of our adventure will be aimed at trying to take possession of a container initially convinced that it contains a nuclear warhead (but let's avoid excessive spoilers). Obviously we will soon have to deal with the alien threat that will indiscriminately attack our Psycho and the fortified positions of the almond-eyed soldiers. At our disposal we will have the trusty futuristic suit with the same powers already tested in the past and a fairly varied paraphernalia including handguns, machine guns, rocket launchers and various types of grenades and explosives which is enriched by a brand new grenade launcher and the possibility to use pistols and short-barreled machine guns in akimbo mode, i.e. one in each hand. Furthermore, near the epilogue we will be able to take up a weapon of great effect that will help us in the charismatic and intense final battle. Nothing new, however, on the enemy front. In addition to the usual fully armed Korean soldiers and excellently made on the behavioral front, even the aliens, unfortunately, know they have already seen it. In fact, we will face the usual ground troops who continue to remind us of the Sentinels of the Matrix, the huge aircraft capable of dropping mines or the creatures just mentioned and absolutely disturbing in their perpetual freezing ray and the huge tentacled monster halfway between a Striker from Half-Life and an invader from War of the Worlds. As just mentioned, all enemies already seen in Crysis but which in Warhead are launched against the player practically immediately if we consider that just at the third level we will already meet the huge Hunter. However, by digging deep into some innovation we can also find it in this field and, to be more precise in terms of artificial intelligenceAnd. The soldiers, it must be said, have not gained great genius but respond in a significantly more realistic way to any hit and run tactics that exploit invisibility. They never stand still waiting for your coup de grace but tend to organize themselves into small search parties, move to more sheltered areas and shoot empty in a seemingly more sensible way (sorry for the nonsense). As for multiplayer, alongside the Power Struggle mode already seen in the first Crysis, we point out the addition of a simple Team Instant Action (a tempting name to talk about the classic Team Deathmatch) which finally allows you to quickly enter a game and limit yourself to take out your opponents without worrying about anything else, at most of your teammates who, if nothing else, expect a minimum of cover. The new maps present are also pleasant, in particular the one entirely focused on vehicles strongly shows what is possible to do with the Crysis editor especially in terms of gameplay versatility. Instead, all the maps already seen in Crysis return (some with various improvements capable of making the gameplay faster). We also point out that, unlike the original title, in Warhead the multiplayer component, called Crysis Wars, is available as a stand-alone game that can be installed separately. Other than Superman The Nanosuit developed by the US government is the basis of the sci-fi drift of Crysis and is probably the best design object made by Crytek. Inside the game it allows you to upgrade the controlled character in four ways through a radial menu that is activated by default by pressing the middle mouse button. Super-Strength: Activating this function it will be possible to throw objects and enemies great distances, make huge jumps and significantly decrease the effect of breathing on the weapon when the view from the viewfinder is active. You are also less prone to recoil from long bursts of fire. Super-Speed: With this power-up, the speed of movement will be greater, especially in the case of sprints. Invisibility: The basis of any stealth tactic, activating this function Sykes will become completely invisible to the eyes of the enemy and the aliens, allowing him to quickly escape a running shootout, or to seize the enemy from behind or, again, to infiltrate highly protected without arousing attention. As soon as you try to shoot, throw a grenade or an explosive, the skill is automatically deactivated to switch to armor mode and the entire energy reserve of the suit is consumed. Armor: The mode that you will find yourself using the most during firefights. In fact, by activating this upgrade, every blow you suffer will reduce the energy of the suit instead of insisting on the protagonist's life points. Also when the suit is at full capacity, Psycho's life energy is recharged. Nobody wants to hear about anything else But let's get to the historically most discussed aspect of the Crysis universe: the technological component. Has the CryEngine 2, the beating heart of the marvel born from the forges of Crytek, been really optimized as we found ourselves saying on several occasions during our numerous played tests? The answer can only be, without fear of contradiction, a resounding yes. Warhead is smooth, with no stuttering, frame rate drops, sudden freezes or unexpected crashes. Take the previous Crysis, run it at a certain resolution on a specific PC, then load Warhead, use the same graphics settings and the same computer components and you will see it gain that handful of frames per second that make it much more playable. This alone could guarantee a round of applause for the developers but that's not all. The management of the lights has been enhanced and with it the engine that manages the particles, to the point of making the scenarios even more realistic, especially when you find yourself walking among the trees in the presence of explosions and smoke, with the rays of light passing through the foliage by projecting shadows in real time on every surface present by raising believable dust. And the small streams that form on the helmet when you get out of the water or the ice effect that appears on the visor in some pre-rendered sequences are also credible (a completely different matter instead for the condensation that appears on the optical viewfinder in some levels in a frozen setting: absolutely unrealistic, poor quality and too annoying as a ploy to make precision aiming more complex). And, speaking again of optimizations and implementations, Crytek has seen fit to meet the eli playerseffectively undermining that hypocritical subdivision of the graphic settings based on the operating system used and the consequent DirectX installed on the computer: Warhead can be set with the maximum settings even under Windows XP in the presence of DirectX 9. Simply when you are in the Vista environment, the game will use version 10 of the Microsoft libraries. you can amaze any of your friends by showing them what still represents the best exponent of the technological level reached by video games Nobody wants to hear about anything else However, at the same time, there are some problems that have made us turn up our noses. First of all, the explosions with the consequent shock waves appeared less realistic to us, perhaps rendered in a more hasty and approximate way, as well as the level of detail, that particular procedure that allows you to load the textures with a different detail depending on the proximity to the player's field of vision, which now appears more clearly and, unfortunately, annoying. Probably precisely to recover a few frames per second, many textures will have a lower quality even from an appreciable distance, pointing out the loading detachment of the high resolution version more clearly. Unfortunately, when talking about optimizations, the uploads seem to have been left aside, remaining identical to the original Crysis over time, often very long when changing levels but also when you find yourself reloading the quicksave in case of premature death. However, these development imperfections remain crushed under the weight of that incredible visual quality that Warhead throws out of the monitor when you run it on your PC. Stylistically exceptional scenarios that far distance what was seen in the first Crysis, with attention to design, variety, to amaze the player. Noteworthy is the entirely frozen level where, as soon as you exit a tunnel, you will find yourself in the midst of a blizzard with frighteningly realistic HDR effects in an attempt to focus on a huge warship stranded in the center of this frozen plain. And just in the field of variety worthy of note are the level set on a moving train that reminded us so much of a similar sequence of the old but never forgotten Soldier of Fortune or the ending of the more recent Gears of War. The final sequence of the level set in the same open-air mine already seen in Crysis is also extremely adrenaline-pumping, where together with your war companions you will have to defend yourself from a spasmodic alien assault, while a soldier will try to blow up the entrance to a mountain blocked by numerous debris. Of course, in any case, these are variations on themes already tested on numerous occasions, especially in the FPS field, but always with that touch of originality, splendor and pleasantness that distinguishes the entire gameplay of Warhead. With Warhead we feel like reconfirming the vote given to Crysis at the time. While it is in fact true that the new Crytek project manages to run better on the same machine, it offers content on the single player side of greater impact and a higher overall quality than the original Crysis, and the same is also true in the multiplayer field with new levels and finally a more immediate and frenetic game mode, at the same time Warhead fails in terms of surprise. Everything knows, paradoxically, already seen; amazement is a thing of the past and the same single-player campaign proposes an identical setting with a parallel narrative evolution but too similar to that of Crysis and which in just 7 hours of playing will show us its ending. However, it remains out of the question that Warhead must be purchased by all PC owners, also thanks to its incredible budget price. You'll play it in one breath and you'll be able to amaze any of your friends by showing them what still today, without danger of contradiction, represents the best exponent of the technological level reached by video games, consoles included.
