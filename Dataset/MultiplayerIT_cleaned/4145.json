{"name": "Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/vengeful-guardian-moonrider-recensione.html", "text": "Oniken, released in 2014, followed a very simple philosophy, which was to bring back a certain way of conceiving video games on consoles in the 80s, both in terms of mechanics and aesthetics. What amazed was not so much the gaze turned towards the past itself, but the demonstrated ability to know how to manipulate the original material, reinterpreting it in a modern key to create a very refined experience, almost authorial in the demonstrated dedication. Oniken was not just a vintage game, but a nice vintage game, worth playing regardless of having lived through the era it harked back to. JoyMasher, the development team, has maintained the same vision of the video game even with subsequent releases, but always trying to refer to different models. So Odallus: The Dark Call came out as a perfect mix of elements taken from the Castlevania and Makaimura series (including the spin-off Demon's Crest), while the later Blazing Chrome is the best Contra of modern times, far superior to the attempts made by Konami to revitalize the series (Contra: Rogue Corps... brrr). In the review of Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider we will see how JoyMasher looked back to the 80s and 90s to come up with a perfect title for 2023. Game mechanics Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider is inspired by several titles from the 80s and 90s Let's immediately eliminate some doubts: Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider is not a metroidvania, it does not want to be and is not interested in following in the wake of modern 2D action. Its most obvious point of reference in game mechanics is SEGA's Shinobi series, but it actually also looks to a multitude of other games, such as Mega Man (especially in the bosses), Hagane and Cannon Dancer, to name a few. So expect essentially linear levels, in some cases very difficult (never impossible) with a few secrets scattered here and there to find. Not even the possibility of deciding the order in which to tackle the stages is a concession to modern times, since it was not lacking in the aforementioned Mega Man series (just to give an example). The strength of Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider, which is also its most obvious limitation, is precisely its betting everything on mechanics from the past, but refined in an almost obsessive way. So the protagonist, Moonrider, can basically jump, run, attack frontally with his sword, making up to one combo (no multidirectional attacks), can dive into enemies and can jump on walls. It also has an energy bar linked to certain powers, such as a laser spear, a fire boomerang, a super dash and more. The latter are unlocked by finishing the various levels. Searching the maps, he can also find bonuses that he can activate (maximum two at a time) to obtain advantages... or disadvantages. For example, he can develop double jump, or the power to recover energy by killing enemies. The most hardcore players will also have the possibility of dying from a single hit, thus raising the level of challenge to the stars. 16-bit experience Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider has a really tough time So we have a hard-core 16-bit style action-platformer, in which you lead a rebel ninja warrior, who decides to help humanity against the same oppressive regime that created him. In reality, his main objective is revenge against the established power and the super soldiers who defend it. It all spans eight thrilling levels, with the first serving as a tutorial and seeing Moonrider escape from the lab where he was being held, then another six dedicated to finding and killing super warriors (playable in any order) and finally, the last stage, divided into two parts, where the story finds its natural conclusion. Maps of them are very diverse. Moonrider will have to penetrate maximum security buildings, some partially flooded, jump on the spaceships of the oppressors fleet, escape from a large robot in a forest, avoid laser traps, jump on moving platforms surrounded by electric discharges and, more generally , face many dangers, until the final showdown. In Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider there is no shortage of alternative levels, like this one on a motorcycle There are some sequences aboard a motorcycle, designed to break the rhythm of the platform sections and many small variations on the theme that allow you to get to the end of Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider without ever feeling a sense of repetitiveness. Speaking of enemies, the bulk is formed by the troops of the super warrior army, ranging from the classic soldiers armed with rifles, to ninjas armed with spinning swords, passing through killer drones and mutated creatures, such as pedecidedly aggressive skis or flying insects that, guess what, can't wait to kill us. There are of course also the bosses, more than one per level actually. Usually the rule followed is to put one or two mid-level opponents related to the same, and then finish with a super warrior. In general the bosses offer a good challenge, but never keep you stuck for too long. They all have their own attack patterns and some are particularly spectacular, including bio-cybernetic beasts, robots and giant spaceships. Everything really works perfectly and has no particular flaws, so much so that those who love this kind of operation shouldn't think too much about it and embark on an adventure. In some moments the graphics are really nice, albeit retro It must be said that in its stylistic radicalism, Vengeful Guardian: Moonrider may be difficult to digest for an audience that is not particularly tolerant of a gameplay crystallized over time such as the one offered, packaged in graphics that recall some Mega Drive titles (not for nothing the console on which many chapters of the Shinobi series were released). So it is natural that if such operations do not interest you or cause herpes, you can also look elsewhere without too much drama. Obviously this is not the game for you and it doesn't even want to be.", "date": "2023-01-11", "grade": "8.5"}
