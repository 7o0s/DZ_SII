{"name": "FIFA Street 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-street-2_b.html", "text": "The road of fear 2 Belonging to a line of video games that also includes football and basketball titles, FIFA Street 2 acts as a good sequel by updating its range of available characters, settings and modes while remaining a very special gameplay, very far from football simulations. In fact, once you take the field, you immediately realize that strategies and teamwork leave the time they find in front of solo plays, made up of spectacular tricks as well as ~gamebreakers~, i.e. momentary boosts that are obtained once the score bar has been filled (through the execution of various stunts) and which allow you not only to score very easily, but even to cancel the opponent's score. The FIFA Street 2 teams, each made up of four players, are commanded using a control system taken from FIFA Soccer but which is enriched with numerous functions thanks to the contribution of the right analog stick and the back buttons, through which it is possible to execute the numerous tricks or hinder those of the opponents when you are in the defensive phase. A fiery shot? Ordinary administration. Each player should have their own personal ~maneuver~. We'll be leaving soon... Gameplay and technical considerations If on the one hand FIFA Street 2 allows you to play matches between ~national teams~ in the most classic ways, on the other hand it offers a great, enormous space for a ~career~ that sees you personally engaged through the creation of a footballer, a footballer who he will take part in a series of matches around the world and which you can enhance by spending the points earned after each victory. The career mode consists of a series of challenges to be tackled progressively, in which sometimes the team that scores the most goals wins, sometimes whoever reaches a certain score with tricks first. As you progress, new challenges are unlocked and you are invited to special tournaments. The numbers of the game speak of twenty teams made up of dozens of real players, ten locations and lots of tricks. The new Electronic Arts product probably uses the FIFA Soccer graphics engine, so we have very detailed settings, characterized by good quality textures and quite different from each other. On the other hand, the players do not appear graphically very similar to their real counterparts, despite using complex polygonal models and despite being equipped with a large number of animations. The sound sector is typical of productions of the genre: signed ~underground~ soundtrack, with a lot of selection of ~radio frequencies~, together with low-level effects, limited in number and often out of place. Team play is limited to a few applications. The locations are very well done. Better to play with capable people... Cross-platform FIFA Street 2 is available for PS2, Xbox and GameCube, as well as for Personal Computers. There are no substantial differences between the various versions, except for a slightly more solid frame rate on the Microsoft and Nintendo consoles and an obviously higher resolution on PC. Comment FIFA Street 2 is not a football game, not like we are used to seeing this type of product. It is something different, which makes the aesthetics of the ball its fulcrum and which finds its soul in acrobatics and exaggerations, in a way completely similar to that of NBA Jam: fiery shots, improbable maneuvers and so on. The graphics and sound of this title are completely functional to its playful applications, the game modes are not many but the ~growth~ of the character and the possibility of always unlocking new tricks will certainly represent an incentive for all those who already have enjoyed the first episode. Being a ~spin-off~ is in many ways a justification for FIFA Street 2, as the game suffers from the same problems as FIFA Soccer and in any case it doesn't keep up with the ~feel~ of Pro Evolution Soccer: players are not always responsive as they should at the controls, stealing or keeping the ball sometimes becomes a matter of luck and having to act ~alone~ in the long run proves repetitive. Ultimately, we are dealing with a product that does what it aims to do well, without particular strengths or weaknesses: if you liked FIFA Street, then FIFA Street 2 will not disappoint you, on the contrary. Pros: Good technical realization Spectacular Once you understand the mechanism, it's fun Cons: Few game modes In the long run repetitive ~Ethereal~ ball control Au revoir.: a shot that becomes a flaming arrow starts a close relationship between sportswearand famous footballers, a relationship that has been reiterated over the years and which has the merit of producing a series of really nice and engaging television commercials. Sooner or later, of course, someone would have watched one of those commercials, in which the various Ronaldos, Figos, Henrys and Tottis challenge each other in soccer in unlikely places and to the sound of acrobatics with the ball, and would have decided to make a video game out of it.", "date": "2006-04-13", "grade": null}
