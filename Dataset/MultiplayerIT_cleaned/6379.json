Although the football manager has also been available in a Handheld version for smartphones and tablets for years, the most demanding players could in fact only find on PC the depth that makes the Sports Interactive series famous, whose mobile version was only a small surrogate snubbed by the hoof hard more demanding. The difference between the two versions of Football Manager was in fact quite clear, both in terms of game features and databases, before with Football Manager Classic 2014 the guys led by Miles Jacobson decided to take a few further steps in the mobile world, publishing the game on PlayStation Vita. A year has passed, the gap is now being filled further, with the 2015 edition abandoning the Sony console to focus on Android tablets and iPads: like the previous one, this is a version capable of reflecting the already existing Classic mode in its contents known on PC, with an inevitable series of changes to adapt the game to the touch interface of these platforms. Football Manager Classic 2015 brings much of the experience known on PC to tablets Classic but not too much For those unfamiliar with the Classic mode of Football Manager, we remind you that this was introduced with the 2013 edition of the manager on PC, to give fans of the series a simplified way to carry on their coaching career without necessarily having to do accounts with all the details and delays to which the complete mode of the game subjects. Inside, a series of features have in fact been introduced that are able both to speed up the experience and to make it simpler and more accessible: in the first case, for example, it has been made possible to skip the simulation of a game to directly obtain the its result, while in the second a system of microtransactions was introduced to obtain bonuses of various types, such as instant healing from an injury to a player. Features that go perfectly with those of the mobile world, where to prevent the arrival of a deeper Football Manager was so far the barrier constituted by technological progress, which has now reached a point where the latest generation devices are, according to the developers , finally able to manage uploads and amount of data. Although the completeness of the traditional one is not found in the Classic mode, compared to the handheld version there is almost an abyss: just to have a dimension, in the first it is possible to find as many as 117 championships, compared to 35 in the second, with everything that it also follows on the number of players present in the game, which went from 30,000 to 150,000. In terms of raw gameplay, Football Manager Classic adds a whole host of management and tactical options, which can give fans of the franchise on the go a more than compelling way to indulge their passion: footballer personalities , refined tactics and workouts and more are no longer exclusive to the PC world. Here comes 3D For those who play Football Manager on PC, the 3D graphics engine with which matches are simulated is a feature that has been acquired for some time now. In the mobile world, however, its introduction is a novelty: as in the desktop version of Football Manager 2015, you can now choose to see the current match with all 22 men on the pitch represented by polygonal models and no longer by dots 2D, engaging in dribbling, tackling and whatnot, with pretty good animations and models for the platform you're on. In addition to the aesthetic aspect, the 3D engine gives the coach the possibility of realizing more effectively the need for any instructions to be given on the fly, or to go and change the face of the team by putting his hand on tactics using the tools offered by Football Manager Classic. Speaking of the technical sector, we recommend paying particular attention to the specifications published by Sports Interactive: in fact, all the qualities inherited from the PC version of the game have their price, which translates into the need to have a fairly recent tablet. As far as the Apple world is concerned, Football Manager Classic 2015 is fully compatible only with the last two iterations of iPad Air and iPad mini, while the supported Android models are around 45. Another historically delicate point for performance are uploads, which they prove able to handle the workload quite well, even if as it used to be on the PCinitial stage of the game will take some time to define. As far as the touch interface is concerned, we are not yet at the level of quality we would expect to see: the main problems concern areas of the screen that are sometimes too small to make a selection tap, as well as dragging an element (for example when make a substitution) becomes a frustrating experience at times. We also hope for cloud save support in the future, to carry on a game by switching from PC to tablet, and vice versa.", "date": "2015-04-28", "grade": "8.0"}
