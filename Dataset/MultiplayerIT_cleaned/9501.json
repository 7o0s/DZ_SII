{"name": "Il beat'em up si traveste da MMORPG", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/83972-dungeon-fighter-online-il-beatem-up-si-traveste-da-mmorpg.html", "text": "As in Vindictus, which also emerged from the Nexxon stable, the key to this MMO is the arcade-style action integrated into a fantasy world. But if with Vindictus Nexon's efforts aim to bring beat'em ups into a three-dimensional and broader context, Dungeon Fighter Online's goal is less artificial and aims directly at bringing the classic scrolling fighting games into the world of online titles. Between spells, minotaurs and dragons, the memory can only go back to Dungeons & Dragons Shadow Over Mystara and not only for the fantasy manga look but also because already at the time, in the arcade, it was possible to specialize the character, use different skills, choose different paths and play in four cooperatively. A horizontally scrolling world The heart of the title is obviously represented by the instances, given the impossibility of the engine to articulate some typical elements of the mmorpg such as free exploration. A factor almost impossible to recreate in a two-dimensional engine and based on horizontal scrolling gameplay. They are therefore the dungeons, divided into rooms developed horizontally, which lead us to explore most of the game world. Fortunately, the instances are extremely varied both in size and in level of challenge and can be tackled both alone and with a party. Furthermore, in the dungeons we are granted a substitute for exploration through the possibility of choosing which room to explore after we have cleaned up the one we are in from monsters. Available exits light up as they become accessible, and there's also a minimap to keep players from losing their way. But Dungeon Fighter Online has nothing to envy to other MMOs in terms of NPCs, quests, mana-based skills, professions that allow you to further specialize classes, objects of all kinds, game elements to interact with and the advancement of characters that eighteenth level, through a series of quests, they can access different specializations. Then, at the forty-eighth level, the specializations reach their peak and, unfortunately for now only in the eastern version, at the sixtieth level a hero can try his hand at some epic quests to embark on the hero's career. Among other things, the presence of missions guarantees specific situations and particular objectives that enrich a gameplay that, despite being intuitive and full of special moves, is still several years old. Furthermore, the mmorpg component brings with it other advantages such as the possibility of fighting against other players and offering options such as the choice of difficulty for each single instance. Unfortunately the PVP, we say it right away, is not exceptional. The skills studied according to the monsters and the low mobility of some classes certainly do not help the combat between players which is unbalanced and boring. However, some characters are better suited to player-to-player battles, and one-on-one battles between like-minded characters make up for balance. On the teamplay side, however, the issue is even more difficult to manage. In fact, a team that has more Gunners or Slayers than the opposing team is almost always the winner. There are 5 difficulty levels, even if the Hero's Road is implemented only in the oriental version of the title. Obviously the difficulty levels allow you to face the same instance several times, increasing the longevity of the title and the experience gained by the players. To play an instance on expert difficulty you must have completed it on normal, to access the master level you need to receive a B grade rating in expert mode, while accessing the hero level even requires you to earn the grade S by completing the dungeon on expert level . A regular player can get to level 30 in 5 days but going through all the instances and reaching max level takes several weeks to play. FATIGUE POINTS To prevent general abuse of your body and the software house's servers, many Nexxon titles integrate a system marked by fatigue points. Each point, of the 156 available, is consumed for each room visited. Returning to rooms that have already been cleared of monsters does not cost effort points and if the points run out in the middle of an instance it is still possible to complete it. Once the points are exhausted, it is no longer possible to face dungeons until 6 am the following day. Two genres merging The land of Arad is full of characters who ask us to complete missions of all kinds but despite the attempt to structure the experience around the canons of the MMO, the beating heart of Dungeon Fighter Online, we repeat, is the combat. And despite the obstacle represented by the keyboard isit is immediately clear that the game system, although more complex than the classics, is able to rival the big names in the beat'em up genre. What is obviously missing is a granite balance given the too many skills in play and the possibility of being accompanied by a stronger player without particular penalties to the experience points earned. But in general Dungeon Fighter Online keeps hands and brain busy without ever getting bored and reminds us in various situations how fun it was to spend hours beating up henchmen in Final Fight, Streets of Rage, Vendetta and dozens of other titles. Obviously the monsters are many and varied and, as in the best tradition of the genre, there is no shortage of champions. Upgraded versions of base monsters that are obviously tougher and can generally use a special ability. But when it comes to monsters, the thought can only go to the end-of-level bosses who represent the cream on the cream cake in this kind of title. And luckily this ingredient is also of excellent quality. The action is in fact nothing short of tight and flows between sequences of attacks, breaths of the dragon, skills that block the players, chains from the sky, bombs and dozens of sprites as immense as the head of the Death Dragon. In short, the quality of the boss fights is of the highest level and in terms of the variety of situations, which in this case is the fundamental element, there is nothing to complain about. Furthermore, the plethora of skills and the colorful and varied graphics avoid the feeling of having fallen into a retrogaming nightmare where the game never ends. Indeed, the longer the paintings are, the more fun the game is, even if, as for Vindictus, the possibility of tackling a specific subsection of a dungeon which can be completed in a few minutes and can therefore be tackled even in spare time is appreciable. Obviously at the end of the instance, as in the best tradition of oriental two-dimensional arcades, we also find the evaluation of our performance. The votes, ranging from F to triple S, are not only functional to unlock the difficulty levels but also allow us to receive extra experience points and other bonuses. And finally, immediately after the vote, we finally move on to the division of the loot kept by the boss who has just been defeated. Obviously the final loot, as in any self-respecting MMORPG, allows us to find the best objects in relation to the instance and the difficulty we have completed. Furthermore. in a clever move given the nature of the title, Nexxon has implemented the possibility of immediately selling and repairing the objects in our possession to allow us to repeat the instance or immediately switch to another one without wasting time. Pros and cons of the two dimensions In technical terms Dungeon Figher Online is certainly not interested in impressing. But the Nexxon guys didn't just copy some sprites from the golden era of beat'em ups and re-propose the same gameplay. The cartoon style, the quality of the animations and the often witty and detailed sprites give the title a unique identity and offer a pleasant framework both to watch and to play. The screens are often crowded and there is no shortage of monsters and special abilities capable of filling the entire monitor. In short, between columns of fire and specials with dozens of shots, there is nothing to complain about, provided of course that you appreciate the two-dimensional grading. On the other hand, 2 million contemporary players in China alone, 200 million accounts, an anime and a manga give an idea of the entity of the DFO brand which, despite its relatively modest nature, is the result of a great commitment and will soon enjoy new substantial updates. It is no coincidence that the sound effects are also numerous and perfect for recreating the typical atmosphere by perfectly marrying the moves and actions of the characters. But it is in the sound sector that the only flaw is hidden. In fact, the music, while drawing inspiration from various musical genres and respecting the canons of beat'em up, lacks originality and is not very engaging. Classes and specializations Slayer - The ultimate close combat fighter is capable of dealing massive damage even if he cannot use any type of shield. The specializations are: the Blade Master who is vulnerable but inflicts increasing damage, the Berserker who offers a good balance between defense, mobility and attack and can cause prolonged damage over time, the Soul Bender who, thanks to the help of demons, can become extremely resistant and attack from afar and the Asura who wears plate armor and has all the typical skills of tanks. The forty-eighth level upgrades of these specializations are the Grand Master, Hell Bringer, Soul Reaper, and Dark Knight. Fighter - Directly dto the first Beat'em Up comes the fighter specialized in unarmed combat. Very powerful punches, good defense and extreme speed are obviously counterbalanced by the extremely small range of the attacks. The four specializations are: the Nen Master who has defensive abilities and also uses ranged attacks, the Striker who through martial arts increases the range of physical attacks, the brawler who inflicts malus such as blindness on enemies and the Grappler who can use taken by immobilizing and causing very high damage but it is also the fighter with the smallest attack range. The related subspecializations at the forty-eighth level are Blazing Flower, Champion, Hellcat, and Dervish. Gunner - The gunner resurrects old-fashioned western beat'em ups using firearms and very powerful repeater attacks. Very agile they can also use the slide to get out of the most agitated situations and are therefore extremely used in PvP. Through some quests, like the other characters, the gunner also has access to 4 specializations. The Ranger specializes in revolvers which allow for very fast attacks and allow for devastating criticals. The Launcher uses heavy weapons such as the gatling gun, flamethrower and laser rifle and can attack at incredible distances. The Mechanic, on the other hand, is completely different and focuses on the possibility of using robots, turrets and air attacks. To close we find the Spitfire which relies on special bullets, grenades, mines and other area skills. At the forty-eighth level the specializations become Desperado, Wrecking Ball, Machinist and Viper. Mage - The mage is obviously the class with the most powerful mana-based skills and equally obviously the character with the least life points. Quick in movement, it can still reduce damage thanks to the Mana Shield. The specializations are: the Elementalist who uses the elements to generate ranged attacks, create defensive barriers and teleport, the Summoner who summons creatures very useful in PvE but poorly balanced in PvP, the Battle Mage who also attacks in magically enhanced melee and moves quickly and the Witch can fly, area attack and use very powerful single target spells. At the forty-eighth their respective specializations are Archmage, Gaia, Bellatrix and Sorceress. Priest - The last class available in the western version of Dungeon Fighter Online is the healer who, inspired by some Dungons & Dragons specializations, is also a very resistant warrior. Through the specialization quests, the Priest can also access four variants. The Crusader wears plate armor and can both heal and give bonuses to his companions, as well as enhance his own combat skills. The Monk fights very quickly using oriental melee weapons and can avoid enemy attacks with some evasive moves. The Exorcist is both the slowest class and the one that can deal the highest amount of damage thanks to some very powerful combos. The Avenger, on the other hand, is not yet available, not even in Korea, but apparently he can transform into a demon, becoming very strong but decidedly slow. The three specializations at level forty-eight become Paladin, Templar, and Hyperion. Thief - The thief, available only in China, South Korea and Japan, is obviously agile and capable of causing massive damage using daggers. Currently only two specializations are available and they are the Rogue, who fights at short range and has the ability to avoid enemy attacks, and the Necromancer who can summon the undead thanks to the dark powers inherited from the dark elves. At forty-eighth level, characters can become Silver Moon and Death Bringer, respectively.", "date": "2011-01-28", "grade": "8.0"}
