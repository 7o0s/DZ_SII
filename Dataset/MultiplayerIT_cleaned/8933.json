So, let's get the matter out right away in order to move on to the more substantial issues: Arcanium is one of the new games that Netflix has made available within its video game catalog. This means that, if you are a Netflix subscriber, you can proceed with the download of the game in question without any outlay, at least as regards the mobile version, since it has also been available on PC in early access for several months now. In addition to the curiosity of dealing with a game distributed by Netflix, the question also involves an important consideration for the consistency of the game itself: it is not a simple free-to-play with microtransactions, but a real premium game, distributed through the service subscription-based, which is good news in itself. Having clarified this, it must be said that the choice of Netflix was rather prudent because the potential of Arcanium: Rise of Akhan is remarkable. It is a deck builder-style card-based RPG with some roguelite elements, which in some ways recalls the well-known Slay the Spire, which is already an excellent starting point. Set in a fantasy world verging on fairy-tale, where the sinister Umbra moon is extending its power, bringing magic and darkness with it, the game sees us put together a team of heroes made up of various anthropomorphic animals capable of fighting threats using magic derived from cards. Nothing particularly new under the sun (or the moon, better) but everything is done very well and with considerable care, even if the balancing issues, which are fundamental in a game of this type, can only be evaluated for longer term. What we can detect at the moment, rather, is a certain difficulty in playing it on mobile platforms given the interface clearly designed to work first of all on PC, which can hinder its use on smaller displays. Fate in the cards Arcanium: Rise of Akhan, a screenshot showing a card fight Arcanium: Rise of Akhan makes us choose the three characters with which to start the story, based on those we have unlocked in previous games, and one of three provinces to start from, each of which is characterized by a particular setting and narrative background, but all united by the same looming threat represented by Umbra. It is defined as ~open world~ by the developers but the definition is a bit forced: in fact it is a question of moving on a checkerboard map choosing which boxes to move to, each of which hides a different situation between encounters with fights, encounters with NPCs, merchants, treasures or various explorations. Beyond the combat, which obviously triggers the game phase with the use of the cards, all the other scenes are simply told through written text and some beautiful illustrations. It is a solution that may be a bit old-fashioned but which cannot fail to be appreciated by fans of classic ~pen and paper~ role-playing games, since it seems to recall the more traditional adventures narrated by some dungeon master around a table. The arrangement of the boxes and the corresponding events occurs randomly at the beginning of each game, which adds to the roguelite element given that, when the whole party is defeated, the game restarts from the beginning but maintaining some of the progress performed previously. A large part of the game focuses on the management of the cards, of course, which must be conquered by playing and organized in decks as powerful as possible and trying to balance them among the three party characters. During combat, the three heroes each deploy a hand of cards to be used during the turn, which are then replaced in subsequent turns, always drawing from the possibilities offered by the three decks. The checkerboard map of Arcanium At the start of the round we can already have a precise idea of the moves that the opponent, managed by the artificial intelligence, will be able to execute against the characters, which allows for the elaboration of more complex strategies with counter-moves studied in time, all keeping in mind consider the energy required for the use of each attack or defense spell. To the great variety of spells made available, which partially diversify according to the class to which the characters belong (not well defined but still broadly related to the classic ones of the gioco role), numerous variables must be added provided by the possibility of applying relics and objects, while the statistics change as the level increases. This is combined with the specific skills of each individual fighter and the ultimate ability that triggers once the reference bar is accumulated, all this to give an idea of the considerable depth in the structure. This is a game that requires you to spend time in reading the texts, between the description of the game situations and the management of cards and characters within the menus, there is a not exactly optimal adaptation to mobile platforms, probably caused by a development that has kept the PC as the main point of reference. It is an element to take into consideration, given that reading is difficult and even the response to commands can be uncertain, with an arrangement of keys and sensitive elements more suited to the mouse than to the touch screen.", "date": "2022-02-05", "grade": "7.8"}
