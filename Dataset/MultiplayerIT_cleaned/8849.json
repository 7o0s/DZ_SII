In the sense, it is clear that publishers must earn from what they produce and if this type of product has become increasingly popular on the App Store there must be a reason, in this case there must be people (many!) who use the in-game purchases, even in an exaggerated way. Do you know someone who has unlocked the complete package of weapons, upgrades and rich cotillion spending 79.99 euros? Well, you don't know him but this shady figure must exist, and he is mainly responsible for what Six-Guns, on balance, is not. Six-Guns is not a Red Dead Redemption clone in the first place. Or, better, on paper the comparison fits everything and certain mechanics are strongly inspired by the Rockstar title, it doesn't rain; but its freemium nature clips its wings and reduces it to a far less meaningful experience than it could have been. Let's first take the two maps available, Oregon and Arizona, among the largest ever seen in a product of this kind for Apple devices, to be explored on horseback but solely for the pleasure of doing so, to enjoy the panorama and the virtual wind on the face. At most to find some extra object that can make us unlock an achievement. The NPCs are in fact reduced to the bone, as are the possibilities to interact with the scenario; shortcomings mainly due to practical reasons, to the need to make the gameplay as immediate as possible, to allow us to play even for just two minutes, perhaps while we are in a waiting room waiting for our turn or if we have a little free time between one commitment and another. In short, nothing ~serious~: you locate a mission on the map but then, instead of riding to your destination, you press the button to ~teleport~ immediately to the place. The elimination of any contours of value in the name of speed has never been more questionable, and in the case of Six-Guns it has also eliminated any semblance of plot: our gunslinger is there, intent on rescuing some maidens and kill some criminals, even some zombies, but no one knows why. You feel no pain with your gaze into the sun Having highlighted the elements of ~disappointment~ relating to this latest Gameloft production, let us instead analyze what are its merits, indeed far from limited. Assumed in small doses, the Six-Guns experience turns out to be not only pleasant, but also quite varied: the forty missions available see us protect a location from the attack of a group of bad guys (or monsters), free ~princesses ~ imprisoned inside labyrinthine catacombs, storm the lair of a gang of criminals, face speed contests on horseback, tests of skill of various kinds and more. In short, quite a few things to do, and you can play for several hours without feeling any need to use the in-game purchase system: the character's vital energy recharges over time, the bullets they are given away every tot and in any case we can buy them by spending virtual money. Likewise, we're given some leeway for boosts and customizations. Developing a third person shooter for touch devices isn't easy, you have to find the right compromise between cumbersomeness and automatism, trying to prevent one of the two elements from exceeding a certain tolerance threshold. Six-Guns manages to achieve this goal in a more than discreet way, using a virtual stick on the left side of the screen for the movement of the character and a second (invisible) one on the right side to manage the view and therefore the aim. The latter is automatic by default, i.e. the reticle locks onto the closest target and at that point we can open fire, with variable results depending on the situation, the weapon equipped and our level of experience. However, the possibility of placing precision shots, completely ~manual~, remains, even if it is an operation that is advisable only from long distances. The layout of the commands and the responsiveness of the controls is excellent, even if we will inevitably end up getting a bit stuck in the most complicated situations. What about the technical sector? Beyond a non-extraordinary polygonal count, revealed by the angularity of the models, Gameloft has done an excellent job in terms of general design, animations and detail, even if the quality of the textures is fluctuating. The music is also well suited to the action. The tested version is 1.0.0 Price: Free App Store links", "date": "2011-12-20", "grade": "8.0"}
