{"name": "La fine del medioevo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/68816-anno-1404-la-fine-del-medioevo.html", "text": "Anno 1404 is a management game set during the century that marked the transition from the Middle Ages to the modern era. The last noble son of a very successful series, especially in Germany, which began many years ago, this new chapter tries to repeat its predecessors by showing off a renewed graphics engine and some tweaks in the gameplay. Starting the game you can choose between different modes, all quite classic, which include the free game and three campaigns. Basically, the game mechanics are identical in all modes, that is, you need to manage a human settlement, providing it with various infrastructures that are used to exploit the resources of the territory and ensure population growth. The goal is to make it grow by transforming a muddy slum into a rich and prosperous urban centre. The fulcrum of each settlement is the market (read the dedicated box for some historical details), around which the houses for the population are built so that they can start fishing, cutting wood and working the fields. Economic growth leads to a better standard of living for the inhabitants and the gradual transformation of peasant society into a mercantile society. Each step forward in the development of society activates new needs related to new buildings to be built. Progress is possible only by satisfying the needs expressed by the inhabitants, summarized in easy-to-use graphs. Obviously, life for the player is made complicated by various factors such as the lack of resources in certain territories, which forces you to explore the map in search of regions to colonize, or requires you to trade with advanced settlements that have the resources you need. Unfortunately, the difficulties are not only of an environmental nature and soon fires and discontent will also intervene to require drastic interventions to resolve intricate situations, especially if the construction of the city has not been properly planned and some sectors have been left uncovered for too long. Why the market? Some of you, the most curious, may have wondered why the fulcrum of the settlements present in the game is not the classic castle or fortress, if you prefer, but the market. The developers wanted to stick to history and chose to represent the realities of the mercantile municipalities, born in Italy in the 11th century and subsequently developed also in other parts of Europe, up to the affirmation of city lordships, monarchies and the birth of the nation states. Having blossomed within the feudal system, which had characterized the early Middle Ages (a period which by convention goes from 476 AD to 1066 AD), in the communes trade with the outside world assumes a primary role and is the main form of break with the system previous economic, more closed and centered around the court. The Saracens are coming! The three campaigns certainly represent the most structurally interesting mode of the game. Each of them is divided into several missions, in turn divided into small quests, usually activated by requests from allies or enemies. In reality, the three campaigns follow a single narrative thread and are part of a single large campaign that culminates in the open battle against the Saracens. Some may be disappointed by the fact that moving from one mission to the next, the efforts made in the previous one are canceled and the game always loads preset settlements, resetting any changes made by the player. So you will understand that it is useless to go too far beyond what the plot requires and take advantage of the extra resources to expand the colony. Probably a similar system was necessary to be able to create more complex missions, but we are always talking about a management system and the player is pleased to see his efforts take shape on the screen. Obviously the problem does not arise in free mode, where there is no division into missions. The weakest phases of the game are those of the clashes. There is very little fighting at first, but it soon comes time to cross swords against the Saracens. Unfortunately in these situations Anno 1404 transforms and clumsy simulacra of what should be heated battles appear on the screen. Above all naval engagements and those with more troops lack precision and any attempt at tactical planning is frustrated by the response of the troops, very ready to act in a reckless way, less to follow the indications given. The conclusion is that the only winning strategy is that of accumulation, i.e. one must aim to form immense armies to overwhelm the opponent from a numerical point of view. Nice and heavy Graphically the titleby Related Designs is the best the genre has to offer. The representation of the evolving cities is very detailed, with models of buildings and inhabitants treated in detail, as well as those of the various naval and land units. After a few hours of play, when things start to get serious, it's a pleasure to wander around the different settlements and watch the carts transporting raw materials, the citizens going to the temple or the drunks coming out of the tavern on duty. all of course with their own animations. Also from the point of view of the effects we are faced with an excellent work: the water is very realistic, especially being able to select the maximum level of detail, and there is no shortage of assorted special effects that brighten the games. A lot of technical bombast is paid for in terms of performance. At the maximum level of detail, the game struggles a lot, especially when the settlements have become real cities, with conspicuous drops in framerate that force onerous cuts to be able to continue playing decently. Unfortunately, the drops also occur if you have a higher PC than the one recommended by the system requirements (of course, if you have a twenty thousand euro PC with the built-in teleporter, you certainly won't notice them) and they are very annoying because the details must be lowered right in the situations in which the graphics engine gives its best in terms of pure visual rendering. A real pity, in short, not being able to fully enjoy the graphic beauty precisely in the situations in which it can express itself at its best.", "date": "2009-07-07", "grade": "8.0"}
