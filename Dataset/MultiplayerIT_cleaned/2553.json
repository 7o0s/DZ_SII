{"name": "Suzuki Alstare Extreme Racing", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/suzuki-alstare-extreme-racing.html", "text": "The game Initially you will ride a motorcycle that has just left the factory, a Suzuki GSX 600, complete with mirrors, lights, indicators and any other type of junk (essential among other things for homologation) that are not properly suited to racing bikes. To make a career, you have to face the various championships, nine in all, in which both the circuits and the bikes change. From the production bike we move on to the racing version (no junk this time, but only what is needed to whiz around the circuits) with a significant change in performance, sometimes even excessive. At the end of each race, consisting of three laps each, a score is assigned based on the qualification order which adds up to the score for the entire championship. You are forced to win if you want to make a career. You start as a rookie and after three championships (won) you move up to the novice class, facing three more really difficult championships riding a frighteningly fast bike, which will prove almost undriveable. Even starting your career as a novice, you will pilot a production bike fresh from the Japanese factory, but this time the displacement increases up to 750cc. With the GSX 750, you will face new particularly difficult tracks; It is useful to memorize them by first running in the ~single race~ mode (accessed from the main menu of the game) in order to learn the circuit and know exactly where to put the wheels to gain precious time once in the race. Here you also decide how many opponents to run with, from 0 to 7, but it won't be decisive for scoring purposes. If you are good enough to overcome the first six championships, the team will welcome you with open arms and finally you will have the Suzuki GSX 750R that races in the Superbike world championship at your disposal. The game The other races that await you will obviously be the most difficult and also the fastest. It becomes essential to get the bike settings right. When you start the race and you are asked to choose the bike and you also have the possibility to modify it in the main settings: power, steering, braking; you can select which of these parameters should take precedence over the others. Another feature is the presence of a ~turbo~ command (typical of arcades), whose power is displayed on the screen in the middle of the rev counter by a vertical bar, from red to yellow; at each passage to the chekpoint, its thrust capacity is increased which translates into a burning acceleration with consequent wheelie; be careful not to use it when cornering: you will inevitably bump into some walls. Once you have faced all the tests, you can still continue racing but this time you also have the possibility to choose to run in the opposite direction, always on the usual 12 tracks. And if multiplayer is your passion, you can choose between a challenge of up to 8 players via the internet or you can challenge friends by competing against each other on the same PC: the race will be displayed by dividing the screen horizontally (split screen). The controls You don't need to do much to get ready to play: the installation automatically selects the type of video card to use and prepares you for starting the game. You can change the video resolution as you like. The controls of the game are very intuitive and if you opt for the automatic gear change, which I highly recommend, you only have to choose the accelerator, the brake, the steering and the turbo. You will have the possibility to choose different shots of the on-board camera to best adapt it to your driving and playing style: ranging from the classic ~from behind~ view to the far more exciting ~asphalt height~, up to a view with the camera mounted on the upper left corner of the fairing. Run Almor, run! An extreme motorcycle race that will take you to compete with the greatest Suzuki team riders. From Pierfrancesco Chili to Stephan Chambon up to the Superbike championship races. It's not a driving simulator, but a very fun arcade that will test your ability to manage speed within a track, even if it's not a real track; in fact the circuits that you will face are obtained in roads more than common to normal traffic; it is difficult to race at 250 km/h up a snowy road and hope to emerge unscathed, but, as I said, this is not reality, it is Suzuki Alstare Extreme Racing. Race and climb your career until you are officially a Team Suzuki rider and enter the annals of motorcycling history.", "date": "2001-04-28", "grade": null}
