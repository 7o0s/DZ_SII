The announcement of a 2D scrolling fighting game had intrigued us: it's an underrepresented genre, which is only recently making a comeback thanks to the excellent performance of titles like Streets of Rage 4, but always damned fun, especially if played in company . This review of Asterix & Obelix: Slap Them All!, therefore, will explain to you why we were hugely disappointed. Comic stories Asterix & Obelix: Slap Them All!, Asterix leads the Romans The idea of beating Roman legionaries as Asterix and his inseparable friend Obelix always has something perversely fanciful about it, so it's not like an intricate plot was needed to motivate the inevitable button mashing. However, developer Mr. Nutz Studio promised a more original approach than usual: Asterix & Obelix: Slap Them All! he had to transpose the most famous comic volumes, transforming them into scrolling stages in which to beat hordes of centurions, bandits and pirates. Amazon offer Asterix & Obelix Slap Them All - Limited Edition - Limited - Playstation 4 49.99 See Offer The game published by Microids does it, but it dedicates just a few illustrations to the original comic strips between one stage and another, citing some practically decontextualized dialogue that only serves to justify the next level of play. None of these dialogues are dubbed - despite the characters of Asterix and Obelix saying a few phrases during the fights - except for the narrator who introduces the various Acts into which the main campaign is divided, which in turn are divided into various stages. So the presentation is really poor: the interlude skits introduce many characters like Panoramix, Falbal, Abraracourcix and so on, but these have just a line or two and then disappear completely. On balance, it is not clear how these stories begin and end, which often pass through game scenarios that did not even appear in the original books. Obviously this ploy serves to extend the duration of the game, which is quite long-lived on its own: there are dozens of stages, some even quite long, and if you run into a Game Over you have to start the level over again, as there are no intermediate checkpoints. it is the only game mode available at the beginning of the game: once completed, all that remains is to play the individual stages to improve one's score, perhaps by choosing a higher difficulty among the various selectable ones. The problem is that the experience is enormously repetitive, both due to the structure of the stages and the lack of variety of enemies, and due to the all too classic nature of the gameplay. How to beat the Romans Asterix & Obelix: Slap Them All!, Asterix slaps a centurion Mr. Nuntz Studio has certainly not promised an innovative or revolutionary combat system, and indeed from the beginning there has been talk of an extremely traditional scrolling fighting game, but the press release mentions ~a wide range of unique moves and combinations for each character ~ which we, honestly, did not find. Asterix and Obelix have a single combo each, which can be chained to special attacks: the latter are performed by pressing the appropriate key together with a direction, but they all look alike and do not differ so much from the two Gauls. Asterix can become a top and hit all the surrounding enemies, while Obelix can grab them and keep hitting them in different ways, but if we exclude these peculiarities, the two characters are substantially identical: it didn't seem to us that Obelix inflicts more damage, given his size , say, or that Asterix moves faster. Having said that, the problem with the gameplay is certainly not the move park, which in any case is more than discreet and guarantees a good variety, but rather the actual combat dynamics, if we can call them that. The enemies are practically all the same and within a few levels you will have seen them all: occasionally real bosses take the field at the end of the stage, but the developer recycles even those to exhaustion, which in any case do not represent who knows what threat. Often and willingly, indeed, the henchmen who accompany them are more unpleasant. The game, in fact, is really badly balanced. Any enemy attack can interrupt the animations of the two protagonists,so using the hold with Obelix is often unnecessarily risky, since the long initial animation is almost always interrupted, leaving the Rooster exposed and vulnerable. The parade, then, is almost totally useless. Like special attacks, it also consumes Lightning Bolts (a small meter located under the character's health) with each countered hit, but the animation is slow and inaccurate, so it is almost impossible to switch from a combo to a block while enemies they surround us, especially if we consider that the block only protects the front and the attacks from behind interrupt it. Asterix & Obelix: Slap Them All!, banned in the forest That said, there are enemies that attack with unpredictable animations that the player can't interrupt - such as bandit charges - often forcing the player to choose the easy solution: crowd control. Rather than knocking down enemies to papagni on the snout, it is realized that the best solution is to grab the smaller ones and throw them from one point to another on the screen to knock them all to the ground repeatedly. In certain moments, one has the sensation of cheating, but the more direct alternative is too confusing and unsatisfactory: to this is added the boredom of always facing the same opponents, thinking that it is enough to take a false step, perhaps right at the end of the stage to get back to the starting point. In this sense, the foods that are occasionally found in the barrels should be used wisely to restore the health of the worsted character.Asterix & Obelix: Slap Them All! you can play alone or in company. On Nintendo Switch, just select the co-op mode at any time and entrust a friend with a Joy-Con or other controller to continue beating the Romans together. In cooperative mode, however, the game does not change practically at all. Communication adds a little salt to the experience, especially when you have to share regenerative foods or are cornered, but the gameplay is so trivial and without flashes that not even multiplayer can lift it from mediocrity. Asterix & Obelix: Slap Them All!, collecting bags full of money increases your score The developer has slipped in a few mini-games here and there to break up the monotony, but even those are simple affairs: in most cases it's about running as fast as you can by repeatedly pressing a button to get to the finish line before an opponent, or you have to break as many barrels as possible before time runs out. Nothing particularly engaging, if we really want to be honest. And it's a real shame because Asterix & Obelix: Slap Them All! it's really nice to see. Mr. Nutz Studio has chosen completely hand-drawn 2D graphics, and the result can be seen. The internships are incredibly accurate and full of details, but in general it seems like watching a cartoon that respectfully transposes Uderzo's drawings, complete with onomatopoeias at every punch thrown. Even the sprites of the enemies denote a certain variety, and although there are few types of opponents, at least they are not limited to simple recolored sprites as happens in many other games. It is a pity, therefore, that some animations are not as fluid or harmonious as the others - those of the parade are particularly rough - and that in certain stages there are significant slowdowns if the presence of many sprites adds up to some animation too many in the background.", "date": "2021-12-01", "grade": "5.0"}
