{"name": "La saga riprende", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/156494-galactic-civilizations-iii-la-saga-riprende.html", "text": "After a crackling debut in October 2003, Stardock's workhorse was consecrated in 2006 with the second chapter, Dread Lords, and the two expansion packs Dark Avatar and Twilight of the Arnor; everything was then ~remixed~ in the Endless Universe compilation released in 2009. Despite the six years that have passed since this last incarnation, the community around GalCiv2 has continued to be lively and faithful to the brand: with such premises it was natural to expect a simple evolution of the species and, we say it right away, Galactic Civilizations III does not betray its origins. Those who have reached thirty will surely know that we are talking about the spiritual sequel to Master Of Orion, while for the younger ones it will be enough to read that Civilizations, which is not only a tribute to one of the fundamental videogame series but also and above all a commercial appeal, to immediately identify a turn-based strategy set in space. GalCiv lays its foundations on the sacred rules of the 4X: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate, i.e. the main stages in the development of one's civilization. The multiplayer, the only novelty, is snubbed: Galactic Civilizations III almost seems like an upgrade of the second one Management in every detail When starting the game you can choose whether to embark on the single player campaign or the sandbox mode, which is by far the more important one. In the first case, in fact, a series of scenarios are faced in which all the variables have already been predefined by the programmers and the player must adapt to the resources in his possession to achieve the objectives initially set. The story consists of a handful of missions starring the human race against the fearsome Drengin. It doesn't take long to understand that this is a filler, put in a bit to serve as a tutorial and a bit to increase the number of trophies to show off on the Steam bulletin board. In free mode, however, there is nothing different from Sid Meier's Civilization: you have to choose one of the eight pre-packaged races, distinguished by different bonuses and malus; it should be noted that there are two less than in the previous episode, but in any case the range of choices is sufficiently wide and the possibility of creating ad hoc ones compensates for this lack, which is moreover difficult to notice. Each reflects the traditional canons, so that the human one will be the most versatile, that of the orcs (Drengin) more focused on war, that of the robots (Iconia) will prefer technological development and so on. You must then set the fundamental parameters of the game, including the size of the map, the maximum number of opponents and the conditions of victory that can be obtained by military, cultural or diplomatic domination. Then a series of secondary options remain to be set, such as the frequency of occasional events, any shift limits and the difficulty of artificial intelligence. You start with a planet, a small military fleet and a colonist ship. The first steps move, rather than exploring, in search of new territories to populate while at the headquarters it is decided which buildings to build to increase the productivity of the planet: in this way it will be possible to speed up searches and have access to new and more powerful spaceships or other buildings. This is one of the most delicate aspects of the entire game: not wasting any resources is the only way to keep up with the other civilizations, especially in the more difficult modes. Soon you will realize that you are not the only inhabitants of the space and you will have to become familiar with the delicate diplomatic decisions involving the other players controlled by the CPU: you can make commercial alliances or favor cultural exchanges, as well as declaring war for expansionist purposes only . To expand the borders and increase the productivity of the colonies, the first thing you need to do is exploit the resources found within a solar system; there are quite a few of them and you need special units to extract them. The empire will therefore grow in size and there will be more and more planets to manage, and at this point the bizarre micromanagement system of the GalCiv3 economy begins to show its critical issues. To get the maximum yield from each colony it is necessary to personally monitor its production, with even less automated methods than those of Civilization: this tedious routine, which could be eased in the future by the introduction of governors (enthusiasts cross their fingers for the next patches), it is sometimes frustrating and not very functional. Still the editor, even more powerful As can be understood, in such a historically consolidated genre it is difficult to introduce revolutionary innovations and in fact Paul Boyer and associates have focused above all on balancing the units and on the revision of the search tree, which has been simplified and made more interesting and a little less verbose than its predecessor, even if the user interface continues not being entirely intuitive. Even in this respect, however, there are no major differences with Sid Meier's masterpiece: the four scientific macro-categories (War, Engineering, Interaction and Expansion) are in turn divided into three eras (of expansion, war and ascension) , and deciding which branches to give precedence reflects the policy with which you want to be successful. A further tactical nuance is provided by the moral inclination, which can be benevolent, evil or neutral depending on the decisions made at particular moments during the game. For example, one could decide to exterminate a newly conquered planet or, conversely, to preserve its population: these choices are then reflected in relations with the neighborhood and could lead to new trade agreements rather than unexpected wars. This latest loan from Civilization counterbalances a series of omissions (at least for the moment, even if Stardock has promised a reintroduction with future patches) regarding the political section, in which elections are missing, the possibility of adopting a certain type of government or to use spies. The artificial intelligence is both cross and delight in GalCiv3's gameplay economy: during our games we noticed that up to the normal level the computer-controlled opponents, while playing according to the rules, do not adequately exploit the resources at their disposal and often make ill-advised decisions; moreover, many races prove to be too docile and lenient even when they could easily rage on the flanks left uncovered by the player. By raising the difficulty, things become more challenging but it almost seems that the enemies have some ~facilitation~ to reach higher levels more quickly; however there is absolutely no complaints about the challenge rate provided. The battles, although theoretically avoidable, are another cornerstone of the turn-based strategy genre and consequently also of Galactic Civilizations, which has historically made it one of the strong points. First you need to decide the composition of the fleet, aware of the fact that the amount of ~space~ inside each hex is limited. Making a squadron of only cruisers, however fast, is not a very wise choice because their firepower is not adequately high; at the same time dropping the heavy hand with a few elephantine flagships may not be the trump card due to poor defenses. Once the powders have been set on fire, it is possible to decide whether to go directly to the outcome of the battle, which will be displayed after a few seconds of animation, or to watch the evolution of the spaceships in the third person. Unfortunately, however, in these three-dimensional screens the player is a passive spectator, unable in any way to intervene on the strategies of his men. In our view, it is a mode designed above all to admire one's creations on the battlefield: in fact, one of the unique features of GalCiv, namely the spaceship editor, has not only been maintained, but even enhanced. The possibility of creating your own customized vessel (or downloading it from the Steam Workshop) is one of the levers (units with the immensity of the maps that guarantee endless matches) on which Stardock relies to dramatically extend the longevity of the title. Unfortunately, also in this episode the aesthetic aspect is partly detached from the game mechanics, as four parameters count in the economy of the battles, namely sensors, thrusters, weapons and armor, regardless of the shape, however bizarre or futuristic, it is decided to give away to the spaceship. The novelty: the multiplayer The big change compared to the predecessor is given by the presence of the multiplayer mode, loudly acclaimed during the beta versions and inexplicably (but not too much) left to itself in the final one. The main problem is that it is almost impossible to find populated lobbies and, even if it is possible to involve other players, the pace of the game, slow in itself, becomes unsustainable. Moving on to the technical aspect, we need to highlight the requirement of a 64-bit operating system: the reasons are to be found in the possibility of managing truly endless maps, so much so that they cannot be managed with traditional 32-bit technology. It is di an obstacle that fortunately shouldn't be too difficult to overcome. Should one decide to venture into a battlefield of truly enormous dimensions, it is necessary to arm oneself with a hypervitaminized processor or in any case with an enormous dose of patience: in the more advanced stages of the game, in fact, when the amount of data becomes imposing, each round can also require a two or three minute wait. Graphically, the game gets along very well, although it does not boast features capable of surprising. The 2D screens (management of the planets, of the research tree, of the political relations), are made with an elegant style even if, as above, not always immediate, while the battlefield, while not presenting particular smudges, fails to be more convincing than a very classic Haegemonia, just to name one. Not even the audio sector is infamous or praised: in a title in which matches can last even days, the only thing that is required of the soundtrack is that it does not become alienating and that of GalCiv3 avoids any danger in this sense. There has been extensive discussion about the longevity of the product and the heritage of the brand confirms the validity of a project which, thanks also to the openness to modifications, has what it takes to be enjoyed for hundreds of hours; from this point of view, therefore, the approximately 50 euros requested seem justified.", "date": "2015-09-23", "grade": "7.7"}
