{"name": "Warriors Orochi - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/warriors-orochi-recensione.html", "text": "Koei is now one of the best known Japanese software houses, mostly made famous by the two very famous sagas of Samurai Warriors and Dynasty Warriors, titles that regularly appear on almost all platforms on the market with a certain following from the public all over the world. world, especially the Japanese one. However, in the West we are now accustomed to excellent and fast conversions, so that Koei titles have become ~popular~ also in our land, and boast a fair number of enthusiasts. The protagonists of ~Dynasty~ today join those of ~Samurai~ to fight the common enemy Orochi and his evil army, creating a mammoth videogame cross-over that will delight all those who appreciate the genre. Comment Samurai Orochi is yet another Hack and Slash equal to himself for too many years now. The title, which draws inspiration from the Dynasty and Samurai series, fails to innovate but proposes a worn, repetitive gameplay and, above all, simplified by the fact of being able to use three characters instead of just one. The technical realization is insufficient for a next-gen title, as is the level design, which is too similar for the entire duration of the game. Orochi is a title to consider only if you are passionate about Japanese culture, the game genre it represents, or if you have never tried to play one of these series created by Koei. For all others, we advise careful evaluation. Pros All heroes finally united Character leveling Lots of items, weapons and items Cons Poor graphics and audio Level design Too repetitive gameplay Goals 360 Like every Xbox 360 game, Orochi also offers the canonical 1000 points. In total there are 29 objectives to unlock, none of them very easy to obtain: it will take time to start having some satisfaction, from this point of view. We will see the first points to be unlocked by completing the various story-lines with each character, or at each multiple of 20 as regards the level reached. Nothing impossible, indeed, everything will come automatically as you progress through the game, but certainly don't expect to reinvigorate your gamer-score in no time. The eight-headed Dragon Orochi Warriors Orochi boasts 70 usable characters, with a tag-team mode that sees three warriors engaged at the same time who can be changed in real time at any time to take advantage of their peculiar characteristics to our advantage, depending on the situation in which we find ourselves. The setting is the same as always: the classic feudal Japan. Koei has accustomed us to the use of historical, geographical and artistic elements taken from the tradition of the Rising Sun, and the name of the game confirms it: Orochi is inspired by the legend of Yamata no Orochi, an eight-headed dragon that represents a large part of the mythology of Kusanagi No Tsurugi, roughly the equivalent of the western ~Excalibur~. Orochi is therefore a very famous demon in Japan, and it is no coincidence that he is represented in many famous manga and video games, including Okami, Naruto, King of Fighters and even Final Fantasy. This chapter mostly represents a full-bodied ~more of the same~, without distorting anything of the original structure of the series: it is therefore yet another Hack'n'Slash with RPG elements. Orochi mixes ideas taken from the two series of which he is the son, denoting characteristics sometimes similar to Samurai Warriors, others to Dynasty Warriors; the setting itself takes its cue from both the Three Kingdoms era and the Sengoku period. Moves, special shots, summons and equipment are ~copied~ from the two original series and pasted into Orochi in a remix full of elements that, although old and recycled, find in this last game a global container of everything that represents the saga of ~ Warriors~. Koei has accustomed us to the use of historical, geographical and artistic elements taken from the tradition of the Rising Sun, and the name of the game itself confirms it The eight-headed Dragon Orochi For those who have never tried a Koei title, the gameplay consists of the fights of the hero (three characters, in this case), who, placed on the battlefield, must face hordes of dozens and dozens of enemy soldiers within some areas. Once you have defeated an army and its general, you check the area and move on to the next one. During the furious battles, which will often see us absolutely alone against entire coalitions of Samurai and warriors, it is possible to collect weapons, shields, potions and objects that we can later use through a well-kept inventory management. Our protagonist thus becomes stronger and more fearsome, as he always learns new mbones, combos and attacks. As mentioned above, in Orochi we have the choice between three characters to take to the battlefield. You use one at a time and the change is made in ~real time~ by pressing an analog. The idea, interesting in itself, is made counterproductive by the fact that the game is thus much simpler and less exciting. The two characters ~on the bench~, in fact, recover their energies in a short time and so it is enough to change fighters before his death and let a fresh one in to be able to advance without too many problems. For this reason it is strongly recommended to increase the game's average difficulty before starting the main story. The Clone War has begun! The game genre that Warriors Orochi represents is an ~evergreen~, but with game mechanics that are now too used and abused: innovations over the years have been very few and in this last chapter they can be counted on one hand. Plus, they're not heavy at all. In addition to the previously mentioned possibility of being able to use a party of three warriors, in Orochi each fighter has at his disposal special personal items that only he has the power to use in battle. Furthermore, the new ~Weapon Fusion~ allows you to combine two weapons of the same kind to create a new one with greater power (very similar to what was experienced in Two Worlds). Finally, each warrior has a special ability, which can be red (power), blue (speed) or yellow (technique): by pressing the back button this is activated, producing huge damage in the melee battle. More than innovations, we therefore speak of modifications or slight additions, which do not substantially change anything in substance. In any case, the two-player cooperative mode via split-screen is present, but without the help of Xbox Live. The missions to complete in Orochi are terribly all the same, and will quickly become boring unless you find it exhilarating or extremely fun to sword your way through hundreds of enemies, in a brain-disconnected button-smashing frenzy for hours and hours. Setting and characters certainly don't help: the armies are made up of infinitely cloned polygonal models and all the same, so much so that it often almost seems to be faced with the Republican space marines of Star Wars. The protagonists are numerous and well characterized, each with its own personal story and background. They are almost all fished out of tradition, and we can mention the very famous Ishikawa Goemon, Miyamoto Musashi, Tokugawa Ieyasu, Kunoichi, Hattori Hanzo, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and the Orochi demon himself. Back to the Future: Go back in time Koei's game is very little from a purely technical-scenographic point of view. The graphics are stuck to that of the old generation, when Samurai Warriors 2 came out: the polygonal engine is the same, unchanged and very little equipped. The legacy from the old-gen is clear, and if it weren't for the greater number of characters on the screen, the doubt of being faced with a high definition Playstation 2 title would be fully legitimate. Warriors are low poly and have virtually no effects applied. The fight scene itself is bare and does not contemplate either its own shadows or dynamic lights, now a standard in this next-gen. The level design is rather bland and is monotonous already after the first level, too abused and the same for the duration of the game. Very uninspired. The same can be said of the audio sector with a soundtrack that takes up some tracks from the two main series from which it originates, rock from Samurai Warriors, and Techno from Dynasty. Sound effects suffer the same fate with sampled character voices and exclamations returning from previous installments. Warriors Orochi is available for Playstation 2 and Xbox 360. The tested version is the one for Xbox 360.", "date": "2007-10-16", "grade": null}
