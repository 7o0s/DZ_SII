Having practically dozens of games in your pocket that use a touch interface in the right way and have an adequately relaxed pace are absolute pluses for all those titles that use cards, rounds, boards, dice and pawns. In addition, the mobile business system allows developers to enter microtransactions, expansions and so on. In short, all very nice. So good that even Obsidian Entertainment has decided to enter the sector and not with a trivial thing but by exploiting the Pathfinder license, a role-playing game strongly linked to Dungeon & Dragons which boasts hundreds of fans all over the world. For the occasion, however, he did not transpose the classic pen and paper RPG on Android and iOS, but the related card game, which tries in some way to replicate clashes, adventures and character development with different mechanics. Pathfinder Adventures is an interesting mix of RPG and card game that needs to mature Paper is life The mechanics of the game are moderately complex, but clearly explained in the initial tutorial. In each adventure we will have to kill a boss and certain henchmen, looking for them in various points of the map. When we eliminate an enemy we can ~close~ an area, to prevent the boss from taking refuge inside it: the more areas we close, the more likely it will be to meet the latter in the remaining ones. Each character's life points are his or her cards, which can be used, returned to the deck, discarded, or destroyed based on various game occurrences, such as spells, traps, or damage. Combat is based on dice: to eliminate a creature we will have to do more than its life points and if necessary we can play weapons or spell cards to increase the number of dice and our chances of success. Each character has different cards and abilities, so a thief will be able to use his tools to easily open chests, while a warrior will be able to count on swords that can make fighting easier. Obviously we will be able to spend the money collected in the missions or our euros to open new decks or unlock extra adventures, in full free-to-play spirit. The whole is embellished with the original Pathfinder drawings that will surely be appreciated by those who know the game, but also by newbies. Playing Pathfinder is undoubtedly a good experience for those who love these settings and card games, the problem is that the game is infested with bugs and bad design choices. Being a game full of information, the screen is full of writing, boxes and buttons that are quite understandable on tablets, but become illegible and confused on smartphones, so much so that it is practically impossible to understand the story or the tutorials. Furthermore, for being a card game, the touch sensitivity is dramatically poor: in fact, it happens that you have to make various attempts to play or drag a card or even just to select a character to add to the party. We even had to start a mission again because we couldn't discard cards after taking damage and the game completely froze, on the contrary, it made us do everything except discard! A real shame, because the title would be very enjoyable, both in terms of presentation and mechanics and the additional adventures could be very interesting, as well as the possibility of exploring different environments and styles of play. If you only have a smartphone for the moment we advise against playing it, unless you already know the game well and can do without the instructions, however it is still a free title, at least in part, so you can always try it and wait for any error fixes.", "date": "2016-05-05", "grade": "6.5"}
