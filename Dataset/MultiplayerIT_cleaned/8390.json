Orcs Must Die too! 2, like its predecessor, is an action game full of weapons, special abilities and magical items, but it takes advantage of the strategic component to offer us a unique experience. At the base, the gameplay is decidedly eventful with various weapons to unlock, specializations for them, vials of mana and energy as well as various magical items. But it's the spring platforms, the axes hanging from the ceiling, the pools of pitch and a whole series of traps between the classic and the imaginative that decide the outcome of each game. You can not pass! Orcs Must Die! 2 does not upset anything but takes the formula of the first chapter firmly in hand to enrich it and place it in a slew of new maps. Instead, the equipment growth system is simplified, now leaner and less cumbersome. At the beginning of each level the player has a pre-established amount of money to place the first defenses and, by defeating the enemies, he gradually earns more coins to place new traps among those available at a given moment. We start with a handful of objects including pools of pitch, buckshot and dart-launching walls, but as we advance from mission to mission, the arsenal is greatly enriched, also granting us the ability, for example, to transform enemies who become chickens or creatures even more powerful than they were before, with the spell of transformation. Some defensive tools are automatically unlocked by beating levels and can be upgraded by choosing between two ~specializations~. The currency for equipment-related purchases, which includes various traps to be unlocked by paying, is represented by the skulls which constitute the game prize for completing each map. The better the performance, the more skulls you get, but sometimes it can be difficult to complete a stage without the right traps. To avoid frustrating situations, the title advises the player to face the Endless mode which allows you to obtain various bonus skulls. But it's no cakewalk with 40 increasingly challenging waves of Orcs, Hounds, Giants and Elementals. To accumulate more money and more points, the series of kills that can be ringed using traps and elements of the scenario such as overhangs or mine carts are essential. The latter can become incredibly deadly once you get the chance to place obstacles capable of driving enemies along the tracks. Strategy of an extermination When facing a map for the first time, it happens that you have to place a series of traps again due to a wave of monsters that are immune to a particular type of damage or have a peculiar ability. The title allows you to do it quickly with the old traps that can be removed by getting back all the money spent to place them. So the replanning of defenses is possible, even in the middle of the action, but it is advisable to take advantage of the breaks that the game allows us between one wave of enemies and another. In addition, each map also grants some indefinite breaks that allow you to change the equipment as well. Despite the various extra possibilities in some cases it is almost inevitable to die when facing the map for the first time, and this is often due to the lack of information on incoming enemies. But it is a mechanic that adds a pinch of strategy in the second place. Indeed, when facing the levels again to improve the score, it becomes essential to remember which and how many monsters will try to break through our defenses. As we said in Orcs Must Die! 2 there are various types of traps which also include different types of guards with specific abilities to be exploited on certain occasions. But the initial defenses, if strengthened, are among the most effective. Slowing down and throwing enemies into the air, respectively with pitch and spring traps, is in fact essential for obtaining good scores. Faster creatures, for example, escape most damage-dealing traps unless impeded in some way. And pitch is also essential to allow us to knock down monsters that cannot be thrown in the air like elementals and like the one in golden armor which, if defeated, guarantees a large monetary bonus. In any case it is necessary to know all the traps, since some of the advanced defensive tools are fundamental in certain situations. This is the case of flying creatures which, of course, are not affected by the traps installedlate on the floor and often even escape from sight. Fortunately, the title gives us a mini-map that highlights the enemies well and which represents a fundamental tool in the larger levels. Balancing and cooperative In a title like Orcs Must Die! 2 there is the risk that one of the two mechanics, i.e. action and strategy, will take over. But the guys from Robot Entertainment have done a good job of balancing and between monsters that attack from every direction and extremis rescues with shots, the action component almost always remains fundamental. The cooperative mode is undoubtedly the most important novelty and is enhanced by the fact that the orcs attack from different directions, appearing from portals often very distant from each other. The two players, the second of which uses a woman, can divide the areas of competence on the map reducing the need to run wildly from one part of the level to the other. The difficulty remains calibrated, with the money being split evenly between the two heroes, but the experience is undeniably less demanding than the single player. The plot is specious but, if nothing else, it enjoys complete localization in Italian. The two heroes, apprentices of the old warrior mage, must escape hordes of orcs by preventing them from passing through a series of portals. The goal, of course, is to save the world. The interlude scenes are relegated to static drawings, excluding some animation which to define as poor is an understatement, but on the other hand they certainly do not represent a fundamental component of the title. What matters is that Orcs Must Die! 2 offers an avalanche of maps, all carefully studied and decidedly different from each other. To this must be added the cooperative and 10 maps recovered from the first Orcs Must Die! and collected in Classic Mode. Technically it changes little compared to the previous chapter but the aesthetic rendering, in cartoon style, is still pleasant and commensurate with the price. Of course, the lack of an adequate dynamic lighting system is felt, but the modesty in terms of effects and definition allows the engine to throw up hordes of monsters while remaining light as a feather.", "date": "2012-08-02", "grade": "8.4"}
