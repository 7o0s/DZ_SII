Ask Novarama and Sony: Invizimals is a franchise that has carved out a small niche of fans over the years, but the choice to publish this new adventure for PlayStation Vita right now seemed to us to be at least unhappy, if only because - fresh fresh of our walks through Kalos - it's hard to turn a blind eye to its problems. However, the courage of the Catalan developer cannot be denied, who continues undaunted to propose and improve a somewhat bizarre idea which, however, thanks to the new Sony portable console, can better express its potential. And if you think that even Nintendo must have taken it into consideration when Invizimals made its first appearance on PSP (just think of Pokmon Radar 3D) then the matter gets even interesting... Invizimals: The Alliance has a lot of great ideas that could have been put to much better use Invizimals goes to Hollywood Invizimals: The Covenant essentially reproposes with a renewed graphic layout and some novelties the ideas that had made its predecessors for PSP quite well known, Invizimals: The Lost Tribe and Invizimals: Shadow Zone. Invizimals are real monsters of different sizes that live in a reality parallel to ours, and that once they have crossed a portal and reached our world they become, needless to say, invisible. Apparently Sony must have been aware of this matter from X-Files, because it built PlayStation Vita so that the camera could perceive its presence: a sort of scientist explains it to us in a long introductory film played by flesh-and-blood actors bones, which also acts as the incipit of the parallel adventure for PlayStation 3, Invizimals: The Vanished Kingdom. We, on the other hand, in the role of ourselves, are the new agents of this secret society that is responsible for studying, cataloging and protecting the Invizimals who have arrived in our world after theirs has been invaded by the terrible Xtractors. Mind you, the plot is a colossal stupidity, and the actors in the flesh offer it to us almost as if it were a TV commercial for the Sony console with an acting level that borders on the ridiculous, but the way it was made and the generous amount of footage is quite amazing and captivating. The real Invizimals, if anything, are really ugly and generic: mostly they are combinations of animals, dragons and other mythological creatures that wink at pop culture on several occasions, with fluctuating results. Pokmon, Skylanders and even Digimon are of a completely different caliber, from the point of view of character design, but the artistic team must be recognized for a certain flair in having modeled, animated and textured them: from a technical point of view they are without other the most convincing aspect of the game, so well done that they appear in stark contrast to the terrible polygonal backdrops in which they happen to have to fight. There are more than a hundred creatures, so there is no shortage of variety, and to find and capture them all we will have to face very special mini-games using practically every possibility of the hardware. The adventure, in fact, is essentially structured in three distinct parts, separated by short uploads, numerous videos and multiple tutorials: the initial phases therefore proceed quite slowly, and it takes some time before you find yourself free to navigate quietly among the menus and choose at will what to do, how and when. Of course, if you want to control the Invizimals, you must first capture them, and to do so you must complete the mini-games which are undoubtedly the strength of the package. PSVita trophies Invizimals: The Alliance offers about thirty Trophies, divided into eighteen bronze, five silver and six gold, which includes the inevitable platinum. To conquer them it will be necessary to complete the story, capture the various Invizimals but also win the numerous tournaments and grow the monsters. It's not particularly difficult, but it will take some patience. I thought I saw a Tigershark As with all games based on augmented reality, a spacious and bright environment is required, AR cards that can also be downloaded from the Internet and printed, a flat surface and a lot of patience: the game, from time to time, will offer us a challenge based on the Invizimal on duty, which will have to be found, for example, by following a noise of increasing intensity or by finding a certain color in the surrounding environment. The creature finally appeared - and apprezgiven the excellent implementation of augmented reality from a purely visual point of view - we will have to challenge it in a sort of minigame: there are about twenty of them and they are mainly based on the player's reaction skills. Sometimes we will have to touch the touch screen before the Invizimal completes an animation, in some cases we will have to hit the creature by touching the rear touch pad, in others we will have to play ~one, two, three... star!~ with a little monster by going around the AR cards placed on the table or on the floor. Even if the types of minigames are not many when compared to the number of creatures, the various difficulty levels make them quite interesting. At the same time, there are some moments of frustration, caused by the time limit and by the augmented reality technology itself, with the camera having to constantly frame the cards or the surface on which the Invizimal appeared and the player having to get by to keep eye contact. Once the Invizimal has been captured, it can be used in combat: this is instead the weak point of the game, and unfortunately also the predominant activity since it is necessary to make the Invizimals fight to level them up and upgrade them. The clashes do not involve augmented reality: they take place in specific polygonal arenas and the player directly controls his Invizimal, moving him with the directional cross, putting him on defense and making him attack in various ways by pressing the console buttons. The clashes, in addition to being structurally very simple, are also designed in a rather superficial way: the control system is imprecise and unresponsive, the hitbox of the creatures is completely busted and the collisions leave a lot to be desired, making the experience frustrating, boring and relatively pleasant only from a purely visual point of view. Nonetheless, in Invizimals: The Alliance you fight, fight and fight even more, both online in multiplayer and in single-player, to complete the campaign or win the various tournaments that are gradually unlocked together with the new monsters and to the new elements of the village that we can build for the Invizimals: this is the third part of the game, as well as the least important and the most boring; essentially we will be able to place various buildings in a 3D environment at will, using a combination of touch screen, rear touch pad and camera to build them on the basis of the AR cards as if we wanted to complete a puzzle. A minigame that leaves the time it finds, in short, but which in some ways offers that little bit more customization and which represents yet another excellent idea that the boys from Barcelona have not been able to implement properly.", "date": "2013-11-12", "grade": "6.0"}
