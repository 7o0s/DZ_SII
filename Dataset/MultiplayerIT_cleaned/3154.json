We had to choose three adjectives to open the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered review, we wouldn't find better ones, even eleven years after its release and with all the games that have passed before our eyes in the meantime. Therefore, the decision to re-propose what hands down can be considered one of the best chapters of the historic saga signed by Activision is not surprising: if from a shooter you expect first of all a concentration of heart-pounding action that makes the narrative sector more an appendix aimed at justifying the context, which is not an element capable of standing shoulder to shoulder with the gameplay, this particular chapter has always managed to perfectly balance both. Therefore, an acrid and very cruel cross-section of the war has always been returned to us, which perhaps finds its maximum expression in one of the most politically incorrect - and precisely for this reason - fascinating missions of the main campaign. Fascinating because, as we anticipated, it dares: you take a sensitive risk, one of those that has no historical connotation because it is delicate regardless of the period in which it is played. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has never glorified war nor does it still do today, rather presenting it for what it is: dirty, unjust, ready to drag us towards our basest instincts. Without its multiplayer counterpart for rather obvious reasons, which Activision still wanted to make clear, we are facing a chapter that then as now deserves to be discovered by the public. War never changes Narrative side, the campaign has aged very well: a handful of hours where we take part in a manhunt, that of Vladimir Makarov, and in the heroic defense of the United States from the Russian invasion thanks to the special Ranger corps. Feverish and cinematic, it bounces the player from one perspective to another with a rhythm that never loses its bite, making this long race against the clock incredibly tense and entertaining from start to finish. Without necessarily focusing on the ~No Russian~ mission, the maximum but not the only expression of the duality of war, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered reminds us how many moments of impact the original game had but above all how, in an armed conflict, there is no real winner: perhaps on paper, but when you dig deeper and examine the decisions that led to the supremacy of one of the two sides, then you realize to what extent morality is a concept relative and expendable at the altar of victory. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered is a compelling and magnetic narrative even eleven years later, one that deserves to be (re) experienced. Similarly, from a playful point of view we have an experience which, while revealing ~old gen~ aspects - a less articulated level design than the current ones and some mechanics aimed at slowing down or break the frenzy of the action - its effectiveness is not compromised. After all this time, it remains a very enjoyable game, dotted with small defects that are inevitably compared to today's standards but certainly do not invalidate the work done by Beenox. An element that could have been worked on, however, is the management of the checkpoints that save the game at less suitable moments, especially when facing almost infinite waves of enemies with the sole purpose of pushing beyond their lines - the clash in the favelas is a great example. Make up Nothing to say as regards the technical sector, which redoes the trick to present itself at its best in the eyes of the players: we have already seen it with the remaster developed by Raven Software and it is evident here too, we are not dealing with a simple update but to a real revision whose goal is to give a game capable of approaching, within the limits allowed, current standards. The result is therefore a substantial replacement of several assets (textures, polygonal models, shaders and so on) with new elements to which is added a series of features aimed at enhancing the aesthetics of the settings, making them even more realistic, and the spectacular nature of the firefights. The quality is only a step behind the work of Raven Software but justifies the sale price especially for those who have not had the opportunity to try it at the time: the almost total stability of its 60fps (at 1620p on PS4 Pro), with just slight sagging in the most agitated phases, goes with a package that we just can't help but recommend.", "date": "2020-04-03", "grade": "8.0"}
