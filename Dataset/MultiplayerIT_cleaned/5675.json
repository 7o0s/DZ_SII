{"name": "L'edizione definitiva?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/164371-gears-of-war-ultimate-edition-ledizione-definitiva.html", "text": "First step towards the unified Xbox platform that Microsoft seems to have had in mind for a while now, Gears of War: Ultimate Edition is the remake of the third person shooter from Epic Games that revolutionized the genre in 2006, offering solid gunplay like never before and a multiplayer sector that has made history. The war that devastated the planet Sera, the personal story of Marcus Fenix and the desperate attempt of his team to repel the attack of the cruel Locusts are therefore told in a renewed and spectacular guise, thanks to the use of cutscenes of excellent quality, redone from scratch, which however represent only the proverbial tip of the iceberg for a remastering work carried out with passion, attention to detail and intelligence, in which the developers enjoyed enriching the scenarios with unpublished details functional to the plot. The Xbox One version of the game had certainly convinced us in this sense, while ultimately offering an excellent but less brilliant technical sector than one might expect from a first-party production of this level, see the choice of 30 fps for the campaign in single player and some small uncertainty in performance. Absolutely nothing to say, however, on the performance of competitive multiplayer, which ran at a very solid sixty frames per second and which quickly conquered both nostalgics and novices, successfully making its debut in eSports. So what were our expectations for Gears of War: Ultimate Edition on PC? Simple: an even more advanced product, without limitations from a technical point of view but with the same, very valid contents of the Xbox edition. Were we satisfied? Gears of War: Ultimate Edition is confirmed as a remake of great value, but with fluctuating performances The single player On the structure front, as already mentioned, the Windows 10 version of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition takes up exactly what was seen on Xbox One, in this case a single player campaign enriched by the five chapters originally present only in the first PC edition, for a total duration of about ten hours. The story is playable in cooperative multiplayer mode and is supported by a side of interesting extras that are unlocked gradually, such as the Gears of War comics. The missions offer exciting firefights but also challenging bosses (such as the one, unedited, with the enormous Brumak), and have crossroads that enhance the replayability of the campaign, to be completed several times by focusing precisely on the co-op and on the difficulty levels higher to get an exhilarating challenge. Of course, the artificial intelligence of the companions and enemies has remained the same, discreet but often subject to blunders: on the one hand, an active attitude during stalking is evident, with the Locusts coming out of cover and coming towards us for a frontal attack ; on the other hand it often happens that they do not notice our presence when we go around them and approach them, giving life to at least bizarre situations. The very solid gunplay decisively enhances an arsenal full of personality, thanks in particular to the limited quantities of ammunition available for each single weapon, which lead to often changing the equipment we use in battle and, therefore, to discovering the advantages of alternative tools. The multiplayer The nineteen maps of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition ensure a great variety and different strategic approaches in competitive multiplayer, which in many ways represents the fulcrum of this production. As happened for the campaign scenarios, the locations have remained consistent with their respective original versions, however introducing substantial changes to the polygonal structures and, obviously, to the textures. The feeling of historical stages such as Traffic Jam, Mausoleum or Canali has remained unchanged, the positions to be conquered to have more chances of winning are the same, as well as the location of the most powerful weapons (Boomshock, Hammer of Dawn, Arco Torque, etc. ) and grenades. For the nostalgic it is therefore a bit like going home, with the big difference of the 60 frames per second, which change the cards on the table and give us an experience that has never been so fluid and reactive. On the mode front, everything possible has been done to combine numbers and popularity, with a total of nine variants that include Team Deathmatch, King of the Hill and War Zone, but also more ~restricted~ modes, such as Gnasher Execution for four participants. In terms of unlockable items, the seventeen characters from Gears of War 3 stand out. The selector that allows you to set the geographical area for matchmaking is also present on PC, so as to take advantage of servers with lower latency, but unfortunately it is missingppo an element that would certainly have increased the value of this production, namely a cross-platform feature to ensure that Windows users could challenge Xbox users and vice versa. The servers have only been open for a few minutes: while we have few doubts about the quality of the online experience, given its central role in the product framework, we will update the article to confirm that everything is working properly. Multiplayer - update As promised, here we are to take stock of the functionality of the multiplayer sector of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition for PC a few days after its launch. The contents, as mentioned, are the same as the Xbox One edition, which we have been able to try for quite some time; we also confirm the lack of cross-platform, a feature that in our opinion, with a view to a unified Windows platform, should have been one of the developers' priorities. Unfortunately, the Microsoft infrastructure leaves much to be desired, with some glaring shortcomings and various problems afflicting the Windows Store, in particular as regards the download and updating of the application. During online matches, you also pay for the lack of technical optimization already reported for the single player, with clicks that force you to lower the graphic parameters in order to be able to count on the fluidity necessary to obtain a certain precision during movements and attacks. Not the show of force that we expected from DirectX 12, in short. Fortunately, we are talking about aspects that will certainly be fixed with the next updates, and which hinge on a solid and efficient framework, with fast matchmaking (but be careful to get an open NAT), many online users and games capable to engage and entertain just like on Xbox One. The PC version Beyond what has been said about the excellent gameplay and the rich structure of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, which we already know and which we have appreciated over the course of these months on Xbox One, it is clear that for the PC version the discourse relating to the sector technical is central. In fact, we are faced with a title that on paper uses DirectX 12, which can go up to 4K resolution, has no limitations in terms of frame rate (one can freely decide whether or not to block the fps at 30) and therefore should being able to shut the mouth of those (yours truly first) who had pointed out some opacity in the console version. Well, so far we have often talked about the new Microsoft libraries for their contribution in terms of performance, flaunting benchmarks with incredible results compared to DirectX 11. Unfortunately we have not had the opportunity to appreciate such wonder, experimenting instead with a frame rate that in the open field often becomes dancer (although the situation improves with dedicated NVIDIA drivers), all on a system capable of running Dying Light: The Following at 60 frames per second, Rise of the Tomb Raider with respectable performance (net of some trick) but above all Batman: Arkham Knight (obviously the reference is to the current version of the game) at 1080p and sixty frames per second with all the settings at maximum. We have not mentioned the Rocksteady title by chance, since it uses the same graphics engine as Gears of War. The leak regarding the Ultimate Edition system requirements had us worried, they were too high despite the great work done on the assets, but the reality is precisely that of a game that needed better optimization. The FRAPS counter and the NVIDIA one are blocked by the software and it was therefore not possible for us to verify the extent of the uncertainties, but in the most agitated situations they are quite evident, especially if the texture quality setting is set to ~very high~. which is probably the value designed for those who play 4K, given that we are talking about 20 GB of textures that the engine has to manage. Setting the textures to ~high~ and the shadows to ~low~ improves the situation, but there are no advanced anti-aliasing settings (there is only FXAA, for the moment) and there seem to be many effects in the game configuration file deactivated at the start, perhaps precisely to avoid disappointing performances on machines which, in theory, should be able to run this title without problems. Let us also try to be clear here: the visual rendering of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition on PC is excellent, the textures are sharp and some effects have been further improved compared to the Xbox One version, but in terms of performance we expected more, considering the use of DirectX 12 and the hardware used for the tests.", "date": "2016-03-01", "grade": "8.0"}
