It is also useless to illustrate how, for the umpteenth time, the French house is continuing to support the game in a substantial and satisfactory way, making changes and balances and adding new operators from time to time. However, it is fair to underline how Ubisoft was actually one of the first houses, well before Epic and its Fortnite in short, to study a continuous growth plan, something that kept players glued to the servers and went far beyond the simple recurring DLC to payment, reminding you that it is possible to get every single operator with the in-game currency without opening the wallet further. It has been a watershed, has created a winning model and has been followed by many other titles in the last two years with a future that seems to increasingly align with this choice. Today we return to Rainbow Six: Siege again to review Operation Wind Bastion, the new and final season of the third year of content that brings two soldiers and an unpublished map as a gift right under Christmas. Kaid and Nomad reporting Kaid and Nomad are not two complex operators to play and do not require particular strategies to be used properly. Not as much as Finka and Lion at least, where communication with the team was one of the key elements to make the most of their skills correctly. Kaid is the most immediate specialist to use, he is the one with the simplest mechanics to absorb but this absolutely does not mean that the Moroccan soldier is to be underestimated or is of dubious use, far from it. What is really frightening is its basic equipment with the Rtila which allow you to electrify any metallic element in their reduced range. You can electrify reinforced walls, shields and barbed wire, even all at the same time if you manage to place the gadget on a wall. One of Kaid's biggest advantages is the ability to throw this tool, thus being able to apply it also to ceilings and less visible areas, making it a less easy target for enemy shots. Before activating, however, the gadget needs time and that is why its use must be well planned during the preparation phase and cannot be thrown at random in the middle of a firefight, but the uses are many and all interesting . IQ, Thatcher and Twitch obviously remain formidable opponents, thanks to their ability to know in advance the position of the Rtila and deactivate them without too many problems. If you want to throw Kaid into the fray you can easily take advantage of his three armor points and the TCSG12, a devastating shotgun even at medium range thanks to the supplied ACOG sight. Nomad, on the other hand, requires you to learn more about the maps, the waypoints and to know when to launch into firefights and when to use your gadget to make a difference. The Airjab is basically a mine capable of throwing opponents to the ground, passing through walls, shields and covers. We loved being able to take advantage of the imagination and inventiveness to get the most out of the new gadget since by placing it on the roofs or near the balconies it will be possible to make your opponents fly, killing them instantly, or seriously damaging them. The rush is also very useful for gaining a few seconds and ending them with a couple of bursts of Ak74 while they are on the ground or pushing them towards electrified walls or other traps. The possibility then of using the gadget from a distance (the mines are in fact fired directly from the side of your rifle) allows you to operate in discreet tranquility perhaps taking advantage of the corners and long corridors of the new map, or even placing traps on a floor while you patrol the upper one. Nomad seems to be the perfect counter for Clash so given that the explosion will destabilize enemies even with shields drawn and for now only Jager with his Active Defense System seems to be a valid and immediate counter. The real trump card for both operators, however, is the new semi-automatic .44 Magnum equipped with an optical sight: a pocket sniper rifle capable of killing with a single well-placed headshot even from base to spawn point. It is a fast, precise and rapid weapon, perhaps too effective and which perhaps should be reviewed and weakened for a better balance. A two point operator of speed and armor that will easily become a favorite of many players. Many more additions for the last season He also thinks about enriching the packagea new map, very particular since it exploits both verticality, offering a safe entry point from the roof with few tools for defense, and the enormous horizontal extension. Destructibility returns overbearingly as a key element of the game and it will not be complex to see the dozens of destructible walls reduced to pieces, to the point of being able to create a truly surprising amount of shooting lines. After playing several games on it, we can safely say that the ground floor seems to be potentially the most difficult to attack, since it has fewer entrances and, above all, easier to control and dress up to the nines. For the attackers, therefore, taking the game home will generally be more difficult, especially if the defending team opts for Valkyrie and Maestro so as to have visibility on the few uncovered points but above all if they take operators capable of placing traps like Kaid himself, the always dangerous Lesion or Bandit. Small changes also affect the aesthetic aspect of Rainbow Six: Siege with visual improvements in the skin selection menus, with the usual additional seasonal camo, and in particular to the new reflex sights. A three hundred and sixty-degree job as usual to improve a title that does not seem to want to stop in terms of growth and quality.", "date": "2018-12-13", "grade": "8.0"}
