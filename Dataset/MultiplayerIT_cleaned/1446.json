{"name": "Star Wars Jedi Knight : Jedi Academy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-wars-jedi-knight-jedi-academy-3.html", "text": "The sides of the force The main single player mode has 25 missions, some of these can be tackled in a non-linear way, after the first series of training levels the player can choose to progress in the game by alternating fundamental missions with other satellites, whose usefulness is to increase your character's ability in the various Jedi arts and, of course, the inevitable choice between the Dark or Light Side of the Force! During the training levels, Jedi Academy is very easy, veterans will complete this portion of the game in a short time and without difficulty, while newcomers will be able to familiarize themselves with the controls and capabilities of their future Jedi Knight. The difficulty gradually rises with the subsequent missions, but, while reaching a fair level of difficulty and a good general balance, even in the advanced missions there are some small problems in the AI of the enemies, which are certainly not as lethal as in the past. The design in the maps and missions is extremely varied, not only is there an alternation between outdoor and indoor environments, but numerous historical Star Wars settings have also been implemented, such as Tatooine or the (abandoned) rebel base on Hoth. You will have to fight between industrial plants and wastelands and this difference is certainly pleasant for the player, who can feel the transfer from planet to planet. As previously mentioned, the lightsaber is available from the first level, Raven Software (Vicarious Vision is the team responsible for the Xbox conversion) has however inserted various degrees of specialization in the use of this weapon. During training in the academy it will be possible to choose whether to continue using one sword, use a second one in the other hand, or learn to fight with the double-bladed sword that became famous as Darth Maul's weapon in Episode 1. In case you choose to using two swords at the same time, or the double-bladed one, it will be possible to use only a fighting style defined as ~medium~, i.e. the generic one, but you will have other advantages, such as that of throwing (and then returning, thanks to the powers of the Force ) one of the two swords, or have particular combos using Darth Maul's weapon. On the contrary, those who choose to wield the classic lightsaber will also be able to learn two other fighting styles: the ~fast~ one with a short range of action, but very useful in movement, and the ~strong~ one, which using two hands and slower movements, provides increased power on shots that become difficult to block. This choice then becomes fundamental in battles via Live, where each technique has its weaknesses, and having experience in all ways of fighting can become decisive in defeating Jedi opponents. In Jedi Academy you will be able to choose the skills and powers deriving from the force and as in the best Jedi tradition it will be possible to have a ~general~ preparation in all powers, or choose some and specialize in the three levels available for each skill to obtain more effective results . The game in story mode will last about 15 hours, the control of the character, otherwise well done, follows the one used in Jedi Outcast, with the management of the camera and the movements entrusted to the analog sticks, the two triggers used for primary and secondary attack , the various customizable buttons for other functions such as jumping or activating the lightsaber, and the Dpad that scrolls between the various force powers and the inventory. During the evolution of the story you will be able to meet various characters from the Star Wars universe, from the aforementioned Kyle Katarn, who became your teacher, to Luke Skywalker or Chewbacca, the most famous Wookie ever, up to others that I cannot mention without ruin the plot. The veterans of the saga will notice that in this episode Raven wanted to change course by transforming Jedi Academy into a title based heavily on the clash using lightsabers and force powers, pushing on the third person view, which is certainly the most used during the game. The decision to abandon Kyle as a hero loses some of the charm of the Jedi Knight, but every generation has its ~Hero~ and the Jedi master must leave room for the new recruits. Clash of the Jedi online ... Jedi Academy is not only a single player game, but as for the PC version, there are numerous multiplayer modes on the Xbox too. In addition to the classic split screen and System Link, full support for Xbox Live has been introduced. Once connected to the network, there are several options for customizing matches and numerous fashionsity, in addition to the conventional deathmatches, both for single players and in teams, and Capture the Flag, three other types of combat can also be selected: Duel, which consists of a one-on-one duel with lightsabers, with the contenders compete in an arena, the winner will face off against new opponents (if any) until eliminated or time runs out. Whoever scores the most points during the matches will be the winner. Siege, or the siege mode, in which the Jedi will be divided into attack and defense teams, whoever conquers the opposing stronghold wins the game. The peculiarity of this mode is that the game gives the various players different classes and different powers based on the chosen setting, making cooperation and a good balance of characteristics and powers essential in each team. The last possibility is the Power Duel, perhaps the most fascinating battle, during which you can recreate the most exciting battles between Jedi in the game. It is fought in a two-on-one dry battle, in which the outnumbered player will have enhanced strength, health and skills compared to the opponents, recreating the typical feeling of aspiring jedi in the presence of the strongest elders, in an attitude of fearful respect. In matches on Xbox Live, the frame rate problem, rather dancer, which affects the single player mode, does not occur except on very rare occasions, with a high number of players present on the screen. This is a decidedly positive fact, perhaps due to a better optimization of the arenas available in multiplayer, which helps to guarantee an excellent Live experience. Note the presence of Bots, which allow a player to train and explore the various levels even without necessarily being connected to the internet. When testing the game on Xbox Live, we rarely encountered any lag issues, never in Duel modes; the code is well structured and makes good use of fast connections. The only comment that can be made concerns the number of levels available for the ~siege~, but probably during the next few months, thanks to the download of content, this small gap will be filled. Clash of the Jedi online ... Graphics The graphic aspect is certainly not the strong point of the game, the engine used is still based on the technology of Quake III. Raven has improved it in several fields, probably reaching its limits, given that the engine is still inadequate for a late 2003 Xbox title. The poly count is always quite low, the textures certainly don't represent the state of the art and the graphic effects , featuring the powers of the force, or certain weather conditions, are not enough to get the entire department promoted. It should also be noted that there are numerous drops in the frame rate. A separate note should be made to the programmers for the creation of the animations during the fights with the lightsabers: these are excellently made and moves, combos, parries and various evolutions are worthy of the epic fights admired in cinemas all over the world. Sound Totally different speech as regards the care of sound. Jedi Academy does not betray in this respect, taking advantage of the music of John Williams combined with a good realization of all the sound effects and in the dubbing of the voices. The result is guaranteed, especially if you have a Dolby Digital 5.1 system Clash of the Jedi online ... Comment Jedi Academy is a decent title, where unfortunately the single player mode is certainly not at the levels of the first episodes of the series, given the programmers' choice to focus on the fights between other human opponents via Xbox Live. The poor performance of the graphic engine also decisively affects the final vote, which does not really do justice to the title, due to the numerous slowdowns that break the rhythm of the action. Old fans of the saga, looking for a new exciting offline saga, will be a little disappointed with this new chapter. On the other hand, Xbox Live users who want another game to add to their challenges between friends will find bread for their teeth in Jedi Academy. Pros: Star Wars is immortal Exciting power duels Live support Cons: Unstable frame rate Graphically not great No longer using Kyle Star Wars Jedi Knight is a particularly evocative title for every gamer in the PC world, a saga that began in 1995 with the first ~Doom clone~ set in the Star Wars universe, namely Dark Forces. Over the years, programmers have changed the structure of the game away from the classic fps, mixing first and third person views in a very successful way. These changes have accompanied the adventures of Kyle Katarn until today, in Star Wars Jedi Knight III: Jedi Academy, in fact, we will no longer be able to impersonate the now famous Jedi knight, the circle closes and while Kyle has become an instructor equal to Luke Skywalker, we will have to start from scratch and start with a new pupil. This choice, dictated by the level reached by Kyle in Jedi Outcast, was probably inevitable and, with the loss of the charismatic Jedi knight, this chapter introduces some new features starting from the creation of the character, now totally customizable in physical appearance, race, up to the choice of the lightsaber. It is not a mistake, unlike the previous episodes, our virtual counterpart will not have to conquer the possibility of using the Jedi weapon par excellence with various tests, but will start the game with his own basic sword.", "date": "2003-12-18", "grade": null}
