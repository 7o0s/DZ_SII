The series created by tri-Ace, a company born from a rib of Namco and the team that developed Tales of Phantasia back in 1996, has always encountered some difficulties in establishing itself on the market and the latest chapter, Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness , rather than revitalizing the brand, it has practically destroyed it. It's surprising that Square Enix has decided to remaster The Last Hope, but perhaps it's a last-ditch effort to convince audiences that the series can still say something. Playstation 4 trophies Star Ocean: The Last Hope Full 4K & HD Remaster offers 47 Trophies of which 1 Platinum, 2 Gold, 14 Silver and 30 Bronze. The Platinum Trophy can be obtained by conquering the other 46 Trophies, which in some cases require the simple overcoming of some stages of the game or the execution of particular actions in battle. Other Trophies require, for example, the completion of the adventure on various difficulty levels, the vision of all the optional endings or the destruction of specific enemies. Space, first frontier After the third Star Ocean, at a certain point the series thought well of abandoning precise numbering and relying only on subtitles so as not to confuse potential players: in fact, it is not necessary to have played the previous Star Oceans to understand the story of The Last Hope also because, in fact, The Last Hope is the prequel to the whole saga and only veterans who have played them all will recognize the tiny connections with the other episodes. For everyone else, The Last Hope is ~simply~ the odyssey of Edge Maverick and his childhood friend Reimi Saionji, young members of the Special Reconaissance Force tasked with searching for a new habitable planet now that Earth is on the brink of destruction. collapse. However, our heroes come across a cosmic threat that will force them to travel far and wide, assembling a diverse team of extraterrestrial adventurers determined to help them for more or less personal reasons. The story mixes fantasy and sci-fi elements in an epic adventure that begins slowly to mesh as the hours go by: Star Ocean is one of the few Japanese series that pushes a lot on the science fiction factor and The Last Hope, in this sense, is one of the its most successful titles as it tackles some interesting and original themes. The problem is that he does it through well-characterized characters, but who fall into the typical stereotypes of Japanese animation: the insecure protagonist who grows up during the adventure, the friend who is secretly in love, the funny little girl, the estranged cyborg and so on. All in all, the cast turns out to be quite pleasant and often interacts throughout the story, but some passages still appear rather forced and too melodramatic today also due to an unsatisfactory English dubbing: much better, in this sense, to set the original track Japanese. This Full 4K & HD Remaster version is in fact based on the International version released for PlayStation 3 in 2010, therefore it also allows you to change the menu and the illustrations that represent the characters in an anime style, as well as proposing a whole series of balances in terms of gameplay which many players, at this point, will not even grasp, but which we appreciated quite a bit at the time. If the plot of Star Ocean: The Last Hope may appear hyperbolic and cloying, punctuated through numerous exaggeratedly verbose kinematics, it is more difficult to criticize the combat system which, after an unexciting start, opens up to many possibilities and becomes one of the most technical and interesting of recent years. The clashes take place in arenas following a fully action setting, but the player must learn to control the right characters and chain skills, attacks and dodges to overwhelm the enemies. It's a real shame that the excellent combat system puts the frustrating exploration phases in a bad light, also due to an archaic structure that forces the player to save in specific points, often very distant from each other. In these moments, The Last Hope feels the full weight of its years on the gameplay front, while on the technical side this Full 4K & HD Remaster version lives up to the high-sounding subtitle thanks above all to a multitude of graphic options that allow you to customize the experience depending on the configuration possessed: it is therefore possible to choose the resolution, the quality of the textures and various typesmultiple anti-aliasing filters, just like you would in a PC game. We tested The Last Hope on PlayStation 4 Pro and we must admit that the game literally has a completely different aspect, especially setting each parameter to the maximum, and nothing to envy to the titles released in recent years on the Sony console, even if in certain moments the game it struggles conspicuously in terms of frame rate, especially if too many special effects explode on the screen at the same time.", "date": "2017-12-08", "grade": "7.0"}
