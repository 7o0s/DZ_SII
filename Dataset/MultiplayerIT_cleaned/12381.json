{"name": "Enchanted Arms - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/enchanted-arms-recensione-2.html", "text": "In Enchanted Arms we will play as Atsuma, an apprentice enchanter who finds himself involved with his friends in an adventure that is much bigger than him. A plot that is divided into about forty hours of play, going through various twists and turns, and which in general does not upset the typical jrpg canons, based on some ~universal~ values such as friendship, sacrifice and love . After all, saving the world from mad machines won't be easy, thank goodness friends exist. We will command a party formed by elements with peculiar characteristics, a mention of merit, if only for the originality and breadth of vision, must be made to the developers who have inserted a homosexual character like Makoto, moreover decidedly stereotyped in every aspect , and which plays an important role throughout the adventure, also giving several moments of pure hilarity. The story itself as mentioned is not particularly innovative, certainly not evil, leading us to explore the various areas of the planet, meeting places and villages that will always mean something to the members of our group, leading them to reveal something about their past and obviously doing proceed the plot in that direction. The entire game revolves around golems, artificial minions whose origins are lost in past ages In the world of Enchanted Arms we will come into contact with golems, a kind of artificial humanoid servants created during the war that raged on the planet a thousand years earlier. We will be able to exploit them in combat and often new creatures will be the reward for passing the dungeons encountered on our path. Collecting the largest number of golems is certainly one of the main objectives of the whole game, their characterization is very good, we go from a semi-cartoony look for some of them to a purely dark and very gloomy look for others. Each of these enchanted creatures has a unique set of skills, which is why the choice before each battle will be essential. Meeting and defeating the creatures is certainly satisfying, let's say that the real and only flaw is that the golems do not develop together with the progress of the character, and therefore it is obvious that the ones we will meet towards the end of the game will be decidedly stronger than those used in the first hours of our journey. In the passage on PlayStation 3, thirty unreleased ones are also available, which add to the hundred already present in the original version. Anyone who has played a Japanese role-playing game knows what to expect. Exploration, moreover limited in the case of Enchanted Arms only to the places to which we have already gained access through the events of the storyline, turn-based combat, character development and obviously a solid plot. We have already said about this and more it is better not to reveal, as far as the fights are concerned, we do not deviate much from tradition. Encounters with opponents occur randomly, it is not possible to avoid them, and unfortunately their frequency is quite high. Each fight will immerse us in a sort of arena, characterized by a grid on which, like a kind of chess game, we will move our characters. Each of our warriors has their own ~attributes~ which refer to elemental forces such as earth, wind, water, fire, light and darkness. In clashes, using characters with opposing elements such as water against fire will be essential to inflict as much damage as possible on the opponents. All the statistics on the members of our party are the classic RPG ones, the VP vitality points, the HP wound points, the EP ether points and then the indicators that help us understand when it is possible to use particularly effective attacks, carried out in combination or through skills extra. On the grid, we will be able to move all the members in turn and choose whether to have them fight hand-to-hand or at a distance, depending on their respective abilities. To counter the too numerous amount of random encounters with enemies, the developers have inserted two very useful commands, namely the auto battle, thanks to which we will see our characters fight alone without our intervention, and the fast forward which allows us to advance the time between one action and another in the fight faster. The difficulty of the clashes seemed quite balanced to us; at the beginning the fights are almost impossible to lose, as the adventure gets underway instead the difficulty will also increase even if, let us tell you, without ever reaching too high levels of challenge. The latter never becomes very high also because at the end of each battle the HP and EP points will be recharged automatically and also, not a small possibility, it is cIt is allowed to save at any moment of the game, without necessarily reaching pre-established areas. Technically, the From Software product appears to have ups and downs, with the first especially for the polygonal models of the characters, including golems, which are excellently cared for in every phase of the game. The scenes that take place during the dialogues are very cinematic, during which the two characters facing the discussion are presented in the foreground, highlighting the great quality of the details, leaving the area in which the meeting takes place as the background. During the fights, the animations of the attacks stand out a lot, even the particle effects during these scenes and in particular during the EX attacks, the variant foreseen in Enchanted Arms of the best known ~summon~. The environments are taken care of, especially at the beginning of the game, losing some detail as the settings go by. However, the difference in care that exists between the objects and buildings present in the reachable areas and those more in the distance catches the eye. Inexplicably you can then find strange textures in low resolution, which really stand out on HD screens, and some uncertainty mostly in Atsuma's animations. The real lack of Enchanted is that it doesn't have an Italian translation, not even as regards the subtitles, thus limiting its usability only to those who know a minimum of English. The dialogues are in fact completely in the Albion language while it is also possible to hear the original Japanese audio, much better than the western adaptation. A lack of the PS3 version, compared to the other additions, is the online mode, which allowed you to challenge other people with the monsters in your possession. Comment Enchanted Arms should be taken for what it is, a decent product that fills a temporary gap in the PlayStation 3 lineup. In fact, Oblivion, despite being a great title, is another way of understanding role-playing games and J-lovers. Rpg did not have what to devote themselves to. From Software's game does not upset the genre, on the contrary it remains too much in the canons of tradition, however presenting an interesting story and a good combat system. If you are eager to be able to play the first J-RPG in high definition, Enchanted Arms could be for you. Pros: Interesting story Good combat system Attention to detail Cons: Lack of Italian translation Random encounters too frequent Technically high and low The development of a game belonging to the J-RPG genre is certainly among the longest that can take place in the videogame field, either for the large amount of dialogues that characterize them, or for the great variety of settings and levels. To see a good number of them on next gen consoles we will have to wait several more months, in the meantime Enchanted Arms also arrives on PlayStation 3, the first exponent of the genre that appeared several months ago on Xbox 360.", "date": "2007-04-05", "grade": null}
