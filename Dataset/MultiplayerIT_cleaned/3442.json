{"name": "Call of Cthulhu", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/call-of-cthulhu-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "Our review of Call of Cthulhu for Nintendo Switch arrives with an almost annual punctuality: last October 30, 2019, in fact, we had proposed a similar overall evaluation of Cyanide's work, but for PlayStation 4. It therefore took a long time for the development team to prepare the port for the Nintendo hybrid console: this is not a problem at all, if the effort is justified by at least discrete results. Fans of Lovecraft's work, in fact, we imagine that they would gladly buy Call of Cthulhu a second time to carry it around at sea, in the mountains and on the tram: Lovecraft goes well with everything. And for once you can breathe a sigh of relief: the conversion of the game is not a mammoth and perfect job, but it does its job. It's not a given these days. The conversion for Nintendo Switch We have completed the adventure of Call of Cthulhu and its protagonist Edward Pierce a second time, so as to be able to have a fairly precise overall idea of the quality of the conversion for Nintendo Switch. The porting of the Cyanide title is of good quality, not exceptional since a conversion job would have been the most suitable to smooth out some defects already present at the time on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC (interpenetrations, small glitches, minimal imperfections of various kinds). Instead of focusing on improvement, the team decided to insist on maintaining what was offered last year. We don't feel like complaining, given that too often in recent years we see video games arriving on Nintendo Switch that were previously perfectly enjoyable in disastrous conditions, unwitting victims of hasty and poorly cared for work. Call of Cthulhu then had a better fate. In TV Mode the atmosphere of the original production is perfectly maintained, net of some backdrops that are sometimes not very clear and some details that would have required more refinement. Nothing too traumatic: similar defects, we said, were also present on the current generation consoles. So consider Call of Cthulhu on Nintendo Switch the same game already played elsewhere, with the same content and more or less the same overall quality. The real sacrifices rather concern the graphic detail, lower than the other counterparts on the market, and the frame rate. Again, there's never really anything really problematic to report. For example, eternal loading before each new setting also plagued Call of Cthulhu on PlayStation 4 Pro. Even in Portable Mode (tabletop) Call of Cthulhu is enjoyable and almost always solid, net of some slowdowns in the most agitated phases (leaks, the few fights present, with many elements on the screen, etc ...). Fortunately for most of the time the player explores the environment calmly and dialogues with the other characters present, so the frame rate drops only occasionally bother him again. Even on this occasion, however, we had the impression that the reviewed title gives its best in portable mode, confirming that in all probability the beginning of each conversion operation starts on the console outside the dock and ends with the console inside the dock. With hindsight and the arrival of the Nintendo Switch Lite, it doesn't seem like a meaningless schedule to us. Storyline and gameplay From the point of view of content, Call of Cthulhu on Nintendo Switch is the exact same title of which we offered you the review last October 2018; let's spend a few words to remember the start of the plot. The protagonist, Edward Pierce, is a private detective with a mission as delicate as it is dangerous (even if it doesn't initially seem so): to investigate the death of all the members of a small family unit residing in Darkwater. And it is precisely in this small and asphyxiated whale fishing village that events immediately take a surreal turn, reconnecting to the well-known cycles of cosmic horrors by Howard Phillips Lovecraft, the Providence writer. Specifically, Cyanide's narrative refers to the myths of Cthulhu, the great sleeping deity buried in the seas of our planet. The narration and the atmosphere represent the cornerstones of the production, which without them would hardly be sufficient. Some good ideas also come from the gameplay, which however never really manages to shine. In its essence as an investigative RPG, Call of Cthulh pushes the player to explore ever new game environments, collect clues, get his own idea about the events that occurred, and above all dialogue with the other NPCs present (not always benevolent). Dialog lines provide optionsmultiple games with different outcomes, just as the expected endings are different: however, apart from some important decisions to be made after a good half of the main narrative, Call of Cthulhu appears (and is) almost always very guided by the developers themselves. Edward's freedom is therefore apparent and limited, and is resolved above all in the collection of collectibles and in the detailed analysis of the entire game world, full of secrets, curiosities, ideas, including literary ones, and revelations. The artistic direction, this must be said, remains inspired for almost all of the adventure, apart from some small trivialization of the original themes.", "date": "2019-10-09", "grade": "7.5"}
