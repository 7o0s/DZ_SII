{"name": "Moto GP", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/moto-gp_a.html", "text": "Goodbye legendary Super Hang-On After years of dedication by the software houses to the four-wheel category (whether they are single-seaters, rally cars or grand tourers), Namco wanted to play the motorcycle simulation card, and in the end it did well, seeing that Moto GP undoubtedly deserves the first place on the podium as far as this genre is concerned, dethroning the very old but never forgotten Super Hang-On. Absolutely the first feature that catches the eye of this game is the graphics, absolutely beautiful and full of details. The Pal version is almost identical to the Japanese Ntsc version and, while not boasting the 50/60 hertz option, at the moment inexplicably exploited only by minor houses, at least it does not suffer from the oppressive black bands from which the European version of RR5 suffered, and maintains still an excellent frame rate. In fact, it is detached from the slightest slowdown even in the busiest phases of the race (such as the start) giving us a sensation of chilling speed, cleverly reinforced by the progressive shaking of the bike as the tachometer value increases, by the total absence of pop-ups, and by the realistic depth of the field of view. The polygonal modeling reaches its peak in the representation of centaurs and motorcycles. Although a careful look at the latter reveals a few too many edges, they still appear sufficiently detailed to be solid and credible (just look at the shifting of the suspension load during braking and acceleration to get an idea). There are twelve models available right from the start and they belong to the 500 class; we will therefore find the various Yamaha, Aprilia, Honda, Suzuki, and the like. As for the various drivers (unfortunately all ~updated~ to the 1999 season), the animations are mainly surprising, such as the beautiful ~folds~ during the curves; not to mention the opponents who turn worriedly to look at us before being overtaken. Even accidents surprise in their reproduction. Crashing at speed causes the immediate unseating from the vehicle, which, runaway and out of control, leaps into the air, rolls and slides vertically as a real motorcycle would do. Honorable mention then for the replays at the end of the match, the most fascinating and complete in living memory. There are all possible shots: from the helicopter to the front and rear on-bike, from the side one to that of the camera positioned near the curbs, whose images jump due to the movement of air generated by the passage of the motorbikes. Full throttle fun But let's finally analyze the gameplay, a basic requirement for a game like this. The five tracks in the game (Suzuka, Motegi, Jerez, Donington and Paul Richard) respect their real counterparts by reproducing the gradients, descents and climbs with absolute precision, the impact of which on the behavior of the bike is more than appreciable. The driving model is subordinated to the fundamental choice of the option between arcade and simulation. In the first case, the gaming experience retains the typical characteristics of Namco racing games, making possible accelerations and bends in corners without worrying about oversteer and the related skids and falls. In the second case, however, the instability of the two wheels, combined with the need to follow soft and precise trajectories, makes a clean riding style indispensable with perfect use of the accelerator and brakes. In this regard, the possibility of activating the pressure detection of the keys of the Dual Shock 2 is enormously welcome, which can finally express their much-vaunted 256 levels of sensitivity at their best. An indicator located in the lower right part of the screen shows the strength of the pressure exerted on both the accelerator and the brake keys, helping us to quickly assimilate the new control method. As soon as you become familiar with it, the frustration caused by an initial difficulty of the game gives way to satisfaction; as in all driving games, in fact, the greater the difficulties necessary to master the vehicle, the greater the satisfactions become over time. There are two game modes in Moto GP: Arcade and Season. In the Arcade you have the possibility to take part in a single competition by choosing one of the foreseen tracks. By participating in a Season, on the other hand, you are obliged to participate in the qualifiers to determine your placement in the actual race. After completing a grand prix, we are shown times, gaps, placings and points obtained in the drivers' standings. Very useful resthen the ~secondary~ modes included in the CD, such as Sfida and Time Attack. I don't think there is a need to say anything about the latter, as it is now a classic presence in this genre. While the Challenge is certainly more particular, as it offers the possibility of competing in a large number of tests with precise objectives: covering a portion of the track within a certain time limit, overcoming a certain number of opponents and so on. In short, a bit like the tests for the Gran Turismo licenses, only that here the reward consists in enabling the tracks in reverse, other pilots and other bonus bikes. Small niggles To be honest, it must be said that this game is not free from defects either. First of all, the five tracks present seem to be few and certainly a few more would not have hurt. In the graphics, albeit wonderful, then, we must underline the annoyance caused by the cursed jaggedness due to the now fateful lack of anti-aliasing. In fact, one cannot fail to notice the backgrounds and the lines of the asphalt which somehow ruin the level of almost photorealism achieved by the replays. Another defect can be found in the two-player game mode, in which, through the horizontal spit-screen, we can face a human opponent. In this case, in fact, we are not given the possibility of being able to compete even against the bikes controlled by the CPU, effectively reducing the fun. The last negative note goes to the sound, or rather to the music, which are completely inadequate, unlike the effects that reproduce the various engines and the cheering of the public quite realistically. Guaranteed podium Apart from its small defects, however, Moto GP forcefully enters the Olympus of unmissable games. The presence of the two modes, arcade and simulation, guarantees equal satisfaction to the various types of enthusiasts, and the three difficulty levels make this title able to entertain for longer than other noble racing games. Purchase therefore strongly recommended to everyone, also because if you are a speed lover there is nothing for now on the PS2 that can compare. pros: graphics of the race and replays. immense playability. analog keys. cons: few slopes. lack of anti-aliasing. inadequate music. Namco is back A year has now passed since the birth of the Playstation 2, and finally the time seems ripe to truly appreciate the great capabilities of the Emotion Engine. Among the authors of this turning point is Namco, which is slowly establishing itself among the strongest developers for the new hardware, thanks to games of the caliber of Tekken Tag Tournament, Ridge Racer 5, and the just released in Italy Moto GP extension. But if the first two, despite having sold a lot, have not been considered real ~killer applications~ by the public, Moto GP, perhaps also thanks to the greater development time, will be able to boast in the future of having boosted sales of the Sony console throughout the world.
