Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. We need to look at things in perspective, place them in an appropriate context before drawing conclusions. In fact, if mentioning the word ~autofire~ can give purists hives, bringing to mind the controllers ~with makeup~ that were so fashionable in the 90s, when video games often resorted to button mashing to resolve certain situations, the same term in the mobile arena can mean the difference between a fun game and one that isn't. The question, as we well know, revolves entirely around touch screen controls, which if they prove to be functional, or even ideal for certain applications, in other cases necessarily need a ~little help~. In driving games the question is open to different interpretations, which often concern the arcade or simulation approach of the product in question, but in the case of shooters there is very little to discuss: automatic fire not only works, but it also represents more sensible solution to lighten the functions of the interface. Think about it for a moment: when you frame an enemy in the viewfinder in a shooter, you don't do it to take a photo of him or to admire the textures that cover his polygonal model, but to reduce him to Swiss cheese using the weapon you are holding. So what's the point of assigning fire to a separate button? Raising the thumb from the right virtual stick and relocating it to a different area of the display not only represents a cumbersome operation, but implies that in the meantime the opponent is there waiting for us and does not move, with a view to evident involution of artificial intelligence rather than an improvement of the routines that regulate it. In short, there are many more problems than benefits in adopting a control system with separate fire, and unfortunately still many development teams that deal with games for iOS and Android, even some of the most famous, seem not to have grasped this important aspect of the matter. Despite some rough edges, Isolani is a solid and fun shooter with excellent touch controls The solons The incipit was necessary to illustrate one of the best aspects of Isolani, the new freemium-based first person shooter developed by Scattered Entertainment, or precisely the control system via touch screen. After the disappointing experiment made with The Drowning, the team has seen fit to set aside improbable gestural interfaces to adopt a much more traditional approach, which starts by default with autofire. The option can be disabled in favor of a separate button, but it only takes a few minutes to understand that it would be crazy to give up the immediacy of this solution, which on paper allows the mobile shooter genre to take substantial steps forward, focusing on aspects such as the aforementioned artificial intelligence of enemies and level design. From this point of view, it must be admitted, Isolani keeps it simple and doesn't dare, giving us pseudo-technological settings that are visually a bit flat and devoid of bite, but which have the great advantage of often winding through corridors and rooms which allow us to beat a retreat if necessary and take cover behind a pillar until the life bar is automatically restored. A little too fast, actually, which makes the first nine levels of the campaign (divided into three different episodes, the last of which will unlock shortly) a little too simple to complete, with some more challenging exchanges only at the end. It's funny, because the system devised by Scattered Entertainment to monetize it is based precisely on the challenge, with three default lives that ~recharge~ with the passing of the minutes but which we can decide to restore immediately by paying eighty-nine cents. Similarly, the purchase of a credit package can allow us to get hold of more powerful weapons than those supplied, but even here the operation appears relatively superfluous, given that with a minimum of experience with FPS and a not too unscrupulous style you can go on in the adventure without ever running into game over. I, robot The protagonist of Isolani awakens after a cryogenic sleep and finds himself in a far from idyllic situation, pitted against an entire army of flying drones that have reduced thehumanity in bondage. Guided from a distance by a mysterious woman, the man manages to obtain some weapons and launches an attack, with the aim of reaching some key points of the orbital structure that forms the background to the story. The story, which is narrated through a series of good dialogues in English, does not appear particularly original but lets itself be followed and has the advantage of sufficiently motivating our sorties based on traditional revolvers and machine guns, in a sort of bizarre contrast with the futuristic ambitions of the setting. The arsenal is quite rich and there are significant differences between one weapon and another, but the need to keep experience on the basics has also played here to the detriment of an enhancement of the equipment which in FPS should instead play a role prominent. Similarly, the design of the enemies is not very inspired and there is a lack of humanoid opponents in place of the multiple fluttering drones, but it must also be recognized that a good job has been done in terms of types and differentiation of the robots, each equipped with a routine unique behaviors, weapons, and stamina. Luckily, the technical sector takes care of putting a patch on the artistic limits of the production, which on the iPhone 5s makes a fine show of excellent fluidity (also essential for touch control systems), without ever an uncertainty, and of a fair level of detail for the scenarios, which perhaps give up a higher resolution of the textures in favor of the frame rate.", "date": "2014-04-26", "grade": "7.8"}
