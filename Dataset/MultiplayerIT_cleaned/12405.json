{"name": "Burning Tires 3D", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/burning-tires-3d.html", "text": "Burning Tires 3D, developed by FishLabs, follows in the wake of the most famous purely arcade racing games that have always populated our consoles and mobile phones. We will be catapulted into crazy races through twelve different tracks that develop around three main settings: a desert area, a world flooded by lava and one invaded by ice. The title developed by FashLabs offers all the usual modes of racing titles, a practice session and the one that characterizes the heart of the game, the championship. It is practically useless to talk about the first one, you choose a car and race on a track against three other opponents, in the championship instead we will find ourselves facing four different competitions, each in turn made up of imaginative tracks, set in one of the three areas described above . The four tournaments in which we will be able to participate are called in order: Raw Rumble, Mad Mayhem, Insanity Run and the last and most difficult Clash of Titans. As is to be expected, the difficulty grows as you continue in the game and face the new challenges that are unlocking, managing to finish all the competitions in the top positions. In addition to accessing new races, new cars will also be offered in succession which will add up to the already excellent ~Green lizard~, the starting car. As for the vehicles, as well as the tracks, they are all invented without any official license and we will find ourselves using tractors with large engines in evidence, such as the Red Rebel, or cars that are more similar to rockets with wheels than real racing cars, such as the Orange Blitz. In total we will be able to unlock a dozen new vehicles, a further challenge for those who intend to play the game thoroughly. Technically Burning Tires 3D is pleasant, with sufficiently varied paths and particular elements of the scenario such as suspension bridges and exciting jumps. The view is the usual one of racing games, with the shot located behind and above the vehicle that allows you to fully enjoy the details offered by the game. We have noticed some sporadic pop-up phenomena, with background elements that suddenly appear out of nowhere, but in principle the visual horizon is wide enough, to confirm the goodness of the title's graphics engine. The big lack that we would like to underline is the lack of interactivity of the scenario with our car, an example above all when during the races it happens to hit the ~rivers of lava~ without suffering any consequences. The sensation of speed, an indispensable element of every racing game, has not been underestimated and the general impression is that of a very fast and fairly fluid game, with some rare slowdowns. The control system, on the other hand, suffers from a few minor problems, given that it doesn't always manage to be effective, resulting in being too ~abrupt~, causing the vehicle to make excessively sudden curves and forcing us to perform almost impossible maneuvers to keep it on the road. There is also the possibility of selecting automatic acceleration, thus leaving us the sole task of performing lateral movements during the races. To conclude the technical analysis, we also recall that there is a multiplayer mode via bluetooth capable of exponentially increasing the longevity of the FishLabs title.
