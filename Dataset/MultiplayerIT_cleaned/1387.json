The more curious among you will find many answers among the various interviews or ~making of~ that it will be possible to view. In short, a nice plus which, however, does not sweeten the regret for the absence of the multiplayer mode. I'm an experienced pilot SWON is a purely arcade game. Set in the Second World War, it will offer the player the opportunity to take on the role of American pilot James Chase who, from the cockpit of the planes he will be maneuvering, will have to face something enormously greater than himself: the savagery and cruelty of a world war. It was said before, SWON is not a flight simulator. To master the more than 20 vehicles offered by the game it will not be necessary to study a 500-page manual, much less enroll in a correspondence aviation course. The controls are simple, immediate and reduced to the bone. The arcade approach chosen by Totally Game is confirmed by the extreme comfort with which it is possible to play using any joypad. LucasArts offers a main game mode ~Campaign~, consisting of a linear series of missions, of increasing difficulty, set in the Second World War. Each mission will be preceded by a series of cut scenes that will illustrate to the player the historical background underlying the tasks that will be faced. Although the title of the game may suggest the opposite, our aerial actions will not be limited to taking place exclusively in Normandy but will also touch other areas of the old continent, North Africa, Great Britain and the Pacific. Successfully completing campaign missions will unlock new planes (expect space surprises...), weaponry, upgrades and activate the missions of the ~Challenges~ sub-mode. The latter will allow the player to refine and improve their skills by putting themselves to the test in a whole series of quite varied challenges of a different nature. The ~Instant Action~ mode closes the sphere of game possibilities available to the user. As you may have easily guessed from the name, this option will immediately catapult you into the heart of the action, offering the discretion of being able to choose which airplanes to see darting in the sky and on which scenario to set the action. Watch me and listen to me LucasArts is a multiplatform title. This means that, together with the PC version, the PS2 and XBOX versions are also available. To make it easier to develop simultaneously on different hardware, it was decided to use the Criterion Renderware. Nothing wrong, of course! Recent productions have shown how it is absolutely possible to make a video game on multiple platforms while maintaining a high technical value of the playful work; Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a prime example. Unfortunately, however, in our case the situation is not so happy. SWON does not shine from a technical point of view. Graphically, the game stands at just discrete levels. The polygonal models of the absolute protagonists of the game, the planes, are not shocking due to the complexity of the details or the cleanliness and quality of the textures. The same thing goes for the structures that make up the scenarios: tanks, hangars and houses are even less cared for. Furthermore, don't expect incredible special effects, breathtaking explosions or plays of light to exalt the most savvy among you. The speech is different for what concerns the sound department. Here the situation is decidedly more positive. The sound effects are good: the hum of the engines or the marking of the shots fired by the paraphernalia installed on their vehicles have been taken care of. Equally happy is the musical accompaniment that will keep us company during our missions: never excessively invasive, always pleasant and able to increase in tone as the action progresses. Will I be able to complete the mission? Tackling the various missions that make up the game is fun, but not too exciting. After mastering the simple game controls one would expect to be overwhelmed at any moment by an uncontrollable wave of emotions and unexpected and unpredictable situations, but this is not the case. Unlike the planes we fly, the game doesn't take off! To complete your tasks it will be sufficient to organize with aminimum attention the order of the targets to hit. Furthermore, the artificial intelligence of the enemies does not improve the degree of challenge. Enemy planes are not shocking due to the incredible skill with which they carry out evasive maneuvers and often face us as real kamikazes with results that you can imagine. The purely arcade nature of the game, on the other hand, does not oblige the user to study particular action solutions and everything is limited to identifying the next target to shoot down, point it and in the best case scenario dose the power of your engine for the best ~tail him~. Despite the three main game modes, the game is not characterized by a huge longevity factor. The re-playability of the Totally Games creature is brought down even more by the unhappy idea of not including any type of multiplayer option both online and offline. Final comment SWON is a game that stands on discrete levels. It lets itself be played without claiming to offer something truly innovative and without ever surprising. Absolutely not technically exceptional, it is characterized by an interesting sound section. Multiplayer.it recommends this production to lovers of frenetic air combat and the historical period in which the action takes place. Anyone who wants to hurtle through the skies chasing like hell everything that moves on the screen might find the Lucasarts mom game fun and interesting. The fact remains that it is far from the splendor that Mr. Lawrence Holland was able to give in the past. To be able to play peacefully, perhaps compromising with some sporadic slowdowns, it is sufficient to have a mid-range computer and, why not, a nice joypad. Pros: Frantic and particularly immediate Pleasant musical accompaniment Cons: Graphics not in step with the times No multiplayer mode Not very long-lived In the past of every gamer there are titles that are difficult to forget. Video games that have had the ability to transform dark winter days into memorable gaming sessions, which have been able to excite and entertain. Scrolling through the memories gone, the older gamers among you will surely smile thinking back to Star Wars: X-Wing or, again, to Star Wars: Tie Fighter. We are talking about two gentlemen space simulators: spectacular, highly playable, atmospheric! What do they have in common with Secret Weapons over Normandy (SWON from now on), Lucasarts game subject of this review? All and nothing! All because the mind and the software house behind the aforementioned space simulators set in the charismatic Star Wars universe are the same: Lawrence Holland and Totally Games. Nothing because, it's good to be immediately clear, SWON doesn't have much in common with the aforementioned masterpieces. Let's try to understand why?", "date": "2004-02-19", "grade": null}
