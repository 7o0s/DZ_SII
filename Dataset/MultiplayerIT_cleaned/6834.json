When it came out, now more than two years ago, no one expected it to be so successful that it would sell more than a million copies. Instead it was and we can well consider it one of the forerunners of the revival of classic role-playing games, one of those titles that demonstrated the existence of a market for genres considered dead such as that of dungeon crawlers. Some places are fascinating For this reason, the expectation born around the official sequel, announced more than a year ago, was really high, an expectation that has not been disregarded. Legend of Grimrock 2 is an intelligent sequel: on the one hand it doesn't touch the original formula one iota, while on the other it expands everything that can be expanded by introducing new elements. Let's say that if the model of the first chapter was Dungeon Master, this second follows the path of the Abandoned Places, trying to offer a greater variety of scenarios to the players, including open spaces, while not touching the basic inspiration, well rooted in the original conception of western role-playing games, born as an attempt to virtually reproduce some mechanics and atmospheres of paper role-playing games, especially fantasy (but not only). The story begins with the sinking of a ship carrying four prisoners (party members). Waking up on the mysterious island of Nex is traumatic, surrounded as they are by monstrous and aggressive creatures. They will soon discover that they have been lured to the island by an evil Doc who will enjoy following them and watching them grappling with the traps he has scattered everywhere. It won't take much to understand that the island is actually a huge maze full of dungeons to explore, monsters to fight and palaces to conquer. Will they be able to survive? Find out, by reading our review of Legend of Grimrock 2, if it's worth dusting off the sword Party time There is no shortage of puzzles As soon as the game starts we are asked to select the difficulty level (there are three) and if we want to activate some options to make the game experience more difficult. We will thus be able to deactivate the automatic map, manual saves or make the crystals of life usable only once. We will also be able to choose whether to create our own group of heroes or to use the ones preset by the developers. Having opted for the manual generation of the party, we are faced with a screen full of numbers and values, in which we can define the characteristics of each individual hero, give him traits, decide his skills and so on. Compared to the first Grimrock, where there were four races, three classes and very few skills, here we have five races, eight classes and many more skills. The latter have been reorganized following a more classic scheme, instead of the tree-based one of the past. So now each skill can be assigned up to five points, which can be accumulated by going up in experience, which unlock one or more additional skills. Having made your own evaluations and distributed all the available points, all that remains is to enter the adventure. Gameplay and surroundings Legend of Grimrock 2 begins on a beach, with the party imprisoned in a cage. Once the bars have been broken, you can start exploring the area, where there are really aggressive, but not very dangerous, giant turtles and some objects of little value, still useful for starting to fill the inventory. Is anybody there? The first thing you notice is that the control system is really simple, with a few commands to move and fight, as well as to access the convenient map that automatically updates as you explore the island. All extra game features are tied to items. For example, if you want to dig you need to find a shovel first, while if you want to make potions you need to find the classic alchemist's pestle. From this point of view, the complications are really nil, probably in order not to deconcentrate the player from what he will have to face. The magic system itself is immediate to use, with a complex of nine runes placed in a chessboard to be used to compose spells (similar to the one seen in the first chapter). After a more linear initial section, with a dungeon and a boss to defeat, Grimrock reveals its open nature allowing for a freer exploration of the map. Mind you that there are always some limits, either for some enemies strategically placed to prevent the passage, or for chained puzzles. However there is a much greater sense of freedom than in the first chapter thanks above all to the alternation of open and closed environments, which also make the exploration more variedto. You soon realize that there is no shortage of things to do and that each area is full of secrets to discover and puzzles to solve. Disturbing, but in this case only scenic Some are really challenging and, if at the beginning you proceed quickly enough in their resolution, in the advanced dungeons you often get stuck grappling with some seemingly insurmountable puzzle. In addition to the classic puzzles related to levers, spells and plates, there are also environmental ones, linked to the presence of elements such as water, one of the most insidious enemies of the first part of the adventure. Speaking of enemies, but in this case to be sliced, let's say that there are all kinds, all worthy of a good modern fantasy manual. Undead of different dangerousness, wild beasts, flying predators, giant insects; nothing is really missing. Each has its own characteristics, both in attack and defense. In total there are more than forty of them. Remaining on the cold numbers, to finish the game the first time on a normal level and without activated hardcore options, it takes more than twenty hours. Obviously choosing a higher difficulty level will also lengthen the playing time. Note the presence of a rich editor, which allows the creation of customized levels. Whether you enjoy creating your own or playing other people's, it's certainly a great tool to dramatically extend the life of your installation files on your hard drive. Considerations Legend of Grimrock 2 is not only a beautiful game, but it is one that has great consideration for its ideal target, if we want to use the terminology of marketers. Playing it is clear that the developers have chosen to address an audience that they consider more than intelligent, that is capable of overcoming and appreciating even very difficult puzzles. This is not the time to sunbathe This is not a trivial consideration, because many design choices revolve around the conception of one's audience. Normally, games in which there are too many simplifications and too many aids have been conceived considering the player as a kind of monkey, incapable of complex reasoning and prone to frustration. Let's say that Almost Human has decided to address anyone who is able to not give up in the face of difficulties, disseminating the right clues to solve each puzzle, but never providing easy solutions. The greater openness of the game world, which allows you to choose the order in which to tackle some dungeons, also allows you to take breaks in case you are unable to overcome a particularly difficult situation. There is no expectation that those who play necessarily reach the end, which then does not happen very often even in very easy titles, but there is great respect for those on the other side of the monitor, who are given a big credit and that he is rewarded for the skills demonstrated, not with circus trainer techniques. We just have to point out some defects of the game, relative but present. The most obvious is the lack of originality, which is forgivable given that we are faced with a title that is excellent in what it does. The second problem is of a technical nature. As you can see from the screenshots, Grimrock is a beautiful title, also capable of producing suggestive landscapes, but certainly not exceptional from a graphic point of view. Not bad, given that it is not a multi-billion dollar production and that the price is not very high. Too bad, however, that every now and then there are inexplicable drops in the frame rate. Let it be clear that it is nothing compromising, since they do not affect the dynamics of the game in the slightest, but it is impossible not to notice them.", "date": "2014-10-16", "grade": "9.0"}
