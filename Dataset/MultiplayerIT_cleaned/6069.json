A developer who, despite not having much appeal to the general public, has always managed to create titles of undoubted quality aimed at an ~enlarged niche~ of players, able to touch some different strings of the gaming experience. Their latest game was greatly appreciated but unfortunately it didn't sell astronomical figures - a real shame because we liked it a lot - hence perhaps the choice to bring it to PlayStation 4 in a revised and corrected version, both in relation to the different control system than to the increased computing power. Paper Adventures is the new subtitle that also highlights the most visible feature of this adventure, the creation of the game world with this single element, used for the characters, the backgrounds, even the graphic effects; the result is simply delicious, a peculiar style that immediately captures and that does not require brute polygonal power to return a pleasant, colorful, cheerful impact. The PlayStation 4 cure has allowed the developers to increase the visual distance, the complexity of the details and also the extension of the levels, with a better fluidity but also in this case suffering from uncertainties in some situations, also linked to the animations of some objects on screen. Tearaway: Paper Adventures is coming to PlayStation 4, here's our verdict Playstation 4 trophies Tearaway: Paper Adventures offers 35 trophies, up to the coveted platinum. In theory it is possible to get them all during the first game, realistically you have to replay a few chapters to get all the associated gifts, collect all the confetti and kill all enemies. Other trophies are linked to particular conditions, such as jumping a marmot several times, bringing a lost one back, photographing particular glimpses of the scenario. Director's cut In fact, Tearaway: Adventures of Paper offers most of the objects, music and practically the same levels as the original title, but sometimes mixes them because the control system is different. Such levels are more extensive or perhaps refined due to the additional development time used. The game can therefore be defined as a sort of ~Director's cut~ version of the original, which after a year and a half is holding up well but tends to suffer from the same defects, linked to excessive ease, certainly not exceptional longevity and a with a labile bite and very tied to the player's approach. The protagonists are animated messengers in the shape of an envelope for letters, Iota and Atoi, and their job in this colorful paper world is to deliver a message just to you, the player, renamed YOU within the title. A bond that becomes stronger and stronger during the adventure, thanks to the finally sensible and imaginative use of the control system that allows you to affect what happens on the screen. Already on PlayStation Vita Media Molecule has done justice to the physical characteristics of the console, allowing the touch parts and the camera of the latter to be used in an interested way; on PlayStation 4 we have a similar speech, this time with the DualShock 4 and, optionally, with the PlayStation Camera. The main protagonist has classic platform movements: after a few sections of the game he learns to jump and with the front buttons he can collect objects while facing the difficulties that appear in front of him. The world of paper is in fact populated by fearsome crows that block the road and above all by ~cartacce~, small squares of waste paper that literally dirty the beauty of the landscape and instill fear in the present population. The YOU, or the real player, would be the person who can be seen through the hole in the sky and who represents the goal to be achieved for Iota (the male version of Atoi, the one we have chosen) and precisely because there is this link between you and him, you need to help not only by controlling him directly, but also by affecting the world around him. If you have a PlayStation Camera, your silhouette often appears in the game, starting right from the gash; the rest is left to the DualShock 4. For example, by pressing one of the rear triggers and using the motion sensor, you can target the area with a beam of light capable of clearing the road, erasing the waste paper that visually disfigures the environment and hypnotize the same litter, for example to throw it off the screen. Therepressure with release of the touch pad allows you to interact with the drums scattered in the levels, which allow Iota to reach high positions; by picking up an object, moving the pad upwards and pressing square, it is possible to throw it towards the player and ~store~ it in the pad, until you want to throw it with the slide to solve, for example, environmental puzzles. Still using the touchpad, it is possible to cut out shapes in the virtual paper which are then applied directly to the objects in the game. Sometimes some characters will ask, in fact, to draw something and choose its color, and then physically apply it on the parts of the body; with R3, on the other hand, it is possible to directly customize the main protagonist, drawing new shapes or buying among those available for the nose, eyes and the rest, within a truly vast subset of choices. The sound currency of the game is represented by confetti, which are collected on the street or by performing small secondary activities. A final interaction is represented by the game's internal camera, which is activated using the triangle button: also in this case it is possible to purchase different lenses, such as macro and wide-angle, and special filters, from sepia to negative, before taking the picture with R2 . An absolute novelty is the possibility of creating animated Gifs, really nice to share on your profile on the Tearaway.me site, which among other things allows you to download the compositions hidden in the game to create your own origami with real paper. Directly connected is the second screen function within the PlayStation App, which allows you to draw shapes directly on smartphones and tablets, as well as send your own photographs to customize even part of the textures relating to the setting. Tearaway is all of this, it surprises with its interesting gimmicks related to the control system, delights with the graphic style adopted and the light-hearted tone, captivates when you feel more involved with what is happening on the screen. The ending should be enjoyed alone and concentrated, because it has a message - it must be said - not indifferent; the game leaves a sense of satisfaction for having given a different experience than usual, certainly capable of leaving its mark. The novelties and adjustments made to the PlayStation 4 version make everything more pleasant, but as mentioned, the defects, although present, do not change, beyond a narrative that is subtle and has a different grip for each one. The title struggles to give more than 6-8 hours to complete, and although replayable in order to collect all the extras and get platinum, it lacks a bit of bite in the progression, it is rather easy and does not offer particularly obstacles and opponents interesting. It is ~only~ limited to surprising the player visually and with its narrative and interaction gimmicks, while the rest remains more normal.", "date": "2015-09-02", "grade": "8.0"}
