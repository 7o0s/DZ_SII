{"name": "Templar's Creed", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/88701-the-first-templar-templars-creed.html", "text": "Tested version: PCPerhaps not everyone knows that the origin of ~Friday the 13th~, understood as an ill-fated date, derives from the day in which the Knights Templar were betrayed by King Philip IV of France, who captured most of them by deception and made to persecute those who remained for the simple purpose of appropriating their property. It is precisely in this period of 1307 that the story narrated in The First Templar takes place, and which sees two Templars engaged in a mission of extreme importance, which could save the Order from its ominous destiny: to find the Holy Grail. The Christian relic would seem capable of giving whoever possesses it the power to dominate the world, and it is precisely in these divine properties that the knights Celian and Roland trust. To find the Grail, the two must first save a certain Marie, accused of witchcraft by the Holy Inquisition and imprisoned as a result. However, the expedition to the prisons of the Church turns out to be more difficult than expected: after having freed the girl, the Templars are surrounded by guards and only thanks to the sacrifice of Roland, who decides to stay and fight to allow Celian and Marie to escape, the mission can have a sequel. A revelation of the plot unfortunately necessary to describe the gameplay of the game, based precisely on the concept of a couple, which therefore sees us first control the two knights and then the duo formed by Celian and Marie. It is possible to switch from one character to another at any time, by pressing the LB key (using an Xbox 360 controller), not so much to take advantage of their special abilities in battle, but rather to successfully complete the levels in which we have to solve puzzles based on switches and traps. Everything is real, nothing is permitted If the general setting of the game, the type of setting and the story told are not enough to brand it as a brave but naive attempt to imitate Assassin's Creed, just get to the city of Acre and use the catapults to find yourself in facing a reinterpretation of what happens at the beginning of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, when Ezio is awakened by the attack of the Borgia army against the walls of Monteriggioni and returns fire using cannons. The scene is practically the same, but from a stylistic and construction point of view we are talking about profoundly different realities, or rather a Bulgarian team that has cut its teeth with adventures and strategic games for PC that tries to deal with a French company that boasts offices around the world and has recently founded its own film division. In a level set in Syria we also witness the confrontation between Celian and the Hashishin, who fight with a blade on their wrist (far from hidden) and are distinguished by their exceptional agility. In short, the inspiration that the developers of Haenimont Games have drawn from the Ubisoft series is clear, and the impression is that the differences between The First Templar and Assassin's Creed are mostly dictated by the inevitable technical limits with which the first title must do The bills. Celian and Marie move within the scenarios in a ~rigid~, almost ~vectorial~ way, and the management of the camera bears witness to the legacy of PC productions now belonging to past generations. In short, there is a lot of ~wood~ in the game dynamics, and quite a bit of linearity: wanting to completely ignore the exciting plot, not very original in its final bars but certainly enjoyable and interesting, the gist of this action adventure lies in the ~radar~ which indicates from time to time the objective to be achieved on the map, in a very limited exploration and interspersed with increasingly dense and demanding fights. A matter of zeal It is precisely in the fights that the thickness of The First Templar finally emerges, as well as the real difference with Assassin's Creed. Unlike the Ubisoft series, in fact, Celian and Marie can also be defeated in a fight, especially when the more cunning opponents, equipped with a shield or heavy armor, take the field. Our character can perform various combos, parry the enemy's blows or slip aside to avoid them when they cannot be stopped, perform spectacular ~fatalities~ (apart from the one in which Celian sends an enemy flying and hits him on the fly with a kick , unwatchable) that fall within the category of critical attacks and finish off opponents on the ground with a slash. Each battle won translates into the acquisition of experience points that can be spent to unlock new moves, increase the number of ~spheres~ that make up the health bar and the zeal bar (the latter essential for performing special attacks) and acquire skills inedite, such as the ability to heal one's wounds through prayer. The degree of challenge of the fights remains on a certain level up to the most advanced levels, when unfortunately the enhancement of our characters ends up far exceeding the numerical factor or the greater tenacity of the enemies, making life a little too simple. The duel with the leader of the Hashishin represents, on balance, the most difficult part of the game: this particular opponent manages to recover his energy if he is not attacked, and from a certain point onwards he can perform unblockable attacks. Everything else, however, is largely within the reach of Celian and Marie, so much so that the switch between the two characters proves to be completely useless in practical terms, remaining an interesting feature for the sole purpose of cooperative multiplayer (possible both locally, via split screen, and online). Traps at the end The levels that present mazes, puzzles and so on fortunately manage to break the linearity of the action, while not shining for the complexity of the puzzles and proving to be a bit of health walks. Among swaying blades, spikes protruding from the ground and sudden jets of fire, but still walks. In such situations, the passage from one character to another becomes mandatory, because perhaps one of the two has to pull a lever while the other passes through the door that has opened as a result, and so on. Solving these stages is fun, even if you never really get into trouble. The presence of water and food capable of restoring health is a bit too frequent, even in the action phases: making things more difficult would perhaps have helped the adventure, which in any case is quite long and can hardly be completed in less time of ten hours. It is therefore necessary to recognize a certain commitment to the developers, as well as the ability to intertwine the events of the campaign so as not to make it necessarily ~stretched~ to reach this playing time. A very similar argument can be made about the technical realization of the game, which from a quantitative point of view certainly deserves applause, but which in the same way can only be dated when compared with current productions. The scenarios cannot be explored as far and wide as in Assassin's Creed, rather they are full of limitations and invisible barriers, with an alternation of uninspired textures and an often questionable choice of colors. The lighting system tries to do everything possible to bring the landscapes to life, but even in this situation the solutions adopted are largely outdated. Also a bit annoying is the lack of many ~surround~ animations, for example the levers that are pulled without the character moving, or above all the very limited gestures during conversations. If nothing else, the graphics engine is very light: we played at a resolution of 1600 x 900 pixels, with all effects maxed out, achieving a frame rate of 25-30 fps (with peaks of 40-45 fps indoors). Finally, the sound appears appropriate to the story being told, with perhaps a little flat acting in the dialogues and music capable of creating a good atmosphere.", "date": "2011-05-19", "grade": "6.5"}
