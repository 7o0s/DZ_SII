The installation, which requires 820 Mb of hard disk space, is very simple and at the end the game is launched automatically. At the start, a nice and well-kept movie introduces us to the game atmosphere, especially thanks to a background music that reproduces the typical South American notes. The movie is relatively short and the screen that appears immediately afterwards allows us to select the style of play: the game, in fact, can follow two paths, one by deciding to play with the pre-built missions, or the second in which we will meet committed to building their own missions. In the first case, the programmers have set the characteristics of each island, as well as their rulers, also setting the objectives and the degree of difficulty. In the second case we will be able to indulge ourselves with many parameters (mountainousness of the island, population, years of government, as well as game objectives) which also includes the possibility of fixing some characteristics of our alter ego, for example how he came to power, what are its merits (ecologist, intellectual, etc.) and defects (paranoid, egomaniac, etc., even with the most ridiculous options!). Every single choice will have precise and at the same time complex repercussions on the game: a mountainous island will allow only certain crops, a dictator who came to power with a communist revolution will have excellent relations with the USSR (remember that the game starts in 1950, it is to say in the middle of the cold war) and again, in an island governed by an intellectual the population will be more cultured and will improve faster in the various trades (all this information is however present in the manual, which together with the tutorial, will have to be the point starting point to fully understand the dynamics of the game). An innovation compared to other similar games lies precisely in establishing the final objective and choosing the characteristics of one's ~favorite dictator~, whose profiles, past and many other characteristics can also be modified. Long live <i>the</i> president! ~Tropico~, despite being a very fun, dynamic, nice game with beautiful colored graphics, maintains that seriousness and that need for administration, to organize all one's moves: this creation by POP TOP SOFTWARE can be compared to a game of chess , where we do not have a single adversary and a thousand variables, but a single goal, many adversaries and infinite unknowns! In fact, our adversaries will be the needs of our island (among many: maintaining political tranquility within society, taking care of literacy, agriculture and especially the general economy, through trade, increased labor production). To facilitate everything, even in the event of political and/or economic unforeseen events, it is possible to resort to methods that are not ~legitimate~. It is in fact possible to bribe anyone, change plans, implement scams, buy elections. At our side and in our aid, both in the predefined games and in those generated by us, there will be our adviser and the annual report. The counselor is invaluable; he gives us little advice or news during the game or presents us with written reports on the problems occurring on the island, offering us valuable advice in this case as well (for example, he informs us that the housing situation is criticized by the communists and that solving it we will get their support). In some cases, the councilor will propose agreements with questionable characters who offer us various possibilities, for example we have been offered money in exchange for the possibility of managing the building on the island (obviously with some more earnings for the builder). The annual report gives us a summary of the situation of our state in all its political, economic, demographic, etc. aspects. This report is very simple to consult, also thanks to the graphs that can be activated for each item. However, in case of need, the game is provided with an excellent tutorial that helps both to manage the various options and to increase one's command skills, especially when it is necessary to manage the many available buildings. Initial (or final?) comment Tropico is a fun game, very challenging, with captivating and well-maintained graphics. A flaw could be that the game does not introduce anything really new in the management genre, but is satisfied (which is not a small thing anyway) to be very complete and well-finished. Enthusiasts will find bread for their teeth in Tropico, for all the others I can only suggest trying itplay the demo first, remembering however that the game is sold at a very attractive price, which could push many to approach this perhaps unknown genre. The minimum requirements are really low (we are talking about a 200 mhz processor; however, it must be considered that only with a much more powerful CPU is the game really manageable without slowdowns). P.S. thanks to Matrix[theONE], who guided and helped me in writing the review. Final (or initial?) comment In the field of strategic-managerial play programs ~Tropico~ certainly stands out for the unusual setting, the impersonable characters, the graphics, but certainly for the involvement that the game offers, above all thanks to the infinite possibilities of choosing the various game lines. However these choices will not ~freeze~ the rest, on the contrary they will make it even more fun and interesting. At the same time you will have to pay close attention, as each choice will affect the continuation of the game.", "date": "2001-08-01", "grade": null}
