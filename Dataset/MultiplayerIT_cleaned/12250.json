{"name": "Asphalt Urban GT 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/asphalt-urban-gt-2-recensione_a.html", "text": "All on track In this sense, the game immediately reveals itself, as mentioned above, as a frenetic and fun arcade (obviously there is the canonical ~turbo~ to load and use at the right time), where it is necessary to compete to overcome rivals but also to throw them off the road, evade the police (including helicopters) or perform special stunts. The latter, clearly inspired by Burnout Dominator, consist of passing a few centimeters from the other cars that unknowingly go their way, or in reckless maneuvers at full throttle, often feasible while trying to take some of the icons scattered in strategic positions inherent in the money or ~fuel~ for the turbo bar. All this is not an end in itself as it serves, like actual victories in the race, to collect points and money to invest later in upgrading one's car or in buying other ones. While this feature appears successful, the same thing cannot be said about the one concerning the presence of the police. The idea, which is not new, is nice, but technically badly done. Losing the vehicles of the police forces is almost impossible and even the helicopters do not let go even when you enter the tunnels (they even follow us there!). Furthermore, once blocked and fined, we will lose only a few seconds compared to our opponents, which will not penalize the gamer at all as it should be for the purposes of a more difficult race. In any case, the police show up when a special bar called Wanted is filled in the upper left of the screen: so be careful. Even if the commands are not configurable, fortunately they prove to be so effective as not to regret the lack of this option too much. If anything, the problem is elsewhere, and that is in the control of the vehicles, understood as the differentiation between two-wheeled and four-wheeled vehicles and the relative different behavior on the track. Well, despite everything, we don't notice much difference in movement, in managing the vehicle between an engine or a car during some stages of the race. For example when cornering, if differentiated movements can be seen from a visual point of view, the same thing, I don't know, is felt in terms of command and response. It must be said that this aspect may depend on the desire on the part of the programmers to propose a clearly arcade title in all respects, even if the fact remains that you have the same driving sensation when you compete indifferently with a car or a motorbike it is not very fulfilling for the user. Proof of this is that crashing into one of the motorbike guardrails sideways in a bend, we will not end up overturned on the road as would happen in normal situations, almost as if we were on board a four-wheeler rather than two. The graphics in general are not particularly exciting. Let's say that it falls within the average quality range of PSP games. We have fairly distinctive cars and motorbikes, with good light and translucent effects, all in all enjoyable routes. But on the other hand there are some defects that make you turn up your nose, such as for example the lack of effects such as to highlight the dents on the machines: when you have an accident in the face of noises of shattered glass, twisted metal, etc., visually we only notice sparks and nothing more Furthermore, during the most chaotic phases of the races, with many polygons on the screen, for example when the police helicopter appears, there are sometimes noticeable drops in framerate and slowdowns. As far as the audio is concerned, however, only positive notes: lots of phrases in Italian, beautiful music during the races (unfortunately there is only one in the menu) and audio effects which, although not the absolute state of the art for genre, they perform their duty fairly well, even if it must be said that the samplings are rather limited, both for the roars of the engines and for the noises of impacts during accidents, so much so that they tend to resemble each other, motorcycles included. Conclusions Needless to say, those of Ubisoft have worked hard to improve their old racing title, modifying it more or less completely in an attempt to make it worthy of competing productions. Sadly, however, despite the efforts, the game remains well below the current quality standard of titles of the genre on the PSP. Apart from the excellent sound, complete with audio in Italian, the many game options for both single and multiplayer, Asphalt: Urban GT2 suffers from a not excellent technical realization and not particularly beautiful graphics. In short, recommended for those who love the genre and are tired, so to speak, of always playing Need For Speed Carbon or Burnout. Pros: Fun. Localization in Italian. Glo soundbaldly good. Cons: Not great graphics. Gameplay to be reviewed in part. The police presence could have been put to better use. The PSP seems more and more the console of choice for racing game developers. There are now several genre titles on the Sony portable console peeking out from store shelves. But for enthusiasts, certain games are never too many. Asphalt: Urban GT 2 belongs, let's say it right away, to that category of arcade driving titles of which the Need for speed and Burnout series are considered the greatest exponents. The Ubisoft game undoubtedly drew a lot of inspiration from these two sagas, as we will see shortly. But let's proceed in order. The game modes are the classic ones for this kind of production: ~Arcade~, where without too many frills it is possible to face the race directly, available in Single, Time Challenge, Pursuit, Rivalry, plus other unlockable options, ~Evolution~, the main mode, i.e. the real tournament, where among other things, you can buy cars, customize them, and then use them in competitions, and ~Multiplayer~, to challenge friends, up to 4 players, using the Wi-Fi connection . The list is closed by the items ~Advice~, in which you can see real technical explanations on how to improve your driving skills or simply to learn about the controls of the cars and the running of the races, and ~Options~, on which there is little to add. Once you have chosen the type of race and the vehicle with which to compete (among 44, many of which are licensed by Lamborghini, Mercedes, Ducati, Kawasaki, Dodge, etc.), you are ready to begin the challenge.", "date": "2007-05-28", "grade": null}
