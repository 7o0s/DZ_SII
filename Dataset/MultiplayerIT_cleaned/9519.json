In the quiet house in the Welsh countryside, together with his animals and his only collaborator, the Italian Ivan ~Giles~ Zorzin, ~Yak~ Minter presents himself as a sort of hermit guru, as crazy as intriguingly mysterious. Still, anyone who started playing early enough to be able to boast of buying an Atari ST or an Atari Jaguar knows how much this bizarre character and his Llamasoft label marked the computer games scene between the 80s and 90s. bewildered Revenge of the Mutant Camels and Sheep in Space for Commodore 64 at that Tempest 2000 became a real cult, each work by Minter was a surrealistic trip made of colors, explosive sounds and crazy gimmicks. As a trademark, the retro style and psychedelic graphics have also characterized the more recent Space Giraffe and Gridrunner Revolution, and it is therefore obvious that longtime followers continue to get carried away by nostalgic joy with each new release by Llamasoft. The last time we chatted with Yak and Giles, a few months ago, we were told that they were working on a mysterious new game, but at the time we hardly imagined that it would be a title for iPhone and iPad. Minotaurs out of control Solar Minotaur Rescue Frenzy, or more briefly Minotaur Rescue, is in fact the first piece of what Llamasoft has baptized with the name of Minotaur Project, a project aimed at creating games that combine retro aesthetics with innovative control systems. With its touchscreen interface, accelerometer and ease of development, iPhone could only be the most attractive choice for the independent British developer. Wanting to simplify Minotaur Rescue, with the risk of trivializing it, it could be defined as a cross between Asteroids and Robotron 2084: just like in the first of the two arcades, in fact, the player's aim is to get rid of the huge wandering asteroids thanks to the fire of his ship spatial, which is however able to move in any direction within the arena. Unlike the myriad of twin stick shooters along the lines of Geometry Wars, however, Minotaur Rescue features an experimental control system, which leaves the dual analog stick emulation at home and offers relative controls: just lightly tap the screen anywhere and in any direction to rotate and move the ship, where small taps direct the fire and a long tap on the screen moves forward. An idea that obviously has two sides to the coin. The first minutes of the game are unsettling, with the player awkwardly trying to get used to the new way of moving around the scenario; after a bit of practice you finally manage to gain confidence, and everything seems not only easier, but also more fun, although you realize that, even after mastering it properly, this alternative control system does not offer a level of precision comparable to the classic two sticks. It certainly wouldn't be a problem, except that in the more advanced levels the amount of asteroids and enemies becomes high enough to make every slightest move a spin of Russian roulette. But a genius like Minter certainly couldn't limit himself to an Asteroids clone with out of the ordinary controls, so here, clearly inspired by Spacewar!, a small star has been inserted in the center of the arena, whose gravitational force attracts both asteroids that the player's ship. Some boulders hide funny pacifist minotaurs, which are nothing more than bonuses to collect to earn points and increase your firepower: the closer they are brought to the star, the more points they damage when you collect them. It is a small trick which, at least in theory, should stimulate the more intrepid players to stall and risk being sucked in in an attempt to earn a few more points. However, stalling is not the most sensible choice when you are surrounded by dozens of gigantic asteroids. If it absorbs too many objects before the end of the level, the star inevitably collapses and turns into a huge black hole capable of sucking up any object on the screen. Along with a lot of survival odds, of course. Based on Neon 2, a much improved version of the engine behind Space Giraffe, the title has pleasantly retro graphics, but for the first few levels of the game it keeps a low profile until at some point it finally implodes into itself. The more explosions become numerous and FrMore Minotaur Rescue transforms into a psychedelic experience, as it reaches its climax with the arrival of the dreaded black hole: the player hangs, teeters surrounded by chaos, caught in a unique aesthetic grip. It is in these brief moments that all the Minter madness that longtime players have come to love comes out. After all, anyone would be able to insert a camel, a sheep or even a minotaur into their game, but few like Llamasoft manage to build an unmistakable hypnotic experience around it. The title is a hymn to the Atari VCS right from the start screen, which implies a whole series of limits that the developers wanted to self-impose: there is no music to accompany the action, but only a few repetitive effects sounds, although you can leave any song from your iPod library in the background. Minotaur Rescue is also designed to be played in local co-op, but the iPhone screen is too small and it often happens to cover the opponent's ship with your finger. Fortunately, things get less frustrating on the iPad, where the multiplayer mode also supports up to 4 different friends. At the end of the day, Minter's new game is neat, stylish and bursting with humour, but it is mainly intended to excite an audience of nostalgics and retrogaming lovers, for whom the presence of Jets! and Tanks!, the two bonus titles contained in the package and inspired by the old cult Combat, represents an additional incentive to purchase. And perhaps in the end, after removing the contagious enthusiasm due more to the mythologizing of a developer than to the objective quality of his work, what remains is just that. A fleeting but successful homage to times gone by. The tested version is 1.0 Price: 0.79 App Store links", "date": "2011-01-18", "grade": "7.3"}
