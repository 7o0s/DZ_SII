Born as a significant Sony exclusive, very close to the artistic drifts that the Japanese giant tries to include in its titles, it had then disappeared from the radar after an announcement and a few other rumors. Given up for lost, it finally returned forcefully on everyone's lips without exclusivity and with a new launch window on the market. We have already played and enjoyed it in May in its PC version and now we have embarked on the test of the conversion for Nintendo's new hybrid console. The difficulty of this review plays on this: if on the one hand the incarnations of RiME released in recent months suffer from just a few technical problems, the new edition is a total disaster, the likes of which have not been seen for some time. I write you a song It's incredibly difficult to talk about RiME's story arc without spoiling its (few) surprises. Tequila Works' puzzle game takes up the stylistic features of adventures with strong emotional and artistic potential, combining elements ranging from ICO to any of the works of ThatGameCompany, the Journey team. In short, RiME tells the story of a child's journey into a particular world, made up of colorful landscapes and guiding animals. However, a world that changes and that from the serenity of the first moments moves more and more towards the gloom of the final phases, because what it wants to convey to us is the self-awareness that man must achieve in some specific situations, however bad this can do and how much suffering you experience along the way. It is impossible to say anything else without ruining the experience for the player, just as it is extremely understandable to understand what it is if you have played RiME. The whole thread of the adventure - in its six, eight hours necessary to complete it by also collecting the various collectibles - revolves around a single, great purpose: advancement. Everything works according to a very simple puzzle game logic, but what is not convincing in the first half of the adventure is the desire to lengthen the broth in an interminable way. Only a few long and repeated phases lead the overall duration to rise for a title that could have lasted at least a couple of hours less. The situation changes markedly when advancing towards the last chapters, with the fourth in particular which can easily be considered one of the moments with the greatest visual and narrative impact in recent years. It is exclusively on this that the RiME game is played: the lack of foresight or perhaps the desire to give the player too much time to metabolize the journey, not taking into account that only the last minutes of the epilogue really tell the reality of the world you have previously known. Mirror game RiME's gameplay certainly doesn't shine for its originality, but it amalgamates some puzzle game styles in a rather interesting way. Within areas that are always rather large, what you are required to do is play with the perspective of the objects: for this reason, most of the puzzles that will allow you to continue are games of shadows on walls to be positioned in the right way, or the movement of objects in such a way as to be able to use altars to align them perspectively and create doors where they were not initially foreseen. Only going forward in the adventure will you come into contact with a third element: a sort of sentinel of the forgotten world in which we find ourselves, which can be used as a sidekick for solving puzzles and which will not fail to snatch more than a tear in the moment in which his purpose and that of his entire race will be discovered. In its gameplay RiME behaves discreetly: it's fun to play and never frustrating because it carefully avoids becoming too bizarre, but rather gives clues after clues that make progress pleasant and relaxing. What doesn't work, as we said earlier, is the immoderate amount of similar situations that arise especially in the first half of the adventure, the more colorful and less intense from an emotional point of view. Not pursuing a real purpose and not knowing anything about the protagonist's background, we simply find ourselves following a fox who represents the spirit guide, solving often similar puzzles, but without the coveted sugar of success. This problem, although it does not change the general quality of a title which is in all respects a small pearl of our time, at the same time fails to make it emerge above the other exponents of the genre. So be aware that RiME has neither the poetically coherent impact throughout its duration of Abzu, nor the irrepressible force of the situations that arise in Inside. What qThis is due to development problems or to a less cautious overall vision of the team we will certainly not be able to know. In any case, the Tequila Works title remains a recommended experience for all lovers of this genre, as long as you do not decide to play it on Switch (but we have dedicated a box below for this). A beautiful world that goes to jerky Let's start at the end: RiME has some obvious technical problems. Whichever version you choose, we are certainly not talking about a title that is unrivaled in terms of optimization. Although this seems to be a prerogative and curse of almost all games belonging to the genre, the major problem you will encounter during the adventure consists in a series of frame rate drops which are often annoying. Nothing that affects the gameplay experience, but it is sad to see poetically high moments dampened by a dancer frame rate, which does not allow you to enjoy the best shots and extraordinary music. From a visual point of view, RiME is a poem: the settings initials linked to the reality of memories of a place that is incredibly similar to the various Greek islands, gradually gives way to more dreamlike ruins and areas far from reality. This whole process, inextricably linked to the story that RiME wants to tell, is a feast for the eyes, which culminates in a chapter in the rain that no player will easily forget, to then return to the beginning, where it all began, to close the accounts and give the final blow. The color palette and the style used only embellish a delightful visual aspect, which brings RiME closer to a magnificently made watercolor, embellished with animations that are not varied, but excellently done. An evocative soundtrack closes the circle and is able to convey more than a thrill, provided that you are people who are still able to get excited and who have understood how the video game is, to all intents and purposes, an extraordinary form of art. The Switch disaster Although the code provided for this review specifically referred to the Nintendo Switch edition of the title, having already played the PC version months ago, it would have been unfair to bury a work with an insufficiency that simply does not deserve it. For this reason we have decided to dedicate a brief study to the Switch version to explain the tragic situation in which it finds itself. Despite the months of delay, the porting of the title is evidently done without any logic, with a code taken from scratch and slammed onto a platform that is profoundly different from those that already hosted it. It is incredible to see how in visual terms, what we knew about RiME remain faded images characterized by an aliasing beyond any human conception, seasoned by interpenetrations and frame rate drops that come to be, in the worst situations, real freezes resulting in an application crash. The controls respond with a decent input lag and the possibility of finding yourself in endless drops that force you to reload the game over and over again is just the tip of the iceberg of one of the worst conversions we've seen in recent years. It's a real shame, because RiMe deserves much more and because the six months since its release are even less justifiable after such an experience. We hope that at least some of the problems can be solved, but we strongly doubt that some patch can fix a general situation that is paradoxical and that we cannot explain how it can be accepted on the Nintendo store in this state.", "date": "2017-11-13", "grade": "8.0"}
