Without a doubt Osmos is not the typical video game that we are used to know; the concept, minimalist and original, puts in fact the control of a particle, a sort of cell or something like that. The goal is basically to increase one's size by coming into contact with other smaller particles, and at the same time avoiding a similar end by staying away from larger ones. A fundamental rule, on which however the programmers were able to develop decidedly interesting elements. Big eats small Among these aspects, the completely unconventional control system must certainly be mentioned; in fact, to move your particle you need to touch the screen opposite to where you want to go. This is because this touch determines the expulsion of a small percentage of the mass of one's own cell, such as to generate a slight propulsive thrust capable of generating movement. Certainly the touches can be repeated to progressively increase this thrust and therefore the speed of movement, but this conversely determines a greater loss of mass, thus affecting precisely those dimensions which constitute a cornerstone of the gameplay. Being able to incorporate smaller elements than your own particle (distinguished by the blue color) is in fact always the key to completing each level, as well as the need to avoid the larger ones (red) which would end up sucking up your sphere until game over. Another very important component is physics, or rather gravity which governs all movements and which determines the inertia in the reactions of its own particle, as well as the force of attraction which instead dominates in some sections. Similar speech in relation to the ability to control the speed of the passage of time, simply by dragging your finger left or right; a very useful option during passages that need greater precision. Although the key elements of Osmos are therefore pleasant and interesting, it is clear that a minimum of structure and diversification of objectives is essential to ensure sufficient variety. In reality, something more could have been done in this sense, because although there are more or less subtle directives between one level and another, it is equally true that a certain basic repetitiveness does not take long to manifest itself. In reality, however, it is the approach to Osmos that can make the difference; because the effort of Hemisphere Games is certainly a product that should be enjoyed in small bites, with short sessions and placing as a priority the desire to experience a meditative and staid, almost zen, gameplay. Of the same stuff is also the soundtrack, an electronic ambient that discreetly and elegantly supports the equally stylish graphic design.
