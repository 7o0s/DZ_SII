{"name": "Runaway 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/runaway-2-recensione.html", "text": "The return of Brian and Gina One of the most important things of a graphic adventure is undoubtedly the plot, which, since it cannot be supported by action or characteristic elements of other genres, must practically hold up the whole barrack by itself, keeping the player's interest always high, exactly like should make a movie or a book. In Runaway 2 we find Brian Bosco, the Berkeley student whose life was turned upside down in the first chapter of the saga by the beautiful and mysterious Gina, an attractive girl who dragged Brian into a whirlwind of intrigues, secrets and oddities. At the beginning of the game our ex-nerd is convinced by Gina to take an excursion to the Hawaiian island of Mala to visit an ancient temple. Things, of course, all go wrong, and the plane crashes just before reaching its destination, forcing Brian to throw Gina out with the only remaining parachute, and hope for a painless crash. After the rather forced and not particularly inspired incipit, the plot unravels a bit with difficulty, leaving the player in a sort of confusion until at least halfway through the game, and barely managing to capture the interest. The dialogues do not help, and are indeed a little too flat and not very pungent. The characters that you meet gradually are certainly funny but trivially characterized, and in principle each represent a precise stereotype that knows already seen. the characters that you meet hand in hand are certainly funny but trivially characterized The return of Brian and Gina The humor fed to us by Pendulo Studios often manages to elicit a laugh, especially in the interlude scenes, fundamental elements of every self-respecting point and click. The quality of the puzzles fluctuates: we pass nonchalantly from well-structured and tasty puzzles to others that are not very logical and frustrating (fortunately the latter are the least part). Furthermore, inexplicably, some of them necessarily require you to go on trying to find the right solution after having excluded all the wrong ones: this strongly penalizes that taste for racking your brain to find the solution intelligently. A quite serious design problem is given by the fact that many times it is not possible to identify the necessary objects in the scenario, given that these are perfectly ~incorporated~ in the setting or even hidden, and do not catch the eye in any way other than randomly hovering over it with the mouse. If on the one hand this is a welcome injection of realism, on the other hand a more rational, or at least more ~user friendly~ positioning of the objects would have been very welcome. Another of the problems that could be encountered by playing Runaway 2 is the atmosphere, which sometimes risks being quite childish in the eyes of players with a few more years on their shoulders. The longevity of Runaway 2 is at good levels: it will take the average adventurer about 15 hours to complete the game. After that, he will put it back in the case forever: the replay value is practically nil. Graphics and sound Technically speaking, Runaway 2's graphics are just okay. The resolution is fixed at 1024x768 (which is not the best for those who have a panel with a higher native resolution), the style used is that of cel-shading, to make the most of the cartoonish look, and there are no effects details. From an artistic point of view, however, things improve substantially: the environments are very detailed, well-kept, colorful and pleasant to look at, and the design of the characters is very spot on and fun. The sound can boast a decent Italian dubbing and pleasant original music. Runaway 2 also has an ~old style~ package, far from the minimalism currently in vogue: in addition to a manual in Italian rich in content and beautiful to look at, we note the presence of an art book and a brochure for clues. System requirements Minimum Requirements: Operating System: Windows XP/Vista Processor: Pentium III 1 GHz RAM: 512 MB Video Card: 8 MB Disk Space: 1.8 GB Recommended Requirements: Processor: Any released in the last 2 years RAM: 1 GB Video Card: X1600 or equivalent Test Configuration: Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo E6400@3,3 GHz RAM: 2 GB Video Card: Ati X1950Pro Monitor: Dell 24@1920x1200 Comment Runaway 2 is an adventure without exaggerated pretensions. An enjoyable gaming experience, with fresh and cheerful graphics, a discreet plot, and no trace of that seriousness, sometimes out of place, which is often seen in the latest titles belonging to the same genre. Penalized by some really too frustrating puzzles and poorly chosen design choices, Runaway 2 failsto earn a place in the Olympus of graphic adventures, but on the other hand it is a place created and hermetically sealed already many years ago by a certain Lucasfilm Games. That said, any point-and-click adventure enthusiast should give the game at least a chance, perhaps more for the objective scarcity of similar titles on the market than for the merits (however undeniable) of Pendulo Studios. And don't forget that the first Runaway is included in the box, giving players the chance to relive the entire saga. Pros Nice and colorful graphics Fair humor The first Runaway is included in the package Cons Some puzzles poorly balanced and too frustrating Several design errors Not great plot development Runaway 2 belongs to a genre that saw its golden age about 15 years ago, and which then slowly and gradually disappeared, relegated to the release of sporadic titles such as Syberia, Still Life, Ni-Bi-Ru or the first Runaway. True enthusiasts of point and click graphic adventures probably belong to the last generation of gamers, and they know well that the opportunities to enjoy a good adventure are less and less. Those who are interested pay attention to what will follow: perhaps it will be the right opportunity to immerse yourself again in this world totally devoid of frenzy and action but full of imagination and fun.", "date": "2007-08-01", "grade": null}
