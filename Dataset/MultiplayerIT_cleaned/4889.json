This is STRAFE, the most advanced game of 1996, a marvel of technology and violence that calculates progress in gallons of spilled blood, filling the ether with the crackling sound of an old modem. STRAFE, also known as the best shooter of 1996, is finally here The most advanced game of 1996 STRAFE undoubtedly achieves its goal of being the most advanced and violent game of 1996. The problem is that the current year is 2017 and, with this knowledge in mind, we are faced with a modest title that genuinely evokes the atmospheres of the first two Quakes and fielding very similar weapons, characterized by the importance of timing. In addition to this, it adds to the classic recipe a lot of blood, localized damage that causes limbs to fall and some apt quotes, all wrapped up in a roguelike structure, with only one life and no chance to save, which fits quite well with the shooter formula in old fashioned first person. The procedurally generated levels, the variable degree of challenge, the modifications to the weapons and the pieces of equipment do not distort the heart of pure vintage FPS, complete with colored keys that allow access to new areas of a level, and give the title that pinch of modernity that is necessary, both in mechanics and in controls, to ensure that today's audience is able to digest it. Of course, the roguelike formula, with its high rate of randomness due to drops and the layout of the maps, is not the most competitive out there, but the level of challenge is high and grows further in a particular horde mode which guarantees lovers of record the chance to stand out from the crowd. What is missing is the multiplayer, despite the uploads accompanied by the sound of an old modem, but the choice not to implement it, at least for now, undoubtedly makes sense given the intentionally chaotic soul and structure of the game. Perhaps a cooperative component would not have been bad, perhaps in a separate mode given the roguelike philosophy which bases a large part of the difficulty on granting only one life, but STRAFE makes up for the absence of online with a gameplay that is more deeper than it seems. It's based on the old-school adrenaline-pumping shooter and it's a school that's as simple on paper as it is difficult to master, centered around quick movement and quick retreats, weapons to be used with perfect timing, and tons of monsters. These, it must be said, are controlled by an artificial intelligence that does the bare minimum to allow enemies to reach or shoot us, allowing us to easily set traps, but numbers and types of enemies, which include robust insectoids and giant robot spiders, are studied to always put us in trouble. We can also throw objects and rely on the secondary fire of weapons to face levels sprinkled with pools of acid and populated by traps that shoot a sort of plasma capable of pursuing us and making the affected terrain impassable. But the blood shed by enemies can cover both harmful substances and it is a detail to keep in mind when the passages get narrow and it may happen that it is not possible to avoid such threats. Sometimes, however, it is sufficient to resort to the strafe jump, the particular technique typical of Quake which allows you to move faster by jumping, even if in STRAFE it is not easy to master given too marked side skids. Furthermore, the spartan graphics make it difficult to properly exploit the headshot, a peculiarity of slightly more recent first-person shooters, although practice helps to compensate for the intrinsic lack of precision of an engine that has the advantage of running on a huge number of configurations . It also helps us with various mechanics that make the gameplay even more multifaceted. In STRAFE we don't talk, we shoot The STRAFE campaign starts from the classic space station infested with monsters and robots and is made up of four areas divided into as many levels full of monsters that often come out of the doors that we open with the appropriate colored keys or from hidden niches. Surprise is always around the corner or hanging from the ceiling for a challenge that is undoubtedly high, even if there is no shortage of possibilities which, exploited with skill, can help us push ourselves ever further forward. The available resources include the possibility to choose a weapon at the beginning, a shop, stationsystems of care and replenishment that work by spending the scrap recovered by playing and upgrade stations that allow us to change the functioning of the weapons and grenades that often constitute their secondary fire. Finally there are the objects, accessible by holding down Z, which can be purchased from a shop located at the end of the second level of each sector, a fundamental refreshment place that allows us to exploit the scrap collected after having transformed it into currency. The areas, we have said, are four, all differentiated by setting and enemies, although the structure of the environments and the soldiers do not offer a great variety; and this is one of the weak points. Always changing radically is the availability of medikits, refueling stations and objects dropped by killed enemies who can give us a missile launcher a few seconds from the start as well as leave us without shots, making the difficulty decidedly fluctuating. However, it must be said that with sixteen maps to cross, individual skill undoubtedly has a great deal of weight for a title which, we seem to have already made it clear, is really difficult to complete. And this, given the genre we're talking about, doesn't surprise us, as we were surprised by the many secrets that include a Wolfenstein-related mini-game and some other surprises that we reserve ourselves from revealing. For the rest we are faced with a title that mixes old and modern, even in the techno soundtrack, combining a vintage soul to the core with goodies such as the map that can be viewed in the game through a viewer placed on the arm. The result is a hybrid suspended in time, on the one hand deliberately crude and on the other capable of recalling the past without forcing us to suffer too many compromises in terms of controls, game possibilities and overall experience. An experience that includes a couple of extra modes accessible from an interface that asks us to launch an executable to load two types of timed challenges and a particular horde mode that actually relies on the gallons of spilled blood. In this mode, progress is divided into rooms that open onto a central area where we find ourselves repeatedly facing the most numerous and fearsome waves. To help us are a comfortable selector for sound tracks, infinite bullets, a time lapse to prepare after completing a horde and a sound effect that signals the death of enemies, helping us a lot in a title that often overwhelms the senses of the game. player making it difficult to understand what is happening. But all these luxuries come with an even higher difficulty that promises to keep you engaged for a long time. In short, the overall offer exists and although it is not particularly varied in dynamics, it can count on a basis which, as we have said, is deeper than it appears. If we add to all this the soundtrack, repetitive but undoubtedly spot on, and a long series of additions, which include tutorials with eighties-style videos and intros for the secondary modes, we can only confirm our previous impressions for a release final still imperfect from the point of view of bugs and glitches, but without a doubt more refined than the beta. The graphics are spartan, so much so that the option to make it worse makes it somehow more fascinating, but it is a choice that is part of the game like the quotes, silent monsters, goodies and rampant irony. Instead, we were blown away by the lack of the Italian language, given that it is present in the details of Steam, but the dialogues are non-existent and the options are decidedly simple to understand.", "date": "2017-05-09", "grade": "8.0"}
