Another generation has passed in a flash and Sucker Punch opens and closes an incredible journey made by Sony over the years. At such a long distance from Infamous: Second Son and First Light, the American developer takes the definitive gamble for the leap in quality. In the wake of the great productions of the Santa Monica cousins and Naughty Dog, Sucker Punch also tries to surprise visually and narratively, not without leaving a bad taste in the mouth in some respects. If, as we believe, you have already peeked at the number at the bottom, you you may be wondering what could have taken Ghost of Tsushima away from total excellence and this review is here to explain it to you. Story: The Specter of Tsushima Ever since its announcement, Ghost of Tsushima has always been presented as an open world action-adventure game set on the Japanese island of Tsushima during the time of the Mongol conquests. Regardless of how plausible or fictional there may be in the re-proposition of events and places, what is right to make it clear right away is that this work is an evident Western declaration of love for a certain cinematic way of representing the Orient . The atmosphere of feudal Japan, its strict but fascinating traditions, its philosophy that can be found even only in the way of dialogue, are all details captured by the guys at Sucker Punch and inserted into their new IP with great skill. The narration is rather linear, not never really managing - apart from a couple of very inspired moments - to leave its mark as it should, often getting lost in not very sharp dialogues and coming to lose some of its bite along the way. Despite the rather limited longevity - we are talking about fifteen abundant hours of gameplay to conclude the Ghost of Tsushima campaign alone - the script and the plot concocted by the American boys runs smoothly and puts on the screen an all in all epic story, but not for this it keeps pace with works such as The Last of Us Part II. Given the caliber of the production, this comparison also seems unfair to us, because the difference in approach, genre and even budget is evident, but it is also true that the placement on the market so close to Naughty Dog's masterpiece necessarily leads to compare the two works. Jin is a samurai, raised as such by his uncle, lord and protector of the island of Tsushima. As a samurai, he shuns everything he doesn't consider worthy of honor and, for this reason, he decides to face the Khotun Khan face to face after his uncle's kidnapping. Things don't go as planned and, presumed dead, he will instead be recovered in the water by Yuna, a mysterious woman and above all a thief. Jin's life debt to her will lead him to help her and form a common front against the Mongol invasion, even if that means accepting some dishonorable practices. Over time Jin will learn about the way of the spectrum and will understand that he has to make use of it, even at the cost of disappointing his uncle. From these premises a journey begins made of recruiting some allies and regular and cadenced reconquest of the Tsushima territory. The whole island turns into the battlefield of the Mongol-Japanese War, but also the path of growth and change of Jin. If these premises are interesting and powerful, considering the initial psychological division of the character, it is the writing that does not always keep up, soon turning into a race without brakes towards an inevitable and all too little justified change. The will to push on duality between ghost and samurai, as well as on loyalty to his uncle or to the mission of saving the island, he really fails to leave much in the hands of the player, who does not really feel Jin's journey and, equally, has no choice in which direction to take . Contrary to what we had been made to understand, our ability to model Jin only affects the priority with which to decide to unlock the various techniques, guiltily leaving aside all the narrative implications. This detail would not necessarily be a bad thing , except that Ghost of Tsushima wants to be first of all a title with a cinematographic cut, even confirmed by some stylistic choices that bring it together (sometimes pleasantly, others much less so) with that oriental cinema so dear to master Kurosawa to the point of dedicate a specific mode to him. Ghost of Tsushima is deceptive from this point of view, because with its glimpses, its particular initial directorial choices (leaving out a not exactly exciting prologue) and a slyly diluita, try to drag the player into his ~stories~: the real missions. As a year ago Days Gone told his stories, Sucker Punch also combines main and secondary, myth and legend, giving some great highs, and many lower moments. We will not reveal anything about the ending and the more particular stories. However, know that, once you reach the end, you can count on the fingers of one hand those that are really successful and that you will remember over time. Samurai or specter Everything we have said from a narrative point of view does not necessarily have to obscure some important and successful elements of the production. Ghost of Tsushima has all the appearance of being a step forward in the growth of Sucker Punch, but what doesn't add up is the inability to always amalgamate the various elements. From this point of view Infamous was certainly more square and coherent with itself, albeit much less ambitious. This ambition is precisely the double-edged sword of the game: on the one hand the will and eagerness to surprise and on the other the awareness of still wanting to please everyone, without too many frills. We are certainly talking about an open world and, as such , subject to some rules that are now sufficiently established: elements repeated on the map, outposts, places to free, collectibles to collect (a lot and all beautifully described) and statistics and techniques to increase, as well as an inventory to expand and upgrade. All these elements, more or less, respond to a specific choice of the development team: to eliminate the classic indicators on the screen and take advantage of the splendid wind created with the game engine to get to the destination. This mechanic, introduced in the very first bars, will represent in all respects the equivalent of the classic GPS so dear to the genre but, on closer inspection, what is missing is the courage to treat it as a simple natural element. It almost seems that, to prevent players from getting confused, Sucker Punch has decided to simplify the mechanics along the way, turning an interesting idea into a surrogate for the classic minimap indicator. Despite this, which is certainly one of the most insignificant details, the exploration and unlocking of the map reacts to our precise passage. Going around Tsushima means meeting a myriad of points of interest, places to recover collectibles, shrines, spas, fox dens, scalable walls, NPCs able to give us secondary missions and more or less large meeting places where to find vendors and blacksmiths of different kind. From the latter you can upgrade your katana and dagger, increase the capabilities of your throwing weapons or armor and trade today to sell. Talk about Open World Each of these customization pieces requires a specific task to be completed to be recovered and then a series of materials and supplies for the upgrade. The differences are not only aesthetic but are also based on a series of perks that are activated more or less passively once a specific garment is worn. In detail, there are armors that can increase your stealth rate, those that dramatically increase your total health, or on the contrary those that actively help you in battle. The number of weapons and armor is not exorbitant, but the care placed in the reproduction is maniacal and is paired with all the attention paid to the stylistic aspect, the real flagship of the production. During your journey in Ghost of Tsushima together with Jin you can find yourself riding through the rice fields of the island, climbing in search of ancient forgotten sanctuaries or, on the contrary, leaving for remote places known only from the tales of old bards. The first hours of the adventure bode well for a structure that could slowly explode for good, but which unfortunately never reaches that excellence in situations and variety that allow it to compete on an equal footing with the sacred monsters of the open narrative world of today. Emblematic in this sense are the clashes with the bosses, interesting as always with regard to the setting and staging, but which do not give the right depth. Fighting in close quarters and only with the possibility of parrying and counterattacking closely resembles what From Software did a little over a year ago with Sekiro. In comparison with Miyazaki's work, Ghost of Tsushima shows off all its nature as a ~title for everyone~, proving to be fun and accessible, but sacrificing its depth a bit for this. Sucker Punch has attempted to combine different styles in his new work: stealth, action, free flow and ranged combat, failing however to give the maximum in nessone of these, but trying to amalgamate everything in a single huge cauldron that responds to the only real rule: that of the pleasure of the general public. Fighting becomes an automatic action, certainly fun and stimulating but often plagued by an incomprehensible lack of lock on that sends the camera into confusion. The ability to direct the shot with the left analog is not enough, due to a repeated lack of precision. Growth skills, techniques and choices Going forward in the adventure and killing the Mongol ~chiefs~, it will be possible to unlock different stances for the sword, each of which is effective against one of the four types of enemies you will encounter. This interesting and well-crafted detail is another of those elements that risk hiding an incredibly fun play structure in the shadows, but which only requires you to attack, break your guard and kill, without giving the player a great sense of progression. As for the skills and techniques, Jin is able to acquire skills of all kinds ranging from the roll to the lunges, passing through the number of consecutive stealth kills to get to the mythical blows. A plethora of upgrades, which can be acquired through the use of skill points, which imply maniacal care in personalizing our alter ego. More than seventy skills, one different from the other but which are not always useful, leading us to use a handful assiduously. On the other hand it is also true that we are certainly not dealing with a title with a high rate of challenge. In Ghost of Tsushima you die, but most of the time it happens due to the lock on and sporadically due to some perfect-not-so-perfect save. The emblem of the Ghost of Tsushima gameplay, very interesting but which does not make the game stand out from the rest of its category, is represented by a very advanced boss fight which, due to an incomprehensible play structure, turns from one moment to the next into a normal fight against a common opponent, solely and solely due to an inability to amalgamate the interesting gameplay ideas. Does this succession of considerations made of pros and cons mean that Ghost of Tsushima is a bad video game? Absolutely not. All lovers of the classic open world and feudal Japan could easily find those elements that will push them to obsessively accumulate hours within an almost always very beautiful map. The fun in achieving the objectives and the consequent satisfaction of the growth of the character are all elements that give Ghost of Tsushima an interesting and positive airiness. Rather what we regret and regret is the great potential that can be perceived in every element of the design, which however turns into a good experience and nothing more. It really could have been a memorable title. PhotoMode Photo Mode lovers will surely be delighted by the possibilities given by Ghost of Tsushima. For our part, we have never seen such extreme attention to detail. Simply press a button at any point in your game to stop the action and take control of the virtual camera. Packed full of effects and also capable of handling real-time generation of atmospheric elements, time changes and elements such as leaves, birds and flowers, even those who are not accustomed to this type of mechanics could end up spending several hours in this mode. Technical and aesthetic aspects Ghost of Tsushima is generally very nice to look at. The stylistic research and reproduction of Japan is among the most interesting that we have ever seen. Clever direction often tends to keep long or medium shots, so as not to linger on the models and expressions of the characters, which instead leave more than perplexed. This detail goes well with a desire to recall large spaces and immense expanses, even if at times it betrays the desire to be based on a certain type of cinema which, like the western of the past, also featured very tight close-ups. The saturation of the world game, interesting in some situations and totally dependent on personal taste, tends to exaggerate on some specific occasions, ending up ruining some areas and also creating some visual disturbance. As far as fluidity is concerned, the game behaves very well, at least on PS4 Pro, always remaining stable and without suffering even sporadic drops. From an audio point of view, we go from very high quality elements such as the (few) music to effects that instead it is not always exciting, especially in the differentiation of the various types of weapons.
