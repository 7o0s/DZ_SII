This is a real jolt since its arrival coincides with the year of the Mammoth and, consequently, with the exit from the standard format of all the cards from the Grand Tournament expansion and from the adventures Blackrock Mountain and League of Explorers: cards such as Thaurissan, Brann Bronzebeard but, above all, Reno Jackson, loved and hated by Hearthstone players for his ability to restore all life points in one fell swoop and, therefore, to overturn a game compromised by a aggressive deck. A farewell, all in all, necessary to change a metagame that had been stagnant for months in which one game out of three was played against the Pirate Warrior deck and the alternatives were the sorcerer decks with Reno Jackson (Renolock), those of the jade golems for the druid and the one with dragons for the priest. A handful of brave players also played the thief and by now paladins and hunters had practically disappeared. The setting of the expansion, known by every World of Warcraft player in the growth phase of the character, is the Un'Goro Crater therefore, already from the announcement, it was reasonable to expect a massive presence of dinosaurs, elementals and poisonous plants: the wait did not disappoint and throughout the month of March cards were revealed through direct events from Blizzard, videos from famous streamers or some specialized press bodies, as happened to us too. Not only that, Blizzard also showed some cards through five fun web episodes in which the protagonist, Doctor Doyle, explores the Un'Goro area by getting to know very particular animals. Journey to Un'Goro carries the weight of the relaunch of the Blizzard-branded card game on his shoulders which, although it has not lost its appeal and is firmly among the top three most broadcast games worldwide, is still losing some pieces in favor than other similar titles, produced by fierce competition. Let's try to understand what innovations this expansion introduces and what possible scenarios may emerge in the coming months. Journey to Un'Goro introduces new Quest cards that revolutionize the metagame A legendary quest Journey to Un'Goro introduces two new features, the ~Adapt~ mechanic and quests. The first is not a real revolution and can be seen, in terms of gameplay, as a simple variant of the Discover mechanic: when you play a creature with the ~suitable keyword~ three abilities are randomly proposed, in a shortlist of 10 possible, of which you choose one to cast on the creature. These skills are +1+1, Poison, Cover for one turn, Divine Shield, Windfury, Taunt, Cannot be targeted by spells or hero power, +3 Health, +3 Attack, and Deathrattle: Summon two plants 1 /1. The other novelty introduced is a new type of legendary card, the Mission: it is a spell that costs 1 mana and which, if present in the deck, is always proposed in the choice of starting cards, you are not obliged to keep it and you can replace it with the normal use of the ~mulligan~. There are nine missions, one for each class and, essentially, they guide the player towards the construction of a deck whose main purpose is to complete the mission in the shortest possible time since the reward has an important impact on the final outcome of the game . Reaching the Core is the mission of the warrior and to complete it you will have to play 7 minions with provocation: the reward is the Sulfuras, a weapon that costs 3 mana and is 4/2, when it enters the game it replaces your hero power with another one that deals 8 damage to a random enemy target (basically gives you the ability of its master Ragnaros that has gone wild). Making the Sacrifice is the sorcerer's mission and requires building a ~discard~ deck since its completion requires the discarding of 6: the reward is the Nether Portal, a spell that costs 5, remains permanently on the ground taking up a space of the 7 available to minions and summon two 3/2 Imps at the end of each turn. The shaman who wants to complete Gather the Murlocs will have to compose a deck full of these cute amphibians with their unmistakable cry, it takes 10 of them and the reward is Megafin, a 5-cost 8/8 Murloc that fills your hand with random Murlocs when evoked. Instead, the druid needs to summon 5 minions with at least 5 on attack to complete Call Giants, a quest whose reward is Barnabus, a 5-cost 8/8 beast that reduces the cost of all to zero upon entry into play. minions in your deck. ANDelemental's karma Let's continue the overview of the missions with that of the thief who, within a few hours of the expansion's release, has already reached such popularity as to let us encounter a deck that contains it every 3 games: Exploring the Abyss requires you to play 4 times the same card to gain access to the Crystalline Core, a 5-cost spell that transforms the attack and defense of all your minions into 5/5, wherever they are. The hunter's mission is Attract the Queen and is activated when 7 1-cost minions are played: the reward is Queen Carnassa, a 5-cost 8/8 beast that puts 15 3/2 raptors into the deck when she enters the battlefield. Cost 1 with Battlecry: Draw a card. The paladin sees the rebirth of the ~buffadin~ archetype and it will therefore be necessary to play 6 spells on his minions to complete Unearth the Kaleidosaurus: the reward is Galvadon a 5/5 beast that adapts 5 times when he enters the field. The quests for the control decks have been left to the priest and the mage. Fans of Anduin and Tyrande will need to build a deck in Deathrattles and play at least 7 minions with this ability to complete Awaken the Creators: the reward is the Bitter Guardian (not to be tasted) a 5-cost 8/8 whose particular battle cry sets your health to 40 life. The last mission is that of the magician, it's called Opening the Portal and to complete it successfully you will have to cast 6 spells not present in the initial list of the deck (for example taking them from cards such as the Chattering Book or the Tome of the Cabalist): the reward is Time Warp, a spell that allows you to take an extra turn at the end of the one you played it. The expansion, in full respect of the setting, is also chock full of beast-type and elemental-type minions. Precisely for this last type, Blizzard has inserted a mechanic in the battle cry that activates its effect only if in the previous turn you have played an elemental: for example, the Spargifuoco is a 7-mana 6/6 neutral elemental which at its Entry deals 5 damage to a target, but only if you played any elemental in the previous turn. The Metagame In these very first days, exactly what the developers wanted is happening and that is for the metagame to change. However, even though as mentioned it seems that the thief deck with its new mission is going very strong, the warrior pirates archetype still holds up as it has lost practically nothing with the card rotation. It's still early to say if Journey to Un'Goro will be able to put Hearthstone back on the right track by making some pro-players who have recently left returning to play but there is no doubt that the random component has been partially contained and, this, is a moment of turmoil creative in which a further upward peak can be expected. The illustrations of the cards, which mainly depict dinosaurs, elementals and plants, and the animations with which both the minions and the quests enter the field are truly beautiful and always of the very high quality to which Blzzard has accustomed us. Despite this, we must say that Viaggio a Un'Goro is essentially a ~more of the same~ and less ~beginner friendly~ than usual. As regards this last aspect, the situation for new players or for those who have always played without paying is not the best. The adventures also had the function of letting the players ~breathe~ who limited themselves, for a certain period of time, to accumulating a total of coins in play necessary for the purchase of wings (making sure of all the cards of the proposed content) while, from now, getting all the cards without adventures and with three expansions a year will be a really difficult undertaking. Just to let the numbers speak for themselves, the chance of randomly finding a legendary card is 1 every 25 open packs (also verified by us) and, in Journey to Un'Goro, there are 23: three expansions in a year could mean a total of about 70 legendary! We hope that Blizzard listens to the numerous complaints made by the community and comes up with something to increase the number of booster packs you can get for free. A good start might be to switch the brawl reward to winning a booster pack from the latest expansion instead of a booster pack from the core set.", "date": "2017-04-10", "grade": "8.0"}
