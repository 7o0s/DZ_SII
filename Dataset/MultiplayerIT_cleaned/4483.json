The series includes, in order of release, Bridge Constructor, Bridge Constructor Playground, Bridge Constructor Medieval and Bridge Constructor Stunts, which also show the progressive attempt to cushion the too serious impact of the theme addressed, so as to try to reach a wider audience . However, although it cannot be counted among the most famous in the gaming industry, it must be said that the Bridge Constructor series has a good number of fans, as demonstrated by the sales of some chapters (the first has placed almost 300,000 copies overall). This is to say that ClockStone, however small, is not a software house made up of amateurs in the fray, but one with its own pedigree, even if it has chosen to specialize and go to satisfy only a certain niche of gamers. The leap, if we want to call it that, was made with Bridge Constructor Portal which, having a famous license, suddenly made the magic of bridge construction discover to a wider audience, indeed arousing quite a few controversies. By now, announcing something related to an intellectual property of Valve means going up against all those disappointed people who would like to see Gabe and his associates go back to making traditional video games, as indeed are the two Portals, rightly put by many of the absolute masterpieces of the our industry. However, the right recriminations must not undermine the work of those who actually have nothing to do with the whole matter, who must not end up paying for the choices made by others ... also because Bridge Constructor Portal is a more than decent title and made with great intelligence. Building bridges The gameplay of Bridge Constructor Portal is essentially focused on the simple mechanics described at the beginning of the previous paragraph, with some innovations compared to the other titles in the series, which guess what they are? Yes, as in the original Portals, here too there are portals that function as a link to distant points in space. This is a feature that complicates life quite a bit, even if you are an expert bridge builder, especially when trying to complete the game 100%. In fact, each level must be overcome in two ways: first you need to be able to get a single vehicle to pass, then an entire caravan. The first solution allows you to advance to the next level, but only the second one allows you to actually complete all the objectives. Obviously the transit of a caravan involves having to deal with advanced problems. For example, a bridge that can hold a single machine may not be able to hold more; or, a cross jump could turn out to be a lethal trap when crossed alternately by several vehicles. In short, the sixty levels are largely redone twice, with the advanced ones requiring profound revisions between the basic and the advanced solution. But how are bridges built? Easy: first you need to place the platforms, possibly in the right places, then you have to support them with tie rods or with supports built using other structures. Don't worry, because in the first levels GlaDOS accurately explains all the basic concepts needed to play, also giving us some advice. Nevertheless, you will soon find yourself facing puzzles that require a lot of thinking, especially when you have to consider the presence of advanced obstacles such as a large number of crossed portals, the classic and very ruthless turrets or propulsion gels (those seen in Portal 2). In short, getting to the end is not easy at all and can take more or less hours depending on the player's intelligence and experience with other similar titles. Having tried another Bridge Constructor helps a lot, because it removes the obstacle of having to understand how to build a bridge effectively. Even a specific degree helps a lot, but it's not expressly required (joking). Fortunately, the game interface is designed very well and is clear right away, so as not to be an obstacle to getting caught up in the gameplay. Technically there is little to say about Bridge Constructor Portal: it does its thing, and the presence of GlaDOS and many other icons of the series creates a particularly enveloping and intriguing atmosphere. Paradoxically, it also makes it very fun to follow the very thin story told between the levels: without revealingThere too much, we could call it the story of a typical Aperture Science employee, starting with the job interviews. It's nothing earth-shattering, but it's well written and makes you want to go through the levels just to find out what GlaDOS will tell us.", "date": "2017-12-20", "grade": "8.0"}
