Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to shell out even a penny. The concept that accompanies Albert is simple, that is to put the player in the shoes of this funny character with tousled hair during his typical day, therefore in the activities that alternate from morning to evening. Everything takes place within fourteen different minigames, which must be unlocked gradually through the proven star system: the less time we take to complete each challenge in the best way, the higher our rating will be, from one to three stars. The first minigame, not surprisingly, is titled ~The Sleepyhead~ and is completely based on the touch screen: Albert is a very heavy sleeper and therefore alarm clocks abound in his bedroom; despite this, our goal is to turn them off as soon as they start playing, until silence is restored. Reluctantly, the character gets out of bed and goes to the bathroom, but where's the soap? So here is the second minigame, ~The bathroom~ in fact, in which we have to lead a bar of soap through a short maze by tilting the iPhone, until it reaches its destination. Albert is now awake, clean and ready to have breakfast, but he's not really an ace at making toast and therefore we have to help him take only the ones cooked to the right point, touching them with our fingers as they jump out of the toaster. The responsiveness of the touch controls is good, and it could not be otherwise given the promptness that is required to complete these challenges by obtaining the maximum score, however the precision leaves something to be desired, especially in the more advanced tests. Come on, Albert! The mini-games present in Albert are not only based on quick reflexes and precision, but also involve some visual puzzle element, such as when we have to match socks by eliminating the same pairs by dragging and dropping. The operation of watering the plants introduces the concept of ~malus~ for the first time: using the accelerometer we have to tilt the device to move the character while he is holding a vase and catch the raindrops as they fall, but at the same time at the same time avoid the dangerous shears that could make our seedling ~regress~. There is also room for the microphone, like when you find yourself walking Medor the dog and you have to call him back (whistling into the microphone) before he falls off a cliff but after he has picked up a bone on the ground. The subsequent tests are presented as a mix of these same elements: the race among insects, in which you have to clap your hands for our snail to overtake its opponents and cross the finish line first; the minigame of balloons, where the blow must be dosed so as not to burst our creation before it takes off; and the date, when Albert meets his fiance and ~collects~ some shooting stars for her. Isn't that romantic? Too bad that the aforementioned lack of precision of the controls becomes more pressing as the difficulty increases and therefore in the more advanced challenges, with many touches that go astray and therefore damage our performance rather than improve it. In such a situation, unfortunately, it becomes clear that completing certain challenges with honors will remain an impossible feat.", "date": "2012-03-10", "grade": "7.0"}
