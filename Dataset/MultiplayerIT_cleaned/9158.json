Zombie un altro successo in agguato?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/91091-dead-block-dopo-piante-vs-zombie-un-altro-successo-in-agguato.html", "text": "The Game is available for download via Xbox Live and PlayStation NetworkTested version: Xbox 360Lately zombies are a killer, we find them in all sorts of ways, from TV series to books and of course in video games. Dead Block sees them as opponents to fight but with an ironic meaning that closely resembles Plants vs. Zombie, will it be the same incredible success? Available through the digital delivery platforms Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network at a cost of 800 MP or 9.99 euros. Block 'em all! The starting point is very simple, our character must defend isolated locations from hungry hordes of zombies who do everything to exploit every entrance left unguarded. In the role of three different characters, the huge handyman Jack Foster, the fast boy scout Mike Bacon and the policewoman Foxy Jones, we must therefore equip each window and each door of the structures well, in order to delay the invasion of the room as much as possible by the zombie horde. To do this, the first step is to obtain the equipment to create traps and to seal the windows, the only possibility is to search precisely in the areas to be protected by destroying all the available structures, from machinery to kitchens, from beds to stoves. By breaking the furniture it is easy to find the wood to seal the windows, but inside them it is also possible to find the gears, indispensable elements for creating magnificent traps that slow down the undead considerably or block them completely. But what's the point of doing all this? In fact, the aim of the game is to find within the areas to be protected three elements that make up the kit of the perfect rocker: guitar, amplifier and a loudspeaker box. Once all the pieces have been found, you can play the music that crushes every opponent, the Rock 'n Roll! Once the pieces are reassembled and the guitar is held, in fact, the horde is eradicated by the melody that you need to play in a kind of guitar hero minigame but very very simple, essentially the right keys at the right time. Traps for all tastes The progress of the 10 available levels sees us starting from a well-done tutorial and then launching ourselves directly into the real adventure which involves the defense of increasingly large and complex places, from the garage to the hotel, to the record room. If at the beginning we command only one character, the huge handyman Jack Foster, later in the game the other two team members come to our aid, each with its own peculiarities. For example, Jack Foster is capable of building excellent anti-zombie structures simply with wood, while the boy scout is very fast in looking for objects inside the rooms and the traffic warden is the best in hand-to-hand combat. It is possible during the level to switch from one character to another in an instant by pressing the LB key in order to make the most of all the characteristics of each one, it is also possible to call the other team members in the room we are defending or exploring so they can help us out. We have not yet talked about close combat because in reality it is only the last chance and the least effective way to take out the opponents. Once you understand how to deal with the game action, it becomes clear that you need to destroy all the structures present in the rooms as quickly as possible in order to get wood and gears for the traps and immediately after to start guarding the first targeted accesses from the undead. Each of the three characters, in addition to reinforcing the windows with wooden planks, can set up three different ~slow down invasion~ traps, and obviously everyone has different ones. Jack Foster can install elements that instantly freeze anyone in the area, he can build a truly indestructible brick wall and the ~helmet trap~ that makes some zombies capable of destroying the furniture in the room. Mike, on the other hand, can place suspended toilet bowls capable of releasing the stinky contents over the heads of the undead so that they can be devoured by flies, while Foxy can secure the entrances with planks undermined by a nice bomb. Xbox 360 goals The 200 points available are divided into 12 objectives that are not so easy to achieve. It will be necessary to play for a long time and take advantage of all the weapons at our disposal to get them all. We will also have to combine different traps at our disposal such as the jukebox and the toilet trap or hire a large number of zombie builders, and don't forget to use Mike to search the cacti... Always the same thing? These are just a few examples, there are more than 10 different traps, and after a few games it becomes simple and immediate to choose the most suitable for the situation, fundamentalIt is certainly important to arm the internal doors as well and not just the external accesses. We must admit that the control system is decidedly simple and immediate, with the B key the furniture is destroyed, with the A key the traps are built or the wooden planks are laid, following the right rhythm to be faster, while the to fight is the RB. The action is more or less always the same and after a few games the inexorable repetitiveness peeps out, so much so that it is the real Achilles heel of the game:: destroy everything - search as hard as you can - defend the structure, from start to finish. The fights are resolved in fast melee only when this is indispensable and little changes if the zombies have some different characteristics such as size or speed. Inside the premises there are also some objects that help us in the most intricate situations such as for example the TV, after all it is known that zombies love it, the electric stove if equipped with a succulent steak on it and obviously the jukebox capable of make them dance to destruction. Graphically we are in the presence of a not bad product, based on the Unreal Engine, which makes the simple and irreverent style its strong point, the whole game scene is fairly well cared for, the zombies and the protagonists are not bad, some small flaws in the collision management but the title is absolutely enjoyable. From the point of view of the offer we unfortunately have to point out the presence of only local multiplayer in split screen and the total absence of any online support other than the usual and banal rankings. Not a small defect since the online fun would have been a nice ~patch~ to the repetitiveness of the game.", "date": "2011-07-22", "grade": "6.5"}
