{"name": "Dr. Mario World", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dr-mario-world-recensione.html", "text": "Dr. Mario World brings back a franchise that is particularly dear to a slice of Nintendo enthusiasts, which has always been linked to a context of mobility and mechanics inspired by the classic match-3 style puzzle games. In the process of writing this review, however, we realized just how much the experience changed when it debuted on iOS and Android devices. What is offered to us, in the traditional freemium format, is in fact a title with different prerogatives compared to the past, which adopts a scrolling of the capsules from the bottom up but above all allows you to play in an extremely dynamic way, making full use of the potential of touch screen to manage each element with precision and speed; even releasing two pills at the same time to ring them on the fly if needed. The tutorial phase is a bit trivial and takes us through the first twenty levels of the campaign to show us the mechanisms and variables we'll have to deal with, after which things luckily take off and it's the variety of challenges in particular that keeps us going. bench. Our task is clearly to eliminate all viruses by bringing together three or more elements of the same color and using our capsules for this purpose, formed by two ~boxes~ that can be reversed and managed individually where only half of the ~brick~ explode, again with quick hand movements. As mentioned, the Columns-style philosophy has been overcome in favor of a very free and interesting approach, which allows you to freely guide the ascent of medicines and position them anywhere on the screen, regardless of the presence of any obstacles. Gameplay and variations on the theme The experience offered by Dr. Mario World is therefore something different from the usual, which tends much more to the panorama of puzzle games for mobile devices than to that of consoles, whether they are portable or not. The feeling is that in this case Nintendo has played a role of simple supervisor with respect to solutions that appear quite familiar to those who know this type of production for iOS and Android terminals, see for example the structure set up with the traditional path and the three stars that can be obtained if you are the protagonist of an excellent performance. This aspect of the game is determined by the number of capsules that remain unused at the end of each level, and clarifies what the focus of the gameplay really is: planning moves carefully rather than quickly (well, unless you're in a a challenge level complete with a timer!), taking advantage of any power-ups when possible. The latter allow you to eliminate useless bubbles, destroy any brick, etc., but to obtain them you must necessarily resort to the precious currency of the game, diamonds: an element we will talk about shortly. We were rather interested in underlining how the developers have been able to mix the cards on the table often and willingly, proposing always different situations and changing the main objective of the match from time to time. In fact, it happens that in some cases you have to deal with turtle shells that can eliminate entire files of viruses, bombs that destroy what is found in adjacent boxes, a whole series of extra obstacles (frozen enemies or enemies hidden in walls ) and tanks which, once eliminated, instantly fill up our special move indicator. The maneuver varies according to the doctor we have chosen to use between Mario, Bowser and Peach: the first can make the first row of elements disappear from below, the second the first two rows, the third a randomly drawn column among those present in the scenario. Further facets reside in the possibility of hiring assistants who produce variations in obtaining the prizes: small incentives which are however also hidden behind the inevitable paywall. Even in multiplayer! Dr. Mario World includes a rich single player campaign, but also a nice competitive multiplayer mode for one-on-one matches, which can be accessed after passing the twentieth level. You can rely on matchmaking to find an opponent or invite a friend in various different ways, including a link via WhatsApp; after which you find yourself in a context similar to that of the classic Puyo Puyo, in which that is, by carrying out many eliminations, viruses are sent to the other player's screen, making things more complicated for him. Structure and microtransactions Dr. Mario World will keep you company for quite some time, judging by the substantial structure developed by the three teams working on the game, inin particular Nintendo, NHN and LINE. At present there are in fact over two hundred levels available to users, distributed within five worlds each divided into two areas. Further content will be added with the next updates, as per tradition, but we are already talking about a very long-lasting and fairly challenging title where the most advanced stages are reached, which we have not yet been able to do due to the zeroing of progress occurred in conjunction with the global launch of the game. How is this density affected by the inevitable microtransactions? Let's say that we have seen much more problematic situations, but those who are not familiar with freemium productions could certainly resent certain constraints. Let's start by clarifying that each of the five hearts available to us requires thirty minutes to restore for free, which means that in the face of particularly complex levels we could find ourselves without lives and forced to wait a long time to make a new attempt. As long as you win, however, everything is fine: the heart used for the attempt is returned when the goal is achieved, which means that the best players can literally spend hours playing without any forced breaks. Diamonds, the precious currency that is necessarily bought with real money, are used to quickly unlock new assistants (which provide bonuses on revenues, but not so significant), to obtain continues in the event of a game over and to resort to power-ups during a match that may have gone badly. From a technical point of view, there's not much to say: Dr. Mario World's graphics are exactly as we expected them to be, cute and colorful, as are the accompanying music and voices, which quickly come to mind.", "date": "2019-07-10", "grade": "8.0"}
