{"name": "Gran Finale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/86215-pokemon-versione-bianca-e-nera-gran-finale.html", "text": "It is almost poetic that closing the life cycle of the latest Nintendo portable is a new generation of Pokmon characterized by the two absolutes of the chromatic spectrum: there is something particular in this idea that goes well with a feeling of closure and epicness, as demonstrated by the two ~mascot~ pokmon of this generation, Zekrom and Reshiram. For being a fan of the franchise who has played, willy-nilly, all the installments passing from one generation to another, starting with the Game Boy Classic's Pokmon Blue, I admit that my patience with the recycling done by Game Freaks has come less well more than once. The latest ~generation~ made up of SoulSilver and HeartGold has escaped the ax of intolerance for the excellent quality and the nostalgia effect caused by being a remake of what is actually the most loved generation ever. However, Pokmon needed a breath of fresh air for years and if each new appointment is a great starting point for newbies, the same cannot be said for those who have already completed the PokDex not once but two, three or even four times. This Game Freaks knew it well but could choose: to continue recycling a software that everyone - including the bored undersigned - would have bought or try to focus a little more on innovation. Fortunately, the path chosen was the latter. And it's love at first sight again. The old Mind you, at the base Pokmon hasn't changed one iota: the heart of the game is always the same, the structure is the same. You are teenage trainers discovering the world and the pokmon that live in it, to prove that you are cool you will have to challenge and beat various super trainers and in all this you will also have to thwart the intentions of a group of bad guys. Which then is a pretext to explore the different areas of a vast continent and capture the one hundred and fifty or more pokmon that populate it, in order to create your team, perhaps exchanging them with friends (in case you have lived in a cave so far, each version has a number of unique creatures). What appears to be a wild grind and a little game for children with the soft little monsters hides a substrate of statistics, mathematical values and percentages which in the hands of an expert RPG player can transform his pokmon into true weapons of mass destruction. By now it shouldn't be a mystery that Pokmon, under a childish cosmetics, offers one of the most engaging and complex JRPGs ever produced. And the same goes for Pokmon Black & White version, which once again proposes the various types of Pokmon (fire, water, grass, etc.) and the usual infinity of skills, special attacks and evolutions. Once again, you will start on foot, then you will get the shoes to run, then the bicycle, finally the pokmon themselves will transport you around a new region, Unova, vast and full of surprises, between cities, mountains and prairies. In fact, the rule is always and only that: catch them all. The new Apparently Pokmon Black & White version may seem completely the same as its predecessors, in reality it is studded with slightly more subtle and less flashy changes and improvements which, however, have a significant impact on the experience. First of all, the story: just to be clear, the plot of the various episodes of the series didn't have that much importance and in fact even in Pokmon Black & White version it is almost insane at times. However, this time it has much more prominence and intertwines with the player's adventures frequently and naturally, and the presence of various supporting characters and antagonists makes the adventure more tasty and enjoyable. Furthermore, this is the first generation since the Red and Blue versions in which the pokmon encountered for most of the adventure are completely new. That's right, no Geodude in the caves, no Rattata and no Magikarp. The pokmon that live in Unova are entirely new, even if not all particularly inspired, and the player's wanderings gain freshness and variety. From a strictly playful point of view, Game Freaks seems to have decided to make the experience much more user-friendly with a series of tricks that have only benefited the formula. The grind of experience points necessary to maintain the team of little monsters is facilitated, for example, not only by numerous rooms in which to fight coaches on several occasions, but also by the presence of rare pokmon in particular bushes which, if defeated, reward you with a quantity of points much greater than that offered by the pokmon in the same area. The notorious Technical Machines that allow you to insendowed pokmon with special moves can now be used multiple times, allowing for more careful and complex planning of one's play style. The areas that connect the various cities often have an intermediate refreshment point, and Pokmon Centers now include the small shop that once required a tedious commute. There are not only these changes of course, but a large number of small and incisive changes aimed above all at streamlining the experience, making it more fluid and accessible right away. The fights themselves, for example, turn out to be much faster than in the past, just as there is a greater number of ~special~ fights (three against three or in rotation) that break the monotony of traditional one-on-one fights. In general, it is easier not only to manage the pokmon, but the whole adventure, thanks also to the cleaner and more orderly interface, composed of a handful of agile and easily accessible menus. To underline once again the developer's willingness to take a step towards the future, there is also the new gadget called C-Gear, obtainable in the first minutes of the adventure. Not only does this invaluable tool have great features like object tracking radar, but it also lets you take advantage of the Nintendo DS's Wi-Fi capabilities at any time to access a massive amount of additional multiplayer features. The online component of Pokmon Black & White version has been meticulously cared for and the player has an impressive amount of activities at his fingertips from the very first hours of the game that can also be experienced in the company of other players, either by exploiting the link to infrared than an Internet connection. It is not only possible to exchange pokmon, fight against other players and socialize with them, exactly like in Pokmon SoulSilver & HeartGold, but the new Game Freaks proposal is peppered with further content and mini-games of various kinds, from the Musical Theater in which it is possible to dress up pokmon to make them perform on stage, to the Dream World where the player accesses the dreams of one of his pokmon to unlock further items and little monsters. In case it wasn't clear enough, therefore, there is a lot to do in Pokmon Black & White version, whether you play alone or in company, and all the potential of the C-Gear only further extend the longevity of an already existing product. extremely complete. Old but also New Considerable progress has also been made with regard to cosmetics, although certainly not by giants. In general, the new Pokmon is, in a word, much fancier. During explorations, the sprites are larger and have good detail, the settings on the other hand offer an enormous variety and are full of details and touches of class that make the journey much more pleasant than in the past. To the alternation of day and night is added the passing of the seasons (one per real month) which changes the environment by adding, for example, snow or leaves blown by the wind; the puddles and lakes reflect the movement of invisible clouds in the sky and in general the polygonal models of buildings and other elements are much more accurate than in the past. The lion's share is certainly the new dynamic camera, which follows the player's movements with completely new particular shots, aimed at emphasizing the exploration or the most important moments. At times it seems, to all intents and purposes, a completely new game. On the other hand, most of the time will be spent fighting to defeat or capture the various pokmon. On this occasion Game Freaks has given its fans what they have been waiting for for a long time: no, we are not talking about the audio sampling of the animated series for the pokmon's verses, once again simple 8-bit screeches, but of the idle animations during the fights . It's been a long road, which started years ago, but we're finally here: sprites are no longer static or animated only when entering the battlefield, instead they now enjoy numerous animation frames that repeat during the battle. The pokmon are not yet individually animated for attacks, it is true, but this is a significant step forward compared to the past, almost exciting for a longtime trainer used to seeing only the static back of his pokmon. On the other hand, it is a pity that these sprites, at close range, appear so pixelated and antiquated. Finally, the musical accompaniment deserves a special mention since it is not only composed of the usual jingles and nice marches, but of truly exhilarating passages: the care also placed in this aspect of the game, which has always been perhaps the least memorable, reconfirmsbut again the importance that Game Freaks gave to its farewell to the Nintendo DS scene.", "date": "2011-03-11", "grade": "9.0"}
