Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Already available for several weeks on the App Store and Google Play, and recently updated to version 1.2.0, Papa Pear Saga represents one of the various experiments in the field of puzzle games made by King, the English team famous for having created one of the reference in the mobile sector, namely Candy Crush Saga. Actually speaking of experimentation is a little daring in this case, given that we are in all respects faced with a clone of the classic Peggle, from which Papa Pear Saga differs for a series of side elements rather than for the fulcrum of the experience, basically identical. In the upper part of the screen we have in fact a cannon that shoots a ball - our charismatic protagonist complete with helmet, aviator glasses and gray beard - to be bounced as much as possible against the obstacles present in each stage to collect points and reach the quota minimum required to complete the level. Not only that: after the first, simple missions, we will be asked to obtain a minimum score, but also to achieve specific objectives, such as for example making a ball end up in each of the containers present in the lower part of the screen, or making it fall inside of fruits stuck here and there, or even eliminate a certain amount of objects. Papa Pear Saga is a solid and fun puzzle game, if a little slow to get going The Princess and the Pea Halfway between Puzzle Bobble and the traditional pachinko, the gameplay of Papa Pear Saga is relatively slow to get going, in the sense that at first the impression is that of a product that is immediate and fun, but without the characteristics that made Candy Crush Saga a worldwide success. However, after a while the situation improves and undoubtedly convincing aspects emerge, especially among the facets that have less to do with the ~unoriginal~ nature of the title. The physics of the ~ball~ is initially unpredictable and far from realistic, therefore it is necessary to have a little experience to learn how to read the bounces and be able to make the most of the throws, which are however limited and must be enough to reach the goal of the turn, under penalty of game over. Here too, however, with practice you can do better and better and also take advantage of the simultaneous presence of three pears to better unhinge some obstacles before reaching the bottom. Unlike many freemium productions, in the game there is no energy bar that is consumed with each game, but a shortlist of ~lives~ that are lost only when we fail; which means that playing well and making the most of situations can translate into virtually endless sessions. And then there are the upgrades, from the ~standard~ ones that you get on the field, such as the ability to transform into a large heavy sphere or a fiery comet, to those that must be ~purchased~ using a few gold bars , the inevitable hard currency, and which allow you to view the trajectories, obtain high-power launches, place explosive charges in strategic areas and so on. In short, there is so much to play and so much to discover in the over one hundred stages that make up the experience, which has already made many converts and which could capture your attention in a matter of minutes, if you give it a chance. The system is in fact accompanied by a technical sector that is up to the situation, with graphics with a very colorful and pleasant style, as well as exotic and perfectly themed music.", "date": "2014-01-25", "grade": "7.3"}
