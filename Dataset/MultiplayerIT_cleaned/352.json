{"name": "Company of Heroes - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/company-of-heroes-recensione.html", "text": "Over the years, Relic has acquired a reputation as a reference software house in the field of PC strategy titles. From Homeworld to Warhammer, passing through Impossible Creatures, there has never been a lack of innovative ideas that have allowed the games of US developers to become real cults from time to time. Only the title is not very successful This also seems to be the fate of Company of Heroes, their latest effort. Whether it is a game set in the Second World War is easily guessed from the introductory movie, made with the same engine as the game, in which the scenes of the unforgettable Normandy landing are relived from inside an allied amphibian. Not equally predictable is instead to discover that, behind what at first would seem to be a direct disciple of Medal of Honor, there is actually a real-time strategy game characterized by a graphic sector to keep up with an FPS and a finally new playability . The old school RTS have accustomed us to the classic tactic of the unbridled accumulation of resources during the initial stages of the game and the subsequent creation of a super-powered army with which to face the enemy. In Company of Heroes this mental approach is fundamentally modified for two reasons: first of all, command points can only be collected by checking certain ~strategic points~ (just like in Dawn of War); secondly, the subdivision of the map into zones, each of which is characterized by one of these ~points~ means that one tends to expand more rationally from one region to the adjacent one, trying to guard all the entrance doors in a sort of Risk, rather than concentrating all your attacks on your opponent's headquarters - especially since if you have zones that are not connected to your starting base, they don't contribute to the collection of resources. The interaction with the environment is almost total: walls, car wrecks, bunkers and anything else can be used to hide your troops, making them more resistant. Some ruined houses can then be transformed into barracks where units can be recruited on foot, without forcing them to leave the base camp. In the event that soldiers are lost, they can be restored as in Warhammer, i.e. by calling reinforcements directly from the submenu, but it is necessary to be close to a supply area. The importance of preserving your troops as long as possible is emphasized by the fact that they gain experience by becoming more lethal. As for the units, there are several types. Certainly the Sherman tanks have the most firepower, but they are not completely invincible, especially if they are attacked in the rear area; the gunners, however vulnerable and exposed to any ground troops, represent their worst enemy. In short, a sort of Chinese morra to which we have been accustomed since Total War and which enhances all the available troops. The role played by physics, managed by the ubiquitous Havok engine, is very interesting, not only in aesthetic terms but for the same gameplay purposes. Explosions and passages of heavy vehicles completely change the battlefield, forcing the player to evaluate each time the ideal position for his troops. Lord of the field A further variable is then represented by special abilities that are unlocked as the enemies fall under our blows. There are three types of disciplines to specialize in, depending on whether you prefer air, ground, or armored infantry. In the latter case, for example, it is possible to recruit a Calliope tank, a unit that could not normally be built, which has a powerful rocket launcher  a sort of Balrog from the Battle for Middle-earth! The single player, which has always been one of Relic's workhorses, focuses on the victorious descent of the stars and stripes troops up to the capitulation of the Reich; it consists of about fifteen missions carried out taking into consideration the military actions of the time albeit with some poetic licence. As expected, a series of scripts and particular situations make the single-player experience somewhat different from that offered in multiplayer. On average, this game mode can keep you busy for about twenty hours, which increase if you choose difficulty levels higher than the medium one. The online sections are probably the terrain where Company of Heroes is able to express itself best. While there are just two game types, Annihilation and Domination, both are extremely enjoyable and addictive. We don't feel there is a need tobig presentations: in the first you have to physically destroy your opponents, while in the second whoever controls the most strategic points for the longest time wins. Precisely this seemed to us to be the most apt considering the style of play and the extreme difficulty in managing the sources of resources. [C] We try to maintain the strategic point with the help of aviation For the moment the Yankees are settled, but the area remains hot [/C] The maps are not very numerous and a scenario editor would certainly have been appreciated to flesh out the list made available by the designers. Another discordant note is the impossibility of choosing the faction to control: there are only two (Americans and Germans). Network matches (as usual, LAN reunions involved us more) are extremely tactical, but the vastness of the scenarios and the men on the pitch makes the action quite confusing, at least in the early stages. Over time, things improve, but those who think they can dedicate a few minutes to a quick game will have to change their mind: the average duration of the matches is around an hour. This is because the difficulty level is well calibrated and even at an easy level it will not be a walk to get the better of computer-controlled opponents, able to develop widespread offensives in the most defenseless places on the map. The artificial intelligence of their fellow soldiers is not as brilliant as they barely exploit the many defenses available and seem to be particularly prone to being shot. Technically, as mentioned in the opening bars, Company of Heroes fears very few rivals. However, the high detail requires a top-of-the-range system to be fully enjoyed. Achilles heel are the long loads sometimes unnerving; to overcome this problem it is advisable to have a generous amount of both system and video RAM. For those who can afford to set all the details to the maximum, the title reserves scenes that are truly noteworthy: the camera, which can be freely positioned in the three dimensional axes, has been placed in an optimal way for standard action. The textures are very detailed and the color palette, although not exactly lively, contributes to the inspired reproduction of the Nordic battle scene landscapes. [C] One of the cutscenes of the story. There are allies in that house It will not be easy to get the better of such a platoon [/C] As previously written, there are no problems with regard to longevity, not so much in terms of choice but rather for the intrinsic duration of the games, which evolve differently from time to time, always requiring the player's utmost attention. The many innovations put on the plate by Relic make it advisable to use the simple tutorials even for the most savvy players, who will take about an hour to fully understand the game tactics. [C] From an American tank we see a Nazi outpost at the top of the hill <strong>Company of Heroes</strong> knows how to give spectacular screenshots like this one [/C] Work in progress Relic is working on the second expansion for Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War. It is surprising that this expansion pack will be available two years after the release of the original title - a rare thing for non ~multiplayer only~ games. Dark Crusade should be ready in a few weeks; Meanwhile fans of the series can try the demo that has already been around for several weeks by downloading it from our Files Area. System requirements In no uncertain terms, let's assume that a latest generation system is needed to run Company of Heroes in maximum detail. Respecting the requirements recommended by the parent company, we also noticed some slowdowns, especially in the most crowded scenes complete with explosions. At the resolution of 1280x1024 (and at maximum detail) our GeForce 7900 GTX showed the rope a bit, so those who want to go even higher will have to seriously think about a dual video card system. Early versions of the game suffered from a bug with SLI systems, but patch 1.20 fixed this and other multiplayer-related issues. Final comment The next best thing in the field of RTS, that's how we could define Company of Heroes. A graphics engine worthy of being classified among those of the new generation, but not only: the gameplay finally offers something innovative and engaging, sufficiently detached from the usual standards so as to make the new Relic title a new cornerstone for strategic futures. Unfortunately there are small shadows that obscure the enormous valueand of the project and which go beyond the high system requirements, and which materialize in a certain parsimony in terms of factions, maps and game modes. Details that however do not prevent Company of Heroes from entering the ranks of classics directly, and being labeled as the most important title of autumn 2006. Pros First-rate graphics New and well-developed ideas Exciting multiplayer Cons Frustrating loading Few maps and factions Lack of originality in the choice of subject matter The audio apparatus is as rewarding as the visual one. Explosions and crawler noises are noticeable and make the walls rumble, but the same amount of attention has also been paid to speech, which is heard especially in single-player mode. For example, in the second mission, a night attack behind enemy lines, it is pleasant to note the fact that the soldiers respond to commands in a whisper, to avoid ~making themselves heard~ by the Nazi sentries on guard.", "date": "2006-10-05", "grade": null}
