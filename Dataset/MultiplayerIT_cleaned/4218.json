{"name": "The Elder Scrolls Online: Summerset", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/200249-the-elder-scrolls-online-summerset-the-elder-scrolls-online-summerset-la-recensione.html", "text": "The new strategy that ZeniMax Online has studied for The Elder Scrolls Online - the transition to the free to play model, the console conversion - seems to have borne fruit: the game is now significantly improved compared to its launch, while still experiencing a strong contradiction between the multiplayer experience and the solitary one that has distinguished the Bethesda franchise for all these years. The development of these micro expansions, also called ~chapters~, has certainly benefited on the content front, enriching the experience through a compromise: each new update, in this sense, allows you to start all over again, thanks also to the One Tamriel formula which allows you to tackle the whole adventure, or almost, without following pre-set routes as happens in many other theme park type MMORPGs. In that sense, Summerset arguably represents the ultimate expression of The Elder Scrolls Online's dual nature, for better or for worse. It is no country for Elves The new chapter of The Elder Scrolls Online takes place on the island of Summerset, the same country in which The Elder Scrolls: Arena, progenitor of the entire franchise, was set in 1994. Obviously we start as prisoners, as usual, but this time in the psychic plane: the ploy serves to introduce the Order of the Psijic into history, ~wizards~ who have exiled themselves to another dimension and who are now returning to Tamriel to find out what threatens it. Everything would seem to revolve around Summerset and an edict from Queen Ayrenn, who would finally open the doors of the Altmer nation, which has always been particularly xenophobic if not racist, to all travellers. Our arrival will involve us in the palace intrigues and in the power games of the usual Daedric Princes; fortunately we will be able to count on the help of various characters, old and new faces who will entrust us with vitally important tasks to complete between one secondary mission and another. The campaign lasts about twenty hours, if played calmly and without too much haste, and reserves many surprises especially at the end. While not completely succeeding, the writers of The Elder Scrolls Online have tried to give the missions of the main storyline a more epic flavor than usual, while trying to preserve the goliardic and irreverent spirit that often characterizes the atmospheres of Tamriel. Unfortunately, and we will never tire of repeating it, the MMO nature of The Elder Scrolls Online always ends up damaging the good intentions upstream, catapulting us into small rooms where dozens of players gather around the same NPC to discuss the future of the world: who those who are fond of the old solitary formula of The Elder Scrolls will still find these situations quite indigestible today, but those who are used to them will probably appreciate all those little gimmicks that ZeniMax Online has used to establish a greater balance between the two souls of the game. Essentially you can tackle the entire adventure alone, or occasionally team up to complete a couple of dungeons or some public events that scale with the number of players involved and offer great rewards. On the content front, Summerset perhaps offers a little less than the previous chapter, Morrowind, but this is reflected above all in an uninvolving endgame that will engage even those who play The Elder Scrolls Online assiduously in a limited way. Unlike the previous chapter, in fact, Summerset does not offer a new class or race, but a profession of craftsmanship and, above all, only a new school of interesting magic related to the Psijic Order. However, these spells didn't seem to fit naturally into every build. Some of them lend themselves well to the action-oriented combat system, but we always talk about mechanics that have never made us crazy and that ZeniMax Online seems to struggle to balance, especially in the PvP field. In short, Summerset is an experience that lives primarily in the form of a campaign aimed at fans of the universe of The Elder Scrolls, perhaps in the hope that those who feel orphaned by a main chapter can take refuge in ZeniMax Online's Tamriel in search of comfort. Unfortunately, however, we have to admit that this famous contradiction takes on a whole new dimension in this Chapter. Accustomed to the quirks of Vvanderfell, we found ourselves exploring bucolic countryside, ancient elven cities, crumbling ruins and dark caves: while everything is very beautiful to see and hear - as usual, every dialogue is fully dubbed in English - thanks to literally postcard views that hide the shortcomings of the graphics engine dBehind a superlative artistic direction, it must be said that the setting of Summerset appeared to us a bit generic, at times reminding us of many other low budget MMORPGs. It's a shame because the perspective of the story and its direction are exquisitely anomalous even within the series, but those who have never played The Elder Scrolls may struggle to understand the weight of these differences.", "date": "2018-06-05", "grade": "7.8"}
