To complete the title, the first round takes from 18 to 22 hours and at the end some detailed statistics are displayed on the number of kills, saves used, headshots and so on, which go to compile an evaluation expressed in the form of emblems, obtained in based on how you behaved during the game. There are 40 of them, and the most difficult ones to obtain (in one you have to finish the game within 5 hours and 30 minutes, not killing anyone...) also return additional weapons, gadgets and camouflage suits, including that of Altair, from Assassin's Creed, which is seen in a movie originally developed as April Fools' Day. In any case, even playing without banging too much, it is possible to unlock new and powerful weapons, bandanas, new equipment and even a camera to take pictures (in the fourth act there are thirty ghosts to photograph, which will appeal to those who have played the previous chapters) . At one point in the adventure you will be bestowed with a Solid Snake face mask in his prime, with and without a bandana, for all the nostalgics. Furthermore, wandering among the various corners of the settings, it is possible to find some songs for the iPod to add to your collection of songs from the previous chapters (also for the PSP) and some of these songs, if used during the action (and during the second round with the game), they will have effects on the soldiers (or on the bosses) who will begin to laugh, dance or whatever, always from the amused and ingenious point of view proposed by Hideo Kojima. There are tons of other secrets, hidden objects, alternative paths and things to do during the game, we refer you to your imagination, curiosity and experimentation. At one point in the adventure you will be bestowed with a Solid Snake face mask in his prime, with and without a bandana, for all the nostalgics. Longevity, Extras and Options In terms of options there is first of all the virtual polygon, which replaces the previous VR Training and allows you to experiment with all the CQC moves and weapons, thanks also to the excellent instruction menu which explains word for word, with graphic illustrations, such as perform all the moves available to Solid Snake. Do not miss the photo album, where all the photographs taken are kept, and the information item on the mission, which allows you to see all the briefings that precede each act of the game. Finally, under the extra heading, you can access some downloadable content that will gradually be made available, starting with additional music tracks, moving on to extra camouflages and finally arriving at the podcasts, where there will be some downloadable audio files written by Kojima or related to the Metal Gear saga. The last option is the ~Password~ one where it will be possible to insert text strings to unlock some objects, weapons and camouflages without having to recover the emblems upon completion of the game. These will be made available by Konami in the coming weeks and after a good number of people have completed the title at least once. The power of branding Like any videogame production that in some ways winks at cinematographic ones, MGS4 is full of so-called product placements, or objects branded by real brands. It starts with the iPod, which you can use to listen to unlocked music and which you control just like in reality, with the right analog button to scroll the wheel and complete with playlists, albums, artists and so on. But the famous music player is not the only Apple product present in the game, Otacon in fact often uses a Macbook Pro to interface with Snake, and during the briefing missions it uses a powerful Mac Pro to carry out all the calculations, accompanied by several LCD monitors always from the Cupertino house. But this is only the apex, in fact, during some chase scenes, Snake and his companions are driving some beautiful Triumph Speed Triples, which blend in perfectly with the setting, and make calls with some mobile phones produced by Sony Ericsson. There is no shortage of PSP and PS3 scattered on the plane that transports the protagonists around the world, and finally what about the inevitable Playboy magazine, useful for distracting enemies but above all for boosting the psyche by leafing through it between one break and another? Comment It wasn't easy at all after so many chapters and premises created, but Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is all he's passionate aboutthey could expect you and even more. Excellent from a purely playful point of view, where every aspect has been improved and where a linear development is however seasoned with the possibility of tackling the missions according to different approaches. Exceptional from the artistic and emotional one, with a narration that closes the circle on most of the characters in the series, becomes credible and as always offers different interpretations, with moments of direction, interpretation and artistic peaks never reached before by any other video game and always growing until the end. A separate article should be written, and we probably will, to list all the goodies, memorable moments and meta-references present within the game. This is Metal Gear Solid 4, a title that from our point of view can reach a perfect numerical evaluation for all those who have played and enjoyed at least one of the main chapters of the saga, and who will gloat before what most likely represents the first true exclusive killer application present on PlayStation 3, an essential title that exudes class from any point of view you look at it, thanks to the showy hand of Hideo Kojima Goodbye Solid Snake, it's time for you to achieve peace, for us to remember you for the emotions you gave us. Pros Artistically sublime Improved control system Exceptional cinematics and narration There is Metal Gear Online Cons Reviewable AI especially on low difficulty levels It won't change the mind of those who didn't like the previous chapters The story, and what a story The events took place in 2014, exactly nine years after the events that occurred in Shadow Moses (Metal Gear Solid 1) and where a retired but always active Roy Campbell called Solid Snake back into action, to thwart the threat posed by Liquid Ocelot, who is none other than Ocelot with the implanted arm of Liquid Snake (deceased in Metal Gear Solid 1) and who has also appropriated his mental characteristics, and who wants to make a large-scale insurrection to get the better of the Patriots and take possession of the control of soldiers. Warfare has in fact changed in recent years, nations are less and less equipped with armies that fight for a political or religious ideology, and make use of the so-called CMPs, paramilitary organizations of mercenaries who fight solely for money bestowed by the highest bidder and who have made the war economy in fact a real business and engine of the world economy, in the same way as oil had been in the previous century. But there's more, technological evolution has led to the introduction in each soldier of some nanomachines that regulate and suppress all harmful impulses for battle such as fear, trembling, doubt, making them perfect war machines. Each fighter also has an identification code, as well as any weapon, which is associated and works only with the associated ID. Weapons of mass destruction have also been completely eliminated (at least it seems...), precisely to allow the war economy to flourish without excessive peaks and to remain anchored in pre-established war scenarios. We let the player discover who the Patriots are and what they are made up of, but it is already known from the previous chapters that they are a sort of organization created by illustrious exponents of the previous chapters and which aims at standardization and filtering of information, to create an order in the things that instead go against the concept of individual freedom which The Boss aimed at in Metal Gear Solid 3 and which was then taken up by many of his other followers, when in the meantime this organization, born really for this purpose, was always taking a direction more different than the dictates built by The Boss. The story, and what a story Taking liberally from the visionary (and twisted) second chapter, and from the more ~routed~ first and third, also in this case Kojima has played a lot on the concept of individual freedom, of double (and triple) games, of political entanglements, of a difference between good and evil, which are often controversial and where their distinction is never clear-cut; of highly charismatic characters who seek, in their own way, to find their freedom and redemption by pursuing a certain path, seeking death, renewing life, maintaining their principles up to sacrificing their honor, all told in a way to say the least masterful and making the most of the multimedia medium. Why yes, it is necessary to make this premise, Kojima Production has inserted a real tour the force of interlude sequences made with the same engine as the game, aimed at explaining certain points of the plot, enhancing the situationsmemorable ions, act as a briefing for each mission; sequences that culminate in a 60-minute epilogue (yes, you got it right), necessary to close each part of the plot and to give all the necessary explanations. Fortunately, unlike for example Metal Gear Solid 2, the game action is less fragmented, the conversations via codec are reduced to a minimum, and the game sequences can last even hours and then be interspersed with long intermezzo sequences, which, like it or not, characterize what has often been defined as a meta-game that places a lot of emphasis on the cinematic aspect and which for this very reason has also met many detractors who, rightly from their point of view, seek immediacy in a video game and fun without a few frills. These aspects therefore do not change in the fourth chapter, which takes everything proposed in the previous chapters to extremes, thanks to superior hardware and the ideas of its creator, and tries to evolve the game and control system, without however revolutionizing it or putting it completely step with the times. Nanomachines in power! The scenario illustrated above includes Solid Snake, who is catapulted into the Middle East under cover among the ranks of some rebels who are fighting against the CMPs of Liquid Ocelot, spotted right here. Snake aged prematurely and seems to have only one year of life, due to an unidentified disease (always at the beginning, of course) and impossible to be cured; this will most likely be his last mission. In this situation, where the others continue to fight their war, the player can decide what to do, benefiting or not from what is happening around. In fact, by attacking only the CMPs, the favors of the rebels are obtained, who first of all see Snake as an ally and do not attack him, and also serve to clear the area and sometimes bestow objects on the main protagonist. It will be possible to ignore them, remaining neutral, or again, as per the good tradition of the saga, to face the whole mission in stealth mode, choosing the less crowded streets and using all the gadgets available. The game scheme tends to be similar to that of the previous chapters, with all the merits and defects of the case and with the possibility of tackling each section of the game in two ways, that of direct attack, which in certain situations can certainly give satisfaction , but above all stealth, certainly the most satisfying configuration. Also because, in the first case, some shortcomings of artificial intelligence are highlighted, often not flawless, and which are somewhat smoothed out only at the highest level of difficulty, which in fact is also the best to face the first time the game. Snake has aged decidedly, and seems to have only one year of life, due to an unidentified disease (always at the beginning, of course) and impossible to be treated, and this will most likely be his last mission. Nanomachines in power! Despite having an extremely linear plot development, each level created is very vast and offers different paths to follow, more or less safe to go unnoticed, and to discover the numerous secrets and objects scattered in every corner of the scenario. As for example in the second act, in South America and in a sort of forest, where it is possible to skirt all the buildings without being seen, help the rebels to get the better of the CMPs and therefore also cross the various structures in search of objects, or still cut off the electricity to ease his way later. All these solutions will still lead to the end of the level, but to a different exploration and gain in terms of objects. In a part of the fifth act, however, the only solution is to face the mission in stealth mode or almost, otherwise the section will have to be redone over and over again. Nanomachines in power! Returning to Solid Snake, its main feature to cross the enemy lines is due to the possession of the OctoCamo, a camouflage suit capable of adapting to the types of terrain and walls, in fact, it is enough to lean on it to assume the same color and therefore increase the percentage of camouflage. indicated at the top right of the screen. But not only that, you can create your own in the appropriate menu, and save them at any time. But that's not all, Otacon, who returns in great shape like many other characters in the series, is always close to Solid Snake with the Mk.II, a remote-controlled robot derived from Metal Gear that is able to probe the scenario from a distance, electrify the fighters and provide various information to the main protagonist, as well as unlock eventu", "date": "2008-06-17", "grade": null}
