{"name": "The Urbz - Sims in the City", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-urbz-sims-in-the-city_b.html", "text": "After the lynching for the bad joke Released in 2000 for PC, The Sims effectively materialized the idea from which Maxis started: to create a ~life simulator~ in which the player takes on the role of a person like him. A person with physical and psychological needs, who cannot help but relate to others, who has to find a job for a living and who perhaps aims to start a family, buy an apartment, etc. etc. The possibilities of The Sims are practically endless, especially as regards the customization of your character and the wide availability of purchasable items, ranging from furniture to appliances and which allow you to create a welcoming place to live from scratch. After enjoying huge success on PC, the series has evolved technically and has been enriched by a large number of expansions and updates. Finally it landed on consoles, with the aim of captivating an audience generally oriented towards action games. The Urbz  Sims in the City, in many ways, is another attempt to conquer the owners of PS2, GameCube and Xbox. A successful attempt? [C] As you earn money, you can afford some money. of everything. When it is said to have the carrion on one's shoulders... There is work and work... [/C] Go out home Where the focus of The Sims was the creation of one's own home, and therefore the action took place mainly indoors, for The Urbz the developers have adjusted the shot. Now the personalization of one's alter-ego and the house in which he lives are always very important elements, but at the service of a different purpose: to become important, to achieve success, to be recognized on the street. If The Sims was a true representation of our consumer society, The Urbz adds another piece of image and its importance to the mosaic today. It goes without saying that taking care of your image makes no sense if you can't show yourself, and so the game lets you wander around a virtual city, where you'll have to deal with the most diverse people. All of them, however, will pay more attention to the clothes you are wearing. You will start from an editor for the creation of your Urb, after having chosen the neighborhood it belongs to among the nine available, and you will immediately have to deal with the reality that surrounds you: your apartment is completely empty, except for a stereo that plays songs by the Black Eyed Peas, and the clothes you are wearing are certainly not for a gala evening. So how to move? A cursor, controllable via the analog sticks of the pad, will allow you to command the character's actions and movements, or to explore the surroundings to see what the area is like. Since money is a primary necessity, it's better to get going in this direction: leave the house and go to the ~industrial area~ of your district, where you can ask to be hired by the boss on duty. The work varies depending on the neighborhood selected at the beginning: you will have to make fireworks, pose as models or build rings and accessories for piercing. Once in position, everything takes place by pressing a series of keys in sequence: do your job well and you can aspire to a promotion (after acquiring some skills, however); neglect it and you will be fired. [C] What a cute little dog... Sometimes it's good to have a party. Urbz also occasionally shows off special effects... [/C] Bars, bars and bars Between one work shift and another you can possibly go for a stroll and visit what the neighborhood has to offer. Generally there are other ~companies~ (perhaps rivals of the one you work for) or shops where you can spend your money to redo your wardrobe or furnish your home. As usual, both in terms of clothes and purchasable items there is a huge variety. You can put a nice striped sofa in the house or opt for a more classic solution, set up a dutiful bathroom area or put a huge television screen on display. In the meantime, try not to neglect your character's bars: like you, he needs to eat, sleep and fulfill his physiological needs. Ignoring these things will result in a rout, so be careful. Luckily, the game includes the ability to advance time more quickly, which proves to be essential when perhaps the character needs to sleep... Of course, you can't help but relate to the other Urbs: don't forget that your ultimate goal is to achieve notoriety and the success. In this sense, the game offers you ~missions~ to completefrom time to time, each of which represents a step towards the goal. There is even a reputation indicator, which expresses your success in numbers: when you talk to another character and manage to get in tune with him, this value goes up. Otherwise, in case of embarrassment or verbal clashes, it drops dramatically. Interaction with others, however, remains a fundamental element of the series: using the cursor you can select the character to address and then choose what to do: tell a story, gossip or, possibly, use a particular greeting (if you have one learned: each ~group~ of Urbs corresponds to a characteristic way of greeting) or a ~special move~. Just like in real life, knowing the right people can help you to aspire to better professional positions and, in general, to become important. Maybe just enough to have free access to the most exclusive clubs in the city. Finally, a convenient retractable interface will be able to summarize your ~social~ situation at any time, quoting the people and your situation with each of them. Game structure and technical aspects In The Urbz  Sims in the City we will be able to create up to four characters on the same save file. These Urbs will go to live together in the same apartment, so we will be able to see them go on alone and interact with each other. The ways of socializing are fun, even if for a moment limited and repetitive: in the end the ~phrases~ are always the same, apart from the exceptions represented by the ~special moves~. The AI of the computer-controlled characters isn't all bad though, so things balance out a bit. There isn't much to say, however, about the extension of the playing area: limiting exploration to small neighborhoods (very small) isn't exactly like really living in a big city, and loading times (long, especially in the PS2 version) discourage travel when we already know what awaits us a few meters away. Speaking of the play area, it must be said that the graphics engine suffers a bit when zooming out and trying to rotate the landscape. If the initial editor for creating characters is limited, especially for some elements, the same cannot be said for the possibilities concerning clothing or furniture. Both things were decidedly taken care of by the developers, who wanted to give extreme freedom of choice and allow anyone to create their own look or ideal apartment from scratch. Your shopping or work sessions will be enlivened by the songs of the Black Eyed Peas, as already mentioned, and by nice sound effects, including the improbable little voices of Urb. Comment Will The Urbz  Sims in the City be able to conquer the console market? Hard to tell. Anyone who buys a gaming system for the spectacular nature of the related action games will hardly be attracted by an original product that is anything but exciting, even in its best moments. Let's say that to play with The Urbz you need to be in a particular mood, or have had an indigestion of arcade titles so much as to aspire to an all in all relaxing and fun experience, which perhaps will surprise you with some nice touch of class. Or that will make you think, why not. Pros: Many situations Rich in depth Very nice Cons: Sometimes boring Not suitable for the ~average gamer~ A bit repetitive When a good idea comes along, everything is done to make the most of it. This is certainly a true statement also for the video game market, which for several years has been divided between sequels and prequels, unable to give life to something new except in very rare cases. Like when The Sims came out, for example. The developers of the Maxis team, four years ago, asked themselves some simple questions: can real life be fun? Can video games ignore shootings, spaceships, super powers and so on? The answer was: Sims.", "date": "2004-12-13", "grade": null}
