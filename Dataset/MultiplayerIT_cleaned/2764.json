We have seen in recent years how the RPG and the roguelike have often mixed to create different solutions: the search for a new formula has not always given convincing results but in some cases the alchemy has worked, staging strange but well balanced, composed of apparently dissonant characteristics but which manage to magically support themselves together. This is the case of Moonlighter, which combines the classic dungeon crawler RPG with rogue-lite cues and inserting the strangeness of the management elements in between, which represent the most peculiar characteristics of the game. On closer inspection it is not a completely unusual solution, if you think of titles such as Rune Factory, Recettear or even Stardew Valley in various respects, but the extraordinary balance between the depth of the dungeon crawler RPG and the extensive management of a shop and an entire village is here truly remarkable. The story tells the exploits of Will, a young man divided between the desire for adventure and a sense of responsibility, which lead him to have to think about managing the family shop in the best possible way but also, at night, to sneak into endless dungeons in search of mysterious treasures. On the other hand, it is a question of carrying on a tradition in both cases: the village of Rynoka, where the protagonist's shop is located, is famous for being located near a mysterious portal, which leads to an extraordinary complex of dungeons connected to each other, full of dangers but also precious rewards for the most daring adventurers. The area attracted explorers for many years, until the authorities decided to seal off access to the dungeons in an attempt to block the flow, not least given the numerous deaths that regularly occurred there. This has led to a general decline of Rynoka, but it hasn't completely stopped her myth and the desire for adventure has brought the portal back to the center of attention: in dribs and drabs, often at night, new explorers look out into the village and enter hidden in the dungeon, just like Will continues to do in his spare time too. This not only represents a further boost to the adventure for the protagonist, but also an excellent resource to restart business in the shop and perhaps revive the economy of the entire country, prompting us to commit ourselves on both fronts. Adventurers and shopkeepers The original features have been faithfully carried over to the iOS version, so we refer you to the original Moonlighter review for all the finer details regarding the multifaceted nature of this game. As we said at the time, when the old Zenon, Will's conscience but also a retired adventurer, says to the protagonist ~It's dangerous to go alone, take this~, handing him a sword and shield, it seems that the game wants to clearly say which is one of its major sources of inspiration and in fact the immediacy of the Zelda-style combat system is one of the most important features for Moonlighter. Obviously, it is a bold comparison and one to be made with caution, also because it decays as soon as the structure of the dungeons is taken into consideration, which here absolutely do not have the complex and reasoned construction of the Nintendo game, being constructed in a procedural way to ensure continuous variety of exploration in the constant sessions required by a rogue-lite dungeon crawler. In line with this interpretation of the RPG, also in this case it is a question of always carefully evaluating the risk in advancing between the tunnels: it is possible to exit at any time and this is a solution to be taken into consideration, because if you die during of the exploration, a good part of the conquered objects is lost, which are then the very engine of the action, therefore a continuous balance becomes necessary between the drive to conquer new loot (which however represents the only element of progression, not being growth of stats for Will but only for equipment) and be careful not to run into major risks, especially in the vicinity of the challenging bosses. Even in this, however, a remarkable balance emerges: the agile combat manages to make the exploration of the dungeons lively, which in the long run in their unstructured conformation could become boring, under the sole push of finding increasingly precious and rare loot. On the other hand, this last aspect takes on a new importance: it's not just about equipping yourself with weapons and armorincreasingly powerful (which is still an important aspect of the game) but also to find products to sell at the shop at the highest price. This is where the other characterizing element of Moonlighter comes into play, namely the micro-management of the family shop, which hides very interesting mechanisms behind a somewhat simplistic facade. It's not a question of entering too much into complex management dynamics, but the fact of finding the right balance in the prices to be offered to the public, based on the rarity of the objects and the response of the buyers, becomes a sort of game within the game. This component then extends to the entire village, because when the Moonlighter (i.e. Will's shop) begins to mesh, the whole village of Rynoka begins to be reborn and enriched, which leads us to invest in various improvements to be carried out also in the other village structures. As far as content and graphics are concerned, the mobile version precisely mirrors what we have seen on the console, therefore the main variation must be found in the control system and on this aspect it must be said that this is probably not the best form in which it is possible to play Moonlighter . It is possible to choose between two different solutions but neither of them is at the level of a traditional controller: the ~point and click~ mode, which appears decidedly comfortable, however has some pathfinding problems which are also rather annoying as regards the paths taken by the character to achieve the objectives, while the virtual pad on the screen brings with it the classic discomfort of the absence of direct feedback.", "date": "2020-11-30", "grade": "8.0"}
