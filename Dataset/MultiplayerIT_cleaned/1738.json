{"name": "Skies of Arcadia Legends", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/skies-of-arcadia-legends.html", "text": "Discovering the New World As we said, Vyse is a peppery little guy: he is adventurous, reckless (it is no coincidence that one of the titles above is ~Vyse the Bold~) and does not fear the unknown: in order to see the whole world of Arcadia he does not hesitate to find himself in very dangerous situations and to travel to extremely inhospitable places. The plot of the RPG Overworks is something sensational: it is not particularly complicated, nor are there any huge twists (but you still have to be prepared to discover a thing or two), but it is so solid and immersive as to make it seem to those who play that Arcadia as if it really exists, the characters who live there are so lively and charismatic and the places you visit are so coherent in appearance and in their particular culture. The game itself, on the other hand, is a more traditional RPG: dungeons to explore, turn-based battles (and, unfortunately, random, in the most annoying sense of the term) without particular innovations in the combat system, use of magic and very powerful moves specials, characters that level up and equipment that gets stronger as you progress in the game (even if, perhaps, first you found yourself in an ultra-technological place and then you end up in a primitive land, the weapons you buy in the last location are much stronger than those of the first). On the other hand, the actual exploration of the world performed aboard a vessel and the spectacular naval battles, the real novelty of the game, which must be faced at various points in the storyline, are not traditional. Skies of Arcadia Legends has, of course, everything it already had on the Dreamcast. But what are the differences and (above all) the novelties? At first it seems that the frequency of random fights has been decreased, but after playing for over 10 hours, the writer can guarantee that from that point of view, unfortunately, nothing has changed: the encounter rate is always outrageously high, and remains the main flaw of the game. Perhaps the difficulty has been recalibrated, but this impression could be erroneous and deriving from a faded memory of what Skies was like on DC. Everything has remained unchanged in the plot: the texts have not been changed in the slightest, not even the cutscenes, and from that point of view the game flows away in exactly the same way. There is only one small addition, which however does not seem to affect the normal course of events: a new character named Piastol, a bounty hunter who has decided to stalk Vyse until she kills him. On the other hand, numerous other characters are present as a side dish, starting with a strange doctor who assists a mute girl. By feeding the latter's chick with a special type of fish (the Moonfish), invisible to the naked eye and identifiable only thanks to a special type of lens that the doctor entrusts to Vyse, many objects will be obtained (including some specially designed for this version) and you will gradually become aware of some small insights into the main story. Another welcome addition to the gameplay (as well as to the character park) lies in the wanted system. In the Guilds, in which it was originally only possible to buy and sell information on the various Discoveries present in the game, a list of wanted criminals can now also be consulted, with the relative bounties alongside some generic information. The player's task is to track down the fugitives, fight against them (and the battles are sometimes really tough) and then pocket the bounty for defeating them. Lastly, the number of the aforementioned Discovery has been increased: these are discoveries (usually strange and forgotten islands or monuments) that can be made by traveling far and wide in Arcadia, and for which the Guilds can be paid. The Discovery log in the Dreamcast version used to be four pages, now six. This means that now to discover every single secret of the game you will have to work even harder. Another note concerns the downloadable downloads on Dreamcast, which are now an integral part of the game (obvious, since the GameCube does not have a dedicated network). One last note Now let's talk briefly about the technical aspect: graphically the game does not exploit, as expected, the potential of the GameCube. The textures of the landscape are very well done, but they haven't changed since the days of the Dreamcast. The main characters instead have undergone a small addition of polygons that make them rounder (especially the girls) and finally able to move all the fingers independently of each other (in the original version the hands were represented in a single block) . These are small changes, but in some cases make it more pleasant to look at. Some elements of the clothing and the environment, however, remain annoyingly ~grainy~. It is in the music, however, that unfortunately we note a deterioration: Skies of Arcadia once resided on two GDs, and if on the one hand this could, at best, represent a small nuisance, it had allowed the programmers to insert an orchestral soundtrack that in some pieces it managed to be really suggestive. On GameCube the entire, and immense, world and the equally immense story have been crammed into a single mini-DVD, and this has probably resulted in a compression of the music, which now appears to be in MIDI format. In most occasions this does not detract from the atmosphere, although the difference should be noticeable to the ears of those who have already played Skies of Arcadia, but in the more ~majestic~ tracks, such as the theme of Valua, unfortunately this compression greatly impoverishes the value of the BGMs in question. Despite everything, obviously these are not deterrents to the purchase. Comment Finally, even the GameCube is starting to have its own ~host~ of RPGs, and makes its debut in this field with a truly excellent title, although unfortunately it is not very well known to the general public. Fans of the genre who have never owned a Dreamcast must absolutely appropriate this jewel. Choosing the path of ~legality~, however, it will be necessary to wait at least until May for a PAL version of the game. On the other hand, those who have the NTSC Cube or Freeloader, that nice boot disc released a few days ago that allows (at least in theory) to load discs of any nationality on the PAL Cube, can also go to the store immediately and buy a US copy of this masterpiece . The only problem is, if anything, the very scarce availability of the Skies of Arcadia Legends mini-DVD, which forces you to buy online. In any case, it remains a title not to be missed; the only ones to whom the purchase is not recommended are those who have already played it on Dreamcast and did not love it, or those who hate random battles in RPGs with all their hearts. The flaws of this game, however, dwarf its strengths: this should not be ignored when considering the purchase. Pros: Solid and fascinating plot Charismatic characters An RPG masterpiece revived on the GameCube Innovative and spectacular naval battles The additions on the GameCube are very interesting Cons: Frequency of random fights at the limit of human endurance Graphics not up to the GameCube Music slightly flattened compared to to the Dreamcast version Despite the additions, those who own it on the Dreamcast and are not a huge fan may not want to buy it again Attention! The review refers to the US NTSC import version of the game. The Italian edition of Skies of Arcadia Legends for GameCube will be available starting from the month of May. Strangely (since the SNES was considered to be the machine on which the largest number of titles of the genre had been produced), since the Nintendo 64 Nintendo machines have always suffered from a shortage of RPGs, which amounted to very close to zero (if we talk about pure RPG, with statistics, random battles and turns) on the penultimate console of the house. On GameCube the situation was almost identical to the beginning, but now it seems that something is moving and the first real RPG (not counting Rune) to come out on 128 bit is this conversion of the masterpiece released a couple of years ago on the Dreamcast. The world in which the story of this RPG develops is Arcadia, a planet absolutely devoid of both land and expanses of water, made up of a number of small islands floating in the sky on which the major human settlements have settled. The journey between the islands is very dangerous due to the hordes of pirates and outlaws who are waiting for nothing but to rob those who venture into the skies, this despite the strict controls of the Empire of Valua, which wants to dominate the whole of Arcadia. Among the pirates, however, there are also good and generous ones, who steal from the rich to donate to those in need (a bit like Robin Hood on flying ships). The protagonist, Vyse, is one of these, he is in fact part of the Blue Rogue team. At the request of a mysterious girl (Fina), found captive during a boarding raid, Vyse and his friend Aika, together with the newcomer, embark on a journey to prevent the Empire of Valua from taking possession of six crystals with the power to awaken and control the Gigas, powerful weapons of destruction created by an ancient civilization. This search will lead the protagonists to the discovery of unexplored and fascinating landsinanti, while Vyse will acquire fame and charisma. One of the most interesting and pertinent ~small things~ to the setting lies in fact in a rating system which, depending on the choices made in battle and the decisions made within the player's dialogues, will give a ~title~ to Vyse making him more and more famous and talked about in the ports of Arcadia.", "date": "2003-02-28", "grade": null}
