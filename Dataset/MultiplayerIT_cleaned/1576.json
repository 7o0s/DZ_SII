{"name": "Return To Castle Wolfenstein", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/return-to-castle-wolfenstein-4.html", "text": "Let's talk about technique In PC to PS2 conversions, the aspect that is usually scaled down the most is the graphic aspect. RTCW, in this sector, instead comes out incredibly head-on: the textures have a fantastic quality, the slowdowns are decidedly sporadic and the fluidity is impressive. Everything looks very similar to the PC counterpart, except for the inevitably lower resolution and for the very annoying aliasing which, frankly, we hoped was now relegated to a faded memory of the past on Sony hardware, and instead it occasionally returns. On the other hand, the setting and the graphic realization of the locations are dizzying: you will happen to visit an excellently made medieval castle, gloomy catacombs, citadels with attention to every detail and many others, for an impressive variety. To significantly increase the breathtaking atmosphere created by the rooms, there is also a sound of excellent workmanship. For each different event, there's an associated genre of music that ranges from fast-paced (during firefights) to sedate (during exploration), all, as I've mentioned before, with a decidedly satisfying quality; also noteworthy are the sound effects of firearms and explosions, absolutely realistic and convincing. However, it is not all rosy, in fact the various voices of the actors (I take this opportunity to underline that the speech is in English and there are no subtitles) were a bit flat and lacking in emphasis, however nothing excessively compromising, especially considering the game genre. Private Blazkowicz reporting, sir. Compared to RTCW for PC, the Xbox and PS2 versions feature extra levels and unedited cutscenes, which add depth to the story by going into more detail; the fundamental aspect that is however totally (and incredibly) absent in the PS2 version is the multiplayer game, which means no possibility of online play, no possibility of splitscreen for co-op games with your best friend, nothing at all , only the possibility of playing in single player. The multiplayer, despite being an additional feature in itself, has always been one of the focal points in the genre and a pillar for any self-respecting FPS. A very serious absence, therefore, and partly unjustified. In the singleplayer mode, you take on the role of an American soldier named B.J. Blazkowicz, who will have to fight against the Nazi army during the Second World War. However, ID has not given up on inserting monsters of all kinds, taking advantage of the Furher's passion for the occult, putting the player in front of a wide assortment of zombie soldiers and demonic creatures and mutants of various kinds. Like any self-respecting FPS, the main objective is to shoot and destroy as much as possible, and RTCW is certainly no exception. In addition to shooting wildly, however, you can take advantage of your stealth ability to kill enemies: RTCW in fact gives you the possibility to hit soldiers silently from behind, or to hide and walk on four feet to avoid being discovered. However, all that glitters is not gold, and although there are stealth elements, you will count on your fingertips the times you make use of the aforementioned techniques, above all because often the Nazi soldiers will be able to ~feel~ your presence even if you are not within their radius visually and without making any noise. Hiding therefore most of the time is practically useless, except to wait for the right moment to come out and empty magazines upon magazines. From here you can understand how the AI of the enemies is not exactly well-kept, and to confirm it there is also the fact that during the firefights the soldiers sometimes behave in a very stupid way (e.g. it will be enough to wait for them around a corner to then fill them with lead without any difficulty). Fortunately, even if the AI is not at the highest level, all in all it is enough to give you a massive dose of pure fun: the arsenal is very varied and boasts goodies such as the flamethrower and the super machine gun, furthermore the fact that some weapons overheating after a certain number of bullets fired greatly increases the strategic selection of weapons to be used in various circumstances. As I said before, the PS2 version doesn't have a multiplayer mode, so once you've finished the game you won't be very inclined to pick it up again, given that the missions are almost all identical and in the long run they can be excessively repetitive, which happens in most single player FPS. That doesn't take away from that thoughin the first play you can't help but identify yourself and have fun as much as you can for several hours, thanks also to the terrific setting and atmosphere, as well as the excellent playability: after all we are still talking about a title created by the legendary ID... Comment Considering the scarce presence of FPS on the Sony home console, RTCW is an obligatory choice for all first-person shooter lovers who don't have a PC or an Xbox, certainly the queen console of the genre. However, if you own one of the two previously mentioned machines, our advice is not to take too much into consideration buying the PS2 version for two simple reasons: firstly, the absence of the 60hz switch which will force you to play with marked black bars and at a reduced speed; the second reason is the total absence of the multiplayer mode, which has always been one of the strong points of this kind of game. Very little would have been enough to make RTCW the definitive FPS for PS2, the singleplayer is really well done and will make your adrenaline skyrocket. Unfortunately, the lack of multiplayer is felt, and a lot. Pros: Great gameplay Very faithful conversion Immersive atmosphere Cons: No multiplayer AI is not the best of life Those who lived the era of the first 386 will surely remember the legendary Wolfenstein 3D, in fact the first FPS in the history of video games as well as, clearly, a real cult title. About a couple of years ago the sequel for PC: Return To Castle Wolfenstein was released, also of excellent quality and its worthy successor. With the advent of the new generation consoles, many famous PC games have been converted to give those who do not own a good computer the possibility of not missing out on valid products... and RTCW is no exception. Unfortunately however, the radical difference between the architecture of a PC and that of a console (with the exception of Xbox) makes these conversions very difficult, and as a consequence most of the time we find ourselves dealing with products that are nothing but not the pale shadow of the original title. RTCW for PS2 in some ways is unfortunately no exception to this rule, being heavily affected by the porting process and being clearly inferior to its PC and Xbox counterpart in some respects but let's go in order.", "date": "2003-07-23", "grade": null}
