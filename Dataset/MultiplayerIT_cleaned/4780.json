No more oriental dungeons to explore, but an organic action-adventure capable of telling a story even in the absence of long narrative sequences, characterized by well-animated as well as visually stylized characters. As often happens, what at the time were choices made due to technical limitations, turned into a real style, in a certain sense disowned by Chahi himself with Heart of Darkness, in which the protagonist was well defined in appearance , a title of little success not to be confused with the bad apocryphal sequel to Another World, Heart of the Alien. But let's not digress too much and let's take a long leap to 2010, the year in which Playdead's Limbo bursts into the indie market, commercially reinvigorating the genre, obscured over the years by the 3D empire, although many of its elements had survived influencing famous authors such as Fumito Ueda (iCO, Shadow of the Colossus), Hideo Kojima (Metal Gear series) and Goichi Suda (Killer 7). Considered in its original form, it had now become the prerogative of a few enthusiasts who over the years had toyed sadly and solitarily with small and semi-unknown titles such as OnEscapee, or had to fall back on more modern products capable of at least evoking Another World-like atmospheres (e.g. example Outcast), at least until the aforementioned Limbo, which was followed by Inside in 2016, and which in the meantime has conceived countless children outside the nuptial bed such as Little Nightmares, Silence of the Sleep, Detention and others. In an era of increasingly elaborate, standardized and impersonal games and services, ~Limbo games~ have become synonymous with stylistic refinement and a return to an authorial vision of video games, dedicated to a commercially prolific niche that has not completely succumbed to compromises imposed by the mass market. Before Inside? Without any shyness, Black the Fall immediately reaches out to the typical player of Limbo and Inside (actually it came out much earlier than the latter in Early Access, but the troubled development delayed its publication). It begins without giving any explanation, with the player called upon to learn the few functions of the control system by experimenting them in the field: one jumps, ducks down and interacts with objects, at least until one obtains a laser pointer that allows remotely some electronic devices, including those on the backs of our ~colleagues~. The protagonist is a slave worker in a prison factory where no one knows exactly what is produced. In the first sequence we see him get out of a cage full of his fellow men and reach his workplace: a bicycle connected to an electric generator. The type of regime is not a mystery He has to pedal to get some mining carts moving, but it's at that moment that he sees his way to salvation, the only one to have a conscience / gamer that guides him: a door remains open just long enough for him to sneak out. From there begins the escape from his captors and the lethal security systems of the factory, in search of a way to the outside world. Unlike Playdead, which loves the unsaid, Sand Sailor Studio immediately makes clear some fundamental elements of the scenario in which Black the Fall takes place: we are in an alternative future in which communism has somehow thrived. To say: during the escape we will find ourselves in a room decorated with a hammer and sickle and some portraits of characters such as Marx, Lenin and Stalin. In short, where Inside made us escape from a prototype regime, whose nature could only be partially understood by deciphering some signs left in the settings, here we have a precise definition of who our oppressor is, a definition that limits the interpretation of all the other elements, including the final. Of course, not everything is fully clarified, but let's say that knowing the name of the enemy makes the whole adventure more tangible in a certain sense. Puzzles and shadows The first moments of the gameplay leave you a little lost and you end up dying often. Once you've settled in, you start thinking in terms of the game and things improve. Before taking each step, we observe the environment around us more effectively in search of objects to interact with. Here is our travel companion Let's say that to advance you have to solve a continuous series of small puzzles, some of which are very simple, such as asexpecting a large robotic biped to have its back to us to run away, and other more complex ones, such as bouncing the signal of the aforementioned laser pointer to hook another slave and using it to clear the way. In general it is really difficult to get stuck for more than a few seconds and, even when things get complicated, a few attempts are enough to understand how to advance. Let's say that having a minimum of observation doesn't hurt, but that's all. To the credit of the developers it must be said that they have managed to diversify the puzzles very much, almost never repeating them (apart from some trifles), fitting them perfectly into the scenario. Despite the playful nature of the actions, there are therefore no obvious forcings and everything that happens is well contextualized on a narrative level. Sure, it lacks the sophistication of Another World, or the greater political significance of a Detention, but it still manages to involve and tell a story that goes beyond the stylistic features of the video game, also offering some images of unusual visual power. Stylistically, a moderate form of stylization has been favoured, which points straight towards an almost abstract minimalism, cradled however by a strong cinematic-style expressionism, visible above all in the plastic way in which the shadows are exploited, which enrich the composition of some scenarios, giving more weight to representation. There is no shortage of particularly evocative sequences On the other hand, of all the titles mentioned in the article, Black the Fall is the one that does the least to detach itself from its main source of inspiration. The truth is that he doesn't even try, ending up ineluctably subordinating himself to Limbo and Inside. Here, its main problem is precisely the lack of a strong personality that distinguishes it from Playdead titles. Don't misunderstand: we're not talking about a bad game. Indeed, it is better than could be expected from an emerging team. Only that we would have preferred to be able to play a more personal reinterpretation of the genre. Surely it would have been more risky, but it would have taken away from our minds that irrepressible feeling, which goes neither up nor down, of excessive devotion.", "date": "2017-07-12", "grade": "8.0"}
