{"name": "Never Alone", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/141508-never-alone-la-volpe-e-la-bambina.html", "text": "Nuna is a little girl who loves to go around alone, in the snow and ice of Alaska, but one day her initiative gets her into trouble when a huge white bear emerges from the water ready to devour her. Luckily a Siberian fox is nearby, comes to her aid and distracts the bear just enough for her to escape. A deep friendship is born that reconciles two worlds, the human and the animal, which in the tradition of Alaskan natives have never actually been separated and have more in common than you think. Produced by an association that aims to convey the cultural values and folklore of the Inupiat tribe, Never Alone is a cooperative-based platformer, available for PC and next-gen consoles in digital format only. In the game we control two characters, Nuna and the fox, on a journey through ancestral myths and fears, dotted with mysterious and fascinating figures who will offer to help the couple overcome obstacles along the way; and by others, frightening and disturbing, who will instead try to prevent him from finding his way home. We had tried a demo of the game during the Tokyo Game Show and we were therefore interested in deepening the discussion, trying to understand how the developers would have used the puzzle elements and the narration to draw the contours of an experience that was worth living . The final result confirmed in some ways the goodness of the concept, however showing the side to various limits that should not be underestimated. Never Alone is a beautiful fairy tale, full of a particular atmosphere but with a few too many problems The dynamic duo Playable alone or with a friend, but exclusively locally, Never Alone takes up the classic mechanics of the genre, providing Nuna and the fox with a series of peculiar abilities that involve frequent switching from one character to another to solve various environmental puzzles . The girl can climb platforms that are more or less at her height and, from a certain point on, use an Inupiat thrown weapon called ~bolas~ (a bit too cumbersome to control, actually), with which it is possible to break walls of ice that block the path. The fox, for its part, can overcome higher obstacles thanks to the ability to run and jump from one wall to another, paving the way for its friend by lowering a rope or creating a bridge; but above all it has an intimate bond with the elemental spirits, which allows it to recall platforms made of wind, air or water on which Nuna can climb to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. The gameplay appears solid at first, but over the course of the campaign's two or so hours it shows some pretty obvious limitations. Firstly, the complexity of the puzzles never goes beyond a certain point, and apart from some more obscure sections, which require a minimum of reasoning, the degree of challenge of the experience remains low. Secondly, our companion's artificial intelligence often leaves something to be desired and creates episodes of great frustration, in which the fox or the girl do not cooperate at all and indeed seem to get in the way. There is a moment in the middle of the adventure that is emblematic, in which efforts must be coordinated to jump together from a moving object; however the operation, due to the problems just highlighted, inevitably requires several attempts. The result is therefore a poor reliability of the partner, who ends up the victim of some enemy or falls into a ditch when we forget to guide his movements for some stretches, making us feel the lack of a system of orders, albeit basic (of the type ~stay still~ or ~meet me~). Short but intense? On the narrative front, Never Alone is not wrong: the story is well told, touching and full of interesting ideas inspired by Inupiat traditions. Between one level and another we see sequences drawn in the style of the Alaskan natives and commented in their language, subtitled in Italian, which undoubtedly contributes to creating a certain type of atmosphere, further enhanced by the in-game sequences and by a Disney-style design for the characters, which are very well animated. In support there is a large amount of audiovisual material created by the producers to illustrate certain concepts and legends, and which brings us back to the initial objective of the project, to its popular nature. Nothing to say in this sense, the product is very well packaged, but once again it is a pity that the gameplay does not go off certain tracks, resorting too often to ~obstacle course~ style sections, even bringing into play the element of gusts of wind (from which it is sometimes necessarydefend themselves, but which in some cases can be exploited to one's advantage) and encountering great difficulties, as mentioned, in the coordination between the character we control and the one managed by the artificial intelligence. The lack of an extended zoom-out then creates further flaws in the slightly more multifaceted scenarios, forcing the girl and the fox never to move too far from each other; while the turning point that occurs at a certain point, and which in fact introduces a different way of tackling the puzzles, is not enough to put things right and patch up the holes in the Upper One Games title. Finally, a few words on the PC version, which runs smoothly at 1080p, without uncertainties in the frame rate but with minimal graphic adjustments: it is possible to select the quality level and little else.", "date": "2014-12-02", "grade": "7.0"}
