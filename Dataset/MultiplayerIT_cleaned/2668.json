{"name": "F355 Challenge Passione Rossa", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/f355-challenge-passione-rossa_a.html", "text": "The game The new game by Yu Suzuki, the guru of Sega of Japan, is the direct conversion of the arcade arcade of the same name. The only difference with the latter is, apart from certain graphic details (in fact it runs on Naomi in the room), in the lack of the two side screens which made the game a truly unrepeatable experience and was the cause of total involvement. But let's examine what the Dreamcast title offers us. The main screen offers us the usual options: arcade mode, championship, single play, versus, car settings, driving data, options, save and load game. Up to here the innovations are non-existent as the available modes offer exactly the same as other titles of the genre. Therefore Arcade Mode will be a single race but allows you to get new tracks;Championship mode consists of a series of challenges where you will use points to climb the rankings; Single Play allows only one run; in Versus mode two human opponents will compete for breathtaking races. With Car Settings you can vary many parameters of your car. Entering the actual game, through, for example, the Arcade mode, you can choose a track from a list of six (Motegi, Suzuka, Monza, Sugo, Long Beach and Suzuka short), the difficulty level between Novice and Intermediate (respectively with automatic and semi-automatic transmission) and finally you have the possibility to decide in which mode to play between Training (training), Driving (racing without opponents), Race (racing with eight opponents). But the important thing is the game on the track; this is why, if you want, you will buy the game and therefore I will immediately describe the sensations I got while driving. First, it must be remembered that this title is a simulation; but not one of those simulations that are such only on paper. Yu Suzuki's work is in fact able to give the player everything you might feel driving a real car. Of course, at first everything may seem a bit difficult but over time everyone will be able to have at least stable driving. There is no need to be afraid, given that the difficulty level is really well calibrated, with increasingly difficult challenges without generally being frustrating. The game physics of the cars is excellent and it is precisely this that makes the simulation experience unique in its kind. Realism is therefore the spearhead of this little gem and precisely for this Suzuki has chosen to provide only one view (the internal one) to the player. I must admit that this choice at first left me a little confused but in the end I got used to it. Graphics & Sound Now let's move on to the more technical aspects, such as graphics and sound. The first will leave you speechless. This game features the most beautiful visuals ever seen in a driving title. The polygonal models are practically perfect and the applied textures are excellent. The same also applies to reflections on the bodywork. Let's not talk about the tracks and backgrounds, on which the Sega programmers have really placed such maniacal care as to touch the limits of photorealism. All the details, including the mechanics at the pit stops and the drivers inside the cars are made with extreme attention. The sound is excellent, the sound effects are very realistic and finally the engines and braking have the semblance of reality. The only comment I can make concerns the music which, to be honest, does not convey the idea of realism very much and could even annoy the most delicate, given that it is pure Hard-rock. In conclusion??? What's left for me to say, then? Longevity is guaranteed by the good number of options and by the great challenge that the game poses to your skill and patience. Summing up, I can only recommend this game to everyone, from Dead or Alive 2 geeks to Gran Turismo fans. In conclusion??? Pros: Incredible level of realism Best graphics ever Great sound Cons: Deafening music Sometimes excessive realism is frustrating Introduction It all opens onto a common Modenese street. Then the scene switches to Maranello, the place where Ferraris are conceived, built and tested. From here comes a car that represents the dream of millions of people. A car capable of taking part in any challenge, with devastating beauty and power. The car. The Ferrari F355. After its release we are engulfed in a spectacular race between some of these dream cars. Thus begins one of the most spectacular games of all time which takes the name of F355 Passione Rossa.", "date": "2000-12-02", "grade": null}
