The hybridization also continues in this Bug Heroes Quest, but with a slightly different meaning, proposing a mixture more inclined to the action-RPG than the semi-strategic that characterizes the prequel, consequently developing as a game more focused on the development of characters and their story, as well as the tight action. The first chapter was based on the need to stock up on food and defend them from enemy attacks, a structure based on strategy but which forced the player to make rapid sorties into the outside world and strenuous defense of his base, while Bug Heroes Quest expands the scope of the action, focusing mainly on the exploration of the environments and the achievement of variable objectives within the various levels. The protagonists are again the small and modest ant, the deadly and dark spider and the strong and kind beetle, but this time the action focuses on one or the other protagonist in turn, explaining the story and background that lead to the approach of the three characters, initially belonging to opposing factions but then united in the war that is raging in the world of insects since the advent of the terrible scorpions. The form given to the game is therefore more complex and profound, evidently derived from a higher level production: this is the impression that derives from the simple but not obvious plot, from the construction of the characters and from the interesting dialogues with the numerous NPCs and above all by the vastness and complexity of the explorable environments, now much more varied and extensive, located throughout the various rooms of a house. Entomological wars The action is framed from above, with characters and environments built entirely in good 3D, with the scenarios obviously built to scale with respect to the small size of the protagonists, thus presenting objects, household furnishings and so on in gigantic forms. Note the possibility of choosing between two different graphic options (high and low) in order to meet the fluidity needs based on the iOS device in your possession. The interface is inserted on the touch screen, placing the virtual analog stick and the fire button at the opposite corners of the screen at the bottom, with the controls that are reactive, but often it is a bit uncertain in pointing. Added to this is the annoyance caused in some cases by the placing of scenery elements in front of the protagonist, which can partially cover the unfolding of the action. The game mechanic is similar to that of action-RPGs: by eliminating crowds of enemies, obviously trying not to reduce one's energy to zero, the experience points are increased up to the passage of a level, which assigns a point to be applied progressively to a of the character's stats between energy, strength, defense, accuracy and evasion. To the main weapon, specific to each character and characterizing his particular fighting style - machine gun for the ant, blade for the spider and club for the beetle - there are various slots dedicated to special abilities, which also differ according to the fighter and unlockable by fully exploring the scenarios and discovering secret chests and shops dedicated to customization. Longevity is therefore helped by the possibility of discovering these important hidden elements which, together with the presence of optional secondary objectives, lead to tackling the approximately 60 levels with greater attention and in some cases even more than once. The audio sector is not characterized by particular qualities, although some music is quite pleasant and the sound effects appropriate to the setting. Note in this field the possibility of using songs of the user's choice taken from one's own iPod catalogue.
