{"name": "Codename Outbreak", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/codename-outbreak.html", "text": "We are not alone. Set in the near future, the plot of Codename Outbreak draws heavily from the American B-series cinematography of the 60s/70s: a meteorite that fell on earth contains an extraterrestrial parasite capable of ~infecting~ the human race and taking control of it . Bad luck has it that the alien life form is not satisfied with proliferating through a few cocoons (which we will find scattered throughout the levels and which constitute a quote from Duke Nukem 3d), but decides to take possession of some military bases, from which to start to extend the own dominion over all the earth. We are not alone. At this point in the story we naturally enter the scene. By controlling a small team of two soldiers (who we can choose from a list in which each one will have different characteristics, which will evolve as the game progresses), our task will be mainly to investigate the events by collecting the information contained in notepads, minicomputers and other electronic objects, and of course to eliminate the different soldiers infected by aliens. As for the actual alien life form, we will find some different species in the game, from the smallest ones, which slip out of the cocoons and jump towards us like little Aliens, to the largest capable of launching chemical gases over long distances: however, it must be said that their presence is in any case rather limited, and for this reason we will fight most of the conflict against other soldiers in an atmosphere rather similar to that of the aforementioned Operation Flashpoint. Reflect, plan, strike. The general setting of the title is mainly stealth, both for the numerous presence of enemies in the areas and for their A.I. quite developed. In fact, every firefight, even with a few enemies, must be planned in such a way as to be able to seek shelter between us and them, since being in an open field against a small group means giving up at least one of your men. The firepower, the absolute precision of the enemies (I assure you that the numerous snipers scattered in the woods or in the turrets are capable of killing you with two shots), their tactical disposition and their generally very aggressive behavior force the player and think carefully before making any movement. To give a better idea, before crossing any part of the large maps that distinguish the missions, we will have to carefully observe the possible presence of patrolling guards or turrets, and we will do so thanks to the use of the ocular device that allows our soldiers to zoom in on their perspective. Reflect, plan, strike. The fact of being able to control the other member of the Team through some very simple commands (follow me, stay still, fire at will, don't shoot), allows you to program some rather functional ~ambushes~, as we will make some enemy follow us and we will bring our partner into the shooting zone: it is also possible at any time to transfer our control to the other member. Despite some initial perplexities due to the rather high difficulty of the game (which can however also be modified at the Arcade level), once you become familiar with the reflective and partly planning setting of the game action, you can savor the many positive aspects of experience. Among other things, to confirm the care taken by the programmers in the development of the title, the objectives that we will find ourselves having to complete during the missions are not only various, connected to each other to give a strong sense of continuity to the story, but dynamic and they change each time we reach the next one. The missions themselves are partly connected, and throughout the first part of the game we will find ourselves, for example, having to first infiltrate a base, then recover a key person in the game and finally escort him to the point from which we started. Light of my Eyes. Using a proprietary engine, the talented GCS Team was able to recreate very large scenarios with it, particularly cared for in some parts (even if certain exteriors tend to look similar to themselves) and with one particularity: if we lower the brim to the protagonist and have him fix a point, we notice that this becomes MUCH more detailed than it appears when the game is in motion. Apart from this little gem, the strength of the engine is certainly not that of having created new standards of graphic quality, but that of having been able to equip the maps in which we will have to move with a broad scope. In this sense it is amazing how the enemy guards posthey can see each other at a distance of a kilometer, and when they are stationed on the turrets they enjoy an even wider overview. Fortunately the same argument applies in our case, as we will have the possibility to identify opponents at great distances, and to hit them using the sniper rifle or even the rocket launcher. Light of my Eyes. As far as the sound aspect of the game is concerned, the action of our soldiers will not be accompanied by any background music, but when we are spotted by some enemy, a musical commentary will start and continue until the end of the battle. Ultimately, we certainly cannot speak of a new standard of graphic comparison (the characters themselves appear rather squared) as one can expect from the titles of the next generation: but this is perhaps the fortune of Codename, preferring substance to aesthetics. Strengths and weaknesses: the conclusions. The game is difficult, certainly challenging, and often requires a lot of patience to be overcome; the A.I. of the partner is not perfect, sometimes he tends not to follow orders or to implant himself when he is asked to go down or up the stairs (however, it is enough to take control of the other member to solve the problem personally); the maps are too large, especially for those used to the small spaces of Half Life, and must be crossed with caution; the realism of the blows suffered is very high and could discourage the less thoughtful (three blows and you risk dying); the need to maintain the stealth setting for most of the game sometimes risks weighing down the game excessively. These are the points to which we can move our most important criticisms. However, as can be easily understood, most of the above should not be considered as a defect, but as an asset, for those players who loved Operation Flashpoint (or even those who considered it too complex), Project I.G.I., Hitman, Thief or other stealth games. Furthermore, the strong narrative thread that binds and reveals the events during the course of the game (helped, in the style of what was appreciated in System Shock2, by reading the numerous notes left by the scientists before being infected), contributes significantly to improving the quality of the gaming experience. In the end, Codename proves to be a very solid title, with a great feeling and capable of giving enormous satisfaction to players looking for something more challenging, something that requires constant concentration and little propensity for open-field confrontation. Strengths and weaknesses: the conclusions. It hasn't happened to me for some time that I ~wanted~ to continue playing a title whose review has already been written, just for the sake of discovering new details and not just for the need to write the article connected to it. With Codename this happened, and it must mean something. Among other things, I have not yet had the opportunity to try the cooperative mode (in which each person controls a member of the team), which I think fits very well with the title in question ... In this regard, I invite anyone of you who is about to buy the title, to contact me: he will be happy to share this gaming experience with someone Ultimately, if you are looking for an exciting challenge, an FPS capable of putting you on the ropes but still more malleable than Operation Flashpoint, Codename could be for you. If, on the other hand, you enjoyed the frenetic action of Serious Sam, rather direct your attention towards something else: in this sense, you should take a look at Red Faction. P.S.: Codename was tested on a 1 Giga Athlon with 256 Mb of Ram and a Geforce2 Mx and it turned out, at a resolution of 1024*768 and 32 Bit of color depth, fluid even in the most complex occasions: the readme. txt even mentions a PII 500 with accelerator card as the recommended system. The reviewed version is the American one, but the game will arrive on our market within a few weeks completely translated into Italian. Sleeper Hit. What a pleasant surprise this Codename Outbreak. Popped practically out of nowhere during the last E3 Los Angeles, the game offers a successful mix between Half Life and Operation Flahspoint, two of the latest masterpieces of the genre. Inheriting from the first a captivating action rhythm, led by a strong narrative thread, and from the second the particular team play setting, Codename offers a frenetic and at the same time reflective scheme, constituting in fact one of the most deserving FPS of recent months . There are few reasons to choose to remain indifferent to this title: let's try together to understand why.", "date": "2001-10-06", "grade": null}
