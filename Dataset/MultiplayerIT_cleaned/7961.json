This new adventure distances itself from the events narrated in the main story, albeit leaving some tasty references, giving itself a real license to pay a great tribute to the most avid fans. To do this, the programmers have set aside the serious tones of the saga, taking a somewhat unexpected and multifaceted turn. Citadel is a product that we could define as bipolar: on the one hand we have a new quest, lasting about three hours and characterized by spectacular clashes and some new ideas for the series, on the other a structure entirely dedicated to social media, which allows you to deepen the relationships between the various characters, face various mini-games and even freely manage Anderson's apartment, kindly offered to Shepard for his entire stay at the Citadel. Let's find out the results of this bizarre experiment together. Agent Shepard Content requires a pre-Cerberus lab save to activate; as usual we receive a new email in the terminal which invites us to reach the key place. The story begins when Shepard and his companions take a break to enjoy the entertainment of the Citadel. Facts precipitate after meeting the clumsy Maya Brooks, which involves the protagonist in a clash with a mysterious organization. The story is even tinged with yellow, with a heinous murder and with the attempted theft of Normandy herself. Probably inspired by the previous DLC Leviathan, BioWare experiments with new formulas, such as an unconvincing stealth section, where armed with a miserable pistol with a silencer and limited bullets we must try to avoid firefights. The part set in the Citadel casino, the Silver Coast, is much more interesting, characterized by an opening towards mechanics more congenial to graphic adventures. Here we see Shepard divesting himself of any weapon to try his hand at an investigation with Maya and a freely chosen character from the team. In this mission we witness hilarious scenes, such as using Liara as sexual bait (!) to distract the security, or strike up improbable conversations with the customers of the club in order not to attract attention. The action then moves to a museum and the dock of the Normandy, theaters of clashes more in the strings of the saga, where we find ourselves facing mercenaries armed to the teeth, essentially a variant of the Cerberus soldiers. The fights are enlivened by the enemy's use of energy shields, which require a certain strategic approach and the collaboration of the whole team to be overcome. Unfortunately we must reiterate that BioWare is not yet at its best in the field of pure shooter, presenting a certain general woodiness, lack of level design and an all too excessive schematic, defects that are beginning to feel the weight of the years. The final boss presents a curious twist, also giving ideas to the main plot and leaving the player the choice of how to behave. All for one...Normandy for all! As we said, however, the beauty begins only after the DLC campaign is complete, since new sections of the Citadel are opened that can be freely explored by the player. Among these we find the aforementioned casino where it is possible to face various mini-games, from roulette to a fighting game between mech-holograms, and many others. We can also go to an unprecedented commercial sector to buy new items with which to furnish our apartment, in Sims and Playstation Home style, paying with credits shared with the base game. The aim is to organize a big party by inviting all the crew left alive in our save file, the beauty is that we have full power to manage the evolution of the evening, obviously we have opted for alcoholic degeneration, with Shepard who he launches himself onto the dance floor, arousing general hilarity. In addition to this, it is possible to initiate a whole series of interactions, especially sentimental ones, by inviting the various characters to the apartment or meeting them in specific places. Many of you will be happy to find the beautiful Miranda Lawson, with all the natural consequences of the case. Between an abundance of cutscenes, humor and the usual plethora of dialogues, this is a gigantic operation of a fan service nature, as demonstrated by the approximately 4 Gigabytes needed to download thecontent. In all, even six hours of gameplay can be exceeded, adding the Arena Armax mode to the plate, where we can build the team of our dreams and face a series of clashes in a virtual simulator, features that make this the largest BioWare DLC ever product. Unfortunately, such an abundance has a price that translates into some technical problems: the presence in the campaign of only one audio track, which is uninspired, takes something away from the involvement, so much so that it seems like a preliminary version. There are not rare moments totally dependent on the voices of the protagonists, among other things penalized by a not very incisive Italian dubbing, and environmental tunes. Graphically, the work done by the developers is noticeable, so much so as to validate the legitimacy of this DLC and move it away from the easy territory of profit. The facial expressions and the modeling of the face of the new character Maya Brooks testify to a further step in the exploitation of the Unreal Engine, so as to overshadow all the others, while the new settings are more than pleasant, full of details and characterized by a remarkable scenic impact . The animations are less exciting, which still represent a thorn in the side of the developer. Despite the gleanings Mass Effect 3: Citadel remains an expansion as interesting as it is nostalgic, certainly the richest ever released by BioWare, a great farewell to the saga from the most avid fans, for whom the purchase is strongly recommended. For all the others, the general frivolity and the absence of a solid narrative line are aspects that could dissuade you from buying, especially for the not negligible outlay of around fifteen euros, even if justified in terms of content. Regardless, Commander Shepard and all of the Normandy's friends will always be in our hearts.", "date": "2013-03-11", "grade": null}
