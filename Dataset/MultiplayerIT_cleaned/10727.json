Once upon a time there was a king Wanting to introduce in a few words to what is the essence of Little King's Story, it could be said that the Marvelous Entertainment work represents a union between Pikmin, Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon: the inspirations for the three products just mentioned are evident and not at all disguised, but the skill of the developers was to amalgamate them within a title with a strong identity, which shines through from many aspects. Among the first entries we ascribe the presentation of the game, capable of effectively lowering the user into a universe that is only apparently childish and naive. Little King's Story tells the story of little Corobo, a shy and awkward boy who suddenly finds himself having to lead his own people, after discovering a magical crown with the power to transform anyone who wears it into a king. The graphic impact is absolutely convincing: the adventure is introduced by a movie that could be defined as a sort of moving oil painting, while menus and tutorials appear in the form of scribbles on a blackboard. The originality of the visual style also extends to the actual gameplay phases, thanks above all to some filters that make the graphics of Little King's Story particularly ~soft~: the game area is framed from a bird's eye view which shows colorful bucolic settings with great attention to detail, and the characters (even if not particularly defined) denote a good character design and various and very pleasant to see animations. All of this is accompanied in an extremely effective way by a soundtrack composed mainly of fairy-tale interpretations of famous classical music pieces, while the effects are distinguished by some decidedly nice solutions - above all the ~puppet~ sound of the protagonist's steps- and for the characters' incomprehensible babble, similar to the gibberish made famous by The Sims. A context that serves as an ideal outline for the player's activity, who as king must lead his people to nothing less than the conquest of the world, step by step: certainly not an easy undertaking, given that Corobo begins his adventure being able count only on a shed as a castle, on three councilors and on a handful of inhabitants certainly not inclined to work...< Little king, big staff An index of the quality level of Little King's Story also comes by taking a look at the key figures behind the project, starting with the executive producer, or Yasuhiro Wada, creator of the Harvest Moon series. We then head the programming Youichi Kawaguchi (whose curriculum includes none other than Dragon Quest VIII), while the design was handled by Hideo Minaba (Final Fantasy XII) and Kazuyuki Kurashima (Freshly Picked: Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland). The sound sector was finally entrusted to Yoko Shimomura, already famous author of the music for the Kingdom Hearts series. It ain't easy being the king The concept of progression is to all intents and purposes the real beating heart of the playful mechanics of Little King's Story: instead of cramming the title with quests, sub-quests, mini-games and parallel activities, the developers preferred to permeate their work with a series of elements capable of instilling in the user a genuine sense of accomplishment at the end of each of his small or large undertakings accomplished in the game world. In very strict terms, in fact, Little King's Story could be defined as a repetitive video game, which cyclically offers a series of rather limited activities, despite the obvious diversifications. Basically, the typical day of Corobo translates into getting up in the morning, gathering a handful of citizens in his presence and leading them to explore a part of the scenario, either to collect treasures and provisions or to slaughter little monsters: at nightfall darkness (a special on-screen clock marks the passage of time), one sums up one's conquests and spends the money collected to expand one's kingdom with new infrastructures or upgrade existing ones. A routine broken from time to time by boss fights or cutscenes that highlight events of particular importance, but which keeps repeating itselfi for a long time, given the considerable extension of the adventure. And yet, Little King's Story is anything but monotonous: the exploration of a new area, the discovery of a large loot or simply the construction of a new building are small great satisfactions that push the user to start every new day with enthusiasm in the Corobo cloths. Obviously the merit is also of an impeccably modeled play structure, in the footsteps of what Miyamoto did with Pikmin: the user directly controls the king alone, who can be followed by his allies by selecting them with the B key and directing them towards a goal by pressing A. Two simple bases on which the entire gameplay of the Marvelous Entertainment product rests: the elements indicated by the player can be enemies to attack, resources to collect, areas to reclaim and so on, all jobs to which specific units are correlated such as the soldier, farmer, carpenter and so on. It goes without saying that everything becomes progressively more complex: as the adventure continues, the size of the kingdom will increase, the areas to explore, the subjects that can be managed at the same time (up to a maximum of 30) and their qualifications, reaching at levels of depth unrelated to the Pikmin itself. Precisely for this reason, in some cases the lack of a more performing control system is felt: with a choice that is not entirely acceptable, the developers have preferred not to exploit the motion sensor of the Remote in any way, but on balance some point functionality -and-click would have been really handy. This and the sometimes frustrating absence of the autosave are the only criticisms that can be leveled at a thoroughbred strategic RPG, which will make all Wii owners happy, even if only minimally interested in the genre.", "date": "2009-05-11", "grade": "S.V."}
