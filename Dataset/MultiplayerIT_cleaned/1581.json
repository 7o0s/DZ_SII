The Aquiris Game Studios game is a real toolbox for building adventures, or rather a ~magic box~ that allows you to build settings, stories and levels to play and share with others. It is certainly a more limited system than other known solutions such as Roblox or similar, but it has considerable care on the technological front and a truly impeccable style. All this accuracy necessarily entails less freedom of action in the construction of the gameplay, which in fact is essentially based on a single type of game, but the amount of variables is still considerable and the result is always creations that are very pleasant to look at and rather clean in terms of mechanics. Wonderbox allows us to build fascinating and detailed environments It all starts with levels built in 3D from juxtaposed blocks, something like little fragments of the world of Minecraft or Dragon Quest Builders like world building. In terms of extension and mechanics, however, the closest example could be Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, given that also in this case we are faced with rather limited levels in terms of extension but full of obstacles, traps, passages and possible enemies to fight, with the ability to jump and interact with characters and elements of the scenario. The setting takes on the appearance of a sort of block diorama that can be rotated in any direction to reveal every detail, with the possibility of also zooming in or out. With a basic mechanic that can be defined as a 3D platform with action-adventure elements, it is possible to create a large number of different game situations but always limited to these fragments of the world, which can also be linked together to form more complex adventures. . A box full of adventures Wonderbox is essentially an action adventure with 3D platforming elements Even if you don't have particular creative ambitions, Wonderbox: The Adventure Maker already has various contents that can simply be enjoyed as in a normal game. The main menu allows you to participate in the Campaigns built by the developers, try the levels created by the users, play in multiplayer or dedicate yourself to the creation of new worlds to be shared. There's a really good amount of content to use even without touching the editor, which makes the game suitable even for those who don't feel particularly creative. The problem is that the gameplay itself is rather limited, in most cases: even the pre-set campaigns from Aquiris are made up of simple levels in which we simply have to try to reach the exit by jumping on platforms and fighting in a very basic way with various enemies, hitting with sword and bow without going too subtle. The strength of Wonderbox lies above all in the power and ease of use of its editor, which allows those with the right predisposition to build even rather interesting levels. Among the content shared by users we already find several hundred levels to try, which demonstrates a remarkable liveliness for the game already in these first days of launch on Apple Arcade and bodes well for lasting support. Obviously the quality of these contributions varies extremely and in principle the most complex and interesting levels are still those of the developers, but interesting challenges can still be found, especially by those who manage to build platform phases with a minimum of sensible level design or action adventure situations by placing enemies and combat in a studied way. The intrinsic simplicity of the game mechanics, including the poor control over jumps and the need to often adjust the shot to have a clear view of the scenario, hardly allow the construction of very deep and satisfying gameplay, but the simple variety of situations and settings that we can find, in addition to the graphic quality of the models used, still makes a little experimentation pleasant in this large collection of mini-experiences. The Wonderbox editor is intuitive and allows you to create wonderful scenarios in no time Creating levels is very simple, although it still requires a certain amount of time and dedication: it's all about choosing ao general style among those foreseen at the moment (fantasy-style nature, medieval castles, desert and ice, with probable future expansions) and build the scenario within a 3D grid, developing it as desired both horizontally and vertically inside of a limited amount of space. Everything is based on the application of blocks with different characteristics, which are positioned very easily by touching and dragging your fingers on the touch screen. The excellent graphic style adopted does the rest, making every creation enjoyable even with good audio support. The downside, with such a default graphic setting, is a certain impossibility of creating something truly unique and original, but the amount of variables is likely to increase over time. Also very interesting is the possibility of creating small narrative fragments within the mini-adventures, something that is not easy to find in titles of this type and which further expands the creative potential of Wonderbox.", "date": "2021-04-13", "grade": "7.4"}
