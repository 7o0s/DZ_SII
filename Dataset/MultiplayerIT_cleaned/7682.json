The first official DLC of Bioshock Infinite arrives to fill this gap and appease the appetites while waiting for a new, much more substantial additional content that will take us back to the depths of Rapture. But let's go back to Clash in the Clouds, offered to the public at a price of around 5 euros and already included in the Season Pass, a feature that immediately made us turn up our noses. As you know by now it is increasingly difficult to be able to distinguish a legitimate expansion from a content deliberately omitted to generate further profit; the assumptions seem to lean towards the second unpleasant category, let's see if after our review we will be able to clarify your ideas on the goodness of this content. My museum Clash in the Clouds transports the two protagonists Booker and Elizabeth into a new hub area called the Archaeological Museum of Columbia, an area that connects the four areas proposed by this DLC and offers a shop for upgrading weapons. The nature of the content is immediately clear, which is expressed in the form of the classic Horde mode totally disconnected from the narrative context. This is demonstrated by the absence of unpublished dialogues and the recycling of the maps, obtained from assets already used in the main campaign. It seems that too little has passed since the release of the game to indulge in memories, so Duke & Dinmit, Raver's Dome and the Emporia Arcade are unable to enjoy the freshness desired by a new purchase. All in all we could even say that there is nothing new under the sun, it is not the first DLC that recycles the areas already seen in the main game. Clash in the Clouds is little more than an appetizer for DLC to come in the future The challenges proposed by the zones present an increasing difficulty by virtue of the tasks required to complete them, the result will influence the online rankings, but not only, given that there is a long list of unlockable objects and artworks in the game gallery, which will go to gradually enrich the museum. In the style of Bulletstorm we must pay attention to eliminating enemies in a creative way, also taking advantage of parts of the scenario to win points and then hard cash. Not to be forgotten is the use of Vigor powers, which can also be purchased in the shop once teleported to the museum. The most coveted goal is to triumph in the blue ribbon challenges, clashes that require special conditions that dramatically raise the challenge (as if there were a need...). All in all the soul of Clash in the Clouds, the blue ribbon challenges open up worrying questions behind an apparent genuineness. What really stands out are the limits of the combat system in relation to the main campaign, where the player is never really forced to exploit Elizabeth's abilities in the background or take advantage of a particular condition. Finding all this in an additional paid mode is not very heartening. The reduced price and the integration with the Season Pass are further signs that distinguish a substantially content-free DLC that could, and perhaps should have, presented itself in a good show once the end-game credits are over. The presence of Columbia's most powerful weapons, all available from the beginning is another sign of a mode designed to be used after completing the main one. Xbox 360 goals Clash in the Clouds increases the total number of objectives by ten units, similarly brings us 195 brand new player points. Completing the four areas allows us to conquer half of them, for the others we really need to roll up our sleeves and face the fearsome Blue Ribbon challenges. Good luck! Time is money In any case, Irrational Games has not skimped on attention to detail, from the presence of the aforementioned online rankings to a scalable system that allows everyone to tackle the content. The clashes are decidedly challenging and force us to face the most dangerous types of enemies and in large quantities, but the presence of a large number of aids that can be purchased in the shop smoothes the edges a lot, however to the detriment of the hard-earned position in the standings. In short, there is something for everyone. On balance, therefore, we are faced with one of the most difficult expansions to evaluate that has ever happened to us. Clash of the Clouds is basically done well, but doesn't really add anything other than a paid horde mode, which in an attempt to fill the gaps in the comb systemmoment ends up weakening the basic game, an antithetical feature compared to what should be the purposes of an additional content. This consideration therefore leads us to advise against this DLC or limit it only to the most loyal fans of the game eager for new challenges and objective points, without expecting content capable of entertaining for a long time. For that it will necessarily be necessary to wait for the promising Burial at Sea, of which Clash in the Clouds represents only a mere and unsatisfactory aperitif.", "date": "2013-08-09", "grade": null}
