These words, accompanied by Randy Newman's notes, formed the backdrop for two of the animated films that have had the most success and that are still very much alive today in the minds of many more or less young people, films that were also among the turning points for Pixar's definitive consecration. Just today, and more than 10 years later, the third film of this successful series arrives together with the dedicated video game, which belongs to that group of tie-ins that have equally made great strides over the last few years and which less and less rarely they are also valid videogame productions with all the trappings of the case. Toy Story 3: the video game is developed by Avalanche, the same people behind Just Cause 2, and actually sees as its strong point not so much the main story, but a free roaming mode that surprises for its variety and quality, and manages to fully capture the spirit of Toy Story. To infinity where? But let's go in order, the title produced by Disney obviously enjoys the official license of the film and therefore of all the characters, logos and music; is fully dubbed in Italian, with Fabrizio Frizzi and company in the local version to give voice to the main protagonists. Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Jessie, Mr Potato, Rex and the others are all inside the game ready to welcome the player in two big ways, which determine joys and pains. The first, obvious and obvious, retraces the events of the film in an interactive way through eight chapters connected by more or less unpublished interlude sequences. The type of gameplay ranges between action and cooperative puzzle, passing through platform phases and so on. The most interesting sections are certainly represented by those where it is possible to use Woody, Jessie and Buzz in turn, who can use their own peculiar skills to overcome some passages and help others. For example, the first can use the lasso to activate gears, Jessie can jump on pipes and ledges, Buzz throw the other characters to higher points. The result is certainly pleasant and clearly indicated for less savvy players, there are in fact different types of help that start from simple written suggestions to arrive at sequences in holographic form that indicate how to pass the next step. The problem with this modality, however, lies in two points: the longevity which stands at a few hours of play and above all the structure, where if at the beginning the narrative, graphic and identification part is close enough to resume those of the film, with continuing of the chapters enough is lost, the interlude sequences and their quality decrease, up to the final chapters where there seem to be real narrative holes, and the passage from one point of the story to another is only marginally explained, leaving a little bitterness in the mouth especially if you have seen the film. There's a friend on Wii too Toy Story 3: The Video Game is also available for the Nintendo Wii, and basically shares all the features of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox versions, namely the story mode and the toy box. In this case, too, fun is guaranteed and the graphics sector does its job very well in reproducing the world of Toy Story, unfortunately, however, the version for the Nintendo console does not have the possibility of playing cooperatively in free roaming mode, which among other Things also features fewer options and missions. Even the customization of the characters is no longer single, but is applied to all those present in the world of Woody and his companions. The game therefore remains equally interesting, but a step below its counterparts for Microsoft and Sony consoles. Playstation 3 trophies Toy Story 3: the Video Game offers 39 trophies, of which 3 are gold and 13 are silver, in addition to the ever-present platinum. The easiest are related to completing the story mode, to get to specific objectives in the toy box and completing different types of missions, up to the accumulation of all the gold stars and extras present. There is a free roam in me Where, on the other hand, the title surprises and expresses all its potential is in the mode called ~Toy box, Woody and his friends from the West~, a real free roaming set in the world of Toy Story in which it is possible to participate by choosing one of Woody, Buzz or Jessie. The aim is to expand and welcome new toys in this imaginary world by completing various missions to accumulate money and then, periodically, buy new buildings, characters with other missionsions and even new worlds, that of Doctor Zurg and the aliens for example, which systematically open up new pieces of the scenario to explore, new missions and even graphic themes. The playful spirit of Toy Story is fully captured here, every few missions, in fact, various toys are unlocked which not only serve to beautify the landscape, but also prove to be useful in moving around (see the Bullseye horse rather than the various machines present) and allow access to further sections of gameplay, which are certainly not lacking in variety. The structure of this mode is quite fun, the missions immediate and it's fun to paint the buildings rather than discovering new creations or dedicating yourself to dressing the inhabitants of the box: among the many missions there are in fact those of the pict-o-matic, where you have to reproduce some specific looks using different hats, haircuts and clothes, some of which take up other Pixar productions such as The Incredibles. Even the unlockable items are present in industrial quantities (out of all the 103 gold stars that are obtained by completing certain conditions) and the developer Avalanche has been very good in distributing the various elements in a constant and calibrated way for the duration of this mode, superior and not a little compared to the story. Let me be clear, the depth of the missions never reaches the complexity or spectacularity of the best exponents of the genre and as mentioned the setting is always tending towards ease and fun without too many frills, but otherwise we are faced with a valid implementation of free roaming within a tie-in. This is because the technical sector and above all the graphics can also be counted among the positive aspects: the game world is extremely colourful, clean and detailed in its stroke with good textures and light effects, perhaps a little static but decidedly pleasing to the eye and perfectly capable, always in the above toy box mode, of proposing the world of Toy Story adequately. Dulcis in fundo it is possible to face any game mode in cooperative via split screen, a feature that further increases variety and fun, and works exactly as you would expect. Between film and criticism of too many stereotypes Toy Story 3 in the United States is already a box office and critical success, it has matured with us, the point of reference for toys, Andy, has grown, as well as the way of narrating things, the script itself and the type of approach to the theme dealt with, which remains that of friendship and which becomes stronger and more ~touching~ at the end of the film. Even today, therefore, it does not give the idea of being childish in the negative sense of the term, but instead it is an explosion of rhythm, humor and, if we like, in some cases clichs (the combination Barbie / Ken is sensational from this point of view) that make you laugh and smile from start to finish, a truly successful sequel that easily manages to support the high quality of its illustrious predecessors, increasing the humorous component to support the past and as always giving away different touches of class. Precisely the presence of various clichs, and a ratio between male and female toys decidedly in favor of the former, has aroused some criticism on the presence of too many negative female stereotypes, which could give an incorrect interpretation of the role between the sexes. Honestly, during our vision we did not find all this imbalance or ~malice~ in using them to make people laugh, but you know, sensitivity and judgment varies from person to person.", "date": "2010-07-07", "grade": "8.0"}
