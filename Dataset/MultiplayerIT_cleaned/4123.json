This medieval sandbox puts us in the shoes of a nobody and gives us a whole world to face, following the path we believe is most appropriate. Such a free approach has its ups and downs, as does the game itself which struggles from different points of view, but is often quite fun, provided you have the ability and patience to deal with it. Available on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X | S, TaleWorlds Entertainment's game improves on what was achieved with the first chapter and offers dozens and dozens of hours of single player and multiplayer gameplay. Let's see the details in our review of Mount & Blade 2 Bannerlord. It starts from the bottom An area of Mount & Blade 2 Bannerlord Mount & Blade 2 Bannerlord wants us to become kings and queens, commanders of kingdoms with vassals and entire armies at our command. Before getting there, however, we will have to start from the bottom and learn to exploit the many, even if sometimes not particularly stratified, mechanics available. The adventure, after a somewhat too short tutorial, leaves us alone with a handful of coins and a generic plot mission. Narratively, Mount & Blade 2 Bannerlord is nothing incredible. Don't expect an epic quest with elaborate and deep characters. The NPCs are empty dummies and the game texts are repetitive, the price paid for having a huge map full of cities, villages and missions to be tackled at any moment, at the service of the evolution of our character. The world of Mount & Blade 2 Bannerlord is large and divided into various kingdoms Right now we will be able to go in every direction and explore every region, but we will not have the means to do so. The first step is to spend the money to set up a gang of mercenaries and therefore not risk being robbed by every group of bandits. Having gained strength in numbers, therefore, the cutthroats are repaid in their own coin and some loot and perhaps prisoners are gained. Passing from one village to another, within the 2D world map, we will be able to talk to a series of merchants and nobles of the area, in need of help. At this point the ~grinding~ begins, which is a constant repetition of small tasks necessary to gain resources or even just keep our purse inflated to make sure we can pay our group of soldiers. Initially a small group of soldiers is all we will have available The scale on which we are going to act will expand gradually. Close alliances with kingdoms we will be able to become vassals, managing a castle and some villages. We will go to war, we will manage (or rather we will activate, since there is little to manage) commercial routes or we will give control of specific parts of the game to the companions we have recruited. A certain chunk of Mount & Blade 2 Bannerlord can be managed without getting too involved and that's as much a good thing as a bad thing. It's a bad thing because it's never particularly thorough and the management options don't give us much control. It's good because we'll have more time to go to war. We fight The more soldiers there are, the more fun Mount & Blade 2 Bannerlord is One of the most relevant and characteristic elements of Mount & Blade 2 Bannerlord is the more action side. The sandbox is mainly based on clashes between groups of soldiers to determine who has dominance over a certain area or simply to ensure that we get resources and loot, including food and equipment for our character. The battles are a mix of real-time action and strategy. We will have our character, who will lead his own soldiers, but apart from a little more intelligence we won't have much else to our advantage. Even with good skills, good equipment, and even having mastered the one-on-one combat system, in the midst of melee we will be worth as much as anyone standing in front of us. There are many types of troops and we will be able to evolve them as we take on battles in Mount & Blade 2 Bannerlord Our character can fall very easily, but on basic difficulty it doesn't mean game over: our soldiers will be able to win for us and after the battle we will be able to recover our health. The real task is to give orders to the troops, defining formations, movements and other actions. This is not a simple task and it will take several hours just to start getting the hang of it if you are not already used to this type of mechanics. The battlefield, however, can give satisfaction in the more advanced stages of the game, between pitched battles and sieges. Both inWhether in an offline campaign or in online battles, you can put your attack and retreat strategies to good use to get the better of it. However, if you want to fight in first person, perhaps choosing the right moment, you will have to get used to an attack system based on the four directions, which allows you to attack and parry with a simple movement of the mouse and a click. Dueling might seem like a precise art, but most of the time it will be pure metal-on-metal chaos. A proper Middle Ages There are so many 3D environments in Mount & Blade II Bannerlord, but there's not much point in exploring them The beauty of Mount & Blade 2 Bannerlord is also in the atmosphere, in this medieval world that is large and full of environments. Each village can in fact be explored on foot and on horseback and the wide open spaces of the battlefields vary according to the region, also with tactical implications. Unfortunately there are some technical and even structural limitations. Although initially it is pleasant to take a tour of the city, very quickly we realize that it is not necessary at all and, indeed, it is much better to use the menus to speak directly with the various notables of the area. Completely avoiding exploring 3D maps, saving time within an already lengthy campaign in itself. The view from a castle wall in Mount & Blade 2 Bannerlord This also removes the hindrance of having to move in technically non-excellent environments. Again, we are faced with the price paid for the magnitude of this work. Dozens of villages, cities and castles cannot be created with attention to every detail. Finally, the dubbing is average and does not excel, while the soundtrack accompanies us with pleasure during the adventure. The voices are in English, but the text is translated into Italian, which is very welcome since the game is mostly text-based.", "date": "2023-01-14", "grade": "8.0"}
