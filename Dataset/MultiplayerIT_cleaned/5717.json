Although Hunting Unlimited has had several sequels, until the last discrete iteration in 2011, the Czech studio is known worldwide mainly for its driving simulators dedicated to trucks, such as the 18 Wheels of Steel series, including a dozen titles, and above all Euro Truck Simulator, from which various thematic spin-offs have been translated such as German Truck Simulator, SCANIA Truck Driving Simulator and UK Truck Simulator. However, the consecration at an international level only took place in 2012 with the launch of the splendid Euro Truck Simulator 2, a title which to date has managed to place the beauty of over two million copies on the market. A truly surprising result for a fundamentally niche product, which in addition to offering a thick playful substrate was able to count on the constant support of the developers, who intervened by refining and expanding the experience also through a couple of valuable expansions, such as the spectacular Scandinavia which we reviewed a few months ago. Driven by the enthusiasm of the users and the solid foundations that have been created, the development team convinced itself to return to the fascinating theme of 18 Wheels of Steel with American Truck Simulator, a work that can simply be summarized as a version stars and stripes of Euro Truck Simulator 2. Released on February 3 on Steam, we put it to the whip with our driving position and this is our analysis. The charm of the USA in American Truck Simulator, the new effort by the authors of Euro Truck Simulator 2 The land of opportunities Once the game has been started, weighing a single GB of data, you are projected into a menu that is practically identical to that of Euro Truck Simulator 2, both in terms of dynamics and in the options available, although there are some small, interesting innovations. Beyond the organization of the units of measurement, linked to the American system but adjustable to the European values, it is possible to intervene on parameters that are even more in-depth than the simulation aspects, such as for example on the different types of brakes relating to the semi-trailer and the tractor. The best control method for enjoying the experience is naturally a steering wheel equipped with 900 of rotation and a force feedback effect, essential not only for identifying yourself with the role, but also for performing more complex parking manoeuvres. Just like in Euro Truck Simulator 2 you start without a euro (or rather, a dollar) and to start accumulating funds you need to work as an employee. In this mode the player has to worry only about the delivery of the load, given that the various customers, companies that often mimic really existing brands, make the truck available and cover all the costs related to the transport. Although it is a pleasant and relaxing component, the beating heart of the game lies in the self-employment and entrepreneurial work, which in addition to guaranteeing greater income integrates a simple but intriguing management component, at the basis of the creation of a real logistics empire. Since trucks are quite expensive (about 120,000 dollars are needed for a basic Peterbilt), if you don't want to wait until you have enough money, you can apply for a loan from the bank, to be repaid in ~comfortable~ daily installments. At the beginning of the game you decide in which city to locate your headquarters, which with time and money can not only be expanded and improved, but also accompanied by external offices to be searched on the map. By expanding your company, you can buy other vehicles and hire truck drivers from employment agencies, triggering a virtuous circle that significantly increases revenue and allows for further investments. With each new experience level gained, it is possible to improve one's truck driver skills, for example by increasing the length of journeys and integrating the transport of precious and dangerous goods, such as chemicals and explosives. The playful substance, for those who loved Euro Truck Simulator 2, is practically the same translated into American soil, but there are some interesting distinctive features in the new work. Hot asphalt Similarly to the title from which it draws inspiration, American Truck Simulator is also made with a modular structure to be expanded with new contents, however it is a much more ambitious project that will only be able to embrace most of the fifty states that make up the USA. In this pThe first package, sold for around twenty euros, is in fact only California and Nevada, which will soon be accompanied (free of charge) by Arizona. Considering the development times of the expansions released for Euro Truck Simulator 2, it could take many years to be able to undertake the famous ~Coast to Coast~. The currently available map is not comparable in extent to the basic offer of Euro Truck Simulator 2, however the new cities surpass in quality those already appreciated in Scandinavia, thanks to significantly larger dimensions and an even more accurate reproduction of road networks, monuments and urban planning , supported by painstaking analysis of Google Maps and in-depth topographical studies. The substantial difference with the previous title consists precisely in the peculiar American road structure, characterized by the enormous highways that connect the most important metropolises (for example Los Angeles and Sacramento) and by extra-urban roads which, in this specific case, get lost in the rocky and desert environments between Nevada and California. Currently only two trucks are available, the Peterbilt 579 and the Kentworth T 680, and although they can be customized both aesthetically and in performance, the variety is certainly less than that of the simulator set in Europe. Soon, however, the Swedish Volvo should join the two American manufacturers. The eighteen wheels with stars and stripes differ from European heavy vehicles for a greater number of gears and for the possibility of transporting longer semi-trailers, which in American Truck Simulator can put the player's skills to the test during the parking phase. One of the main differences with Euro Truck Simulator 2 consists precisely in being able to select the difficulty of the maneuver to be performed once you reach your destination, allowing for a greater gain in experience if you opt for the more articulated and complex one. Among the peculiar features of the game there are also the possibility of weighing the load on special scales and a slightly different functioning in the management of traffic violations: if in Europe the deterrent is represented by speed cameras, in American Truck Simulator they are the (many) police patrols to monitor compliance with the limits, ready to impose very high fines of a thousand dollars. Naturally, close attention must also be paid to traffic lights, which unlike in Europe are positioned on the opposite side of the intersections and not on the stop line, a situation that can sometimes lead to error, especially on the characteristic ups and downs of San Francisco. Relaxing glimpses From a technical point of view, the title is more solid than the excellent Scandinavian expansion thanks to the greater attention paid to the details, however the urban settlements, despite being much richer and more varied, still have several clones of shop windows and buildings. City centers and warehouses are embellished with a higher number of animated pedestrians, sometimes engaged in peculiar activities; just outside Las Vegas, for example, you can see a skateboard park with several kids doing stunts. These are small fragments of life that increase involvement and give American cities a more colorful and ~human~ face than those appreciated in the past. Even the roads and the sky are more realistic and among other things it is possible to observe meteors, aircraft of various kinds and even the iconic rolls of straw (the so-called tumbleweed) that sometimes cross the roadway in the driest areas. The lighting effects are very good, especially during sunrises and sunsets, where the delightful HDR is able to give particularly poetic and relaxing glimpses, one of the most loved features of the ~Truck Simulator~ saga. With our test configuration, at maximum detail and in 1080p, the frame rate is stable at 60 frames per second in most cases, but some drops are noticeable in particularly stressful conditions, such as a busy city center in pouring rain. Among the most interesting technical aspects there is the renewed traffic artificial intelligence, which manages to interpret the player's intentions more effectively by avoiding traffic jams and trivial accidents, one of the plagues of the first builds of Euro Truck Simulator 2. Finally, the soundtrack is good original and the various audio samples, although some of them have been translated from the previous work.", "date": "2016-02-09", "grade": "8.0"}
