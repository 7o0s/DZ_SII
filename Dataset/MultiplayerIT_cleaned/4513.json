One thing is sure though: in terms of platforming we can't really complain. In recent months, the genre has given us valid exponents, both on consoles and on PC, including Yooka-Laylee and obviously Super Mario Odysey. But there's also a third competitor, perhaps a little less known, which performed really well on computers last October, selling more than 50,000 copies in just a few days after experiencing a successful Kickstarter campaign. Now it also arrives on consoles in better shape than ever: it's A Hat in Time. A tribute to times gone by Even A Hat in Time is the son of nostalgia for those titles that ten years ago consecrated the genre of 3D platformers. The references are obvious, and if that weren't enough, the developers themselves say on social networks that they were inspired by the masterpieces of the Nintendo 64 and GameCube era, including Super Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie and Super Mario Sunshine. And on closer inspection there is not even a pinch of Super Mario Galaxy and Spyro The Dragon missing. Taking the controller in your hands there is a bit of fear of finding yourself dealing with a simple Super Mario clone (it wouldn't even be the first time), and at first glance the raw technical sector of the production certainly doesn't help. But once a little trust has been granted, A Hat in Time gets off to a great start, takes the player by the hand, presenting him with an extremely original universe, full of situations and charismatic characters, which underline his very specific identity. The protagonist of the adventure is the little Hat Kid, who on board his spaceship travels thoughtlessly through space and time. This is until a mafioso (yes, a mafioso) causes a breakdown and the loss of all 40 hourglasses, the vehicle's precious fuel. We will therefore have to land on the first available planet, which also serves as the initial game world: Mafia Town. Thus begins our patient search for all the hourglasses, but it is easier said than done, given that the power of objects is clear to everyone (they can turn back time and prevent certain events from happening), and half the universe will want to get their hands on it. Including Mustache Girl, our moustachioed and schizophrenic antagonist, the only one to enjoy a real English-language dubbing, which is completely annoying and avoidable. A hat for every occasion A Hat in Time is a 3D platformer spread across five different worlds, thankfully completely different from each other. The glue is not so much a barely sketched plot, but the search for the numerous collectibles scattered everywhere. In fact, we are not referring only to the forty hourglasses lost by the Hat Kid, but also to hats, balls of yarn, tokens and relics, each with a very specific function. The protagonist has among her basic moves just the jump and a long sprint to reach the farthest platforms, but she will soon earn respectable auxiliary weapons: starting from the dreadful umbrella stolen from the Mafia in Mafia Town, useful for carrying out a series of basic attacks, to the much more interesting hats. The latter are the heart of the gameplay of A Hat in Time, and the title itself should already have told you something. However, the resemblance to the basic weapon of Super Mario Odyssey is only apparent: each headgear of our heroine will remain firmly on her head or allow her to take control of her enemies. Instead, they will be used to gain particular abilities: run much faster and sprint, become bombers armed with explosives, slow down time and much more. Hat Kid's hats and clothes are also customizable both in functioning and in coloring, it will be enough to continue collecting the collectibles to unlock the many possibilities. From time to time we will also meet a mysterious merchant who, in exchange for the game coins collected in the levels, will sell us stickers, small permanent upgrades that can make our lives a little easier. Playstation 4 trophies In certain situations, especially in the Time Rifts, A Hat in Time offers a demanding but never insurmountable challenge. The platinum of the game will therefore require the right amount of dedication, as well as varied objectives: collect all the collectibles, complete the plot, perform certain (optional) actions within the five game worlds. Fifteen hours should be enough. A solid adventure, but at times a little uncertain Perhaps five worlds are a bit few for a 3D platformer, especially if they are small in size, but the problem is circumvented thanks to the plot divided into chapters, in full Super Mario 64 and Super Mario S styleunshine. Each scenario can therefore not only be visited at will, but with each new visit it shows something new and new paths open up that were previously blocked. Let's take the world of Mafia Town: it is divided into four chapters complete with a final boss fight, and we have never found ourselves doing the same thing twice. To enrich longevity there are also the dimensional gates, which offer much more demanding (and infamous) challenges than the story missions: they will appear in the worlds already visited if we manage to satisfy certain conditions, for example finding a certain relic. It is also true that A Hat in Time is not all rosy: it suffers from various technical problems which individually do not spoil the fun, but all together they are annoyingly showy. An almost always inspired level design has to coexist with various cases of interpenetration between polygons, objects suspended in mid-air for no apparent reason, graphic glitches and not always convincing physics. The camera is also irritating, often the real culprit for missteps and falls on deaf ears. These are aspects to which, however, one can turn a blind eye, above all because they are sporadic. And then, to be honest, the production never tries to hide its nature: that of a small product for connoisseurs, created by a small group of enthusiasts.", "date": "2017-12-05", "grade": "8.0"}
