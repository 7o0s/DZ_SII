{"name": "Fobia - St. Dinfna Hotel", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fobia-st-dinfna-hotel-recensionee.html", "text": "A creepy hotel, monsters hidden in the lower floors, heart-pounding exploration to figure out exactly what needs to be done to continue the adventure: there are some evergreen features in horror titles. And if it is true that the small but intense demo of P.T. has almost created an entire strand of its own within the genre - the latest representatives of which are Visage and the very recent MADiSON - no one can deny the importance of a much older model: that sacred monster called Resident Evil. In a context where independent horror films all too often look alike (or all look like the corridors of P.T.) and still show very few creative flashes, every small exception represents a breath of fresh air. This is also the case of Fobia - St. Dinfna Hotel, a survival horror developed by a small Brazilian team (Pulsatrix Studios) and published by Maximum Games, who evidently immediately sensed its potential. The paradox: Phobia isn't really new either, because it recycles practically every mechanic from Resident Evil 7. However, in addition to putting their own into it, the developers have kept in mind, for once, a different model from the one indicated by Kojima and overused in recent years, thus obtaining a sort of innovation which is actually a very effective rediscovery of a certain way of understanding the genre. In the review of Fobia - St. Dinfna Hotel we will try to explain to you whether or not the survival horror in question is right for you. We have omitted spoilers of any kind, so as not to spoil your possible experience with darkness. Plot: haunted hotels and gas masks The environments of Fobia - St. Dinfna Hotel are all very charming The plot of Phobia - St. Dinfna Hotel is divided into three different timelines: 1920, 1960 and the 2000s. This is an original and intriguing first element, as the player begins his adventure in the past (the 60s) when a private detective finds himself investigating a mysterious cult that has settled in a remote town, until he himself becomes the last victim. To kill him will be a singular creature, a sort of mutant equipped with a gigantic claw instead of an arm; and already here it is easy to trace a clear suggestion of Resident Evil, in the figure of the Nemesis. However, this coming and going between the different historical periods will not be too invasive, apart from another couple of sequences set in the early twentieth century, useful not only for partially changing the entire style of play, but also for shedding light on the events that led to the situation current. Some areas of Fobia - St. Dinfna Hotel are creepier than others Almost all of the main adventure takes place instead in the hotel of the same name, where things definitely don't go as they should. Shortly after his arrival, in fact, the journalist Roberto Leite Lopes finds himself in complete solitude, in an environment with a drastically changed appearance: everything is run-down or on fire, the light is available only in some rooms, and strange creatures have taken over control of the lower floors. As if that weren't enough, every now and then a little girl with a gas mask peeps out, apparently harmless but still very disturbing. Lopes certainly didn't expect any of this, even if he reached the hotel to investigate the alleged disappearances of the local population and certain paranormal phenomena reported in the area. Will the unfortunate protagonist be able to solve the mystery of the hotel? What is the mysterious cult known as Il Sentiero, whose headquarters would be located right in the basement of the structure, up to? Where do the monsters come from, and how are they related to the little girl? While the narrative cues show clear parallels to the plot of Resident Evil 7 (not the house but a hotel, not the Bakers but the cultists, and then again the unknown helper on the other end of the phone, the creepy little girl, etc.) the development team has created a coherent, interesting and not without surprises story. Just that ~knowing how it ends~ will be one of the main stimuli that will spur you to continue, when you no longer know where to hit your head to continue from one floor to another of the hotel. Gameplay: camera and firearms Without using the camera, you will go a little far in Fobia - St. Dinfna Hotel The formula proposed by the developers for Fobia is ~explore, solve puzzles and survive~, and perfectly sums up the playful proposal of the survival horror in question. First of all, the player finds himself exploring the hotel floor by floor, gradually gaining access even to initially blocked areas, by finding magnetic cards, crowbars, keys and so on. The progression isn't there thoughlinear and provides for very intense backtracking, thanks to the absence of a real map of the individual floors and of the structure as a whole. Safe areas have been set up from time to time, where you can save your progress (via the pendulum clock) as well as add and delete items from your inventory (with chests with shared content). Overall, the cases in which we find ourselves wandering without reference points are not infrequent, even if in any case small clues would like to direct us at least towards the plane of interest in that particular moment of the exploration. The cute creatures of Phobia - St. Dinfna Hotel (and there are real bosses) The gameplay, however, is not just walking between rooms. The presence of a camera capable of interacting with the surrounding environment makes everything more interesting: for reasons that will be clarified in the course of the narration, the tool is able to bring back in time, thus modifying the objects present in the surroundings or opening unexpected passages. That is, it is possible that a room is simply a dead end; but looking through the lens, a gap appears in the wall instead, so that he can continue. Fortunately, it is not necessary to recall the camera from the inventory every three by two completely at random, because there are specific signs (the black print of a hand) on the walls or on objects that require its use. Here the suggestion clearly no longer comes from Resident Evil, but from another excellent horror film of the last decade, the Outlast series. The enigmas of Phobia - St. Dinfna Hotel constitute the most successful aspect of the entire production Two more elements contribute to better defining the offer of Fobia - St. Dinfna Hotel: the fire fights and the puzzles. The former are perhaps the least convincing aspect of the entire production, not so much for the banality of the weapons themselves (a pistol, a shotgun, a machine gun) and not even for their characteristics (recoil, damage, dispersion and much more can be improved through upgrades) but due to enemies. The dark creatures that haunt the hotel will just sit about their business, motionless on the spot, ready to attack you only if you get within a breath of their face; it goes without saying that it will therefore be possible to eliminate them calmly at a safe distance. Even when they attack, however, both they and the bosses don't show who knows what intelligence: most of the time they deliver lethal blows simply in a vacuum or against walls. The situation definitely improves with the puzzles, always intelligent, satisfying and also very numerous compared to any other title belonging to the genre. Especially in this aspect, the developers have literally let their imagination run wild.", "date": "2022-07-16", "grade": "8.0"}
