{"name": "Axiom Verge 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/axiom-verge-2-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Axiom Verge 2 drags us back into an alien world, albeit different from that of the first chapter of the series. However, this is not the only novelty of this sequel, which adopts a different approach in various respects: it changes the style of the scenarios (of most of them, at least), it changes the focus of a gameplay that focuses entirely on exploration by putting in the background the fights and by severely limiting our arsenal, the main characters and their stories naturally change. So what remains of that Axiom Verge which in 2015 caused a jolt in the indie scene, showing us how a retro-style metroidvania should be done ? The formula, in the first place, reaffirmed in a practically scholastic way from the first to the last of the upgrades and from the first to the last obstacle that we will be able to overcome thanks to them. And then of course the undoubted ability of the author, Thomas Happ, to keep everything together with a coherence and vision that is still uncommon today, despite the fact that in recent years this same vein has seen the emergence of some pearls of extraordinary quality. History Axiom Verge 2, the confrontation between the protagonist and a mysterious entity Surprisingly launching on PC (via the Epic Games Store), PS4 and Nintendo Switch, Axiom Verge 2 tells the story of Indra Chaudhari, a multinational owner who recently bought the settlements and technologies developed by Elizabeth Hammond, a scientist who conducted mysterious research in Antarctica for years. It is precisely there that the woman goes in the initial sequences of the campaign, aboard a helicopter. Something does not go right, however, and during the inspection Indra falls into the void. He wakes up later in a body that looks like it always did, but which is no longer his, but has been rebuilt by nanomachines of an ancient technology. The female figure who speaks to her through nanites, Amashilama, explains that she is now in the world of Kiengir and that perhaps there is a way back, but not without a struggle. The place that Elizabeth Hammond was desperately looking for, and that she probably found together with her expedition, is in fact populated by hordes of dangerous drones that attack any unexpected life form, the last legacy of a bloody war that led to the devastation of that world. Armed with a pickaxe and a boomerang, but also with an ability that allows you to hack enemies and electronic devices, we will therefore have to explore the scenario in search of answers and a possible way out. What really happened to Kiengir? Who are the mysterious Arms that Indra can accommodate in her new body and that give her special abilities? What is hidden in the stormy past of the protagonist? And what is the secret of the Breccia, the parallel reality that can only be explored by drones? Over the course of the approximately ten hours it takes to complete the Axiom Verge 2 campaign we will get some answers, but some of them we may not like. Gameplay Axiom Verge 2, the ability to climb allows you to reach previously inaccessible areas It was reasonable to expect from Axiom Verge 2 in some way a ~more of the same~, an enrichment of the play system that many users had appreciated and which precisely provided for close combat, a rich arsenal with many firearms and a certain type of atmosphere . Instead, what Happ has given us is in some way a hybrid, an experience that on the one hand certainly relaunches the founding elements of the metroidvania sub-genre, on the other it clearly pulls back, almost as if to convey a political message. It therefore happens that the numerous enemies present within the map can be avoided by moving quickly, even including the bosses (apart from a couple of mandatory battles for the purposes of the plot). You can use this approach for convenience, especially until you unlock the ability to instantly move from one save point to another; but also, it must be recognized, because the combat system is less exciting than expected and is expressed through often approximate dynamics. Axiom Verge 2, platforms and drones are a constant of the levels Here, therefore, that the focus, as mentioned, shifts to exploration and the puzzles connected to it; on the essence, therefore, of a medroidvania structure that opens the doors to new areas for us only and exclusively when we come into possession of a skill that allows us to access them. The spectacular explosion that Indra can perform and which disintegrates certain rocks, or the ability to climb surfaces, the call of the drone that we have already talked about and which has its own set of skills, including a catapultwhich destroys specific blocks or a partial flight device to reach more distant platforms. After that there is the power to hack the devices and enemies, so as to block them, slow them down or even turn them into impromptu allies, and which represents of itself an additional source of environmental puzzles to solve. Where is the switch to disable that barrier? What happens if I use a hostile drone as a platform to reach a higher point? Questions that you will not fail to ask yourself as soon as you have begun to understand the philosophy behind certain choices. And then there's the Breach, which adds a further layer of complexity to the structure and puzzle solving. Axiom Verge 2, a section in the Breach commanding the small drone Here, in the context of this system there are perhaps some less successful and valued aspects, which remain in the background and which it is even possible to ignore until the end of the campaign, they are so marginal. We are referring to certain weapons and certain upgrades, given that in the end it is enough to emphasize only some of Indra's skills for the character to have what she needs to overcome virtually any obstacle. And maybe modify some values from the options related to accessibility to make the clashes much less insidious. It is therefore not a donut with a perfect hole that Thomas Happ has prepared over the last six years, also allowing himself a postponement lo last May to carry out further refinements. However, it is certainly ~his~ donut, his way of understanding what by now, also thanks to him, has become to all intents and purposes a sub-genre recognized and appreciated in the increasingly multifaceted world videogame panorama. Structure and technique Axiom Verge 2, a huge worm to be eliminated by exploiting the surrounding environment and Indra's skills In terms of content, Axiom Verge 2 is decidedly dry: from the main screen it is possible to access the campaign (with three different save slots available) or the interesting speedrun mode, designed precisely for those who want to attempt the feat and who cut away automatically dialogues and interlude sequences to leave room only for an in-game action that is as fast as possible. The map is visually represented by blocks and can be navigated paying attention to any coordinates communicated to us by a document or a character , which produces a bright dot that indicates the next goal to reach. How to get there, of course, will be the problem we'll have to solve for ourselves, often making surprisingly long loops and virtually lighting a candle to the god of backtracking. Axiom Verge 2 also includes the inevitable sections in the dark, in this case, moreover, submerged Navigating the Breach, the alternative dimension perfectly superimposed on the world of Kiengir, implies very similar dynamics, even if in that case we will be able to move only at the command of our small drone, cross ducts that connect one ~room~ to another and face different threats with our trusty rotating appendix, until we find an exit that projects us into a different area even on the starting map. You understand what the point is, yes? The whole experience is strongly characterized by the inevitable retro style, which refers to the era of 16-bit systems as regards the in-game graphics, albeit with a somewhat cloying appeal to rotations and ~aggregate~ sprites when the objects are big, see for example the bosses. However, everything changes in the breach, which instead turns into the paradise of 8 bits and psychedelia, somehow distorting and reinterpreting even the beautiful soundtrack that accompanies us throughout the adventure.", "date": "2021-08-24", "grade": "8.0"}
