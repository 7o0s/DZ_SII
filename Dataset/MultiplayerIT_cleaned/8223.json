{"name": "CRYSTAR", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crystar-recensione.html", "text": "There are video games that are perfect for escaping from the real world and all its problems, others that forcefully force you to face one and the other. In the best of cases, after having enriched you with new awareness. The FuRyu developers probably opted for a middle ground: as a result we found ourselves a curious game, with strongly spiritualistic and philosophical inspirations, but at the same time also with clear ideas regarding the playful offer itself. However, the overall experience, and we consciously choose to anticipate it, should above all convince not so much lovers of Western philosophy as connoisseurs of Japanese culture and society; so much so that the protagonist, Rei Hatada, falls to all intents and purposes into the hikikomori category, that is, those individuals who have escaped by precise choice from the competitive and demanding logic of a very little ~social~ society like the Japanese one. If we have piqued your curiosity, the CRYSTAR review will provide you with all the coordinates you need to evaluate a hypothetical purchase. Plot based on Purgatory CRYSTAR abounds in maidens, for once without malice Rei Hatada and her sister Mirai ended up in the otherworldly realm for unclear reasons. Transformed into brilliant butterflies, their spirits roam Purgatory, waiting for a transformation or a relocation; only those who manage to awaken their self-awareness can restore a physical body faithful to the now lost real counterpart. The special bond between the two sisters contributes to the result, but things soon become even more complicated. In fact, due to a tragic fatality, Rei, who transformed into a warrior to defend her sister from the dangers of Purgatory, strikes and kills the latter. All is not lost, because two guardian demons of the places (we postpone the names, but each enemy, supporting character and NPC usually has one relating to Greek philosophy and mythology) offer her an agreement. Rei Hatada will fight the evil local creatures known as the Specter and Revenant for them, and the keepers in return will restore Mirai's soul, in a potentially beneficial deal for both. No extraordinary twists along the way, but at least Rei will unexpectedly meet three other warriors from Purgatory, who will join the party. You will thus be able to explore their background, discovering motifs and stories that have led them to the kingdom beyond death; basically, each chapter of the main plot contains a narrative arc in itself conclusive. We appreciated the balance between the fights with white weapons in Purgatory and the introspection of the protagonist. In fact, the main hub consists precisely in his bedroom, of which it is impossible not to appreciate the aesthetics too. From here Rei can contact her ~new~ friends and the demons themselves via smartphone, access Purgatory with her own mirror, pet the dog (never trust video games that don't allow you to cuddle animals), and above all purify the Torments. And you will now ask yourselves: what are Torments? We tell you later. Gameplay based on tears (and torments) CRYSTAR and fight lights often get along. Sometimes, however, not At first glance, the gameplay of CRYSTAR does not present any original ideas. The protagonist moves from one dungeon to another massacring all (literally all) enemies on the screen, anonymous demons of anonymous levels connected to each other through anonymous corridors. Nothing to tear your hair out of even in the action mechanics: forget Devil May Cry, the action is there but it's not designed to satisfy battles against hordes of enemies. Better to approach them one at a time (also thanks to the camera), and take full advantage of the alternation of combos based on light and heavy attacks. Skills are linked to pressing keys simultaneously (the R command combined with A, B, Y, X), but even in this case you will probably choose one and always use only that one. More interesting are the possibilities related to tears and torments. In practice, continuing to fight enemy after enemy means accumulating their despair, with tears that will recharge a special bar (the Tear Gauge). Once the accumulation is complete, the main characters will be able to summon a mystical Guardian, who will fight alongside them for a while, unleashing literally devastating offensives; think of it as a very simplified variant of what we saw years ago with Astral Chain. It will always be the defeated enemies, then, who will deliver you a Torment, that is to say an emotionally devastated part of what remains of the respective human soul; in fact the monsters to be defeatedthey are but corrupted human souls. Torments of CRYSTAR are a distressing but functional aspect of the gameplay In themselves, the Torments attribute malus, but it is always good to collect them. Once back in Rei's bedroom you can purify them, transform them into upgrades and equip them. What's more: related Torments can be combined with each other, thus leading to the creation of increasingly useful defensive items and power-ups. This is the deepest aspect of the role-playing component of CRYSTAR, but in terms of customization you will also find different stylistic possibilities in the protagonist's wardrobe. Some more dubious than others.", "date": "2022-03-25", "grade": "7.0"}
