Too bad that since then the genre has felt the lack of new surprises, and that the only game to make a big voice was that port of Final Fantasy: Tactics full of flaws and bad optimizations. Finally, to conclude this period of fasting, Witching Hour thought about it, the young Singaporean developer founded by some fans of the genre and whose purpose is to want to replicate on iOS that complexity and that care by now seemed to have become a luxury reserved for Fire Emblem fans and Advance Wars. We want to say it immediately and with full conviction: Ravenmark: Scourge of Estellion is not the usual B-series production to fall back on in the absence of big names, nor the umpteenth ~I wish but I can't~ to which the App Store, with its thousand clones and games without personality, has accustomed its users. Digging deep The first of what has every intention of becoming a multi-chapter series, Scourge of Estellion takes the player to the lands of Eclipse, a typical fantasy kingdom populated by mysterious creatures and divided between several warring nations. And yet, not even the time to familiarize yourself with the various characters and with the narrated plot that you are immediately catapulted into the middle of the battle, despite the fact that the excellent tutorial succeeds in the non-trivial task of illustrating, in a comprehensive but not too verbose way, what they are the foundations of a gameplay studied in detail. In the first moments of the game, Ravenmark looks like a classic turn-based strategy, in which the player's and enemy units move one at a time within a grid. Those already familiar with the genre will also find familiar the traditional rock-paper-scissors scheme that underlies every battle and that creates a successful balance between the units deployed: in the game, archers are more effective against infantry units but they reveal themselves particularly weak to the attacks of the knights, in turn powerless against a handful of spearmen. Each mission offers different objectives from time to time, which range from eliminating all enemies to escaping to a point on the map, but it only takes a few minutes to realize how deep and complex the game mechanics are, undoubtedly inspired to the classics of the genre but at the same time refined to offer an original and no less interesting experience. An example is the possibility of uniting two or three units of the same type in formation, a tactical choice which gives the soldiers involved various offensive and defensive bonuses, but which significantly reduces their freedom of movement; a wall of soldiers arranged in formation could prove useful in weakening the enemy defenses, or it could block their advance to give their allies time to flee or regroup. Another characteristic of Ravenmark is the fact that in the resolution of the turn the moves of one's own units are mixed with those of the enemies, prompting the player to think carefully about the order in which the soldiers will move and possibly trying to predict the opponent's moves. Seeing that an enemy can attack a dying unit before it is able to move away or heal itself, one could decide, for example, to shift the fire of the archers towards that opponent, or to send nearby cavalry to the rescue of the unit in danger. If we add to this the limited number of moves, the special abilities that characterize each character, the excellent artificial intelligence and the influence that the morphology of the battlefield and the type of environment have on the various units, it is obvious that to create a large number of unpredictable and unexpected situations, so that the player is continually stimulated to ponder his tactical choices. The only drawback is perhaps represented by the impossibility of deactivating the animations of the battles, however short enough not to represent too annoying an element for the less patient player. Unforgettable (not so) heroes Just like in Fire Emblem and Disgaea, the plot is narrated for 15 chapters through a long series of dialogues between the characters in a style that is very reminiscent of Japanese graphic novels. Unfortunately, if we really had to find something that Ravenmark lacks to compete head-on with the most famous franchises this would be a captivating story and dialogues that have bite, which could lead less patient users to skip scenes of'interlude to launch directly into the next battle. Let me be clear, the illustrations of the characters and the backdrops that enrich the dialogue interludes are impeccably done, but although the developers have committed themselves to creating heroes characterized as in Fire Emblem, Calius Septim has nowhere near the charisma and personality of Lyn and Eliwood. A plot full of clichs doesn't help, which amid a thousand subterfuges, betrayals and wars between factions never reaches enough epic tones to fully involve the player, a goal achieved instead by the splendid soundtrack by Josh Whelchel: in addition to having a rare quality for a production independent mobile, the huge amount of songs and their variety ensures a sound accompaniment that is always consistent with the game atmosphere, completely eliminating that annoyance you feel listening to the same music at every level. While not having an unforgettable plot, we said, the effort made by Witched Hour to fill the game with narrative details is undeniable, so much so that every single unit is characterized by a detailed description and each character has a unique background. Thus it becomes indispensable to resort to the CodeX, a sort of Encyclopedia accessible at any time and which allows you to consult all the details on the history of Ravenmark and on the legends of Eclipse, on the abilities of the characters and on their biographies. It is an extremely well-finished tool, both in terms of contents and for the graphical interface, which, like the one used for battles, is specifically designed to be enjoyed on the small iPhone screen and allows you to navigate through the numerous menus with a more unique than rare convenience in the playful panorama of the App Store.
