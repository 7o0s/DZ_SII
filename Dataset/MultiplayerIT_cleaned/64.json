{"name": "The Legend of Zelda - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-legend-of-zelda-recensione.html", "text": "What was it yesterday Backed by the not too distant experience of Warren Robinett's Adventure, the legendary big bang of graphic adventures transposed from the original text adventure by Crowther and Woods, The Legend of Zelda must have appeared to the players and critics of the time as a work capable of imposing a new way of understanding video games. For the first time, textual clues, however rudimentary, and graphical interaction coexisted in a fantasy adventure from the vast videogame world for the time, divided into screens full of enemies and new situations, implanted on a refined and complex game structure, with a varied design and engaging. The Legend of Zelda, in addition to being an exciting and very challenging adventure, was also the first NES title to feature a battery to save progress in the game. Zelda didn't just eclipse Adventure as a video game labyrinth, it incorporated a degree of warlike interaction with enemies that had found a precedent in Gauntlet and found here a more strategic dimension, fused with the exploratory element in a complex game world. The Legend of Zelda would go on to sell one million copies for the NES, setting a new record and starting a story that today continues with enormous success. What is it today While the Zelda saga has moved with enormous success into the paradigm of three-dimensional gaming and embarked on new paths, without betraying the spirit of the first chapters but incorporating much more storytelling, aesthetics and richness of situations, The Legend of Zelda for NES could look like a technically obsolete title. Indeed, as cutting-edge as it was at the time, the few pixels and only two audio channels with which the NES attempted to take us to a different world can make us smile today. But video games have been successful in stealing us into their own worlds even before the advent of polygons, texture mapping and remote controllers, and Zelda still wins: the prototypical plot, aesthetic stylization, sonic minimalism, and a map design of terribly well-studied game continue to exert a charm into which trap any player is inevitably led to fall. Perhaps very few will be able to prefer a two-dimensional title, with a ridiculous resolution and extreme aesthetic dryness, to a modern and technologically advanced episode like Zelda: Twilight Princess. Yet, in an era in which two-dimensional RPGs suffer from narrative hypertrophy and plots, aesthetics and situations that are in most cases cloying, saccharine and stereotyped, Zelda for the NES continues to offer itself as an elementary, fairy-tale challenge. Simple, but perfect. The Legend of Zelda for NES, now available in the Wii Virtual Console catalog, is undoubtedly the prototype of the real-time Role Playing Game and a fundamental step in the evolution of the RPG family. Zelda for the NES is also the title that inaugurates one of the most acclaimed video game series in history, both by critics and by the public, and a game of records that has remained in the collective memory of gamers. All of this can now be rediscovered on Wii, exactly twenty years later and in exchange for 500 Wii Points.", "date": "2007-02-27", "grade": null}
