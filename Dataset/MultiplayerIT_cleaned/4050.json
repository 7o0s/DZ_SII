{"name": "Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Realm War", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-realm-war-recensione.html", "text": "Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Realm War clearly demonstrates the passion that the Pixel Toys guys have for the universe created by Games Workshop, after the excellent work done with Warhammer 40,000: Freeblade. The game is set in this case in the scenario of Age of Sigmar, one of the most recent productions of the English publisher, and starts from the mechanisms of the blockbuster Clash Royale to deliver us a strategic experience of great depth, focused on competitive online multiplayer in real time . Exactly as in the Supercell title, in fact, our task will be to manage a deck made up of units of various kinds, enhance them by collecting new cards (included in the ~comets~, prize boxes obtainable with each victory or for a fee, which they are unlocked after a certain amount of time) and then face opponents of a similar level to ours, obtaining the experience points necessary to access new maps. At the moment there are six of them and they naturally take up the Age of Sigmar settings, but the differences are limited to the aesthetics: all the locations are characterized by a main lane and a secondary, or higher, lane which must be traveled with three different heroes in order to get a special card to spend during the match. While taking some liberties in ~mixing~ warriors belonging to different factions, the game performs its task admirably, involving us in intense and spectacular battles. Gameplay and strategies The strategic facets of the formula adopted by Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Realm War appear evident right from the start, bringing the clash to a higher level on a tactical level compared to the much more immediate Clash Royale. The mana indicator recharges as the seconds go by, just like in the Supercell production, providing us with the energy necessary to recall the various units and accelerating towards the end of the match, thus making the action more frenetic and allowing eventual comebacks moved by fury and desperation. The games last three minutes and we will be asked to make clear decisions: will we choose to proceed head-on, concentrating the troops for a direct attack, or will we try to conquer the secondary lane, but leaving our tower and the commander unguarded? Fortunately, an uphill start does not necessarily affect the outcome of the battle, just as an even obvious initial advantage does not necessarily translate into a victory. This is one of the valuable elements of the title developed by Pixel Toys, but not the only one. From a technical point of view, an excellent job has been done in rendering the characters, each with different animations and special moves (the heroes, at least) that add further depth to the gameplay. The scenarios are also very beautiful and an AR mode is available that allows you to project them onto your desk, creating a sort of replica of the original boardgame: an appreciable option also and above all for organizing exciting local multiplayer matches by connecting two compatible devices . The controls and the interface interpret the needs of the experience well, allowing us to zoom in if necessary and to place our pawns on the playing area with precision and speed. Finally, the aspects related to the freemium nature of the product make progression slower, but do not limit the experience in any way: there are no indicators of the energy of action, it is possible to play for as long as you want and the he only downside is waiting for the comets to be released.", "date": "2018-09-25", "grade": "8.2"}
