Developed by Moldy Toof Studios under the protective wing of Team17, the game put us in the role of a prisoner, busy planning an escape route from his prison. Among its strengths we found the presence of fairly deep gameplay mechanics, which guaranteed the player almost total freedom to implement his own escape plan: as told in our review, The Escapists was thus able to please thanks also to a pixelated and cute graphic style, despite there being some pretty glaring design flaws. As we are aware of the characteristics of The Escapists, we don't hide that we raised an eyebrow a little when hearing about the agreement for the creation of a new title in this ~series~, dedicated to the universe of The Walking Dead: if you want to know how the zombies were able to replace the guards of the original game, you just have to read on. Do you want to escape from the usual zombies? The Escapists: The Walking Dead is here for you! Haven't we met before? The Escapists: The Walking Dead draws heavily on the comic book license, primarily retracing its narrative structure. The series of prison buildings that housed us in the original game has in fact been set aside, to bring those in front of the screen to some of the places that readers of the comic - but also viewers of the television series - will have no trouble recognizing: the farm of Hershel Greene, the Jail, Woodbury and Alexandria. A total of four levels, plus the one that serves as a (short) introduction and tutorial: in this case we find ourselves in the hospital where the protagonist, Rick Grimes, wakes up at the beginning of the whole story, after being hit by a bullet before zombie apocalypse. From here, for the rest of The Escapists: The Walking Dead, we will find ourselves playing the deputy sheriff, busy as always with managing the affairs of the group of survivors who accompany him: also in this case, fans of the series will find several well-known names, including Glenn, Michonne, Tyreese, Maggie and more. As we said, the first real level is the country house where the group ends up following the shotgun fired by Otis at Carl: if you know The Walking Dead you will surely know what we are talking about, while otherwise it will be normal not to understand a happens neither in this review, nor in the game. While telling the story of comics with some interludes between one ~prison~ and another, The Escapists: The Walking Dead in fact makes no secret of assuming the passion for comics created by Robert Kirkman, without which it seems rather difficult a product like this may be of interest. Xbox One goals The Escapists: The Walking Dead has 19 objectives in total. Some of them concern, as expected, the completion of the various levels, to which are added other similar achievements obtained, however, in particular conditions. Other objectives are then related to the crafting system and interaction with zombies, encouraging exploration as in the case of the prize for collecting all twelve comic books hidden within the places where we find ourselves moving our Pixelated Rick Grimes. Daily routine The need to bring The Escapists closer to the story of The Walking Dead also changes the ultimate goal of the settings in which we find ourselves, making them more similar to objectives rather than a simple escape. Keeping with the example of the farm, the crucial point will be to provide the other members of the group with a weapon with which to face the zombies present in the famous Hershel's barn, behind which lies the road to reach the camper and move to another place . In its skeleton, however, The Escapists: The Walking Dead continues to resemble the original game, re-proposing the formula of the daily routine composed of cycles starting from the morning roll call and ending with the general retreat to bed, passing through the three meals, the working hours and free time management. There are cases in which the dynamics of the original game manage to adapt well to the new setting, but in general they are a bit forced in a world where there are no warders to supervise us and dictate what to do. In this case, we are the boss, and therefore there will be no one to punish or frisk us if we engage in suspicious activity during the lunch hour. However, missing a roll call or not carrying out the task of the day will lead to an increase in a kind of threat index zombie, expressed as a percentage: the larger the latter becomes, the greater the probability of finding one or more zombies on this side of the barricades, ready to feast on the brains of our survivors. Speaking of returning dynamics, we also find in The Escapists: The Walking Dead the crafting system present in the original game, with its strengths and weaknesses: with the objects found around it is in fact possible to create almost anything, but the game continues to be wrong in assuming that whoever is holding the joypad is a kind of MacGyver, without providing him with a number of ~recipes~ sufficient to exploit its vast potential properly. The training system remains more or less similar, which allows our Rick to increase parameters such as intelligence, strength and speed, while in the combat mode there is an inexplicable removal of the block on his target, which makes the fights with the zombies quite a traumatic experience, even without being bitten. When the enemies manage to sink their canines into our flesh, there is still no game over: we will find the protagonist in bed after a few hours, with a penalty represented by the zombie index increased by a certain amount. From a graphic point of view, The Escapists: The Walking Dead resumes verbatim what was seen in the game released at the beginning of 2015. The various characters of the comic are therefore proposed to us in an unprecedented pixelated guise, which however turns out to be a double weapon cut: in some cases they are quite anonymous even for those who already know them, apart from some more evident details such as Rick's sheriff's hat or Michonne's hair. The zombies are obviously subject to the same type of make-up: in terms of movement, however, we would have expected to see them more active towards living people, thus giving the player a slightly more pressing feeling of anxiety. Also for this reason, the willingness of the developers to maintain an all in all light atmosphere with respect to the subject matter is evident, but in this way we end up losing the sensation of having the breath (or teeth) of zombies on the neck, typical of the universe of The Walking Dead. The soundtrack is not particularly remembered, while compared to the basic version of The Escapists, the lyrics are all already translated into Italian.", "date": "2015-10-13", "grade": "6.5"}
