{"name": "Dredge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dredge-recensione.html", "text": "Over the course of its production, celebrated horror writer H.P. Lovecraft looked over and over to the marine world and its unfathomable, unknown, deeply alien depths. In the early 1900s, the discoveries of fish, sharks and other inhabitants of the abyss with bizarre shapes, completely different from those present on the surface, intensified; the idea was established that incomprehensible forces were hidden under the seas, made protagonists, among others, of the story The shadow over Innsmouth (1936).With Dredge, it is as if the developers of Black Salt Games - a New Zealand team composed of four people, here at his debut work - wanted to reverse the perspective of Lovecraft who, while looking at the mysteries of the sea, remained anchored on land with his protagonist visiting Innsmouth. On the contrary, in Dredge you are always at sea, except for the moments in which you converse with the traders, the mayors of the various villages of the archipelago or with the enigmatic figures that we will meet during our fishing trips. As you may have already guessed from these first lines of the Dredge review, this game is not a simple ocean fishing simulator: it is much, much more, and in the mesh of its net it hides fascinating narrative cues and a plot capable of keeping the l attention of the player over the approximately ten hours needed to get to the end credits. A new beginning A shady collector will push the fisherman protagonist of Dredge to explore the archipelago in search of some lost objects ~Dredge~, in English, means ~dredging~, that is digging on the sea bed to recover wrecks or other objects which, in some cases, perhaps it would be better to leave undisturbed, buried where they are. However, the title of the video game developed by Black Salt Games hides a brilliant play on words: the sound of the word ~dredge~ recalls that of the term ~dread~, which means ~terror~. It is the dominant emotion in the heart of the fisherman who arrives in the village of Midolla Maggiore after a disastrous shipwreck, and welcomed by the Mayor finds himself having to pay off the debt for the purchase of a new boat. Too bad it is immediately evident that the sea is not what it seems: the magnificent colors of the day are replaced by the shadows of the night, often populated by a mysterious purple fog, apparitions and sea monsters that threaten the safety of our barchetta.In fact, the inhabitants of Medolla Maggiore immediately recommend us to return to the mainland no later than sunset, before dark. Except that the most sought-after fish on the market appear, coincidentally, right at night, not to mention that human curiosity knows no bounds - this is known - and those distant lights that appear in the west when the moon is high in the sky are an irresistible stimulus to investigate. We soon learn that the fisherman previously active in the archipelago has met a mysterious end: messages in bottles can be found in the sea that will allow us to shed light on the story, narrated in a non-linear and in-depth manner also thanks to the meeting, throughout our travels, with bizarre cultists, surly ex-whalers and wandering merchants making up an interesting and well-matched cast. In this sense, the design of the merchant who repairs and improves our boat in Medulla major is emblematic: a woman with a grim gaze, marked by the wind from the sea, her muscles highlighted under her overalls, outlined with almost angry brushstrokes that have, on several occasions, reminded us of the style adopted by ZA/UM in its Disco Elysium. Throughout Dredge's run, its narrative flows like a karst river, only guiding the player so far. A collector in search of lost trinkets will give us some suggestions to push us into the various corners of the archipelago, all brilliantly characterized and differentiated: ranging from the dangerous Stormy Cliffs, always about to collapse and crossed by a majestic marine being, up to the Star Basin , a magnificent atoll that hides a cumbersome secret in its center, passing through the very hot waters of Spina del Diavolo, marked by massive volcanic activity that takes place underwater. There are also several secondary missions, of varying depth, but all well written and capable of keeping the player's attention and interest high, pushing him to do what matters most in Dredge: explore, trying to keep the horrors that they hide in the endless nights of the archipelago. A great fundamental freedom remains, namely that of wandering and fishing at will, without the pressure of deadlines or an impending end. After all, the nostro job is that of the fisherman. Fishing for aberrations The cast of Dredge is diverse and each character has personality to spare, even if only on a visual level The sinister appeal of Dredge's story doesn't mean that the gameplay has been overshadowed by Black Salt Games. The publisher Team 17 saw us long: the New Zealand team was able to carry on, with coherence and attention also to the technical part of the game, based on a simple but effective basic idea. Traveling the ocean on our boat, we will notice some sketches that indicate the fishing areas: this sighting is nothing more than the beginning of a gameplay loop which, with a simple minigame to catch fish, sharks and much more, will lead us to an endless series of outings at sea, under the leitmotif ~another day of fishing and then I'll stop...~. We must also pay attention to managing the space on the boat: as in a game of Tetris, we will have to arrange the caught in good order, organizing it as efficiently as possible, and sell it in good time to the nearest market. The fresher the fish, the more the fishmonger will pay us... Unless he has ~particular~ tastes, of course. Time management, in Dredge, is a fundamental aspect: the minutes pass only when we move the boat, fish or drag objects from the seabed and we must bear in mind that the species of fish available vary not only according to the area of the archipelago but also with the timetable. This is why, although nights at sea are full of horrors and dangers, the call of the ocean will be very strong even in these moments. Black Salt Games has paid attention to creating a great variety of situations in which we will be able to run into in the open sea, as well as a series of skills that we will be able to acquire to be able to ward off the unmentionable beings that populate the dark waters. It is essential to maintain control of the fisherman's panic indicator, represented by an eye that opens at night and that shakes more and more as the purple fog throws its horrors upon us: in order not to go crazy, we will have to stay close to a source of light or rest in the nearest settlement to regain strength. We don't want to tell you more: just know that the nocturnal mysteries of Dredge surprise and keep you on your toes even after many hours from the beginning of the adventure. Star Basin atoll hides a very cumbersome mystery: exploration is central to solving the puzzles of Dredge Knowledge is everything to a fisherman. So here is a very useful encyclopedia that collects the over one hundred and twenty species of marine creatures that populate the archipelago, all brilliantly designed and described with clear and intriguing texts. By the way, applause to the excellent Italian translation of Dredge, one of the most accurate we've seen in a video game for a long time now, capable of fully enhancing both the dialogues of the curious characters we'll have to deal with, both descriptions of fish and marine abominations that we will collect on our journey. Yes, because alongside real animals - sharks, cod, limulus, even the elusive Coelacanth - the virtual ocean of Black Salt Games is also crossed by aberrations caused by a mysterious force, central to all of Dredge's narrative. As long as the boat goes... Fishing in the mangroves requires dexterity and attention, also because the branches have the habit of growing suddenly... The real protagonist of the game is one and only one: our boat. Initially small and slow - in the first hours of the game, just getting out of the bay of Medolla Maggiore seems like an epic undertaking - she will become a bombastic queen of the seas by investing money and resources for her improvement in the dry docks that we will find in the various settlements of the archipelago. The materials (pieces of metal, wood, fabrics) can be raided from the numerous wrecks crashed into the islets or dredged up from the seabed; to develop new types of lights, pots, nets and fishing rods we will have to find research components that will allow us to deepen our knowledge in the field. The development of the boat and the increase in the space available in the hold are essential as we continue in the exploration of the archipelago, capable of offering increasingly difficult challenges to our fisherman, who will have to demonstrate that he has strong nerves and a steady hand at the helm, especially when the sea gets rough and is populated by creatures that seem to come directly from the worst nightmares born from the mind of the Providence writer. Dredge puts players in very intriguing situations and pushes them to continue searching for marine animals (and abominations) even after the end credits, toplacing the restart of play immediately before the final phase. Impeccable from a technical point of view in our test, Dredge is also embellished with a sound sector of the highest level: piano, strings and winds come together to accompany the player with painful and melancholic notes during the day and increase panic in the most agitated phases of night navigation, when those purple eyes won't stop looking at us, and the diurnal cry of seagulls is replaced by the sounds emitted by presences of a very different type.", "date": "2023-03-23", "grade": "9.0"}
