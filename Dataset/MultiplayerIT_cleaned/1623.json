{"name": "Final Fantasy Origins", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/final-fantasy-origins.html", "text": "Final Fantasy I Final Fantasy I was created by Nobuo Sakaguchi and Hiromichi Tanaka in the wake of the popularity of the first two Dragon Quests, in a last-ditch climate for Squaresoft, which plunged into a deep economic crisis. Its success was crucial, as its hallmarks would become the paradigms of the genre, from linearity to relatively short dungeons. The class system, which initially allows us to choose between six classes (Fighter, White Mage, Black Mage, Red Mage, Thief, Black Belt), offers a remarkable level of customization for the time, also because the skills must be purchased and assigned freely, albeit with some limitations regarding the type of Wizard. It is even possible at some point in the game to switch classes. The other very important innovation obviously concerns the combat system, no longer seen in subjective, but framed laterally. In a short time any Rpg, apart from the traditional Dragon Quest, would have adopted this method, while it is still early to be able to talk about a noteworthy plot and characterization of the protagonists, which would later make Final Fantasy a product based above all on narrative . To remedy the original difficulty of the title (especially as regards the scarcity of gold and experience points released by defeated enemies) Square has decided to implement two difficulty levels in this edition. Unfortunately unsuccessful attempt, since the Easy mode is too easy and still does not remedy the very high encounter rate, making FF1 really irritating despite its simplicity. Other changes concerned the text, extended compared to the original edition, including the tutorial, and the interface, which now resembles 16-bit Final Fantasy. The graphics could have been treated better, being an almost perfect copy of the Wonderswan counterpart, even if its two-dimensional simplicity can be said to be fascinating in today's panorama. Just as Uematsu's compositions have lost very little, remixed by himself in this edition, which sound sincere and majestic as the first time. Final Fantasy II Released about a year later, Final Fantasy II is a sequel in the most classic tradition of the series, completely distorting the dictates of the first episode. Its characteristics were so innovative for the time that they were later further expanded to create Sa-Ga, but its influence is also perceptible in the latest Square productions, for example with regard to the absence of experience levels. The evolution of the party is therefore entrusted to the Ability Points, achieved through the continuous use of weapons and magic, as well as the amount of damage received in battle, which will allow us to respectively increase the power of the attack and the number of Hit Points at our disposal. Although it looks interesting on paper, the system proves rather slow and frustrating, despite several attempts to rebalance compared to the original version. Instead, it is the plot that stands out in Final Fantasy II, where we witness for the first time the composition of one of the most recurring themes of the saga, the epic of a group of rebels against the empire, in dramatic atmospheres dominated by mass murders and sentimental tragedies. No less remarkable is the characterization of the protagonists, one of the first ever attempts to create credible personalities in a video game. As in FF1, several changes have been made to the dialogues, now less cryptic, recreated the interface, inserted the tutorials and a gallery with the splendid illustrations by Yoshitaka Amano. Technically, the excellent soundtrack should be noted, still capable of offering moments of rare intensity in the versions arranged by Tsuyoshi Sekito. Finally, some little trivia: Final Fantasy II is the first chapter of the series with Cid, the Chocobos, Ultima and the Leviathan. Comment Final Fantasy Origins is a collection intended almost exclusively for fans of the saga. In fact, despite the various changes made to try to renew the two episodes, the experience still proves to be dated and frustrating, technically showing all its WonderSwan conversion limits. The absence of real extras apart from the image gallery aggravates the situation even more, relegating FF Origins to little more than a historical documentary, in which the common user, if he manages to overlook obvious gameplay flaws, will be able to witness the dawn of role-playing, accompanied by the timeless melodies of Uematsu. Pros: Two classics deRPG Several notable changes Excellent music Cons: Inevitably dated technique Frustrating by today's standards Before starting, a little ~extra~ for all of you. If you are interested in some fantastic wallpapers of the title in question, we have collected them in a special article that can be reached at this address Squaresoft's typically retrogaming initiatives in Europe seem to have no end. After bringing the trio of Final Fantasy masterpieces to Snes with Anthology and Final Fantasy 6 released on its own, this time it's up to a collection of the first two chapters of the saga, previously released for Wonderswan, under the title of Final Fantasy Origins, sadly leaving out what is probably the best RPG for NES together with Dragon Quest 3, Final Fantasy III.", "date": "2003-06-16", "grade": null}
