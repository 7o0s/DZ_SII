{"name": "Football Manager Handheld 2009 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/football-manager-handheld-2009-recensione.html", "text": "Born and raised on PC, the genre of football management has enjoyed representation on consoles for several years. In the specific case of Football Manager Handheld, it is a PSP reduction of the more famous Football Manager, a historical title developed by Sports Interactive for SEGA which has dominated the genre on personal computers for years now and continues undaunted to improve with each update. The developers' goal was clearly to create a portable version of their product, giving anyone the opportunity to enjoy an experience as similar as possible to the ~real~ one, but with all the advantages of portability. The results obtained so far are not comparable to the PC version of the game, which seems unattainable. This 2009 edition, however, sees the introduction of some innovations that at least reduce the gap. The 2009 edition of the game allows us to compete in four different leagues at the same time. Coaches by vocation The first thing to do, once Football Manager Handheld 2009 has started, is to set the basic parameters so that they meet our needs: choose the language, the current currency to display for signings, possibly activate autosave (there is a only slot available, watch out), select the preferred skin and the functionality of the analog pad. These last two possibilities are introduced in the series for the first time, and are part of the improvements made to the interface, which in this way can become more easily readable and more easily interactable. It must be said, however, that the analog pad does not perform the function of a mouse, but is only useful for ~jumping~ from one end of a selection field to the other: we are not dealing with a system that it revolutionizes or makes our way of playing more intuitive, therefore. Once we go to the game configuration menu, however, we will be faced with a further novelty: the 2009 edition of the game allows us to compete in four different leagues at the same time, as happens in the PC version, and the the list of available leagues is really extensive: Austria, Belgium, England, France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Portugal, Scotland and Spain, each also represented in the lower categories (in the case of Italy, we have series A, B and C) , while the official licenses of the UEFA Cup and the Champions League (present with an alternative name) are missing. Once the identity of our alter-ego, his nationality and the trained team (or teams) have been determined, we will be able to dive into the reality of the league and cups, depending on the seasonal objectives and the possibilities of the club we have chosen to manage. As usual, the difficult part won't be getting hired by a prestigious company, but rather avoiding the exemption in case of less than encouraging results. The harsh law of goal As in any episode of Football Manager, we will have to face the championship commitments starting from the July period, i.e. with a little time available to dedicate ourselves to the market and to identifying the ideal squad as regards starters, reserves and second team ( another novelty, this, which was missing in the previous editions of the Handheld version). We will be able to check the physical and psychological state of each player, thus verifying his degree of preparation and the extent of his enthusiasm, which obviously will sink if we have to include him in the list of ~transferable~. The interface has remained unchanged compared to last year, and works through a series of buttons located on the left side of the screen, with the L and R back keys that are used to scroll backwards or forwards through the ~pages~ the Start key to move on to the next day. As mentioned above, unfortunately the analog pad does not reproduce a mouse pointer and its use is rather limited, therefore the navigation of some menus is still cumbersome: from this point of view, the situation could have been improved. Those who have already tried the series on PSP know well that this portable reduction lacks all the more marginal aspects of the PC version, i.e. you have to focus on the fundamental things (the team, the strategy, the training, the game, the market) rather than on the surrounding elements (relations with the press and with the president, plant management, etc.), therefore the action will be relatively quick and with few frills. The butterfly form Form and training management is crucial to achieve successes in the field, as in any managerial. In the case of FMH2009, putting one player in the place of another is not a very fast operation due to the ~sliding~ interface, while it is certainly easier to changethe module. The latter can be modified by personalizing the individual positions, which however cannot be chosen freely and are based on a ~grid~ that is always symmetrical. The system automatically updates the position of the players according to the line-up on the pitch, a position which together with the other data can be used to order the display (which is particularly useful during the trading phases). Once we have finished working on the team, training included, we will finally move on to the game being played. The simulation of the match has finally been introduced, even if nothing spectacular should be expected: the purely textual phases, which tell the actions, are interspersed with a 2D representation with the players in the form of dots. However, it is enough to get an idea of what is happening on the pitch, since we will have the possibility to make corrections at any time to rectify an unfavorable situation. Unfortunately, simple changes very often do not solve anything, and sending the team onto the pitch without evaluating things carefully before the game can result in an announced failure. Technical realization As mentioned above, the graphical interface of the game has not changed compared to the last edition, apart from the presence of two different skins. The menus are always legible and navigation is quite simple, even if everything becomes rather cumbersome when the lists to scroll through are long, with the analog pad not meeting us as we would have liked. The 2D simulation has great value in terms of strategy, as it shows us visually what happens on the pitch, but it has been done in a very simplistic way. Who knows how long it will take to have even a limited 3D simulation on PSP? Moving on to the really important things for a product of this kind, it must be said that the behavior of the players on the pitch is always plausible and realistic, with a good degree of adaptability of individual players to roles that may not be theirs, as well as a good response to our directives. Unfortunately, the plague of injuries is still too frequent, so we find ourselves facing a large part of the championship without key elements of the training, even if only because of training that is a bit too intense. Finally, the loading of the various screens is not very fast and clearly needed to be optimized, while there is no background music, which is a bit sad. Comment There's no doubt that Football Manager Handheld is getting better every year, and that in the portable arena it's the best football manager available. Although the differences compared to the PC version are many and quite marked (this year the 3D simulation of the match was also included), the developers have tried to do everything possible to remove the ~superfluous~ and package a product that meets certain requirements , giving enthusiasts a pleasant, exciting and rich experience. The innovations introduced compared to last year do not revolutionize the games, but they still represent a substantial step forward: the 2D simulation, however simple, allows us to monitor the behavior of our players in a much better way than a mere text report. while the possibility of participating in four championships at the same time makes the action more ~dense~ and challenging. If you are attracted by the idea of a managerial game full of depth but at the same time ~lighter~ than usual and above all portable, Football Manager Handheld 2009 is certainly the title you are looking for. Pros Rich in thickness Numerous and updated samples Simple interface... Cons ...but you could have done better Maybe a little easy Sound practically absent", "date": "2008-12-01", "grade": null}
