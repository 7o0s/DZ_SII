{"name": "Supreme Ruler 2010 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/supreme-ruler-2010-recensione.html", "text": "Men or generals? After a quick installation and double clicking on the game icon, it will immediately become clear how much - as expected after all - the graphic (and sound) aspect of Supreme Ruler even struggles to reach the minimum wage. In short, if Civilization 4 is already a masterpiece of modern art in comparison, during the early stages of the game you will find yourself regretting the graphic settings of Europa Universalis or Hearts of Iron. But the aspiring new Napoleons of 2000 will certainly not be discouraged by this purely aesthetic puerile aspect and will be able to appreciate the fact that the scenarios are reproduced on the basis of precise satellite maps kindly offered by the American space agency. In addition to the almost perfect holographic reproduction of the territory (which can be zoomed more or less at will, in full Google Maps style), after a few hours of play you will notice the precision with which they are positioned on the game map with the maximum possible adherence to reality , also all the resources, the urban agglomerations and the various industrial districts. In a nutshell this means that playing the Italian scenario, for example, there will be towns of even 10/15 thousand inhabitants such as Sarzana, Busto Arsizio and Bussolengo... Unfortunately, again from a purely aesthetic point of view, the fusion between the game board and various game elements such as cities, military units, structures and so on give life to an even less attractive result than expected, giving a very unsuccessful sense of fake. Once we have put aside what little Sgarbi is in us, the time will come to put into practice everything that the 150 plus pages of the manual have tried to teach us. Here, among dozens of boxes, hundreds of numbers, thousands of emails and events to deal with, just a few minutes will be enough to understand how much we are men or how much we are corporals, indeed, generals. Sorry. In this regard, it will be absolutely mandatory to try your hand at the tutorial missions, which in their verbosity manage to introduce us to the complex game dynamics in the best way. Power and control Power is nothing without control and from this point of view the Russian developers of BattleGoat provide us with a series of virtual advisors who, thanks to the excellent implementation of Artificial Intelligence scripts, manage to fulfill their duty very well and help us in manage the situation better. There is a minister for each area of the game, the economic one, the war minister, the foreign minister, the head of the cabinet and so on. For each position we will always have a wide range of candidates, each with their own level of preparation and political orientation which will ensure that, during the game, we may find ourselves having to try to agree - at least virtually - our very personal cabinet. Based on the inclinations of the player, it will therefore be possible to decide to devote himself mainly to only a certain area of play by operating as a supervisor over the others, rather than behaving as a real centralizing despot and taking total control of the situation... almost certainly sending him into ruin his own happy state. The presence of these ministers, in fact, is much more fundamental than one might think because each area of interest in the game has been reproduced and simulated with a manic level of detail to say the least and being able to navigate each of them firsthand it means thinking about and pondering dozens and dozens of variables, each as important and decisive as the others. In short, be prepared to stay up late and arrive late for work... Generally, success in each game session will be established by the fine balance that exists between objectives, military strength, economic funds and political popularity. In words it seems easy, in reality it is not. Because even apparently very simple operations, such as building a factory or enlisting a new division of mechanized vehicles, have a more or less decisive effect on the other aspects of the game. Equal attention, fortunately, has also been placed in the creation of Artificial Intelligence, which manages the behavior of the states we will have to face against. Both on the tactical and military front and on the diplomatic one, the computer always seems to react in a plausible and efficient way, thus making up for the poor implementation of the multiplayer mode which, on balance, seemed to us a sop developed only to add an extra feature on the box. After all, given the rhythms of the game, Supreme Ruler can only give its best in single player mode. The game can be played both in turn-based and in real time, almost inutile say that the turn-based mode seems to have been put in at a later time making the choice of real time practically mandatory, which appeared to us to be the most enjoyable. The game interface, entirely controlled via mouse with the occasional help of some hot-keys, helps the player to extricate himself between the open windows and to look for that infantry platoon sent to reconnoitre the Apuan Alps. Final comment Giving a vote to Supreme Ruler 2010 is really very difficult, above all because it is difficult to consider it a video game and therefore to judge it according to the usual rules and standards. For this reason, the title gets a very dignified political 6 with the awareness that, for all ~hard-core~ fans of wargames and strategy titles in general, Supereme Ruler 2010 represents a real rare gem. Must have absolutely. For all the others, perhaps it is better to look elsewhere, perhaps in titles with a less profound and detailed vocation on the simulation front but, certainly, more enjoyable from a purely playful point of view such as the Paradox titles (the Europa Universalis series above all). Pros Excellent AI scripts For enthusiasts, longevity assured It's a simulator with manic detail, not a game Cons It's a simulator with manic detail, not a game Only for enthusiasts, not suitable for newbies Technically poor The beginning of the next decade isn't that far away, but reading the assumptions that gave birth to Supreme Ruler 2010, one would almost hope it would never arrive. Imagine a world scenario where the major world powers as we know them today no longer exist, where they are reduced to a heterogeneous set of small military and economic regions. The surviving political entities must fight each other to protect themselves from the aggressions of their neighbors and to maintain control over their territories and, perhaps, aim for world domination. Not even the UN will exist anymore, in the void left by its disappearance an organization with squalidly commercial and very little noble purposes will enter - known as ~The World Market~ - which tries to get everyone to agree only in the name of the mere economic gain. In short, in this sort of new Middle Ages in a pro-futuristic sauce, the programmers of BattleGoat Studios offer us one of the deepest and most complex strategic titles that we have ever played in recent years since Balance of Power and The Operation: Art of War. A real simulator of geopolitical, military and social dynamics that will make all large-scale strategy enthusiasts drown in a sea of numbers, statistics, events and choices to make. All the others, we are sorry to say right now, will just drown by closing the game after a couple of tries with the game tutorial and yet another pill taken to make the headache go away.", "date": "2006-10-20", "grade": null}
