Mickey Mouse is also called for help, and so he prepares to team up with his former rival in a new adventure designed for cooperative multiplayer: Disney Epic Mickey 2: The Adventure of Mickey and Oswald. We know well how it went with the home console versions of the game, received in a less than enthusiastic way by the critics and rightly so, given that the second episode of the series created by Warren Spector seemed to have lost its original appeal in conjunction with the transition to cross-platform format. Not even the sales rewarded the choices made by Junction Point, and so the team closed its doors and left the conversion of this action adventure for PlayStation Vita in the hands of Blitz Games, which arrives in stores at a decidedly affordable price. Problem cartoons One of the peculiarities of Disney Epic Mickey 2: The Adventure of Mickey and Oswald, as mentioned above, lies in its cooperative setting, with two characters always on the screen who often have to use their special abilities to solve environmental puzzles or simply to open a door. Mickey Mouse has the famous brush with paint on one side and solvent on the other: the former allows the Disney star to ~color~ parts of the scenery, making them visible and tangible, while the other does exactly the opposite and therefore allows us to eliminate any obstacles in our path. Oswald's power is instead linked to a strange remote control that emits electromagnetic waves, such as to stimulate the operation of electrical devices or even light the fuses of fireworks. The Junction Point series was born on the Wii and the transition to other platforms has been quite traumatic, given the nature of the game and the use of the Wiimote to indicate on the screen where we want to use the brush. On the other consoles this type of mechanic is missing and with it a generous portion of gameplay, given that remedying this limitation using the analog sticks is absolutely not the same thing, and even less so on PlayStation Vita, whose two short sticks so far have not given great evidence in the management of the view and any ~sights~. Surely the developers are also to blame, who have not optimized this function and have instead thought of calling into question the touch screen, with even less brilliant results: touching the screen while playing to use the brush is really uncomfortable and some special powers , such as the ability to lift objects off the ground, have been rendered really badly. The PlayStation Vita version of Disney Epic Mickey 2 doesn't convince PSVita trophies The forty-seven Trophies of Disney Epic Mickey 2: The Adventure of Mickey and Oswald can be obtained by completing a certain number of actions (defeat fifty enemies, reprogram fifty enemies), by completing levels but above all by carrying out particular operations such as awakening a spirit, complete all quests and collect all pins. What a pain! The beauty of fishing from the Disney universe is that you can hardly go wrong, in the sense that a few famous characters, some familiar settings are enough and the atmosphere is guaranteed. Warren Spector and his people wanted to do more, implementing in this new title also the traditional songs of the films of the Mickey Mouse house, often interpreted by the Mad Scientist himself. In the review of the home console version, our Giorgio Melani spoke of a quality Italian dubbing, but the digital copy that was provided to us for PlayStation Vita is completely in English and we would not like it to have been omitted for this latest edition localization altogether. In any case, the problem of Disney Epic Mickey 2: The Adventure of Mickey and Oswald is certainly not the language, which already in its original form had not convinced due to the lack of a precise direction, and which on the Sony laptop does even more struggles due to obvious glitches affecting the frame rate. In some moments it even seems to proceed in slow motion, the thing is so marked! Luckily, the excellent quality of the music takes a hit, but the problems remain and it's hard not to notice them.", "date": "2013-07-05", "grade": "5.8"}
