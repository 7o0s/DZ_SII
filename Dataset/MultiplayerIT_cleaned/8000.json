Some questions were easy to answer, but for others there is, to date, no apparent understandable logic. The second case undoubtedly includes a question that every player grappling with the large number of post-apocalyptic setting titles has certainly asked himself at least once: but with desperation and all the worrying things to think about in such a dramatic context, how could the meager human community left alive on earth think of organizing races and racing championships? The developers of Cracking Sands have evidently overlooked the problem, leaving us players with all the philosophical digressions of the case. In return, they pledged to give us a much appreciated pastime, which is to run everywhere, fully armed and to the death. Chaos and Karts Cracking Sands therefore features an unfortunate parallel world, hit by a war without borders, which has left the inhabitants in a sort of pre-civilization condition. No more residential districts or penthouses, no technology or designer clothes, but only tribes commanded by brute force, whose rank is determined not by wealth or birthright but, and it could not be otherwise, by who is better at driving . Running, shooting and winning, without any rules: this is in a nutshell the approach required to face the challenges proposed in the long game campaign. The obvious objective is in fact to go on to the bitter end by winning as much as possible, to unlock all the features of the game not initially available in sequence. Features that, in the light of the facts, are certainly not few, starting with the 5 classic race modes (Race, Time Trial, Elimination, Campaign and Multiplayer, of which only Time Trial and Campaign can be selected at the beginning) and the sixth, unprecedented , called Head of the Pack. It is essentially a race in which you have to hold the first position for a pre-established period of time, during which the personal energy is canceled and that of the pursuers is strengthened. If successful, a point is awarded, at the end of the race the driver with the most points wins. But the most interesting part is certainly linked to the extreme customizations that can be achieved both on pilots and on weapons and vehicles, thanks to the credits accumulated with victories. The clothing itself does not influence the behavior in the race, but the upgrades of vehicles and artillery (choose between machine guns, different types of rockets, energy-sucking cannons and the powerful EMP or electromagnetic pulse) can make a difference. To facilitate the purchase of ever more powerful karts, it is possible to invest small sums of real money but, given the not excessively demanding level of the title, it will be enough to repeat a few races to accumulate enough money for any eventuality. The game interface is easy and intuitive, with the jump and nitro controls always fixed on the screen or disappearing (perhaps the first choice is more comfortable) and the change of direction entrusted to the intuitive accelerometers or to the more classic right-left arrows. Cracking Sands, obviously declined in a purely arcade sauce, winks, as regards the game view and camera management, to another title born from the same skilled hands, Reckless Getaway. In that case, a narrow view and a low horizon helped create a bit of suspense in the chases, with a more than appreciable final result. This time, however, we have to deal with ~tracks~, to use a euphemism, absolutely irregular, full of obstacles and sudden changes of direction, certainly not the highways of a metropolis; a wider viewing angle would certainly have helped, especially in the more elaborate routes. On the other hand, there is nothing to complain from a technical point of view: the work done by Polarbit is really valid, perfectly optimized on each compatible terminal, with only a few very small uncertainties in the presence of all the vehicles engaged in simultaneous explosions. Finally, it is a pity that I could not fully test the multiplayer, due to the momentarily empty servers.", "date": "2013-02-15", "grade": "8.0"}
