{"name": "Rumble Roses XX", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rumble-roses-xx.html", "text": "The control method essential to winning early matches is extremely simple. Basic attacks are done with X, grappling with Y, and B is the multifunction key depending on the context, like stepping into the corner of the ring, picking up an object/weapon, or trying to pin the opponent for 3 seconds needed to win. After a while of encounters it will be necessary to use other controls in order to defeat the cpu, in addition to the A key, which allows you to run and carry out attacks on the move, it will be necessary to learn to parry and use special attacks. The right back button allows you to parry blows, or if used in combination with Y or X and the right timing it is used to carry out a counter-move with standard grips or blows. Special moves, on the other hand, are of two types, namely killer and lethal moves. Possible only in certain game situations, and different from character to character, if implemented, they allow you to inflict extensive damage on your opponent. Far more characteristic are the moves to humiliate the enemy, where the wrestlers perform in grips or combinations of attacks designed to bring the opponent to extreme positions, with the relative shot of the camera that highlights some details..... aspects.... some girls A little limbo never hurts.. The game menu is not the best part of RRXX: implemented as a map, it does not offer an intuitive view of the various selectable matches, nor of the variables that distinguish one match from another, except by entering a second menu before -game, with relative loading time both in entry and exit from the menu itself. There are three combat modes to advance in the career, and they include combat in the desert, on a skyscraper or in the arena. To these types of clashes, in which it is necessary to be able to knock down the opponent or opponents on duty for 3 seconds, there are also modes with different rules, such as matches based on the humiliation of the enemy through the execution of particular moves , those on the beach which as a reward allow the opponent to do a penance and the actual street fighting, in which you don't have to pin the opponent for 3 seconds, but with the sole objective of resetting the energy bar , and is won in the best of 2 rounds, in the best tradition of old-fashioned fighting games. One of these modalities is the very identification of the spirit of RRXX, the matches of the queen, or those in which one fights to make the loser perform a series of penances. These types of matches include the most diverse types of endings in matches. Some of these are to be unlocked, but even with the basic options you can make atypical ballets, play limbo with the bar ever lower, force sexy poses or even make the defeated girl wear particular clothes. Unfortunately, no particular plot or logical thread is followed in choosing matches, and this factor too could contribute to confusing the player without offering explicit references on what he must do in order to become the tournament champion. Compared to the first chapter that appeared on Ps2 and Xbox, tag team fights were also included in RRXX, with relative super moves to be performed in combination, and clashes with various types of handicaps. All-round gameplay? Coming to the game, it must be said that the first impact is not the happiest. The control system and the first two or three matches don't make RRXX one of the most memorable titles ever played. On the other hand, as you progress the challenges against the CPU become more interesting and varied, you have to necessarily develop your own fighting style more and more, using both the different special moves and focusing on the best features of the chosen character. This last aspect is well implemented within RRXX, the more you fight in a certain way the more the character specializes in that specific type of technique, and consequently the player is given the opportunity to modify some physical-technical parameters of the fighters . A negative side that is felt during fights is a kind of ~binary~ effect, which is most noticeable when trying to carry out a running attack. In these cases it often happens to miss the opponent without her doing dodges or movements of any kind, just because you are on a slightly different horizontal level. A detail not to be underestimated is the effective longevity of the title, considering the amount of time necessary to unlock even just the first costumes or reach the first objectives on the live, it is not risky to assume over 50 hours of play to be able to have everything available. Technical and Online The graphics alternate a few highs, like realization of the polygonal models and some lighting effects, and some bass too much, such as the paucity of the arenas, the simplistic audience and the effects used or more generally a graphics engine that absolutely does not exploit the potential of Xbox 360. In the end, the real merit notes are the fluidity of the title and the complete absence of aliasing. The animations of the characters are well implemented and typical problems of fighting games, such as clipping or interpenetration of the polygons during grappling are really minimized. In this sector the programmers have done a good job, in particular for submission holds or complex combos, the movements and reactions of the bodies are decidedly successful. The sound is rather anonymous, with very little speech identifiable in a few sentences spoken by the girls, and some audio tracks that fit well into the introduction of some characters. Obviously there is also the possibility of a photo mode, which in RRXX definitely has a lot to say. The photo mode sessions include some poses or sequences of poses that can be reproduced from the CPU, obviously the most interesting of these have to be unlocked, while the user can move the camera-lens, its zoom and activate other options to customize the photo. Photos saved via photo mode can obviously be shared with other users via Xbox live. Apart from the photo mode, the options available for the game on Xbox live are very few, however, and it's a shame, because the clashes with real players are much more balanced and fun than those against the CPU. Furthermore, the implementation via Xbox Live is of a good standard, during our tests we encountered very few episodes of lag or poor connections Comment As the first Wrestiling title, and debut on Xbox 360 by Konami, it was reasonable to expect something more. RRXX is certainly a step forward compared to the first chapter, with improvements in practically all sectors, including game mechanics. Furthermore, RRXX undoubtedly has noteworthy aspects, such as the implementation of physical parameters in the female wrestlers and their influence on the move set and technical characteristics of the characters, with the further advantage of the discreet support for Xbox Live. The negative sides, however, are not invisible, and in the first place they are identified in a gameplay that will hardly be able to capture the attention of the players right from the start. Unfortunately, the development team still has work to do to transform Rumble Roses into a first-rate title, but for fans of fighting games or wrestling games with a lot of objects to unlock, and possibly with a strong female component, the Konami game proves to be a solution worth considering. Pros Character models Customization of features Photo modes and various clothes Cons Graphics not up to par Game mechanics that can be improved Absence of a common logical thread Konami brings an atypical wrestling title to the next generation Microsoft console. Forget the various Hogan, Undertaker and John Cena, in the rings you will only find attractive girls (s)dressed in such a way as not to look bad in a strip tease club, and this is not necessarily a negative side... There are over 20 characters available in total, obviously all female, and with their own fighting style, which ranges from a multitude of possible combinations. We will find characters linked to submission holds, rather than more or less powerful and fast single blows, or something in between without specializations or significant weaknesses. In the game you can also create your own girl and develop her various attributes, as well as change her physical appearance and clothes, to your liking. A separate note of merit goes to the characterization of the various existing characters, and relative introductions to the encounters in the arena, and of the usable clothes that probably have no comparison in the videogame world, but in this case for a description it is better to leave room for the images and video.", "date": "2006-06-12", "grade": null}
