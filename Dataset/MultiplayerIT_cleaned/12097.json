{"name": "Superbike World Championship (SBK 07) - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/superbike-world-championship-sbk-07-recensione.html", "text": "Small changes Once you get on the track and the race has started, the gameplay turns out to be interesting, albeit with some flaws: on the one hand, it is appreciable to note the enormous amount of work done by the programmers in fairly faithfully recreating the behavior of the various bikes on the track. The vehicles move like their respective real counterparts and therefore the simulation effect is successful. On the other hand though, perhaps also due to the PSP ~controller~ which lacks the analog sticks of the PS2 Pad, very important in the Monolith version of this game, and an impact system for which any contact with opponents or objects, even low speeds, causes the bike and rider to fall, the experience proves to be annoying at times, at least for those who are not hardcore gamers of the genre. And it is of little use to choose an arcade approach rather than a simulation one through the activation of the various ~driving assistants~: effective in other aspects of the game, in that of the physics that manages physical contacts it does not seem to work well. It was perhaps too ~amplified~. Mind you, however, this aspect could be partially ignored, or at least we could turn a blind eye. Especially if you look at the product with a general eye. But what are the small changes we mentioned at the beginning compared to the PS2 version? First of all, the number of tracks has been significantly reduced in number, from eleven to ten. Then the multiplayer, which abandons the ~Split Screen~ formula for two players in favor of the more appropriate, given the system, wirelessly for four competitors equipped with PSP and relative copy of the game. Some changes have also been made to the graphics engine. What is inevitable. However, the Milestone graphics did an excellent job as they limited themselves to eliminating or readjusting some effects during races in the wet and some reflections of light on the bodywork of the engines, keeping the quality of the structure of the vehicles and circuits almost unchanged. All without affecting the framerate and fluid animations admired in the PS2 version. The audio is the same. Comment SBK 2007 for PSP is a decent conversion of the Playstation 2 version. With all the merits and defects of the case. Overall challenging, deep and simulative, the Milestone title makes realism and longevity its strong points, managing, at least on the Sony laptop, to compete on an equal footing and at times surpass its MotoGP rival. Pros: Good simulation level. Graphics and sound ok. Well-tuned opponent AI. Cons: Slow uploads. Impact physics too sensitive. For many motorcycle simulator enthusiasts, the all-Italian Milestone development team is in some ways the equivalent of the Polyphony for four-wheel lovers (with all the necessary distinctions, of course). The group of developers headed by Antonio Farina is in fact the author of the excellent Superbikes 2001, considered by many PC gamers to be the most beautiful motorcycle simulator ever programmed. It is therefore needless to add that this SBK-07 was eagerly awaited by fanatics of the genre, especially after the discreet Superbikes Riding Challenge seen last year on the Monolith. So, after the PS2 version released just a few days ago in stores, now it's the turn of the PSP port to show itself to our eyes. These, we anticipate it already, is really in all respects a conversion, as it is faithful to the original counterpart, except for some small technical modifications which we will discuss later. Therefore, the game modes are the same and it is therefore possible, after selecting in the main menu, to try a ~Corsa Veloce~, in a practice session, in the ~Time Attack~, etc, up to the ~World Championship~, by naturally selecting our stable and driver from a royal shortlist. Clearly the most interesting ~fashion~ is the latter. The game structure in this case is logically rigid, pre-established and therefore realistic. The phases of a championship weekend follow one another like in a real world championship, complete with free practice on Thursday, qualifying sessions on Friday, superpole on Saturday, and so on up to warm-up and races 1 and 2 on Sunday . In each of these phases it is possible to intervene to modify set-ups, suspensions, tyres, etc, in relation to the track to be covered and the weather conditions.", "date": "2007-07-26", "grade": null}
