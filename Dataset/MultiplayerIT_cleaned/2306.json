In the Acclaim title you drive a nice eighteen wheels to choose from among five available, each with its own peculiarities in the field of acceleration, speed and robustness. The aim of the game changes depending on the mission to be completed. Now you will have to cross the finish line first, while afterwards you will have to do a textbook parking; but it's always about driving a truck Forget the very high speeds that can be reached in GT3 and similar stuff because in 18 Wheeler the vehicles are heavier than the racing cars featured in the aforementioned masterpiece. At the limit, you can ~throw~ at 130-140 Kmh. In short, what do you expect from such massive vehicles? With a Rally Impreza you can't literally break through the structures that stand in your way. Well! Instead, with the means offered by the title in question, situations of this type are the order of the day. The playability is like a bar, with all the advantages and disadvantages that this entails: we have just the keys to accelerate, brake, change gears (low and high), change the view, and play the ~trombone~. Controlling the vehicle is child's play even under the most difficult conditions (such as hairpin bends, etc.). In the first mode available, the Arcade, you will have to face a multitude of missions to be solved successfully in order to complete the entire coastal route of the USA-East. It must be emphasized that, during each race, there is an enemy truck driver who wants to put us ~out of the game~ at all costs. This will do everything to cross the finish line before us, even at the cost of smashing towns and other poor cars on the road. It is also important to add that it is necessary to hit some half-bonuses during the race to recover precious seconds. These are essential due to the presence of the classic checkpoints to be reached within a set time limit. Another way to gain seconds is to increase the speed of the ~beast~ controlled by destroying the innocent vehicles that cross their path. Physics mysteries In Parking mode, on the other hand, the missions to be completed always refer to car parks in which the precision and skill of the player in controlling the vehicle is measured. Other modes are Score Attack, in which it is possible to race against time (but who doesn't do it every day?) and Versus, thanks to which you can ~trample~ the unfortunate friend on duty via split screen. The duration of the game is rather limited, being able to complete the game in about a day. The Parking Mode is a novelty compared to the coin-operated counterpart but it cannot stand the competition on its own. The truck you've always dreamed of. The technical aspect of the game stands on mediocre quality levels. The programmers have not added even a frame or a polygon in the porting phase on 128 bit Sony, and this disappoints us a lot. The polygonal models, while nice, have an outdated and simplistic structure. The 18-wheelers are characterized in a ~disinterested~ way, resulting in being pleasant but also very lacking in effects. To aggravate the situation, then, a not exactly high resolution and a certain poverty in the settings are added. Something looks nice, like objects that are destroyed by trucks or some well colored textures (I'm referring to those applied on trucks), but nothing more. What about the 30 frames? Are we the ones spoiled by the quality of titles available these days and bump-mapping? I do not believe. Maybe it's the programmers who should have been more concerned about offering something more innovative to the gaming community. The audio sector of the game is discreetly made, with beautiful music and sound effects that are well suited to the Yankee atmosphere of the product. The various ~soundbites~ offered by the drivers of the vehicles are very nice, each with its particular repertoire of more or less offensive jokes ... In conclusion, this 18 Wheeler American Pro Trucker is a fun but limited title, which does not put all its defects in the graphics (which is still acceptable), but above all in the structure of the game too arcade and simplistic. Finishing the entire game in such a short amount of time isn't the greatest challenge. Only lovers of Sega coin-ups could consider buying this product. For those, however, who are looking for a more simulative impact, I would recommend other titles on the market. Guess what. Pros: Fun initially. If you've always dreamed of driving a truck like this Cons: Arcade to the bone. Little challenge. Technically orobsolete. Arcade perfect Let's make one thing clear right away: 18 Wheeler is the perfect conversion of the homonymous coin up that also made a stop on the ancient Dreamcast. Superfluous review, then? Almost. In fact, something has been added, but not in the technical department but in that of longevity. Will a few more ways be able to make the now ~spoiled~ public rejoice?
