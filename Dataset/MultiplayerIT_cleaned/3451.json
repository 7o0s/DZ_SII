On the other hand, the Ghostbusters are a real media icon still firmly in the hearts of their fans, who after thirty years hope to be able to see them again on the big screen next summer. In the meantime, those who own a console or a computer could while away the wait with what remains one of the best tie-ins ever dedicated to them, namely Ghostbusters: The Video Game. Edited by Saber Interactive for the PlayStation, 4, Xbox One, PC and Nintendo Switch editions, the title is being re-proposed these days in a remastered edition which, let's say it right away, left us somewhat perplexed. Who will you call? Ghostbusters: The Video Game Remastered first offers only the single-player campaign, reserving the right to integrate competitive and cooperative multiplayer at a later time. Based on a story written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, rather faithful to what the third cinematic chapter should have been a few years ago, the game is proposed as a true narrative sequel to the two films directed by Ivan Reitman. And it does it from every point of view, starting with the staging of the events, then from the direction and from the plot, which offers several references to the film saga complete with historical jokes and some cameos. The player plays the role of a new recruit of the team with a plot that develops around an emanation of ghostly energy somehow connected to the Sumerian god Gozer, the one faced in the finale of the first film of the series. Ray, Egon, Peter, Winston and the newcomer immediately begin to investigate, but to block their way they will find dozens of angry ghosts and old acquaintances. In terms of gameplay, for those who don't know it, the title offers the classic third-person action game structure, but with exclusive mechanics due to the weapons used and the objectives of the adventure, perfectly capable of make the mood of the films and replicate the daily routine of the Ghostbusters. The crux of the experience is in fact the hunt for ghosts, to be approached by paying particular attention to the traces that they leave together with other clues scattered within fairly linear but extremely fascinating settings to explore. Once the prey has been identified, it must then be weakened as much as possible before giving it the coup de grace by imprisoning it. To do this, you need to use the supplied proton rifle, connected to the backpack of the same name containing a portable proton accelerator that can be upgraded with additional functions, which forms an energy screen capable of immobilizing ghosts, dragging them and placing them over a trap inside which they will inexorably get sucked in. This mechanic is made decidedly fun and faithful to the original concept of the films, thanks also to precise and fairly reactive controls: seeing your opponent fluttering almost randomly, crossing objects and possessing them, and then facing and capturing them is really satisfying. And it becomes more so when the enemies become more difficult without actually a ~natural~ progression (the level of difficulty in this sense fluctuates, thanks to an artificial intelligence that is not always up to the situation) and you need to know how to exploit in combination a number of equipment and gadgets. Among these there are some useful to replace the basic proton flow with freezing energy beams, photon machine guns and with the infamous slime seen in the second film. The developers' attempt to recreate a cinematic experience as much as possible can also be seen in the choice to eliminate any vital energy indicator, relegating a series of LEDs and lights on the proton backpack to this function: health status and weapon recharge in fact, they appear directly on the character. We are ready to believe you! So far the positive aspects of a fairly valid experience between ups and downs. But a remastered is such also and above all for the technical sector. And here the real flaws come out: Saber Interactive has done very little to adapt the game to the new consoles and the most modern PC hardware, limiting itself to increasing the resolution without changing the textures of the original and the framerate, even if this did not solve some of those problems already present in 2009: the general action is therefore noticeably more dynamic, but we still recorded some slowdownsyou in some situations. More than a remastered game it almost looks like a port: even the movies have kept their original aspect and resolution. In general, the graphics engine is the same: it behaved well at the time and still behaves fairly well today, allowing the game to stand up visually thanks to the stage presence of now iconic characters and settings. From this point of view it is evident how the collaboration of part of the original team, which lent appearance and voices to the story, has benefited the work, and continues to do so: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson are recreated very well, obviously with the graphic style of the game, as well as symbolic places such as the Sedgwick Hotel or the inevitable headquarters. Even during the clashes, between a riot of explosions, pieces of wall and tables that crumble while the opponents move convulsively in an attempt to escape, the game manages to convey the suggestions of the films well. Unfortunately, other sore points also come from the audio sector: if on the one hand we have the splendid original soundtrack of the films, as well as the interpretation of Murray, Aykroyd and associates, nothing short of grandiose in giving voice to themselves in a digital version, on the other Italian dubbing is missing. In our opinion, an absence that was heavy as well as inexplicable, given that it was present in the 2009 edition and that the voices of the late Sergio Di Giulio or Mario Cordova, just to name two, contributed to giving a greater sense of involvement and identification to the players Italians.", "date": "2019-10-07", "grade": "6.5"}
