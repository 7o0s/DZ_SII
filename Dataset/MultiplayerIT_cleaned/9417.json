Halo is now a Microsoft matter and apparently the situation will remain this way for some time. But for now the Reach chapter appears to be in very good hands with a large and passionate development team spending a lot of time balancing and polishing the multiplayer that is now arguably the heart of the experience. But 343 Industries, which has made use of the collaboration of Certain Affinity, has also been busy from a technical point of view and these three new maps seem even more beautiful and detailed than those of the Noble Pack. Condemned - 6 to 12 players Doomed is a 12-player map set in a falling space station. Like Anchor 9 it offers both large rooms and areas for short-range combat, but unlike the Noble Pack map it has some glimpses that cross a large part of the map and give snipers different possibilities to hit from a distance. Undoubtedly suitable for team slayer, this map offers various satisfactions even in objective modes thanks to the rooms almost always built on two levels which make it decidedly difficult to take refuge in defense. In some areas Condemned offers the possibility of moving quickly by hopping from platform to platform and the culmination of the platforming component of this map is undoubtedly the zero-G environment in the center of the map. The distant platforms and lack of gravity complicate movement, and the large area allows marksmen to slaughter anyone who moves carelessly. Furthermore, the platform in the center of the area, which is the top of a reactor, hides another danger or a lethal laser to be avoided at all costs which, however, we were not able to start (unfortunately, it seems it has been removed in the final but hopefully it will be brought back in the future if it's just a matter of balance). From an aesthetic point of view, metallic materials and environments closely resemble the other maps set in space. But Condemned is undoubtedly richer than its companions with numerous monitors, a detailed holographic map of the station, mechanisms and platforms to no end. Also visible outside the station is an epic space battle being fought in the atmosphere of the planet Reach which literally goes up in flames. Highland - For 8 to 16 players Highland is set on a Spartan training station and is arguably the most complex map in the Defiant Map Pack. This is the largest map in this package that still manages to handle both 8 and 16 players without problems thanks to the variety of areas that include a large open space, dotted with pillars and covers, and various structures among which a semi-destroyed Pelican aircraft stands out. At the two ends of the map there are obviously the two bases, fundamental for modes such as capture the flag, which can also be reached by opponents through the multiple tunnels dug into the rock. However, it is possible to cross the map unnoticed also passing through the center thanks to the numerous buildings that characterize the central area and which, unlike the tunnels, allow you to escape any ambushes. One of the most particular structures that we find in Highland is a long tunnel that develops at the base of the central structure and allows you to move very quickly with vehicles. In short, we are in a very varied and particularly fun map to play in modes such as capture the flag, given that rescuing a fleeing enemy is a real challenge. But the pleasure of playing in this map also derives, and in large part, from the undeniable aesthetic appeal. In fact, the imposing central structure, the waterfalls, the river that crosses the flat part of the map and the huge alien spaceship that sets the horizon on fire with its weapons make Highland one of the most impressive and evocative maps of the entire Halo universe : reach. Unearthed - Shootout - For 1 to 4 players Like the previous map pack, the Defiant Map Pack offers one map in space and one set along the side of a mountain. But the third map this time is not of the type Invasion unlike what happened with the Noble Pack. Unearthed is in fact a large refinery dedicated to the Shooting mode. This is probably the most complex map of its type with scaffolding, hangars and lots of roads to get from one part of the area to another. One of Unearthed's main features is the missile-launching Wartogh which is highly effective against the Covenant hordes and allows a close-knit pair to grindpoints and spectacular kills. For those who play single-player, however, a comfortable ghost is available but it is undeniable that the cooperative experience, obviously thanks to the group mechanics but also to the aforementioned Warthog, is much more satisfying. From an aesthetic point of view, the background of Uncovered is decidedly more static than the previous two maps, but given the number of enemies and the complexity of the structure, there is nothing to complain about. In short, all the spectacle that is missing in the background is compensated by the richness of the action. Password: variety The work done by 343 Industries on this Defiant Map Pack is undoubtedly of excellent quality. From a technical point of view, the new maps do not even regret the single player of Halo: Reach with detailed structures and breathtaking views. The backgrounds are designed with the declared aim of integrating the apocalyptic visions of the fall of Reach within the multiplayer and the goal has undoubtedly been achieved. Obviously the definition is lower given the need to maintain high fluidity even with many players, but the overall result is excellent. Even in terms of variety, the three maps are unassailable and offer situations of all kinds, glimpses for snipers, corridors for close combat and maps made up of profoundly different environments both in terms of aesthetics and mechanics. On the other hand, the greatness of the Halo maps is precisely that of being able to offer radically different experiences, but always balanced, depending on the mode. And even the Shootout maps, among which Unearthed stands out for its complexity, require a large amount of work since in practical terms they are cooperative missions adapted to competitive multiplayer and must be balanced and varied in order to always keep the replayability rate at a maximum.", "date": "2011-03-14", "grade": "8.5"}
