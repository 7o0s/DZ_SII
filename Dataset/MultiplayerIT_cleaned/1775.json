{"name": "Racing Evoluzione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/racing-evoluzione-3.html", "text": "Story of an Italian miracle An important event, which can be considered the console debut of the most important and well-known Italian development team, deserves to be celebrated by retracing the steps that allowed Milestone to enter the Olympus of video games. Milestone was born in 1996 from the ashes of Graffiti and immediately achieved success thanks to the highly appreciated Screamer series for personal computers. Subsequently, the successful collaboration with EA Sports led to the beautiful Superbike 2001, an accurate simulation of the spectacular world of large displacement sports bikes, still considered the best exponent of the genre. In the summer of 2000, having completed the development of Superbike, Antonio Farina decided to revolutionize corporate policy by opening the doors to development on the new consoles, which have by now become the gaming platforms par excellence. At the time, the only new generation console on the market was Sony's PS2 which, not yet arrived on western markets, was struggling to establish itself in Japan due to the fluctuating quality of its titles. For this reason, and for the familiarity acquired over many years of PC programming, Milestone bet everything on the Xbox, which has an indisputable kinship with computers. Thus the idea of Racing Evoluzione was born, even before the release of the Xbox and even before the effective validity of the technical specifications of the Microsoft console could be verified. For about 2 years, the development of Racing Evoluzione continued in the strictest secrecy and only in the last few weeks has the gaming community become aware of the promising qualities of the new racing coming to Microsoft's black box. With the game just days away from hitting stores, the time has come to find out if those promises have been kept. Dreaming of the Prancing Horse... If it weren't clear yet, Racing Evoluzione is a driving game with an undoubtedly arcade soul. Any, and perhaps even expected comparisons with Gran Turismo, therefore end here, as there are no elements that can suggest any similarity between the two titles. That said, don't expect to find a Burnout clone, as the driving model is certainly arcadey, but still capable of engaging even the most demanding players. The main game modes are Dream Mode and Arcade Mode, which in turn is divided into Quick Race, Time Attack and One on One. The most interesting aspect of the game is certainly the Dream Mode which offers us, in a rather original way, the classic career mode. In an attempt to emulate the sporting feats and industrial success of Enzo Ferrari and the ~reds~ of Maranello, we will design and produce prototypes with which to participate in races around the globe, with the hope that the victories will lead us to start full-scale production of our models, in an attempt to satisfy the resulting market demand. As in a direct proportion, the greater the number of successes on the track, the greater the sales of the models we produce. Our adventure in the world of motoring starts from the assumption that many of the most prestigious motor manufacturers have surprisingly humble origins. After choosing the brand and the name of what at the beginning is little more than a workshop in a dusty garage, we will witness the blossoming of a company of ever greater size and importance. The transition from artisanal production to industrial production takes place gradually, through numerous stages that will see us engaged in different sectors, starting from roadsters, comparable to 2000cc cars, up to dream cars, i.e. super sports cars. The management of the company, far from being dealt with in a deeply managerial way, translates into the simple choice of car models to be produced. Starting from the roadster category, we will be able to develop about ten prototypes, each with 3 different levels of evolution, with which we will participate, sequentially, in competitions in the amateur, semi-professional and professional categories, facing real models from prestigious brands. These include Mercedes, Renault, Toyota, Lotus, Jaguar and Aston Martin, all of whom show off some of their most coveted four-wheeled jewels in the game. From time to time, between one race and another, we will be cheered by pleasant diversions. Mysterious pilots, very rich sultans or even secret agents will throw us challenges inviting us to measure the quality of our machines on the road. The prize for these battles consists in the majority of cases in increased visibility for our house and therefore in ahigher sales result. Between doors and rear-end collisions... Beyond the happy idea behind the Dream Mode, it must be said that the section could have been created with more detail, as both our effective intervention on team management and the depth of a mode that simply resolves itself in participation are very limited to attach. Nonetheless, the actual game manages to prove to be as fun and compelling as ever. As amply documented previously, the driving model is arcade, so controlling the cars is rather comfortable and a good part of the driving experience is aimed at the easy execution of the curves, maintaining the maximum speed and, above all, the design of the more accurate trajectories. The behavior of the cars, in perfect harmony with the rest of the game, is certainly far from being considered realistic and this will probably displace lovers of pure simulation, especially if they are not used to such simplicity. Fortunately, the three difficulty levels and the consequent variation of the challenge offered by the opponents will make it more difficult, even for the most experienced riders, to conquer the top step of the podium. The artificial intelligence, moreover good for the type of game, leads our opponents to give us a hard battle, between counters, collisions and sudden changes of trajectory, on the 54 courses included in the game. The latter are divided into four categories (cities, mountains, circuits and stadiums) and set in 3 continents: America, Asia and Europe. This leads Racing Evoluzione to reach a surprising degree of variety, thanks also to the undoubted diversification of the tracks and the alternation of ever-changing and in any case fascinating landscapes. Longevity is ensured not only by the number of slopes, but also by a long series of competitions, which should keep us busy for many hours. The arcade mode, on the other hand, does not include significant innovations. We find the quick race, the classic fast race, time attack, race against the clock, and the inevitable 2-player multiplayer game, developed through the usual horizontal split-screen. Note that both link support and Xbox Live compatibility have not been implemented. Class is not water If some small reservations can be moved to other aspects of the product, the technical realization appears free from criticism, at least as regards the graphics. Racing Evoluzione shows off a convincing graphics engine, capable of pushing the game up to 30 frames per second, which are certainly not 60, but which are not affected by any slowdown, thus managing to provide enviable speed and fluidity. The settings are the most detailed and realistic I've ever seen in a driving game. The bump mapping shows itself to our eyes on the asphalt, giving a realistic appearance to the roadway, while highly detailed textures cover mountains, buildings and everything that shines with wonderful light effects. Also worthy of mention are the reflection effects which dynamically reproduce all the elements of the landscape on the metal surfaces and on the windshields of the cars. The scenarios appear not static but animated by a series of objects such as colored balloons, large television screens, seagulls, helicopters, airplanes and even cruise ships. The same level of detail can also be found in the modeling of cars, rich in over 10,000 polygons each and in deformation effects caused by collisions with fixed or moving obstacles. In addition to the carefully reproduced licensed cars, the concept cars developed in the Dream Mode are also made in the best possible way, thanks to a stylistic research that certainly does not appear casual. It should be emphasized that the approximately fifteen prototypes are not the result of the work of the Milestone designers, but the result of a European competition involving numerous design schools. At the conclusion of the competition, more than 150 models were collected, from which an international jury made up of automotive sector journalists selected the winners, who were then included in Racing Evoluzione. The exquisite visual aspect is counterbalanced by an at least disappointing sound sector. The more than discreet dubbing of the voices in Italian and the support for Dolby Digital 5.1 in fact fail to make us forget the sound effects that are not always spot on and the noises of the engines, rather gloomy and all too similar to each other. The same also applies to the music, which is not very varied and cannot be tolerated by our ears in the long run.Conclusions If you were wondering if Racing Evoluzione could represent for Xbox owners what Gran Turismo 3 has become on PlayStation 2, the answer can only be no. The differences in setting, and probably also in targeting, between the two titles are such that no comparison can be ventured. However, Racing Evoluzione is a very pleasant surprise by managing to establish a high standard of arcade game which, probably, had not yet been reached by any other title of the genre released on the Microsoft console. However, Milestone's first driving game for consoles is not without flaws, starting with a well-set main mode, but which could have offered much more both in terms of depth and variety, ending with a sound, certainly not irresistible. However, if you are not too fanatical about pure simulation, Racing Evoluzione is a title to have, one of those that cannot be missing in your collection, constituting the best that our console now has to offer in the field of arcade driving games. Pros: Milestone strikes again Top-level graphics 54 tracks and about 80 real and concept cars Longevity ensured by a good number of competitions Easy to learn control system Cons: Underused Dream Mode It's arcade and may not appeal to everyone Sound not up to par with the rest The road that leads to the perfect driving simulation on the console seems quite long and full of obstacles, in most cases insurmountable. If many developers have been trying for some years to replicate a realistic driving model or at least comparable to what is achieved in Gran Turismo, what a simulation it is but up to a certain point, others have chosen to pursue alternative objectives, probably more accessible, but no less rewarding for this in the results. After all, what is the point of recreating reality if it is boring? For example, try to imagine what expertise and how much practice is necessary to be able to drive a 400 horsepower racing car on the track. do you think it is possible to faithfully transfer the same situation to a simulation aimed not at pilots but at ordinary people, the jealous owner of station wagons or small cars? Aware of the intrinsic limitations of the current generation of video games, Antonio Farina, founder and manager of the very Italian Milestone, started from the assumption that a racing capable of making the most of Xbox was needed, creating a very realistic title, but only in terms of graphics. If then, a dazzling cosmetic is added to an immediate as well as satisfying playability, then here is the driving game that has been waiting for a long time for Xbox owners.", "date": "2003-02-05", "grade": null}
