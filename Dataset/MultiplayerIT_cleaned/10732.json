{"name": "La rabbia di Logan!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/la-rabbia-di-logan.html", "text": "Wolverine has always been recognized as one of the most charismatic and true characters in the Marvel universe. His feline strength and the ability to regenerate from any wound, combined with the bones completely covered in adamantium, a very rare and indestructible metal, have made him one of the most loved and most fascinating mutants. The Origins, paired with the film that was released at the same time, narrates the events that led him to be what he is, alternating flashbacks on his past as a member of a paramilitary corps made up of mutants and under the orders of Colonel Stryker , to sequences, always connected to each other, in the present in which the mutants are now recognized by some as a real threat, while Logan confronts Victor Creed, his brother and with the colonel himself. The game begins in Africa, in a jungle set with ancient ruins inhabited by magical creatures and also mutants, who do everything to thwart the path of Logan and his team in search of adamantium, up to the events that will lead him to undergo the operation that will transform him forever. These phases, as mentioned, alternate with those set in the ~today~ of the Marvel universe, in which the X-Men already exist, and when the Homo Superiors (this is the ~scientific~ name of the mutant genus) have taken self-awareness and the fact that dark forces are trying to eliminate them from the face of the earth, putting the Sentinels, gigantic practically indestructible robots on their heels, and who appear here in one of the most spectacular clashes in the game. Bring on the claws! Just the boss fights are one of the elements in which this Wolverine fails to scratch, given that, apart from the clashes with some of the mutants that appear in the game - the most beautiful undoubtedly the one with Gambit - the creatures that close the different stages they are essentially two, detracting a little from the pathos of the whole structure of the game and partially diminishing the satisfaction that one has in passing the levels. For its part, the combat system is full of references to what is now considered a real point of reference for the genre, or God of War. Raven, however, has done a good job of trying to insert enough distinctive elements to avoid any misconceptions about the effort put into trying to give this Wolverine his own precise identity. Killing enemies leads to accumulating experience and leveling up, acquiring new powers and skill points to improve the different characteristics of the protagonist. Furthermore, hidden in the stages, there are mutagens that can be combined up to a maximum of three at a time and which confer further bonuses until our hero transforms into a real indestructible war machine, equipped with a highly respectable animation booklet that allows you to perform combos and special moves with ease. Precisely these small elements, combined with many surprises, items to collect and references even to universes unrelated to Marvel (references to World of Warcraft and the Lost television series in particular come to mind), constitute a nice diversion for those who decide to spend some time until the epilogue of the game is reached, which is closed somewhat abruptly after about eight/nine hours, also in order not to reveal too many elements of the film's plot. Afterwards, especially fans of objectives and trophies, they can devote themselves to perfecting the character's statistics to collect further points, but with a small negative note, i.e. the impossibility of bringing the character painstakingly built through the first pass through to the next level of difficulty. the internships. Raven is not the first software house that opts for such a choice, but the problem is that, even just starting a game by setting the highest difficulty level, just to see how it is, leads to overwriting the previous save, deleting for always all the stats and experience accumulated. Xbox 360 goals Wolverine is quite generous in points and even if only completing it in the hours set for the basic difficulty level, it allows you to take home around 600 points. The others are related to finding hidden items in the levels and perfecting skills. Be careful to max out the character, before going to unlock the goal of maximum difficulty, because by doing so you will cancel the basic save, losing all previously acquired levels and skills. A lush jungle Raven used the Unreal Engine 3 to bring Wolverine, the settings and the other mutants to life, and once again the Epic engine stands out for its cleanliness and definitionand most of the textures that cover each element. Excellent realization of the effect that reproduces the progressive dismemberment of Logan, up to revealing his skeleton, and which slowly reassembles signaling the level of residual vital energy, as well as the animations of the many moves available. Several shots underline the combos and powers used, with even one-hit kills made spectacular by the shot that narrows the field to reveal the details of the limbs of the enemies flying from all sides. The levels alternate between the African stage and the ~contemporary~ ones, but lack continuity of implementation, alternating good ideas with a long series of prisons, barracks and laboratories, hardly ever pushing on the accelerator, a bit like what happens with the end-of-stage bosses. Except for the very notable exceptions of the fight against Gambit and the one against the gigantic sentinel, where the choice made by the team to eliminate the QTEs, in favor of the free pressure of the keys and the use of the analog stick, is more clearly understood. Ultimately, this choice gave good results.", "date": "2009-05-06", "grade": "7.8"}
