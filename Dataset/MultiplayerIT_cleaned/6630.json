{"name": "Enigmi nello spazio", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/143418-the-swapper-enigmi-nello-spazio.html", "text": "The Swapper was one of the best PC titles of 2013, but also one of the most interesting puzzle games of recent years. The critical and public success has thus prompted the original development team, namely Facepalm Games, to collaborate with Curve Studios to bring its creature to the three Sony platforms as well. The result of this work, at least on PlayStation 4, the version we used for our review, is excellent and the main difference with the computer edition, we'll say it right away, is mainly linked to the introduction of the PlayStation trophies and the control, which has obviously been reworked for the DualShock 4 from the original keyboard and mouse combination. Also from this point of view a good job has been done, and the controls respond well. Furthermore, for the more demanding, the possibility of modifying the sensitivity of the analog sticks has been implemented to seek a perfect balance between speed and fluidity in the controls. The PlayStation version of The Swapper, which is now available for free within the Instant Game Collection throughout the month of January, i.e. the selection of titles that subscribers who own PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita have the opportunity to download free of charge every month, then provides the functions of Cross-Save between the three consoles. Puzzles and tension await users in The Swapper, the sci-fi puzzle game from Facepalm Games Playstation 4 trophies The Swapper offers 10 trophies, divided into 4 bronze, 5 silver and 1 gold. To get them, just progress in the game by satisfying requests such as, for example, activating a certain number of consoles, recovering a particular object or solving the various puzzles scattered throughout the adventure. Clones in space For the rest, the title re-proposes the atmospheres and puzzle game mechanics with 2D platform elements of the original, around which it dictates its narrative themes focused on philosophical questions related to existence. Everything is built with very simple means, above all textual, however capable of involving the user more and more as the story unfolds, piece by piece, up to a very nice ending, in our opinion, of which we will not tell you anything so as not to spoil the experience. It all begins on the Theseus orbiting station, from which a rescue module carrying an unnamed astronaut on board departs towards the world of Chori V. Starting from the icy excavation sites that wind along the belly of the planet itself, and then continuing returning to the starting point, namely the space station, the gamer finds himself catapulted into an adventure where discovering the mysterious disappearance of the entire human population in the area is only the initial input of something deeper. The exploration of the game areas proceeds linearly and without having to continually retrace your steps, except if you have not completed an area and want to do so. But you never have new powers to use and, at most, you can solve the puzzles left behind by exploiting the knowledge gained. Yet the title still manages to instill a certain tension in the player and to motivate him sufficiently to explore every corner of the game world to collect all the little information useful for getting to the bottom of the mystery surrounding the story. And this thanks to a unique atmosphere and the aforementioned narrative component, which is well implemented around a gameplay whose beating heart consists of two well-defined tools available to the protagonist: a wrist cloner and the so-called Swapper which gives the title to the game. The first is a device that is used to create clones of the character, up to a maximum of four at a time, using the left backbones on the pad. These can then be used to solve the most diverse situations, such as solving an environmental puzzle, pressing a simple button positioned in an unreachable point on the screen to open a door and so on. But since the copies can only be generated within the protagonist's field of vision, and therefore not behind obstacles, and that they only act by repeating the movements of the original (if he walks in one direction or jumps, the copies do the same, and so away), so often you have to rack your brains to find solutions that are useful for solving problems. The breath of the soul Initially, in fact, the puzzles to be overcome are simple, but as the adventure continues they become more and more complex, forcing the gamer to use all four clones simultaneously and very rationally. In case of positioning error of the pown copy, this can be reabsorbed by simply touching it, otherwise just leave it behind, perhaps stuck somewhere, moving on to the next screens to make it die and start again. The other key gameplay tool of the Facepalm Games title (but in some ways also of the plot, given the moral implications and connections to the story) is the aforementioned Swapper, which allows you to move the soul of the protagonist from one body to another. In extreme cases, especially of danger, it is in fact possible to move the vital essence of the main character inside the casing of one of his clones, with all the philosophical implications of the case that accompany the choice of the gamer. At a certain point we find ourselves wondering if the indiscriminate use of these clones, treated as simple soulless ~objects~ is right, or if instead we are underestimating the phenomenon, committing morally barbaric acts. Like the narrative elements, a big contribution to the gamer's sense of identification in the world of The Swapper is given by the graphics, which, despite all the necessary distinctions, manage to perfectly restore to the eye environments full of atmosphere and beautiful to look at. and the sound compartment. In fact, every single scenario is able to visually communicate, at a resolution of 1080p, a certain unease and oppression, thanks also to the contribution provided by the skilful arrangement of the light sources; sensations also heightened by the excellent combination of music and sound effects, always on the subject and worthy of an Alien film production: the sensation, while exploring the narrow tunnels of Chori V or of the station, is that of an agonizing solitude, desolation, with wind blowing between the rocks, the sinister noises of technologies that are no longer in use, and so on. On the other hand, the animations of the protagonist of the game are less beautiful, which while not damaging the experience, are still rigid and unnatural.", "date": "2015-01-14", "grade": "9.0"}
