Year 2001: Extreme G and Wipeout are now on the same platform, ready for a practically inevitable confrontation. While Wipeout Fusion peeps out in Europe in November, XG3 Extreme G Racing is already among us. Will the third chapter of the Acclaim franchise or the fourth episode of the saga (excluding the special edition for Playstation, the 64-bit version and the Saturn and PC conversions) of Wipeout win? Game structure Being a high-tech racing game, it is not very difficult to illustrate the game structure, decidedly predictable, but it is not important (for once) to finish first in the standings, but to devastate one's enemies with more or less orthodox weapons such as a machine gun ( standard) or homing missiles (to be purchased in the shop) to earn some pennies. These, once obtained in adequate quantities, can be spent in the virtual shop on duty to improve your war performance or to buy ever faster engines. The championship mode features 4 leagues, each of these is made up of 3 distinct circuits, for a total of 12 tracks. At the beginning of the game you will have to choose one of the two drivers available from the teams present, for a total, therefore, of 12 different drivers grouped into 6 rival teams. As you unlock the tracks in the championship mode, you can easily replay them with the Arcade mode while using the Time Trial you can have many precious extra coins, since your sponsors want you to entertain your fans properly Game structure Once on the track we will have to pay attention to our 11 enemies and the conformation of the track: if the former can degrade our energy bar by hitting us with missiles and machine guns, constantly crashing into the side barriers will certainly not give us relief. Luckily, Nintendo's F-Zero has made school and along the levels there will be areas that, passing over them, will recharge your shields and your nitro reserve. The topographies of the tracks are decidedly well studied, certainly a lot of space has been given to the moments in which with the nitro, used all in succession and not in sprays, absurd speeds are reached, the highest ever seen in a video game. Add to that twisting climbs or caves where you almost feel like you're in Sega's Sonic loop-the-loops and the picture of a thrilling and spectacular game will materialize in your mind. Unfortunately something had to go wrong and it's really difficult, in some sections of the race, to be able to ride correctly, both because the movements of the bike are fairly nervous, and because despite the presence of the side brakes (Wipeout docet!), it's really difficult to avoid constantly crashing into the edges of the track, especially if you have already exceeded 500 km per hour. A just decent split screen surrounds a fairly fun game but which at times frustrates the player considerably, especially if he is forced to redo the usual 3 tracks in a row of the last league reached to have enough credit to unlock the next one. Graphics and sound Extreme G Racing, waiting to try Wipeout Fusion by hand, is the fastest video game in existence at the moment, whatever the platform; the fluidity of 50 fps is absolutely constant, without the slightest hint of slowdown. A result obtained with a number of polygons for the backdrops and for the bikes that is certainly not very high, although it is certainly above the average of the videogame genre concerned. To compensate for the presence of hateful jaggies, Acclaim has decided to insert a thin patina of motion blur as Squaresoft has already done for its Driving Emotion Type S and The Bouncer. The slightly psychedelic effect has a certain effect but what certainly leaves you stunned is the already mentioned hair-raising speed of the game. Speaking of the special effects, the sun is really blinding thanks to a skilful use of the lens flare and also the effect of the motorcycle afterburners (especially when using the turbo) is decidedly well done. Slightly subdued the realization of the snow in the third track of the first league. Graphics and sound The music of the game bears the famous brand ~Ministry Of Sound~ (the very famous English disco) and in fact they are very engaging, worthy of being included in an audio CD (which I believe will appear sooner or later in the form of original soundtrack), as long as you are a fan of house music. More than good sound effects are the right partner to the exciting musiche; add the encoding for Dolby Surround and Wipeout Fusion will also have to really show the nail, ironically, in the field that made school and that launched the fashion of ~proper~ soundtracks (obviously we are talking about the western market). Conclusions Graphically satisfying and very veeeeeelocissimo, very engaging music and a more than fair playability make this Extreme G Racing a good game, certainly the best of the trilogy. Conclusions Some negative sides, already described a few lines above, mean that whoever is writing these lines recommends saving for Wipeout Fusion (expected for November) and leaning towards the purchase of the here present third chapter of the Extreme G saga only if you can afford even the highly anticipated title of Studio Liverpool and you want to spend these scarce two months that separate you from the release of the new Wipeout with a good clone. Wipeout's first rival? When Playstation debuted in Europe in 1995, the enormous (for the times) amount of machines sold in the first days of launch was accompanied by a ton of sold copies of the first Psygnosis game (now Studio Liverpool) for the 32 bit Sony, such as Wipeout . What was so special about this game? Well, it had graphics that the Saturn (used to the early days of Virtua Fighter and Panzer Dragoon) could only dream of, it was equipped with a speed never seen for a home video game (and not) with a frame rate of 25 frames per second without various slowdowns, it had simply fantasy music thanks to compositions performed by very famous musical groups such as Chemical Brothers and Fluke and a general design that was very ~cool~ (to use the famous Anglo-Saxon term which means ~cool~). Wipeout was rightfully one of the greatest successes in videogame history and the sequels that peeked out did nothing but further improve the quality of the Studio Liverpool franchise: the graphics began to overflow with polygons, the light effects improved more and more in quality , Dj Sasha and Prodigy were also bothered for the music and the Dual Shock joypad greatly improved the playability with the analog stick and the vibration function, given that Wipeout (the progenitor above all) has always been very difficult. But what are we talking about? After all, Joypad certainly includes some very young players or players who only started playing video games after taking home a flaming Playstation 2; Wipeout is a futuristic-style racing game that presented subspecies of spaceships as vehicles to pilot to finish first on extremely tortuous tracks (who remembers the tracks in the Phantom league of Wipeout 2097?), made even more insidious by your opponents, decidedly cunning and, like you, ready to launch a guided missile or a shock wave just to blow you up. Meanwhile, the Nintendo 64, the console on which Nintendo was betting everything to make up for lost time compared to the Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation, had made its appearance in Europe in the Spring of 1997 and certainly without the help of Acclaim and its vast line up he allegedly sold around forty million cars worldwide. In addition to the Turok saga, Acclaim has breached the hearts (and wallets) of many fans with Extreme G, a clone of the aforementioned Wipeout which, however, placed the player in means similar to futuristic motorcycles, instead of the spaceships of the Studio Liverpool game . Extreme G had its following of enthusiasts and although Wipeout also landed on 64 bit Nintendo (the beautiful Wipeout 64), Extreme G 2 managed to easily keep up with the first and only 64 bit episode of the Wipeout saga.", "date": "2001-09-22", "grade": null}
