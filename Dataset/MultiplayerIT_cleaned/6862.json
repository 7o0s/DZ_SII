{"name": "Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/138358-warriors-orochi-3-ultimate-tutti-insieme-appassionatamente.html", "text": "Each narrative universe has its supreme villain, a powerful enemy determined to destroy the world, which can only be stopped by the intervention of all the characters who militate in the ranks of the ~good guys~. It also happens in the reality created by Omega Force and Tecmo Koei, that of the musou, and so in Warriors Orochi we witness the choral action of the leaders of imperial China, of the samurai of medieval Japan and even of warriors born several centuries later, such as Giovanna d'Arco from Bladestorm and ninjas Ryu Hayabusa, Momiji and Ayane from Dead or Alive. A crossover that is made possible thanks to the traditional expedient of time passages, created in this case by Kaguya, a mysterious girl with magical powers who intervenes when the powerful Hydra seems to have overwhelmed the strongest fighters in the world. Three characters - Ma Chao, Sima Zhao and Hanbei Takenaka - are transferred by Kaguya in a limbo which in the game acts as a hub to access the various missions, each set in a different historical moment. The team's goal is to ~recruit~ the best warriors ever to compose a deadly group, capable of defeating the terrible monster that threatens the world. A story that is not very original but of sure impact for fans of Tecmo Koei franchises, which we were able to appreciate two years ago on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and which is also being revived today on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on the occasion of the release of Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate. Something new... The debut of Warriors Orochi on next-gen platforms is accompanied by some novelties, in this case the introduction of two new missions (rather significant from a narrative point of view, given that they illustrate Orochi's origins and what happens after the defeat of the Hydra) and a series of extra characters that further enrich an already rather large and varied roster, made up of warriors actually different in approach and special moves. The team with which we will have to face the missions is made up of three elements, the aforementioned Ma Chao, Sima Zhao and Hanbei Takenaka, but going forward in the story we will unlock all the other fighters and we will be able to change the formation at will. It is interesting to note how it is possible to manage ~loose~ experience points to level up characters that we may have just obtained but that we would like to include in the team, so as not to create excessive imbalances or be forced to maintain the initial structure for the entire duration of the countryside. The gameplay of Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate also stands out from the other musou, in particular from the Dynasty Warriors series, for the simplified approach to weapons, given that each warrior can only wield one (thus eliminating any discussion on compatibility between tool and user), possibly enhancing it through trading, crafting and fusion mechanisms. As for the modalities, in addition to a long Story Mode, the mediocre Duel Mode is re-proposed, with one-on-one-style encounters that leave the time they find, and the demanding Gauntlet Mode, characterized by a generally more difficult level higher than the standard campaign and an emphasis on team building, which can be changed by influencing the characteristics of individual elements. In addition to the cooperative possibilities, locally or online, the game finally offers an editor that allows you to create your own missions starting from the pre-packaged stages and modifying some variables, such as the position of the officers, to then share the result with the community. Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate is one of the best exponents of a series that is now suffering the weight of time Playstation 4 trophies The over forty Trophies of Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate leverage above all on the numbers of our eliminations, but also on the execution of certain maneuvers for the first time and on the completion of the various modes present in the game. ...and something old Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate certainly does not lack substance, and the crossover concept undoubtedly represents the wet dream of many fans of the universe created by Tecmo Koei, with all its famous characters. The problem is when you've already played a lot of musou and you find yourself taking the field always referring to the usual mechanics, in this case freeing the various areas of a map from the presence of standard enemies and captains, at least making sure that the companions are not killed while you are busy running from one end of the scenario to the other, moreover without the possibility of accelerating the march that much (yes, the horse helps but up to a certain point).The action is extremely repetitive, the combos are not numerous enough to mitigate it (indeed, one proceeds by always performing the same ones, in practice) and they are alternated with the special move only to be quicker and get rid of dozens and dozens of enemies without an artificial intelligence worthy of the name. These are harsh words, we realize it, but finding yourself after years and years in front of an experience that appears immutable, which has never managed to give weight and depth to the fights (as instead the Capcom counterpart was able to do, Sengoku Basara), ignoring the size of the protagonists, can only make you turn up your nose and get annoyed. Especially since the debut on next-gen platforms is accompanied by a technical sector that is only marginally improved and far from spectacular, equipped with a 1080p resolution, higher than what was seen on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, as well as a more high number of characters present on screen at the same time, but equally subject to a marked pop-up effect of enemies, noticeable drops in frame rate and a general lack of detail and personality regarding the scenarios.", "date": "2014-10-07", "grade": "6.5"}
