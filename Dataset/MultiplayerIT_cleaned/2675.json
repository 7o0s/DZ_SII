{"name": "Carl Lewis Athletic 2000", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/carl-lewis-athletic-2000.html", "text": "The son of the wind is inside a GBC! As for the game itself, there are 3 modes: Arcade, Decathlon and Carl Lewis Challenge. Players will then be able to test their skills in all 10 athletics events: the 100m sprint, the 400m, the 1500m, the 110m hurdles, the long jump and the high jump, as well as for the most qualified, the pole vaulting, javelin throwing, shot put and discus throwing. Finally, after having collected successes in the Decathlon, the players are presented with the ultimate physical challenge, the Athletics Games mode (which includes 10 events: the Decathlon PLUS 200m, the 400m hurdles and the 100m relay). The son of the wind is inside a GBC! If all disciplines are passed then a party(!!!) will be thrown and the players will have the chance to race against Carl Lewis himself to steal his all-time athlete title and have the privilege of playing as King Carl . In practice, the Ubi Soft title is proposed as the classic geek athletics game where the winner is whoever presses the two buttons of our favorite laptop the fastest (and perfectly in sequence) (at least for now ... GB Advance we are waiting for you!!!), like Track&Field on PSX so to speak. The son of the wind is inside a GBC! The programmers have therefore not invented anything new, however proposing a title made in an excellent way and with features of considerable interest, such as the introduction of a system that allows 2 people to play on the same console in almost all the tests and a Ghost mode where you can improve your times by saving them and trading them via infrared with friends. The son of the wind is inside a GBC! PROS Excellent technical achievement A must for geeks CONS Repetitive in the long run Risk of ~breaking~ buttons due to too much enthusiasm!!! International publisher Ubi Soft and developer Planet Interactive have joined forces for the international release of Carl Lewis Athletics 2000 for the Game Boy Color. With the participation of sprinter and world record holder Carl Lewis, players will have the opportunity to show their mental abilities against the ~human splinter~. In the wake of the Australian Olympics, a title is therefore proposed that will certainly not leave track and field fans disappointed, as well as those of the ~son of the wind~! First of all, the graphic impact is remarkable, with a management of animations, colors and a fluidity that almost make us forget that we only have the little one from Nintendo in our hands.", "date": "2000-11-14", "grade": null}
