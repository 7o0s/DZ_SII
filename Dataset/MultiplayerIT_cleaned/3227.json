Maybe starting from the beginning, but in doing so we should go back to 1987 and the release of the very first Mega Man for the NES, and it doesn't seem like the case. We could jump a few years, six to be exact, and strike up a conversation with Mega Man X: after all, it was that series halfway between a sequel and a spin-off that cemented a real mythology behind action titles- Capcom platformer. Before then, Keiji Inafune and all those who had worked on the Mega Man titles had entrusted the story to synthetic, enigmatic screenshots or a few lines of text, but with the Mega Man X series a plot had begun to be built, to characterize better the various characters, making sense of the new scenario and the new era in which the games took place. Mega Man Zero was not developed by Capcom, but Inti Creates: after pestering Inafune in the hope of convincing him to entrust him with his most famous creature, the small developer had found himself facing a double challenge. Mega Man Zero was supposed to revive the 2D action-platform identity of the franchise - which over the years had become an RPG and a 3D action adventure, among other things - and it was also supposed to be its most demanding iteration. Furthermore, it should have continued the story of Mega Man X by embracing a more adult and violent angle, without renouncing the cartoonish aspect that distinguished the series. A seemingly impossible feat, made up of many, too many goals to reach: yet, anyone who played the first Mega Man Zero when it made its Game Boy Advance debut in 2002 will probably tell you that, yes, Inti Creates has it had done. Today the four Mega Man Zero for Game Boy Advance, already offered in Japan with a single compilation for Nintendo 3DS, also arrive in the West and on Switch, accompanied by Mega Man ZX and Mega Man ZX Advent, released some time later on Nintendo DS . It is an absolutely essential package for those who love the thirty-year franchise and in the next few lines we will explain why it is worth buying. From Zero to ZX Let's start with the first part of the package, in a chronological sense: Mega Man Zero. We won't be analyzing the games in the compilation, one by one, but we will give you a general idea of how this series works and how it distances itself from the more canonical Mega Man and Mega Man X. First of all, well, the the protagonist is Zero, and the title already tells you this: Mega Man also has an important role, but we don't want to anticipate anything. The story is certainly not as articulated as that of an RPG, but the future outlined by director Yoshinori Kawano and his team is dark and fascinating, even more so if you have fought so much to save the world in the various Mega Man X. The new series, in fact, begins a century later with the awakening of Zero or, better to say, a new model of the android with blonde hair. In this era, tensions between humans and synthetic Reploids are reaching the stars and so Zero, wielding his trusty lightsaber, will have to help the scientist Ciel stop none other than her historic rival X, apparently mad and determined to overthrow the order. natural on the planet. The story develops through dialogues, illustrations and short cinematics that gradually become more elaborate from episode to episode, and in this sense the gameplay also evolves, which embraces a freer structure and a plethora of RPG dynamics that Inti Creates will go reviewing and correcting at each issue. There are in fact small but substantial differences between the four Mega Man Zero which, playing them today, one after the other, and not after months or years, are perceived with greater clarity. At its core, Mega Man Zero is a Mega Man, a scrolling platformer divided into stages that each culminate in a battle with a specific boss. The enemies that await us at the end of each stage are the flagship of the production: they often have exceptional designs and complex and much less predictable attack patterns than the various bosses faced in the other Mega Man. The series is famous for its difficulty brutal that focuses everything on the reflexes and muscle memory of the players, which is why Capcom has well thought of implementing a ~beginner~ mode and / or a checkpoint system that make the titles much less frustrating. The first four Mega Man Zero then see us control the blond android and access a loadout of weapons that changes slightly from episode to episode. The Z-Buster pistol and the mythical Z-Saber are omnipresent, but Zero can also wield shields, tonfa and whips which can prove more or less effective against certain enemies or bosses. Another feature chiave, who undergoes quite a few transformations over the four episodes, are the Cyber Elves, little helpers that we will find hidden in the stages or by defeating enemies and who will guarantee us various bonuses. The Cyber Elf system changes significantly from Mega Man Zero to Mega Man Zero 4, but remains a crucial element of the gameplay and story, although the game itself discourages its use: abuse the help of the Cyber Elves, in fact, it reduces the score at the end of the stage, a score which can also determine the acquisition of new powers or special attacks and which encourages players to repeat the various levels always trying to improve. It is also interesting to note how the vaguely metroidvania structure of the first Mega Man Zero - in which the stages are interconnected to a central hub - already returns to a more traditional formula in the second episode: we will have to wait for Mega Man ZX to completely change the approach. Mega Man ZX and Mega Man ZX Advent, on the other hand, take place two hundred years after Mega Man Zero 4. We won't explain why - it would be a big spoiler on the series finale - but the protagonists change completely: in Mega Man ZX the player can choose between Vent or Aile, in Mega Man ZX Advent they are Ashe and Grey. The story is a little more intricate and involves many old and new secondary characters, also influencing the game mechanics since the protagonists can transform themselves into the defeated bosses, acquiring not only their attack skills, but also their movement skills. In fact, the interconnected stages of Mega Man Zero are back in an even more metroidvania structure in which it is the player who decides in which direction to explore the game world, using the unlocked shapes to overcome environmental obstacles or enemies susceptible to a certain element rather than a other. The two titles for Nintendo DS, in fact, used the second screen of the console as a map, an element that in this Switch version we can position by choosing from various display options. The RPG drift is interesting: the protagonists can also accept various tasks from the characters who wander around the hub and receive the related rewards when the mission is accomplished. Mega Man ZX Advent, in particular, is the more substantial title of the two, rich as it is in forms, special abilities to unlock and secrets to discover: Inti Creates had really nailed the right formula to evolve Mega Man without distorting it. Good old 2D The Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection carries the years of each title beautifully, whether it's 2002's first Mega Man Zero or 2007's Mega Man ZX Advent. The 2D graphics full of colors and details constantly reminds us how beautiful pixel art was on consoles that didn't move eight billion polygons per second, especially if you decide to play in portable mode: obviously, on the TV screen, the game grains a lot, but it is possible to choose the screen format from various options for each title in the compilation and apply a filter that softens the images or emulates the playback of older CRT televisions. You can also choose the frame illustrations and even the version of each Mega Man Zero between English and Japanese, or between English, German, French, Italian and Japanese for the two Mega Man ZX. We haven't encountered any fuzziness in the control system, input lag or other problems that sometimes undermine these compilations of old glories, but obviously the precision required in the gameplay could encourage the use of the Pro Controller rather than the Joy-Con. It is a complete package, in short, which in addition to six excellent titles also includes a gallery full of illustrations, a music player to listen or re-listen to the excellent songs of Ippo Yamada, a remastered audio sampling for the voices, a kind of achievement system and a brand new mode called Z-Chaser that will appeal to speedrun lovers. The Z-Chaser mode is in fact exactly this: having chosen the difficulty level, we will have to play a dozen stages running at breakneck speed to complete them in the shortest possible time. You can choose from several options, such as racing against the CPU or against another player, even setting up split screen to keep an eye on your opponent's progress. And of course you can upload your records to a world leaderboard to show them off on the net.", "date": "2020-02-24", "grade": "8.0"}
