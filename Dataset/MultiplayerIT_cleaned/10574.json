Wipeout HD, in addition to being able to successfully carry on a series born in 1995 and which has accompanied all the console of the Japanese giant, has also had the merit of bringing the concept of true high definition, to 1080p and 60 fps, associated with graphics of great impact. In short, a small miracle, which however remains a white fly within the modern videogame panorama. And if we can't have a game with equal graphic quality, at least give us some more Wipeout; having said that, the subtitled Fury expansion is finally available. The red fury Priced at 9.99 euros, just a little away from the 17.99 euros needed to buy Wipeout HD, Wipeout Fury is in a strange position for being a simple expansion. Fortunately, however, Fury is not a simple expansion, and for this great credit must be given to the Studio Liverpool team; instead of monetizing the passion of the fans, the programmers have on the contrary done a commendable job, which expands the original offer from every point of view so as not to make it at all distant from what, in many other cases, would have been labeled and sold as a new chapter. On the other hand, about 700 megs must contain something more than a couple of spacecrafts, and the air of novelty can already be perceived from the introductory screen and from the menus; gone are the times of light colors, white and blue, now space is left to black and red, accompanied by a very hard techno musical background. Good news for the nostalgic though, since there is a convenient switch in the options to return to the previous layout, if desired. But let's talk about the contents in detail: these are enclosed within a completely new campaign, with 80 events to face. There are 4 new tracks, even if in reality they are not unpublished but recovered from the PSP chapters; these are Modesto Heights, Talon's Junction, Tech de Ra and The Amphiseum, to which are added the reverse versions and 4 other tracks for the Zone mode. Adding up to the original ones, the result is really exciting. There are also 3 new competition modes: Eliminator, also in this case a PSP legacy, in which the aim is not to cross the finish line first but to obtain the highest score by hitting and eliminating opponents with all the weapons available. The function delegated to the L1 key is very satisfying, with which you can perform a 180  rotation to attack the spacecraft behind you. Zone Battle, on the other hand, is a variation of Zone mode, in which the goal is to reach the target area before the others with a progressive increase in speed; within this there is also a strong strategic element linked to the boost pads scattered on the tracks, and which allow you to skip areas, slow down opponents or recharge the shuttle's energy. Finally there is Detonator, or Wipeout meets a shooter; in fact, the aim is to eliminate the mines scattered on the track with the turret installed on your vehicle, and also in this case the progressive increase in speed makes things increasingly difficult. The achievement of a final score, linked to multipliers and other factors, therefore becomes the main stimulus since there are no opponents on the track. Finally, the list of contents of the expansion includes 13 variants of the original ships, new music tracks and the inevitable trophies. The aesthetic component is exceptional as always, an orgy of very fluid details shot into the player's retina and which in the Zone modes and related variants turns into a flood of psychedelia.", "date": "2009-08-12", "grade": "9.0"}
