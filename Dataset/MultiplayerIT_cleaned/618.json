{"name": "Full Auto - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/full-auto-recensione.html", "text": "Back in time The concept is simple, the execution as well. Spread across the streets of an American city, here is a series of breakneck races divided into various stages, progressively more difficult, and three absolutely imaginary car categories. The juice of Full Auto is all in the weapons that can be mounted on the vehicle bodies, essentially divided into front and rear weapons, and in the two powers available to the player. In addition to the turbo, which is recharged with drifts in corners and with jumps that can be carried out using any ledge and building, there is also the possibility of going back in time to remedy a wrong curve, a deadly off-piste, or a decisive blow delivered by an opponent. To recharge this power you need to destroy the backdrop and opponents, in a kaleidoscope of explosions and polygonal fragments everywhere. there is also the possibility of going back in time to remedy a wrong corner, a deadly off-piste Back in time At that point, and by pressing RB, the screen turns sepia and the game rewinds until the power itself runs out, giving us the opportunity to correct the shot and save the pens. The gameplay of Full Auto revolves around the right balance of using weapons to eliminate opponents and always being able to maintain a minimum level of ~Recovery~, this is the name, or Turbo in order to be able to get back on track at any time. last corner or the last assault of the opponents. Each race has three possible outcomes, given by the combination of the finish position and the number of damage done or enemies killed, for example, and for each of the placements a different medal is awarded which unlocks new modes, colors and decals for the bodies of the cars. This, in addition to the online modes, means that Full Auto has a good longevity, if you want to try your hand at achieving all the gold medals, which are certainly not few. How do you become a Full Auto driver? Full Auto is, especially until the middle of the career mode, rather forgiving. Great skills are not required to pass the rounds and access the following events. The game runs fast with third places which, with a minimum of effort, soon turn into silver and gold medals, until all the tracks and all the cars available have been unlocked. All the cars have more or less the same attitude on the road, creating an arcade feeling that doesn't require you to learn curves or trajectories of the different tracks, thanks above all to the possibility of using Recovery and Turbo, which recharges generously with each jump and drift. Spectacular and fast, Full Auto unfortunately lacks real bite, given that an average commitment is required in the use of the different skills, without ever pushing the accelerator on one of the different characteristics, with the result of being in the hands a title with an undefined personality. A sort of detachment is created between the driver and the car, a detachment that is filled only in the most agitated phases, which too rarely turn into a defeat and in having to really learn all the techniques or tricks in order to continue in the game. The result is a discreet, fun title, but which in the presence of Ridge Racer 6 and Project Gotham Racing 3, is too easily overshadowed. The matter of the online modes is different, where the intelligence of human opponents brings back to life more often those genuinely adrenaline-pumping moments that emerge here and there in the offline mode. How do you become a Full Auto driver? I'll break everything for you. At the start of each race you can choose various combinations of weapons, including mines, bombs, missiles and machine guns. Each of these produces devastating effects on the seabed, which can be destroyed into any element. Collapsing columns, splintering cornerstones, exploding tank trucks, exploding shop windows, plants and seafront for a top-notch fireworks display, but it hurts the frame rate that drops 60fps all too often . a first-rate fireworks display, which however suffers from the frame rate that abandons 60fps too often How do you become a Full Auto driver? Every time you make a jump, or eliminate an opponent, an instant replay shows gleaming bodies and crashing metal from the most spectacular shots, which can be watched at will with a special function. Only in these situations, however, are you able to appreciate the details and nuances that partially exploit the Xbox 360 hardware, but which certainly do not affect the true potential of the new Microsoft console. The chromatic choices and some of the decals that I adore are beautifulnano the bodies of some vehicles, while to forget are the music, which you will replace in a very short time with a personalized soundtrack. Goals In Full Auto there are 1000 points to collect by achieving 50 objectives, between online races and career mode. It is one of the most generous games, given that the completion of each single level of the single player mode leads to the achievement of a goal and the related points. Even after a few games, therefore, you can see your gamer tag score grow considerably. Comment BurnOut is one of your favorite games, but are you dying to tear apart buildings and cars with missiles and machine guns? Full Auto, then, may be right for you with a decent offline mode, multiplayer via Xbox Live and a longevity guaranteed by numerous unlockable secrets and achievements. What is certain is that the Sega title should have given more, and all that it offers will be appreciated only by those who are willing to overlook a slightly uncertain frame rate and a gameplay that grinds its teeth, but never manages to tighten its bite , up to where the progenitor of a new Next Generation brand should. If you love fast and frenetic arcades, however, take a ride on the Full Auto tracks and indulge in some healthy destruction. Pros: Fully interactive backdrop Fast and frenetic Arcade and light-hearted gameplay Cons: Dancer frame rate Midway between old and new generation After the excellent debut of Condemned: Criminal Origins, Sega returns to the assault on Xbox 360 with Full Auto, an arcade racing game seasoned with the mass destruction of backdrops, opponents and unsuspecting bystanders. Since last E3, when we tried the Pseudo Interactive title for the first time, Full Auto has come a long way, the various modes have taken shape and the game is now ready for the shelves of all shops. Even from the demo distributed for free on the market place, many progresses have been made, with greater solidity and a more stable frame rate. Despite this and the good premises, Full Auto does not scratch and remains a discreet game that entertains, but fails to fully convince.
