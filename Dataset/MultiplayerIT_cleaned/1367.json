{"name": "Unreal II: The Awakening", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/unreal-ii-the-awakening.html", "text": "Whats real? In Unreal II: The Awakening we will take on the role of a space marine named John Dalton, who, kicked out of the ranks of the Colonial Authority galactic police, will embark, together with other outcasts, on a series of bloody missions in search of precious and powerful artifacts. During the 12 missions we will see our John fight shoulder to shoulder with his companions several times, but also embark on dangerous solitary expeditions. Dangerous, in fact, is a bit of a big word, given that the two selectable difficulty levels (normal and hard) will soon be calibrated too low, thus making a high-risk adventure a mere stroll through the landscapes created by developers. Being able to complete the game without dying on a normal level will be, as well as easy, almost imperative. On the other hand, the power of the enemy blows is too deficient which, even if equipped with an at least passable AI, will hardly be able to scratch the armor of our alter ego. And if the combat system is essentially standard, the controls offer beautifully intersected lights and shadows. Only places in the sun instead for the paraphernalia, from the top of its futuristic style that however gives a nod to the weapons of today. We will then be able to demolish our enemies with assault rifles or lasers, photon guns and flamethrowers, as well as grenade launchers and missile launchers. Furthermore, each weapon will also have an enhanced and loadable shot, obviously more harmful but also slower in execution. Multi-killer The insipid single player parenthesis will be backed by a cooperative mode and the Live service. The possibility of embarking on an adventure in the company of a friend takes the form of a horizontal split screen which will essentially have the same strengths and weaknesses as the single player. Although the multiplayer component is always welcome, it will only be able to take off for the first few game sessions, and then dive into a decidedly deep abyss. More complex is the discourse concerning the Live, represented by a game mode not too dissimilar from the capture the flag already seen in previous versions. XMP  this is the name of the online game option  will support up to 12 players, who, divided into two teams, will have to battle it out by contending for 4 artifacts. Victory will go to the team that first manages to take possession of all the artifacts, or, if no one has answered the above basic requirement at the end of the time, to whoever has obtained the most points. Earning points will be possible thanks to certain moves on the battlefield, in a balanced and functioning assignment system. On the other hand, some problems arose from the excessive size of the settings, which will absolutely require 12 participants in order not to become excessively dispersive. Unfortunately, once the threshold of 8 players has been exceeded, there will be rather frequent and annoying lags to the point of disfiguring the online experience. Not even the technical realization, which on PC still makes a good impression, manages to raise the fortunes of this Unreal II: The Awakening. The settings offer a fluctuating quality rate, both in terms of design and for the finalization in polygons. Clipping and a light fogging will accompany the player for the duration of the game, which does not even shine for the quality of the textures. Furthermore, the NPC models are rather crude, even if considerably better than the polygonal constructions of the enemies, who will also show off the worst animations seen in recent times. Finally, if we add a rather unstable frame rate and decidedly excruciating loading times, the omelette is ready. Fortunately, the sound sector definitely improves the situation, above all by virtue of a well-crafted Italian dubbing and thanks to the excellent acting of the actors. Comment Unreal II: The Awakening is the result of a poorly cared for job, as well as a botched porting, of a certainly more enjoyable PC version. The defects of this conversion are many and undoubtedly undermine a gaming experience that remains afloat only thanks to the multiplayer modes, which are also affected by noteworthy problems. Ultimately this Atari production is aimed almost exclusively at fans of the series, provided they have not already played the PC version. Those who are looking for an FPS on Xbox, on the other hand, would do better to look towards decidedly more refined productions, which are also present on the Microsoft console in good quantities. Pros: Greatdubbing in Italian. Great variety of weapons. In multi it's fun Cons: but not for long. Flat single player. Graphically poorly maintained. Excessively long uploads. Starting from a basic concept or definition, you can easily go back to the coat of arms of a game. Unreal has always been one of the greatest exponents of the First Person Shooter genre, a game that over the years has been able to dictate the times and which has now amassed a large group of passionate acolytes. The hype that was generated at the beginning of 2003 for the PC version of Unreal II: The Awakening was dampened by a product overall below expectations, whose gaps were partially filled by patches. It is therefore no wonder that the Xbox version, which was about a year late, has gone a bit on the sly. The reasons for this interest 'on probation', as well as for the partial disappointment born from the PC version, can be traced back to a not excellent technical quality resulting from the screens and videos shown up to now. With the final version in hand, we can therefore decree how much this port can undermine the illustrious founders of the genre present on the Microsoft console.", "date": "2004-03-18", "grade": null}
