III has changed quite a bit: beyond the immense snowy expanses, in fact, huge forests now stand out, inhabited by new species of Akrid. No one knows what generated this climate revolution, however it is suspected an involvement of the G-type Akrid, or the most gigantic and dangerous creatures that can be encountered. Ah, it is clear that in the game we will not only find ourselves facing such seemingly invincible monsters, but we will also have to do it a consistent number of times. Life is hard, yeah. Lost Planet 2 finally lands on PC after the not exactly exciting results obtained by the console versions, which in total have not reached the million copies sold (against the almost two million of the first episode). The causes of this situation can be attributed to a series of choices, in the end. Game design choices, in the first place, capable of making certain game sequences really frustrating. Choices relating to the artistic direction, secondly, because in Lost Planet 2 there is in fact no protagonist and there are no ~bad guys~ to face, but only a series of completely anonymous characters who belong to the various factions in the field: a mysterious NEVEC task force on one side, a group of mercenaries on the other and in the background the ragtag but stubborn troops of the Jungle Pirates. Choices that somehow delegitimize a ~sacred~ element such as the single player campaign, finally, because the game has such integration with the online cooperative mode that it simply prevents us from accessing the ~next mission~, asking us instead to create a match with three bots to form the team and eventually wait for some other player to join the session. Too bad I can't do it during construction. A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away... The game offers us six episodes, each consisting of a variable number of missions (from three to five) which, however, can last even a few minutes. Being basically a third person shooter, it is clear that most of the time we will spend fighting using various firearms - machine guns, shotguns, pistols, sniper rifles, grenades of all kinds - and the main dish of Lost Planet , or the Vital Suits (or VS): they are to all intents and purposes metal exoskeletons equipped with heavy armament, rather slow in their basic movements but capable of making great leaps thanks to the reactors supplied (some, then, can also remain in the air for a few seconds). The management of the VS and of the supplied weapons is the same seen in the first episode, and in fact it didn't need major modifications as it is well done: each exoskeleton can mount from one to two weapons, and our character can disassemble and reassemble them at will. at will, replacing for example an empty Gatling gun with a nice missile launcher. Carrying out such operations in the middle of a fierce fight with a huge G-type Akrid is not the best of life, but with a little effort it can be done. Otherwise there are always other VS scattered around, indeed in such situations there are so many that it almost seems to have rained from the sky. How lucky, huh? It must be said that fighting a giant monster, which is extremely resistant, without such a support could really be frustrating; therefore this ~simplification~ is welcome, implausible but with indisputable practical implications. The weapons supplied to our character are managed in an almost identical way, with two slots available plus space for grenades. Playing with an Xbox 360 controller, the key configuration is unchanged compared to Lost Planet 2 for Microsoft consoles, but there are also a number of problems relating to the response to inputs, often late and unaccustomed to the most agitated situations, when for example you have to change weapons quickly because there is an enemy in front of us and we can't wait for reload times. Even the use of the grappling hook appears unchanged and therefore still rather cumbersome: fortunately we will be led to use it almost exclusively during the exploratory phases. Speaking of slow response to inputs, one of the most annoying problems of Lost Planet in its console version was represented by the situations in which our character was hit, ended up on the ground and had difficulty getting up, exposing himself to a further attack that in most of cases resulted in the loss of a ~life~. On PC this flaw has been somewhat filed, so things like this can still happen but to a much lesser extent. Who doesn't play together... Given the propensity native to multiplayer, it is clear that the Capcom title lends itself well to being played with friends, indeed it certainly gives its best when it is possible to organize a group of four close-knit and fairly expert people, who can face any threat with some coordination. Also because, let's face it, Lost Planet 2's AI cannot be taken as an example of excellence, both as regards our ~virtual~ companions, and above all as regards enemies: if you are at a certain distance, you will realize that they won't ~see~ you and will remain there to be targeted, reacting only in certain cases. In this way it is easy to get the better of several opponents aboard VS: just shoot a few missiles at them from a distance, they'll stay still and enjoy it. Probably this defect has led the developers to opt for scenarios characterized most of the time by short distances, by ~turns~ and by relatively intimate environments. But we were talking about the multiplayer modes: in addition to the cooperative one, there are several competitive ones that refer to the classics of the genre between single and team deathmatches, two variants of ~capture the flag~ and the interesting ~fugitive~ mode, already present in the first Lost Planet, in which one group is tasked with capturing the other in a situation of clear disparity in terms of equipment. The review copy in our possession has unfortunately prevented us from accessing the online and apparently there is not yet a large number of players available, however we are hopeful that the situation will change within a few days. Beyond some limitations to the gameplay, Lost Planet 2 on PC undoubtedly stands as the version with the greatest visual impact. The game can be run in both DirectX 9 and DirectX 11 modes. In the first case the graphics are certainly lighter (the integrated benchmarks showed our test configuration an average of 47 fps in ~normal~ situations and 38 fps in the busiest ones, at the resolution of 1680 x 1050 pixels and with all the effects at their maximum) and is manageable, albeit with some sacrifices, even by mid-range systems. The similarities with the console versions are numerous, even if the higher resolution helps to provide a higher level of detail. The DirectX 11 mode is much more complex to manage (the integrated benchmark always speaks of 22 fps in normal situations and 20 fps in the most agitated ones, but we have personally seen really substantial drops during the boss fights), however it offers a show decidedly more gratifying, above all from the point of view of the effects and the yield of the water. These are features of great value, but which in any case do not justify a drop in performance that reaches 50%: we would have expected more attention in the optimization phase. As far as the sound is concerned, everything seemed excellent to us: from the music to the effects, passing through the dialogues in English.", "date": "2010-10-28", "grade": "8.0"}
