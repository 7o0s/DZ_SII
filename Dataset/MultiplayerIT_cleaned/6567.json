Bullets, spells, blood and curses fly as a band of outlaws tries to recover from a mysterious demon something far more precious than money: their soul. Developed by Ice Code Games, a Polish team that received this assignment directly from the authors of the first chapter, Hard West 2 is this and much more: an adventure full of references to the world of gamebooks, featuring crossroads and decisions capable of changing the balance on the battlefield, but also a truly challenging and with a few too many edges, able to test even the most savvy players. The time has therefore come to load the guns, distribute bandages, organize the arsenal and carefully select the fighters we are going to deploy, because the slightest error in judgment could cost us very dearly: here is the review of Hard West 2. Story: between trains and demons Hard West 2, the text interface of the adventure elements Gin Carter and his band of outlaws could not pass up the opportunity to attack the legendary Ghost Train, imagining who knows what riches were hidden inside those carriages. What they find once they get on the convoy, however, is very different: monstrous and gigantic paws appear on the sides of the carriages, as if the vehicle were actually a huge beast, while the driver reveals that he is a demon called Mammon. To get out of the impasse, Gin makes the mistake of challenging his infernal opponent to a hand of poker, but inevitably loses: he can't be damned after all. At stake were his soul and that of his companions, who are thrown off the train and are dispersed within the western setting that forms the backdrop to the Hard West 2 campaign. Gin, her friend Flynn and the Native American warrior Laughing Deer are still alive, but their companion Colt has disappeared: to find him they must recover the soul they have lost and stop the advance of the Ghost Train, the outlaws decide to join forces with the mysterious undead Old Man Bill, with the huntress Cla'Lish and with the reverend Lazarus, forming a new and formidable team. By freely exploring the different maps that characterize the three chapters of the campaign, we will be able to grapple with a series of complicated missions and interact with other characters to unlock secondary tasks, use the money earned to buy new weapons and equipment, assign poker cards that unlock upgrades, but also make decisions and face dialogues that will strengthen relationships with our companions, improving performance in battle. Gameplay: Ruthless strategic Hard West 2, the freely explorable map from which to access the missions The narrative component that develops during the exploratory phases of the map, through a large amount of texts on the screen (fortunately translated into Italian), the interactions with the NPCs, the inevitable visits to the doctors to restore the health of the team after each mission and in general the adventurous elements are presented as something new for the genre, but they often appear simplistic and you will soon take advantage of the possibility of accelerating their scrolling up to four times. Fortunately, the real and concrete gameplay of Hard West 2 is quite another thing and takes form within challenging turn-based combat in which from time to time four of our characters will find themselves facing wanted gangs, but also guardians of the law and obviously increasingly numerous and insidious demonic hordes, composed of multiple units that they distinguish for skills and powers: a more than discreet job has been done on the front of the variety of enemies. Hard West 2, a clash of houses During each round we will be able to spend three coins which act as indicators for our ability to move (through the classic subdivision of the map boxes) or to attack, depending on the distance traveled and the weapon, object or special power used. with a success rate that is indicated on the screen and depends on the location and coverage. However, there is an important variation on the theme, the mechanic called Bravado: when one of our characters kills an enemy, the three coins are restored and he can therefore perform his actions again. It is obviously possible to mix this feature with other traditional tactical elements , with the use of dynamite and the aforementioned special powers: each member of our gang has uno, whether it's teleporting by exchanging one's position with that of an enemy or a companion (very useful for flushing out opponents) or performing a flurry of blows, throwing darts in various directions or producing a crazy and violent charge, machete in hand. Hard West 2, the poker card-based power-up system There is no doubt that the guys from Ice Code Games have been able to manage all these aspects perfectly, without creating balancing problems. The system appears very solid right from the start, but the intermediate (hard) difficulty level, the one imagined by the developers as the most representative of the experience, seemed to us really too difficult: the enemies inflict enormous damage, apparently obvious shots are failed, our units cannot heal each other, there are only two slots for consumables and very often the death of a character can make it absolutely impossible to complete the mission. This type of hardcore approach imposes an excessively cautious approach, which greatly expands the times and which, in general, does not contribute to the quality of the experience, which on the contrary turns into an obsessive trial & error in which the automatic saves, created by the game itself, are reloaded after each shooting. Added to this are some shortcomings related to the quality of life of the experience: there is no possibility of undoing the last action if you have made a mistake, nor can you flee to regroup. The uploads are also longish even with an SSD, we are around 40 seconds. Technical realization Hard West 2, a train assault Hard West 2 presents itself as a discreet title from a graphic point of view, with well-made characters, good animations, a freely adjustable view and an adequate general rendering. The sections on the open map are frankly ugly to look at, but the real missions present a good variety of scenarios and in some cases take place ~on the move~, see for example the assault on trains: the solutions adopted in this sense appear interesting and there is no doubt that the title has character. There is nothing extraordinarily sophisticated, so it is normal for the game to run at 60 fps in 4K and with all settings maxed out, without major problems, but drop the resolution does not imply major sacrifices. As far as the audio is concerned, the soundtrack affects less than we imagined but the English dialogues appear well interpreted, although some sentences are repeated in a somewhat obsessive way during the gameplay.", "date": "2022-08-04", "grade": "8.0"}
