Unfortunately, apart from some exceptions such as Batman Returns for Super Nintendo, the more recent Batman: Arkham Asylum and a few others, in most cases we have always found ourselves faced with poor quality products that had nothing to do with the relative cinematic masterpiece, to which they did not do justice in the slightest. From here, over time, almost an assonance was born in the minds of gamers between ~tie-in~ and ~flop~. It is therefore no wonder that when faced with the announcement of any product inspired or based on a film, users of any videogame platform immediately have a hesitant and a little suspicious approach to it, as in the case of THOR: The God of Thunder, a game developed by Liquid Games, the same as Rise of the Argonauts, and published by SEGA, based on the homonymous film directed by Kenneth Branagh with Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman. Divided between the hope of soon having a good video game in your hands and the fear of finding yourself in reality with half or all of it. But let's do a brief historical excursus on the protagonist of the video game in question, before delving into the analysis of the product. Thor is a character from the Marvel comics created by Stan Lee to the texts and by Jack Kirby to the drawings, based on the figure of the god of lightning and thunder of Norse mythology. He lives in Asgard, the city of the Rainbow, together with his father, the god Odin, and other gods. It appeared for the first time in 1962 in Journey into Mystery magazine and since then, between ups and downs and some suspensions, it has been on newsstands, especially in the United States almost continuously until today. But let's get to the video game. Action... confusing The game takes up the style and dynamics of various other products of the action genre which it then mixes together trying to offer the user, at least in intentions, a varied and therefore diversified playability, but as we will see later, it does so in a certainly not effective way . THOR: The God of Thunder is therefore basically an old-fashioned button mashing with some platform element, where hordes of enemies must be faced and killed in series with kicks, punches, hammers, combos and special abilities, up to the boss at the end of the area . Thor, who is controlled with the left analog stick, can then use various offensive and defensive moves to make his way through the various levels. In particular, in the first case, the son of Odin and Gea can also slide in mid-air, throw his faithful fairy hammer called Mjolnir, equipped with automatic aim, against monsters, and perform devastating combos by chaining together the various typical attacks of the genre with the simple pressure of the two keys used for the purpose. The latter often end with fun finishing moves that give the opponent the final blow. To try to give more depth in some ways to the clashes there are then the grips that can be performed by Thor, and his three powers related to Thunder, Lightning and Wind. The latter can be activated and performed both in their short and enhanced form, simply depending on how and how long the key to which the reference element is associated is held down. The powers can also be upgraded through a discreet upgrade system. Put like this, in short, it would seem all roses and flowers and THOR: The God of Thunder could appear as a good action game. In reality, behind what has been described and analyzed up to now there are unfortunately a series of flaws, let's call them that way, which undermine the positive elements of the game just described. Playstation 3 trophies THOR: The God of Thunder offers thirty-six Trophies to unlock divided respectively into 1 of Platinum, 4 of Gold, 11 of Silver, 20 of Bronze. The rewards are distributed in the single player mode and are obtained simply with the progression in the adventure, fulfilling the specific requests of the game. Then, depending on their importance, they will be racked up for example by upgrading Thor, beating a particular boss or enemy, completing all missions or unlocking each outfit. The usual tie-in From this moment on, in fact, all those defects emerge which unfortunately undermine and ruin everything else. First of all, the almost total absence of interaction with the environment outside the dialogues, which ultimately represent the fulcrum of these phases. Then a certain repetitiveness both in the contents and in the areas and enemies. The latter then do not seem to have particular diversifications not even as regards the parameters that should instead distinguishstalk them, so they react in a similar way to any type of elemental or physical attack. It would have been enough to make some of them weaker or more resistant to fire rather than thunder, just to give an example, to make them more varied and consequently improve the yield of clashes with them. Then in the very structure of the game, which necessarily provides for the systematic elimination of all enemies in a given location to progress to the next one. Considering that the arenas are generally not very large and without ~outbursts~ upwards, it is often necessary to linger for a long time, moving here and there on the screen, at certain points to knock down the opponents. So sometimes we advance too slowly and by inertia. And the music doesn't change even in front of the bosses, even the most impressive ones. The clashes with them are characterized by a mixture of raw action and the inevitable Quick Time Events: if on the one hand everything is translated into moments that are sometimes spectacular to look at, on the other they are not very pleasant to play in the long run due to the already mentioned repetitiveness that also comes out in these battles, and the simplicity of executing the keys which leads to the elimination of the monster on duty. Add to it a collision management system that too often leaks from all sides to complicate things, plus a certain overall linearity, and you will have a complete picture of the situation. Even the graphics of THOR: The God of Thunder does not differ much from the general quality of the rest of the product. On the one hand we have a fair number of polygonal models, faces aside, especially as regards the main characters, whether they are good or bad, apart from the faces, made in an approximate way especially for the lip and for the animations related to the faces. On the other hand, we are witnessing a veritable compilation of opprobrium: interpenetration of polygons, low-grade textures, largely woody and cumbersome animations. And just to make sure you don't miss anything, some clipping here and there. The audio is saved a bit, with a good dubbing in Italian and rather spot-on music in certain situations, even if a poorly calibrated volume in the mix means that the soundtrack and the spoken one often overlap to the point of not being understood nothing and be annoying.", "date": "2011-05-27", "grade": "5.0"}
