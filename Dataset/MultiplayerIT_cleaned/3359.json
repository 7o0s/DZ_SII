{"name": "Sid Meier's Civilization 6", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sid-meiers-civilization-6-recensione-console.html", "text": "The truth? This is a real event! It is the first time that Sid Meier's masterpiece arrives on major consoles. You may remember similar games, with the same name but with alternative subtitles like Civilization Revolution, but they were always reductions designed for a different audience, and less powerful hardware. This Civilization VI, of which you read the console review, is instead the ~real deal~, the real one, the same one that has long kept millions of fans awake on PC and beyond. In fact, this sixth chapter has already arrived on mobile platforms, and with the same excellent results for a few months it can even be played on Nintendo Switch, while now it is preparing to close the circle by finally making its debut on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. From an exclusive title to a game for everyone, the step is certainly not short: it took some time to ensure that Firaxis was able to streamline its structure as much as possible, without affecting its complexity; it took just as much for the consoles to show off a CPU and memory worthy of what the management system of management systems is without fear of denial. Now that this moment has arrived, Civilization can further expand its audience, for a potential success that will never be able to match the quality and depth of this titanic product. Rewrite history Civilization VI allows you to rewrite history, every game. When you need it, because you need Civilization cyclically, with two clicks you have a new adventure ready: once you are the Romans, another the Hungarians, and you never know what the world will be like, how many continents, what resources more common and rarer. And everything that is not in the hands of chance is built turn after turn by our choices and by those of the various artificial intelligences involved: behind that mountain you could find a new civilization much more advanced than yours. Based on its characteristics and agenda, it could find elements of discord or friendship in your evolution, forever changing the course of events. Will it be war or strategic alliance? However, every viable road is destined to change with the passage of time: in Civilization it begins three thousand years before the birth of Christ, and continues until the near future, with space exploration. The mutation is continuous, and it is geographical, natural, political, but always also of gameplay. Imagine living in starvation for hundreds of years, in stagnation, when at some point your scientists discover the qualities of oil thus revealing the presence of wells on the map. Such an event can upset the entire game; maybe you are the only one who has so many, to the point that you can afford to blackmail other civilizations that will urgently need them; by doing so you could even push one of them to go to war, but guess who will have more fuel and consequently more armored vehicles? Then there is the whole political part, organization, and much more, for a stratified and constantly evolving challenge. Win and lose In Civilization VI there are many ways to lose and triumph. To bring home the result, it is necessary to be the first to reach one of these possible victories: the more generic one in terms of points, the cultural, diplomatic, military, scientific and finally religious one. You can pursue them all together or individually, even changing along the way. Some of these victory conditions then propose approaches that are radically different from others, religious victory for example will require constant evangelization of other civilizations, opening up to new types of units and structures that in other cases will not even be built. The game overs, on the other hand, are of your types in Civilization: the first is when you eat the dust and nothing but ruins will remain of your civilization, and the other is decreed in the non-achievement of one of the victory conditions at the end of the last game turn , but from then on whoever wants can continue playing indefinitely. Since this is yet another review of Civilization VI, it is useless to go further into the details, however know that there are countless mechanics that we have not mentioned: there are city states, trade, diplomacy, the differences between one civilization and another , turn-based combat and the epic progression of scientific and cultural discoveries, barbarians at the gates, trade and nuclear threats; then there are historical figures, artists and works to be kept in museums, the golden age, great generals and world congresses in which to decree the fate of the entire planet. Civilization VI is big, layered, infinite. Expansions Along with Civilization VI, console users who want to spend aa little more will also be able to get their hands on the two expansions. The first is Rise and Fall and we could define it sufficient: its purpose is to make the management of individual cities more complex, which now also have a degree of loyalty, as well as requiring governors. With Rise and Fall the negative version of the golden age, the dark century, is also introduced, with new consequences to face. The second expansion, The Gathering Storm, introduces something more concrete like the force of the elements: erupting volcanoes, overflowing rivers, and of course global warming and rising sea levels. With Gathering Storm everything changes, especially in the more advanced rounds, when the ecosystem will begin to change based on the historical paths of each civilization.", "date": "2019-11-21", "grade": "9.2"}
