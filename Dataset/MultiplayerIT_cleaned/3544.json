{"name": "Grandia HD Collection", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grandia-hd-collection-recensione.html", "text": "In the late 90s, shortly after the release of Final Fantasy VII, a kind of gold fever broke out, although it would be more accurate to call it JRPG fever. It almost seemed that every Japanese developer wanted to reinvent the genre, in an attempt to break through as Square Enix did with its first 32-bit Final Fantasy. Grandia made its debut at that time, in 1997, and on SEGA's Saturn, but it took two years for GameArts to decide to bring it to PlayStation as well and, thus, to the rest of the world. GameArts, a few years earlier, had carved out a place in the hearts of role-players with its splendid Lunar: The Silver Star, and Grandia, in many respects, could be considered the spiritual heir of a way of making JRPGs that today is practically not exists anymore. That's why this Grandia HD Collection is important, which although it is not a real ~collection~, by proposing only the first two titles of the series, allows the new generations to get their hands on two real ageless pearls. Grandia Grandia belongs to a more innocent era and reflects a very different storytelling than the standards to which we have become accustomed in the last ten, fifteen years. Today the protagonist of a JRPG is not such if he does not have some complex, if he is not a lone wolf who has to overcome a great trauma or a hero predestined to save the world. Justin, the protagonist of Grandia, is different: he is a teenager who loves exploring ancient ruins in the company of his friend Sue, imitating his father, a missing adventurer who left him with a loving and protective mother. When Justin comes across the artifact of an ancient civilization, a hologram that spurs him to go in search of clues about the past of a world in full industrial evolution, the journey begins in the most adventurous way possible, because there is also a force military in search of the same artifacts, albeit with much less academic purposes. Grandia is an adventure full of multifaceted and charismatic characters, but the young protagonists are the absolute stars. It's impossible not to get attached to this band of heroes, also because Grandia - just like Lunar did long ago - employs a ruse that is now rarely seen in modern JRPGs and constantly changes the party's lineup, adding or removing certain characters as the game develops. plot which is, therefore, more than ever a driving force. Grandia is in fact a rather linear title: it is completed in about thirty hours and there are no secondary missions or optional tasks, mostly you explore intricate cities or dungeons in search of chests and collectibles as you move from the starting point to the arrival point . The combat system always keeps the player's interest at the maximum, however, also because there are no random battles but enemies roaming around the map. Once the fight has been triggered, it takes turns in another screen and pits our heroes against various enemies. The dynamic that distinguishes it, however, is an indicator that scans the order of actions in real time: when a character or an enemy prepares a special attack or spell, a short preparation period follows during which it can be slowed down or interrupted completely. Halfway between Final Fantasy VII's Active Time Battle and a turn-based strategy game in which you have to think not only about who to attack, but also how and when, Grandia's combat system still remains fresh and fun today. It lacks a bit in the development of spells and skills, it must be said, since a certain grind of uses is needed to evolve each attack into its most powerful version. Despite this, Grandia is a JRPG that hasn't aged at all, in its naivety, even if the remastering operation hasn't completely convinced us. GungHo, unlike what was previously stated, did not bring the Saturn version to Switch, but the PlayStation one, lacking in terms of effects and some animations. This is not a dramatic lack, but it would have been better to take advantage of this opportunity to offer the best possible version of the game. The developer then applied a sort of ~smooth~ filter like that of the emulators to raise the resolution in general: in doing so, the original beauty of the pixel art was lost a bit, but the locations and polygonal backdrops gained in cleanliness and sharpness. On balance, however, Grandia is very pleasant to see and play both on the small screen and on the TV, net of some visual or sound glitches that occasionally sneak into the games: apart from this, we appreciated the very fast loading and the direction artistic, inspired and full of colour, it fits perfectlyand with the light-hearted atmospheres of adventure. It is also possible to change the dialogue track from the mediocre English one to the original Japanese version, while Noriyuki Iwadare's extraordinary soundtrack is not much to say: today he is perhaps an infamous composer, but at the time he wrote some of the best video game soundtracks, and Grandia's is one of them. Grandia II Iwadare also composed the music for the sequel, Grandia II, and although they are a little less incisive than those of the first chapter, it is thanks to them that some passages of an all in all predictable story have remained impressed on us for twenty years. Grandia II was released on Dreamcast in 2000, shortly after it also arrived on PlayStation II in a largely inferior version from a technical point of view. Later, the GameArts title was also brought back to PC in a remastered version that does greater justice to the artistic direction and the liveliness of a new world to be explored. Grandia II, in fact, is a stand-alone title, completely disconnected from Justin's adventures, a bit like what happens in most Final Fantasy or Tales of. For the occasion, GameArts decided to take a different path than usual, telling a darker and more adult story than those of the previous Grandia or Lunar. The protagonist in this case is called Ryudo and is a Geohound, practically a mercenary who travels far and wide with his inseparable falcon Skye. Unlike Justin, Ryudo is a much more cynical and solitary type who doesn't say anything and rarely thinks about the consequences. The church of Granas will hire Ryudo to escort Elena, a kind of young priestess who has been possessed by a fragment of the soul of Valmar, an ancient demon whose awakening could cause a catastrophe of apocalyptic proportions. During the journey, however, Ryudo will discover that the young woman is not the only victim of this possession and that things are not exactly as they told her: the two will be joined by some very colorful characters who will have to join forces to save the world by Valmar and by those who intend to exploit his enormous powers. More mature in many respects, Grandia II is a JRPG that explores the meaning of sacrifice and that constantly tests a well-characterized cast, in which each character must come to terms with his or her vision of the world, accepting the usual truth that it does not exist only black or white, but rather many shades of gray. The plot is therefore less carefree, compared to that of Grandia, but equally memorable, also because it maintains the same story-driven setting, without too many detours from a linear path that leads the player from start to finish over about thirty hours . GameArts has not particularly retouched the combat system, which remains exactly that of the first Grandia with some small differences in the management of special attacks, bonuses and spells: these are learned thanks to specific books that can be equipped to party members to customize their roles and skills. In short, with a little strategy, it is possible to complete a title that, to tell the truth, is already quite simple on its own, without the slightest difficulty. As for the remastering, the Switch version is a further revision of the one already released on PC. In this case, however, there are some criticisms to be made. GungHo has done a decent job: unlike the previous Grandia, Grandia II is fully polygonal, but the character models and scenarios are full of details that the new resolution brings out to great effect. However, we are talking about a title from nineteen years ago, so we must not expect miracles or perfect proportions, to which GameArts had preferred a vaguely super deformed style which in any case does not clash at all with the often goliardic and cartoonish narration. The problem is rather the uncertain frame rate, especially if you play in portable mode: in this case, fighting against many enemies at the same time, significant slowdowns occur which do not affect the gameplay but are still a bit annoying. At the time of writing this review, GungHo hasn't rolled out any targeted updates yet, but hope dies last.", "date": "2019-08-22", "grade": "7.7"}
