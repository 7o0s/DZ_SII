We play the role of a scientist visiting a scientific conference, Dr. Leonov, but we quickly realize that something is wrong. Raining outside. The moonlight filtered through the wet glass barely illuminates the room, creating a gloomy and dreamlike atmosphere. We go to the bathroom door. Some situations are suggestive The handle is missing. What happens? We are locked inside, trapped by we don't know who. We begin to explore the environment better, looking around for some clues that can explain the trouble we've gotten ourselves into. We find various documents (covering letters, useful information about the hotel and so on), a lamp without a light bulb and many other objects. We immediately understand that we are not dealing with an Amnesia clone, but more with a Monkey Island horror visualized in first person. There are not many graphic adventures with this setting. The initial impact with the interface is not the best and going forward in the adventure this impression will be confirmed, even if mitigated by the experience. But we'll talk about it later. By solving some puzzles and filling the inventory with objects, some of which can be combined with each other, we manage to enter the bathroom, witnessing the first, short, dreamlike sequence. There will be others throughout the adventure, but obviously we prefer not to reveal them so as not to spoil the surprise. The mysteries are all still unsolved, but in the meantime the environment to explore has widened, given that by solving other puzzles we have unlocked a new area of the hotel room, larger than the previous one. In addition to the classic puzzles with objects to be used on other objects or on the various hot-spots, we also encounter the first Myst-like puzzle, which we cannot solve for now due to lack of information. In general the puzzles are built very well and follow a certain narrative thread, even if some seem a little forced (however a narrative justification will be given to the whole thing towards the end of the game). Between esoteric objects and fuses we proceed quite quickly. Except that... We have delved into The Guest, horror adventure for PC: find out what we think Puzzles and interface Except that from time to time some puzzles pop up that we can define as completely arbitrary. Fortunately there aren't many, but they can annoy. For example, in one of the first sequences ~outside the hotel~, i.e. in a kind of vision of the protagonist, we find ourselves in a surreal labyrinth from which we have not yet figured out how we managed to get out. Dream sequences or visions? We're not kidding: we were in despair, devoid of any clue as to what to do, when we unblocked the situation without understanding how. We probably didn't quite interpret the signs we were given, but in truth we didn't have much to think about. As mentioned, these are not very frequent cases, but they can be annoying. But we had mentioned the interface problems. We can summarize them in: optimized for controllers, penalizing if you use the mouse. Now, on PC it is expected that if you have a pointer available you can use it to perform certain actions and you don't have to use the keyboard all the time. Let's explain better with a direct example. One of the puzzles asks you to rotate three gears to place markers in a certain order. Apparently nothing complicated, except that it is not possible to select the gears with the mouse, but instead have to use the movement keys and then press two other keys on the keyboard, one assigned to clockwise rotation, the other to the one counterclockwise, to solve the puzzle. There are others that present similar difficulties, but it should be clear what we mean by even a single example. We repeat: nothing you don't get used to, but still a significant annoyance, especially in the early stages of the game. We understand that controllers are now essential gaming peripherals for many PC gamers as well, but better optimizing mouse and keyboard interfaces should be imperative, especially for certain genres. Technical issues From a technical point of view, the title of Team Gotham does not make you cry out for a miracle but it does not look bad either, especially considering its production level. The hotel hides more mysteries than it appears at a superficial glance The entire adventure takes place in a handful of environments, many of them packed with items to collect or interact with. The general impact is therefore very good, even if more than a few qualitative limitations emerge when looking at the individual models. In general, however, the atmosphere is well rendered, also thanks to a shrewd use of the lighting system. Nidynamic or particularly advanced from a technological point of view, but the developers have shown that they know how to exploit it well. From the point of view of the soundtrack, the situation worsens a bit. Some of the sound effects are a bit crude, while the voice acting is downright awful. When you don't have the money for decent actors, it would be better to leave the voices alone, otherwise you will get the opposite effect to what you hoped for. Altogether it is a discreet work, which would have gained something from a little more care. Speaking of duration, it's difficult to give precise times to complete the game, because a lot depends on how good you are at solving the puzzles. Let's say that we are talking about a few hours to get to the end and, once we have seen the final sequence, there is no longer any reason to go back to the adventure (it is a problem common to all representatives of the genre). Finally, let's answer one of the usual questions we receive in the comments: yes, The Guest also has the Italian language, so you can enjoy it even if you don't speak English.", "date": "2016-03-10", "grade": "7.0"}
