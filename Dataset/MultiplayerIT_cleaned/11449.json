{"name": "Wii Fit - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wii-fit-recensione.html", "text": "7 kilos in 7 days And so, if with the title offered bundled with the Nintendo console it has put an end to the ~social~ problem of video gaming, with Wii Fit the Kyoto house delivers the coup de grace by solving - or at least trying to - the issue relating to poor motor activity and to the physical decay linked to the traditional commitment with pad in hand and relative inseparable joint to the comfortable armchair. On the contrary, from today, by going to your trusted shopkeeper and paying out 89.99 euros, it is possible to demonstrate to the whole world that no, video games do not make you fat, but allow you to lose weight and even build and outline an almost perfect body. In reality, things are not exactly like that, since Wii Fit can only be partially labeled as a video game, getting closer to one of those DVD gym courses in which characters with sculpted abs and tight overalls invite the poor common~ to make your living room a gym and lose pounds by the sweat of your brow. What amazes is the excellent build quality, versatility and sensational precision that the Balance Board can boast 7 kilos in 7 days However, what allows Wii Fit to add (more than) something to this kind of product are basically two things: the Balance Board and the Nintendo Difference. As for the peripheral, by now anyone who has followed the development of the title will know what we are talking about: it is a kind of scale, to be placed on the ground and able to detect the weight applied to it and the movements of the center of gravity of the one who uses. What amazes is the excellent construction quality, versatility and sensational precision that it can boast; very far from the plasticky and fragile concept that we have often been used to associate with crocchi sold together with the related games, on the contrary the Balance Board is heavy, compact, solid and reliable. These sensations are offered in the same way and indeed emphasized once you get on them and start entering the world of Wii Fit; a brief initial section introduces the key concepts of the product (center of gravity, balance and posture) and allows you to register the user - obviously not limited to just one - with relative Mii, age, height and body weight. On the basis of these data, in a very similar way to what was seen with Brain Training, the software calculates the current physical situation indicating whether you are in situations ranging from underweight to obesity. A couple of balance tests finally lead to obtaining the Wii Fit age (remember the brain age? Here), or how much the shape of our body is aligned with the actual age. We feel we can raise some doubts about the split precision of this last survey, which can be performed every day with a graph of variations; but in reality the important thing is not so much this, as to impose an iron discipline and face your training every day. Because constancy is undoubtedly able to reward. Less fat for everyone Once the age test has been performed, and the relative stamp has been applied to the calendar, there is therefore nothing left to do but move on to the actual exercises, about fifty divided into 4 categories: Yoga, Muscle Exercises, Aerobic Exercises and Balance Games. Initially only a few types for each category are unlocked, and to get new ones it is necessary to accumulate minutes in a kind of piggy bank which - in fact - records the amount of time spent training. In addition to the purely quantitative element, however, the qualitative one is also rewarded, since a good evaluation allows access to more complex versions or with more repetitions of the exercises. Yoga is fundamentally related to the concepts of stretching, lengthening and balance; therefore, with the tests of this category you won't burn many calories, but you will certainly feel a lot of cracks of hardened bones and joints. Moving on to muscle exercises instead, you start to suffer with push-ups, sit-ups and other types of strengthening. The aerobic component is instead fulfilled by jogging, hula hoop, step and things like that, while the balance games add further playful elements with real minigames in which, in fact, balance and weight shifting become the key elements. From the description just offered, it is evident how Wii Fit is basically divided into two sections: the one that includes yoga and muscle exercises, in which the situation offered and the exercises are practically similar to what one could actually experience inside a gym, complete with its own personal trainer (choice between man and woman) perfectly and realistically animated, and the one offered aerobic and balance testslibrio, where the playful component increases and in fact not by chance where the Miis and the related stylized and colorful graphics become the protagonist. And it is precisely in these latter situations that the Nintendo difference is enhanced, with a whole series of touches and elements with a distinctive flavor: for example, when jogging, you find yourself running in a park populated by all the Miis present on your console, the same who meet to throw the hula hoops or depicted on the balance exercise marbles, and so on. But the style of the Kyoto house is present everywhere, starting from the great simplicity and accessibility of the entire package which makes consultation of the manual absolutely superfluous; everything is introduced in a gradual, clear and detailed way, perhaps even a little too much as in the excessively verbose phases that describe the individual exercises for the first time. But at the same time there is depth, there is never any superficiality and indeed there are moments of authentic amazement in the face of what the program is capable of offering. Party games? Wii Fit is basically designed as an experience to be tackled alone, although there is a minimal attempt to involve a second user as in the case of jogging in pairs. Let me be clear, the product encourages the insertion of additional users through the relative Miis, but the interaction between them is minimal; in the intentions of the game designers, the aim would in fact actually be to get the whole family to participate and then push them to compare the results and discuss progress. But to become an authentic tool capable of organizing and determining users' physical training, Wii Fit is missing something; the basic feeling is that Nintendo has found itself reflecting a lot, walking on the complicated path consisting of extreme attention not to expect anything, but rather to offer the user the opportunity to train keeping their physical limits in mind. In fact, if already with the Wiimotes thrown against TVs and windows there had been a long dispute, also dotted with tragicomic injuries, from which Nintendo had had to defend itself by imposing the wrist strap and giving away silicone cases, with physical exercises the risk would have been even greater. Who knows how many lawsuits there would have been, especially in the States, with people injured (or worse) ready to accuse Wii Fit ~that told me to do so~. That's why there are no training programs of any kind, but only suggestions on how to combine tests for certain results. Frankly, the choice adopted is the only possible one given the conditions: the absence of a human personal trainer who can assess the user's condition, abilities and needs makes it impossible a priori to offer indications on how much time to dedicate to physical activity and with which exercises. As a result, the main, if not the only limitation and defect of Wii Fit arises, i.e. the absence of real motivations and an authentic drive for continuity offered by the software, which therefore totally bounces back to the user. In fact, we don't feel like considering the assessment of physical age and the indication of a weight to reach as real and sufficient cues to continue using Wii Fit on a daily basis; consequently, once the push of the novelty is exhausted, the enthusiasm is extinguished, all the exercises are unlocked, between the player and the improvement of his physical shape there will be only the very personal desire and the motivation to obtain the latter. In reality, Miyamoto himself has stated that the product should be combined with normal physical activity, and has no claim or intention to replace it. So if you have always bypassed gyms, activities and exercises as if they were the worst of evils, Nintendo will hardly be enough to make Gerard Butler's turtle abs appear in the film ~300~ instead of the flaccid belly. Comment Wii Fit is a product that tries to make exercise, fatigue, sweat, something fun. Beyond the media and social impact that - we are sure - excellent sales will bring to the world of video games, thanks to Nintendo increasingly cleared through customs and distanced from the unpleasant synonyms it was associated with until recently, Wii Fit represents a in which the N difference and the goodness of the Balance Board are fundamental but not sufficient elements to push ex couch potatoes to take care of their bodies. The forced and inevitable absence of training programs and real goals to be achieved imposes having to ask a lot of the personal motivations of the users, which, once the innovative drive has run out, will therefore all have to be verified. The judgment therefore remains very positive, but not doing gymnasticsit's like launching into a tennis match; if you are aware of this, Wii Fit will be a purchase you will absolutely not regret. Pros The Balance Board is excellent Varied and well described exercises Accessible but deep, typically Nintendo Cons The obligatory absence of training programs weighs Won't make the unsporty sporty A couple of minigames not very fun", "date": "2008-04-30", "grade": null}
