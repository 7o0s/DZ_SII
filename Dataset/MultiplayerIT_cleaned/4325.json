We have to admit that in fact disciplines such as FIFA 18 football or NBA 2K18 basketball can enjoy a tighter rhythm which is certainly good for the videogame field too, but once you have entered the clubs and gloves, you will find yourself involved in the charm of a deeply rooted tradition. Especially if you have had the opportunity to see a baseball game live, you will know what we are referring to: living in the stadium at least once in your life allows you to savor all the passion that Americans pour into this sport, made up of many numbers but also emotions that only a walk-off home run can arouse, overturning a game that was lost until a few moments before. All of this has already been perfectly recreated for several years by MLB The Show, the San Diego Studio series that landed with its 2018 edition on PlayStation 4. An exclusive that the Japanese company makes good use of especially where baseball is more popular, giving however, an important videogame outlet even for those in our area who do not live on football alone. The road to success MLB The Show 18 continues on the path of continuity paved in recent years, presenting few innovations regarding its modalities. Thus we find Road to the Show, that is the career mode that takes our character from the AA league to the glory of MLB. After being enriched by the Pave your Path dynamics, a sort of attempt to approach similar productions such as FIFA's The Journey, this year Road to the Show allows us first of all to create a player by personalizing him to the core. In addition to all the physical details, we can even change the batting position of our virtual alter ego, thus making sure that it represents us in all respects according to our tastes. Secondly, starting a career from scratch we will be able to choose between some player archetypes, thus referring to a famous model. Have you always dreamed of being a full pitcher like Roy Oswalt? Today you can say it clearly. Moving on to the growth of the character, the points that we could assign in the past have been eliminated, leaving the attributes to change automatically with our plays: obviously, by producing good things we will improve the statistics, vice versa by making trouble our numbers will go down. Continuing the overview of the modes we find once again Franchise, however deprived of its online component and therefore playable only locally. A considerable damage especially if you had someone to play with on the net, brought about by what we imagine is Sony's attempt to shift the attention of the online community towards Diamond Dynasty. The latter is the ~Ultimate Team~ of MLB The Show, and as such it also brings with it the loved / hated microtransactions. For those who love to collect cards, this year Diamond Dynasty features more legends, including Babe Ruth, as well as a series of challenges designed to keep us more busy. Speaking of removed things, the possibility of playing a single season also leaves, thus forcing you to choose the Franchise mode even if you intend to experience only the one hundred and sixty-two games of a single championship. They are obviously strategic choices made wisely (we imagine) by Sony, but as gamers we can only be sorry when something is taken away. Playstation 4 trophies MLB The Show 18 is accompanied by a total of twenty-nine Trophies among which the inevitable platinum is followed by six gold, eight silver and fourteen bronze. Most of them can be achieved by performing particular feats on the playing field, such as hitting ten hits in a single game or five home runs. In addition to what has been accomplished in the game, those who want to collect all the MLB The Show 18 Trophies are also obliged to switch between its various modes, in particular Franchise and Road to the Show. Catch this home run The pinch of bitterness as described in the previous paragraph is destined to go away the moment we take the bat in hand, to enter the extraordinary stage set up by San Diego Studio. In terms of gameplay MLB The Show 18 continues to lay some bricks on what was built up to last year, improving from all points of view without distorting anything. The work done by the developers to lower the learning curve even further is commendable, as is the possibility of choosing between different types of throw and serving the one that suits you best.suited to your ideal of baseball vieeoludico. Tackling a pitcher is never frustrating, and if in the past it was easy to feel somehow ~cheated~ by the CPU, in MLB The Show 18 when we miss most of the time it's our own fault. Thanks to the help of the suggestions displayed on the screen, it is in fact easy to realize that you have made a wrong swing because you misjudged a ball or you were in too much of a hurry. Similar speech for those who climb the mound, where it is necessary to pay attention to fatigue: it is impossible to think of ending all nine innings with a single pitcher, unless you want to start conceding valid hits as if it were raining. Similarly, the slightest carelessness in the defensive phase risks giving an extra base to the opponents, which is typically difficult to swallow. If you love baseball as we said at the beginning, the three hundred and sixty degree simulation level of MLB The Show 18 will undoubtedly involve you. Welcome to the show If the dynamics of MLB The Show have made great strides in the simulation field, it is also and above all due to the engine behind the San Diego Studio diamond. Already a year ago we praised the technical sector of the 2017 edition, but we can't avoid repeating ourselves: everything we see on the screen is even more beautiful and detailed, starting from the players' jerseys to reach the public and its reactions, intended to adapt to the moment of the season and the game in progress. The stadiums deserve a completely separate discussion, faithfully reproduced in all their peculiarities, as well as the celebrations that distinguish the different teams. In more trivial terms, during the game you can see better animations that smooth out some problems of fluidity in the movements encountered in the past, while the physics of the ball does its job fully. As heavy when batting badly as light as a feather when hitting a home run. Either because in English, or because the nature of baseball is a little slower than in other sports, in the case of MLB The Show 18 the commentary takes a little second place. However, the entry into the trio of commentators by Mark DeRosa, a former professional player who has now become one of the figures of the MLB Network, makes his impression. He is replaced by Harold Reynolds while Matt Vasgersian and Dan Plesac remain, also belonging to the past of the major league. Compared to MLB The Show 17, the new trio of voices gains above all in terms of liveliness, with more technical exchanges than in the past even if there are moments in which the sentences seem a little too detached compared to what happens on the field.", "date": "2018-03-29", "grade": "8.8"}
