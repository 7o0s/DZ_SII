Initially specialized in strategy games (the long-lived Imperium series is a demonstration of success in this sense), it has been able to adapt to driving games, graphic adventures and finally role-playing games. And it is precisely of this genre that Drakensang belongs, a serious, mature and complicated title that enthusiasts they had been waiting for a long time. Dedicated to enthusiasts In Drakensang, loosely based on the world of ~The Dark Eye~ (a Dungeons & Dragons-like board game), the player takes on the role of a ~hero~ who, called for help by an old friend, finds himself entangled in a as intricate as it is deep, made up of magic, betrayal, friendship and fights. It all starts with the creation of the character, with the choice between a series of careers divided into three distinct races (dwarves, elves and humans) and the gender of the character (however, the choice will not influence the profile, just as it is not possible to decide physical features). Each class (and ranges from the warrior to the archer, the magician, the acrobat, the soldier, the mercenary, the amazon, the sorcerer...) is characterized by a series of skills (the talents) which, influenced by the statistics basis of the character (charisma, strength, resistance and so on) determine the chances that an action will be successful, success finally determined by a virtual roll of a 20-sided die. It sounds complicated and could, in fact, make those who prefer direct action-based RPGs (Gothic or Oblivion) turn up their noses, but that's exactly what the developers wanted: a character creation, management and growth system as similar as possible to that of a paper game, thus drawing inspiration from the great BioWare titles. Adventuria, a world with a talking name Once you have completed the creation of your virtual alter ego, you take the first steps in what is the game world, with the original name of Adventuria: small tasks for the initial village, such as finding a missing master or hunter, the search for trust from part of the citizens, those small tasks, in short, that every fan of the genre knows perfectly. From the beginning, however, the need to find non-player characters as quickly as possible with whom to form a party to face the missions is felt: these can be paid mercenaries, old friends reunited, adventurers in search of thrills or protected fugitives from the protagonist. There are over 300 non-player characters that you will meet, guide and abandon (or they will abandon you) throughout the game. Regardless of the reasons that drive people to join your group it is important that this is well managed: a squadron of only fighters, in fact, would not be able to go very far without adequate cover, while a group of wizards or archers needs one or more warriors to protect them from enemies as they fire their projectiles; finally, an expert healer is often needed to heal one's allies or remove serious afflictions. Furthermore, many of the quests you will face will require different levels of skill and specialization: if in fact in reconnaissance missions and killing particular targets a beefy pirate can make the difference, a clever acrobat is undoubtedly more useful when it comes to looking for information in the slums of cities, while a wise magician is perfect for searching ancient volumes for solutions to some problems. In short, for the adventure to continue, it is important that the party is balanced. Among men the warrior, among the flowers the cherry tree Adventuria is a world full of dangers: even if your hero were some kind of pacifist activist always looking for diplomatic solutions, sooner or later swords will have to shine in the sun, above all because of numerous animals and monsters whose diplomacy does not go beyond wanting to devour you. Drakensang's combat system is presented in real time, it is in fact possible to select the various party members and order them which talents or which moves to use while the battle rages in the background, even if, obviously, having each character an entire bar with a dozen choices, the use of the tactical pause is more obligatory than recommended. In fact, by pressing the space bar the game will stop and it will be possible to manage the various men calmly and calmly, deciding which combos to use, which character to have the curator assist and perhaps sending someone to the backways. As regards the evolution of the character, each monster killed generates experience points, which can be used to raise the basic statistics or the various skills (use of swords, great weapons, natural knowledge, sympathy and a thousand others); at the various level passages, however, it is possible to learn new talents, provided that they have the physical requirements and find someone able to teach them to the interested characters. The appearance of Adventuria Graphically speaking, Drakensang looks pretty good: the settings, in particular, are overflowing with details, freshness and visual depth, the characters have excellent three-dimensional models and the over 500 objects that can be worn are equipped with frills that differentiate them from one another. 'other, all with smooth and pleasant textures, almost as if they were hand painted. The light effects of spells, flames and sunlight are excellent and abundant, as is the effect of water in puddles and rivers (unfortunately impassable). A little less successful are the animations, especially those of walking, which show a certain rigidity and those of the face, limited to a rather unrealistic lip. The sound is good, with some rather spot-on music and a recitation of the dialogues in Italian entrusted to professional voice actors, as well as a fair selection of environmental sounds of considerable impact.", "date": "2009-06-23", "grade": "8.0"}
