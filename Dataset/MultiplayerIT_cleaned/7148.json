He has a photographic memory and an extraordinary intelligence, as well as an incomparable historical background. He leads a successful life in Manhattan, where he runs a top-notch antique shop with the help of Gratchen, his flawless secretary. Malachi's consultancies are sought after by wealthy people around the world, so he is always on the go. Glacial, manicly precise and wildly ambitious, Malachi pays a heavy price for his gifts. Like the inquisitor Eymerich described by Evangelisti, Malachi flees from any human contact. He is intolerant, closed in on himself and hidden behind the armor of intelligence. For him there are no emotions, much less those of others. But the panic attacks that he has to keep at bay with large doses of Xanax are a warning light. The child in him, wounded by a severe childhood trauma, is crying out to be loved. Another very interesting aspect of Malachi is his bisexuality, completely unusual for the protagonist of a video game. In this regard, the ease with which the sexuality of the protagonist has been treated is appreciable, naturally and without voyeurism. However, this tormented, profound and seductive character is more than just the protagonist of Moebius: Empire Rising. It can be said that Malachi is the game; he is the main reason why we click on every sensitive point of the screens and continue to play overlooking the various defects. Such a successful character is another success of author Jane Jensen, who made herself known and loved by gamers almost twenty years ago with the adventures of Gabriel Knight. After a hiatus from the mainstream market, the brilliant Jensen is back behind the scenes on new graphic adventures, such as Gray Matter and Cognition. Only now, however, with Moebius: Empire Rising, she returns as director, game designer and writer, supported in production by Pinkerton Studio and Phoenix Online Studios. But more than to his team, Jensen owes a great debt of gratitude to the backers who made the Moebius: Empire Rising Kickstarter campaign a success. At least they, according to what we read around, are satisfied with the result. We think the same way, but it is undeniable that something is wrong with this adventure. To understand what it is, we have to start from the beginning, i.e. from when Malachi is recruited by a mysterious organization known as FITA, which is responsible for protecting the events destined to repeat themselves in human history from those who would like to alter them for their own shady ends. A metaphysical thriller with a mysterious and elusive protagonist: Jane Jensen still scratches To each his role Moebius: Empire Rising is an interesting thriller with an international conspiracy at its core. The historical documentation provided throughout the game is detailed and plausible and is intertwined with esoteric theories that make the narrative more tantalizing, if a little tacky. The story asks us to be patient for a few hours waiting for it to find its rhythm, but once we get to the heart of the story, following Malachi's adventures around the world is a pleasure. Some twists are quite obvious, but the fact of moving between so many global scenarios relieves the story of the sporadic voltage drops. Too bad the cities look like reproductions of tourist postcards, with secondary characters ready to reinforce the clichs of the place. Overall though, the latitude shifts serve the story well and give a sense of spaciousness that compensates for the few screens devoted to each city. But much of the pleasure of Moebius: Empire Rising lies in the dialogues, especially Malachi's lines, beautifully rendered by his voice actor, and the protagonist's observations regarding external details. There is no piece of furniture, painting or decoration that escapes his analytical eye. On each occasion, Malachi perfectly frames the object in front of him and dismisses it with a few, precise words. During the adventure Malachi will also have to evaluate very special ancient finds or biographies of key characters. Our hero is in fact looking for new incarnations of historical archetypes, one of which he interprets himself, as he will discover during his investigations on behalf of FITA. These analyzes begin with the gathering of information. Once we have all the data we can access our smartphone and compare them to get to the final verdict. Each of these analyzes is also accompanied by numerous historical information which makes the investigations even more fascinating. The relative simplicity with which it arriveda solution is consistent with Malachi's skill and makes us feel even more like a sharp-minded genius. Another very satisfying game system is the profile that Malachi draws up at a glance of the people he meets. By choosing the appropriate icon from the command menu, we access a screen in which three possible answers are associated for each relevant detail of the person in front of us. If we get the meaning of every detail right we get bonus points and the possibility to take extra actions. Again this is an ability in line with the main character, which is reflected in almost every design choice. Adding a touch of technology and modernity to the adventure are smartphone functions, which we can use to call our contacts, search the Internet and analyze information. Everything happens in a guided and intuitive way: in short, these are those typical illusions of freedom that are always very popular in video games, but in this case they work very well. At this point you may be wondering what happened to the puzzles. We talk about this in the next paragraph, along with other aspects of the game that don't work. Style flaws At this point you will have understood that if we loved Moebius: Empire Rising it is thanks to its protagonist and the analysis sections of people and artifacts, very fascinating and out of the usual paths of graphic adventures. We therefore wonder if there was really a need to insert classic puzzles, considering how they were handled. Their banality is salutary for the story, which can proceed without running aground, always keeping us in motion. A bit like in the Telltale adventures. If anything, the problem is in the arrangement of the objects related to the puzzles. In order to safeguard verisimilitude, Malachi almost never puts what he finds in his pocket, but instead waits until he needs it. This means that we have to go through all the screens and then go back each time to get what we need. Unfortunately, it often happens that we anticipate the game on the type of puzzle that awaits us based on the objects seen, and this only makes having to retrace our steps even more tedious. To close there is then a final labyrinth, uninspired and placed there as if by chance, out of place with respect to the main dynamics of the game. Added to this are secondary characters who don't even come close to Malachi's depth and a technical realization that, despite the efforts, often leaves something to be desired, especially as regards the animations. We agree that for a graphic adventure it is not necessary to squeeze the processors, but in this case even a medium-level production would have benefited the narrative ambitions of Jane Jensen who, it should be reiterated, once again proves to be very capable. Despite the shadows, however, Moebius: Empire Rising won us over. He has a strong personality and remains interesting until the end, with some masterfully successful passages. If it had been more solid and refined, Moebius: Empire Rising could have aspired to become one of the most interesting adventures of the moment. In any case it deserves a chance, especially from the fans, with the hope that it will be the first chapter of a long series.", "date": "2014-05-02", "grade": "7.8"}
