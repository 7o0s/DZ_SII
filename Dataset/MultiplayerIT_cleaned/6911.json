Made by Ageod specialists, to whom we owe equally rich and complex titles such as Pride of Nations and Civil War II, it aims to represent the war scenario of the First World War in an extensive way. Information screens are plentiful Let's be clear right away: completely describing all its aspects and facets in a review is an impossible undertaking. We are faced with the classic turn-based strategy that requires a thousand evaluations before making each move, evaluations that translate into dozens of summary screens to be read, full of data on troops, territories, even on the weather conditions of the regions. In short, it is not a title designed for the masses, but for a competent niche of fans of the genre who know how to appreciate the charm of the details inherent in the numerical summaries and in shifts even many minutes long, spent looking at the monitor in the grip of indecision on what to do. Let's say that if we had to make a comparison with some other titles, it would be easy to think of some strategic ones from Paradox Interactive, even if in many ways Ageod's titles are even more extreme in not admitting compromises, starting from the tutorial and the manual. Unfortunately it is easy to see how the tutorial fails to introduce the game completely, as well as the manual, even if the latter offers many more details. Let's say that if you want to start dedicating yourself to serious strategists, it is better that you start from something simpler, or that you make up your mind to go and ask for advice on the official forums while you are in the learning phase. Sure, at least the texts on the screen could have made them more readable, because it's not that strategy enthusiasts all aspire to blindness, but they are details. Warring factions To End All Wars allows the player to take command of one of the great factions that took part in the conflict: the Central Powers, i.e. Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire; the eastern axis, formed by Russia, Serbia and Montenegro; finally the western axis, formed by France, Belgium and the United Kingdom. The map allows you to underline different elements Once the initial selection has been made, which also includes one of the four available campaigns, it is necessary to start managing the various aspects of the war, starting from the general plan which will be reflected on the entire course of the game (some general plans are taken from reality, while others are completely invented), to then devote himself to the real army, diplomacy and military research, i.e. the study of all the aspects that make up the game and which are used to try to get the better of the opponents. Depending on your level of proficiency with the genre, the icon-filled map of Europe may initially give you a severe headache or deeply excite you. The feeling is that of a tabletop wargame, even if it soon becomes clear that we are faced with something much broader in its playful vision. Let's say that a complete game of To End All Wars can last many hours and that the title can be replayed several times without problems, given that it is not possible to appreciate all its facets after finishing it the first time. Indeed, it is likely that reaching the end is the biggest incentive to replay it, perhaps by trying to change some of the dozens of configuration options, or by dedicating more time to aspects that were not considered in the previous game. For example, one campaign can focus on land troops, while in another you can make more use of naval troops and so on. The feasible examples are really many, also because there are dozens of different units available, but we hope you have a clear picture of the game. To End All Wars is a strategy game in the purest sense of the word. Find out in our review Interface and some problems Let's talk about the interface and say that it is in line with everything else: functional, complete and very complex. To fully master it you need some time and study of all the various keyboard shortcuts. Nothing that enthusiasts despise and, to be honest, once you get the hang of the controls, the various operations begin to perform naturally. Even the graphic representation can be defined as functional, in the purest sense of the term. Let's say that the map of Europe is not designed badly and some elements are of good quality, but it is certainly not in The End All Wars that you will find the ideal benchmark for your system. After a few hours of playing what seems incomprehensible will become crystal clear In general we would like to state that lovers of the strategia they won't pay much attention to it, but in any case the latest titles from Paradox Interactive remain a cut above this from a technical point of view, not only for the graphic beauty itself, but also for the general fluidity, here rather poor. Usually the side where Ageod's titles excel is the artificial intelligence of the opponents. The End All Wars does not deny the developer's fame: the CPU is able to manage its resources in a brilliant way, often putting the incautious strategist who thought he could easily win the war in difficulty. It's just a pity that sometimes it takes a long time for the computer to calculate its moves, a defect that is actually mitigated compared to other Ageod titles, but still present. Tired of playing against the CPU? It's time to face some human opponents. In honor of the genre and the developer's other titles, the multiplayer of To End All Wars is not played simultaneously, but in asynchronous turns that can be managed via email. Although it may seem an anachronistic choice, it is actually the only sensible way to allow online in a similar title without sacrificing its complexity. Otherwise, to play online simultaneously, you would have to program whole days to spend in front of the screen, forcing the participants to make their moves within a certain time; that would be absurd for a game that invites you to think about every choice and that is designed especially for those who don't like to rush things!", "date": "2014-09-16", "grade": "8.0"}
