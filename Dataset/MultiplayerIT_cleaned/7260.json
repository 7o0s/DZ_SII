Beyond sterile words full of marketing, betrayed expectations and sometimes too hasty promises, the facts are and always will be to demonstrate the truth and quality of the elements involved. From Software is not a young company but its key men are young, who have led it to be the ideal videogame representative of Japanese fantasy in the world. In an industry where serialization is the daily bread and the perverse mentalities of business cannot detach themselves from the massive exploitation of the usual intellectual properties, From Software has shown courage, winning - we want to be clear from the beginning - the challenge that its own fans they had imposed. After the announcement of the doubling of direction, no longer entrusted to the creator Hidetaka Miyazaki, we do not deny that in the past we have ideally taken part in that chorus of concern arising; the risk was to helplessly witness the qualitative downgrading of one of those titles (Dark Souls, to be precise) that defined and embellished the dying generation. And in a market where, in the progress of the game, there is practically no more satisfaction, the ~Souls saga~ is seen as a flame in the darkness that must never, for any reason, be extinguished. In the shadow of the press, Tomohiro Shibuya and Yui Tanimura took over the direction of the project more than two years ago, with only one goal: to take it to new heights and at the same time make it presentable even to players less accustomed to true hardcore gaming. Ours are sincere words of affection and esteem: Miyazaki could not find more reliable heirs. With Dark Souls II, From Software surpasses itself with a masterpiece of quality and quantity It's the little things... After Dark Souls, we mistakenly thought we had seen a good part of the ceiling that could be expressed by the saga: visibly larger and more branched than Demon's Souls, with substantial gameplay additions, more sidequests, more collectibles and consumables, pacts, new settings, backtracking. With innocence and shrewdness, Tanimura and Shibuya have chosen to go beyond the imaginable, finding a keystone capable of displacing even the accustomed to the saga, so as to create an aesthetically similar game substrate but in essence extremely different from Dark Souls . An absolutely brilliant idea in its simplicity but at the same time deeply rich in a change in the gameplay paradigm: limitation of the amount of enemy spawn. Mark our words, they will come back to you after all. Apparently it may seem a trivial element, but these are the tricks that distinguish a good production from an imperishable pearl. Let's face it clearly: Dark Souls is not a difficult title, or at least it is a concept of difficulty firmly anchored to an old, known, obvious, almost vintage play structure, or rather the so-called grinding, farming and leveling. Call it what you prefer: the concept of stopping at a point where the intersection of factors such as number of enemies, level design, experience deriving from single enemy and proximity of the respawn point (the bonfire) brings the relationship between time spent and potentially experience earnable to be as low as possible. The potential offered by Dark Souls to have an enemy park, always available, to collect souls opened the door to an intrinsic lowering of the bite and the ideological wall that was inevitably created in the face of certain bosses. A few hours of soul recovery and off we go, towards the next challenge. An approach that is not necessarily viable but still present, and therefore an integral part of the title. With a stroke of the brush all this is finally part of the past: in Dark Souls II, the two directors have chosen to set the number of maximum kills for an enemy to twelve. And the change is beautifully drastic. dark Ulysses Having placed a cap on the times you can use the same enemy to retrieve souls unleashes a bewildering number of consequences, all intertwined. The awareness of having a limited number of reappearances of enemies, to be fully exploited to level up, makes advancement a coexistence with a perennial mental sword of Damocles. The focus of not losing the accumulated souls for any reason will be fundamental; in the event of a double death without recovery, those souls will be gone forever. In the advanced game, the occasions in which you will travel to solitary places, as already cleared of enemies, will not be rare, and you will be forced, especially after passing the initial acclimatization phase, to continuously explore to look for new areas in which to grow and find new vent toneed for opponents. The progress between sections is structured to always put you in front of a boss higher than your growth rate; put aside once and for all the imbalances of the first Dark Souls, the clashes finally become, pad in hand, real moments of technical confrontation in which the skill of the fingers, the equipment strategy and the study of the patterns of the opponents become fundamental capabilities. With these premises it might seem paradoxical to discuss From Software's desire to broaden the user base. In reality, Dark Souls 2 enjoys many factors that make it much more digestible, refined and elegant than its illustrious predecessor. Elements such as the careful study of the level design, the arrangement of the bonfires, the possibility of equipping up to four rings and three weapons both on the right and on the left. Even the growth curve of the levels and experience required has been completely redesigned and made much smoother than the exponential one of Dark Souls. Having practically canceled perennial experience collection points, level advancement is a direct consequence. To make a comparison between the two chapters, following an ideal progression, in Dark Souls 2 you will reach level 100 about a third of the way through the game. To you the estimate. Breathtaking views Technically speaking, what is coming to an end has been an unfortunate generation for the Japanese, overshadowed by the Americans time and time again. It took five years, from that Demon's Souls of 2009, to finally see what From Software is able to do at the end of the generational cycle and the results are noticeable right from the start. The resolution plays a fundamental part: the native and fixed 720p give a clean, crystalline image, without smudges, guaranteeing high quality edges and textures even without applied anti-aliasing filters. If at all we marry the evergreen characteristic of the saga of using a full color palette, which varies decisively from oppressive cold to relaxing warm, and the polygonal modeling ability that has reached new heights thanks to the massive motion capture used, all that remains is to applaud the developer for the goal achieved. The price to pay is a consequent unlocked framerate which lowers the flow of frames with a certain constancy, resulting in a large part of the game just under 30 and only in special cases close to the many coveted 60 frames. Impossible to ask for more given the enormity of environments and artistic elements introduced but it remains a real shame as, when present, an update to 60 hertz is truly a splendid sight. We gladly spend a few more words on the shaders and textures used: in some situations, Dark Souls II is closer to the next gen than to the generation in the conclusion phase; the quality and beauty displayed by the surfaces and refractions are a huge step up from Dark Souls and help create even more immersion in exploration. On the other hand, the introduction of shadows in real time is only good: a pleasant addition but which denotes the now exceeded limit of old gen machines. Change of pace The legacy of the saga is vibrant and perfectly balanced between Demon's Souls and Dark Souls, offering a kind of fusion of the characteristics of each predecessor. As per Dark Souls tradition, the main hub is back where the non-player characters encountered during the adventure will gather and where you can then buy and improve equipment, make pacts and grow in experience. Yes, exactly: in pure Demon's Souls tradition, the ~Maiden in Black~ returns, this time in a decidedly brighter version, which will guide us and allow us to use souls to level up. The bonfire acquires unique peculiarities in Dark Souls II: thanks to the possibility of using the teleportation from the beginning, it becomes an immediate portal between the available macro-areas, divided according to the bonfires inside. Our dear flame will not only allow the return of enemies in the area but can be used as a brazier in which to throw specific objects to modify the characteristics: personal, such as enhancing the Estus flasks, or environmental, such as reinforcing the enemies in the surroundings. Another fundamental factor, breaking with the first chapter, concerns the ability of the bonfire to completely regenerate the wear and tear of the equipment; fortunately, it will therefore no longer be necessary to go back to the blacksmith to repair every comma, but only in the event of irreversible deterioration. The level design is, once again, an ideal marriage between the Dark Souls backtracking network and the direct worlds of Demon's Souls. To make exploration congenialand not dispersive, the two directors have chosen to create micro-environments for self-contained exploration, embellishing the sense of travel and satisfaction with even more crates to be found in the maze of Drangleic. And we are talking about a really long title, as the he game environment is equal if not superior to that of Dark Souls. It is with pleasure that we noticed the emphasis placed on inserting destructible scenery elements, such as explosive barrels, which sometimes revolutionize strategies in an unexpected way, or the importance of the torch that as new marathon runners you will be forced to carry to illuminate the sections darker, and maybe set off some triggers. Or overcome some puzzles since, as if that weren't enough, From Software has inserted small environmental puzzles to make progress even more difficult. Playstation 3 trophies Dark Souls II offers 38 trophies, divided into 12 Bronze, 23 Silver, 2 Gold and the obvious Platinum to complete. The focus of the team went on rewarding the defeat of bosses, the lighting of certain bonfires but also the recovery of unique equipment, i.e. belonging to the setting. There will be the recovery of spells, miracles and gestures with which to mock online players. Hands on pad Only experts will be able to notice some technical changes attributed to the animations of dodging, using the shield and hitting from behind. From has opted for a more punitive approach, as the frames of ~immortality~ linked to dodging with somersault have decreased, the same goes for the number of frames attributed to using the shield to block, now much lower and therefore to be taken into account for parades. Even the blow from behind has undergone changes: given the enemies' ability to move and attack in the round, it will not be easy to grasp the reduced angle of attack for the success of the action. The interface, the real flaw of the first episode, has been completely revised and improved, both in terms of direction and use. If the menu is opened, the view shifts the character to the right with a three-quarter cut, and unfolds the tables on the left, allowing simultaneous control of view, movement and navigation between the grids thanks to the cross-use of directional and analog of the inventory. The HUD, thanks to a specific option, finally disappears in an intelligent way, guaranteeing a clean visual picture in the absence of war inputs and instead maintaining it on the screen in the opposite case. The only, real defect related to the controls is attributable to the automatic viewfinder, triggered by pressing the right analog: the lock is deficient, poorly calculated in distances and consequently difficult to manage. We hope it will be fixed with an update as soon as possible. Curiosity In creating his hardcore creature, Hidetaka Miyazaki was inspired by his own masochistic characteristics. In conceiving Dark Souls, the Japanese designer based the difficulty and the punishing approach exclusively on the basis of what he wanted from a video game: initial frustration - many new attempts - final satisfaction. Who knows if, in directing the sequel, Tanimura and Shibuya based themselves on the same perverse instincts... Connected worlds The online has always been a fundamental element of the saga: since the dawn of the messages left on the ground to warn of traps or bosses up to continuing in the natural evolution of the Covenant, or pacts, invariably returned in all its glory. Again, the influence from the past is felt. Just like in Demon's Souls, in Dark Souls II From Software has rightly opted for a triumphant return to dedicated servers, tools capable of guaranteeing a reliable online experience even for the less fortunate and not marred by the ~peer to peer~ of the first chapter. The PvP element, present here, is instead taken from Artoryas' DLC, and will therefore also allow followers of the same pact to engage in battles in dedicated sections. The vision of the Pacts has remained on the known standards, with the ability of each player to follow or not a creed, invade other worlds and be invaded, always with the aim of increasing their reputation to access new benefits. Instead, what has definitely improved is the character editor: not so much for the available classes, decreased from ten to eight with the addition, however, of the double swordsman, but for the amount of customization options available, now finally equal to the standards required. Given the nature of the title, it will be difficult to enjoy your character in human form, but those few times it is nice to present yourself to others in maximum aesthetic splendor.", "date": "2014-03-11", "grade": "9.3"}
