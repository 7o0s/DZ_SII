{"name": "WRC II Extreme", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wrc-ii-extreme-2.html", "text": "Don't stop, baby don't stop Among the merits of the first episode, the one with the greatest impact was the graphic layout, especially as regards the extension of the field of vision and more generally of the race theater settings; obviously, the Evolution Studios programmers have worked in order to confirm this feature also in this sequel, so much so that WRC 2 Extreme is aesthetically superior to its predecessor from practically every point of view. The aforementioned visual extension still represents the strong point of the graphic sector of the SCEE production, whose goodness is revealed in an almost brutal way during the replays; in fact, on the occasion of shooting from the helicopter, the emotion engine chews up entire square kilometers without any hesitation, literally leaving the player speechless. WRC 2 Extreme represents an excellent example of the technical potential of Ps2 also as regards the modeling of cars and settings; the racing cars reproduced by the team of programmers are in fact very faithful to the real counterparts, with an impressive wealth of detail. Through the windows it is possible to scrutinize the pilot and navigator, capable of movements absolutely adherent to reality and appreciable to a greater extent on the occasion of the shots from inside the cockpit. Despite all these merits, however, the graphic aspect of WRC 2 Extreme also leaves room for some criticism, especially as regards the definition of some textures; this problem which, together with the use of a slightly ~dull~ and opaque color palette, significantly penalizes the SCEE title on more than a few occasions. On the other hand, the reproduction of atmospheric events is excellent, while the clouds, both of dust and snow, that the cars leave behind as they pass leave some doubts. A trip at 250km/h However, where Evolution Studios has concentrated its efforts is in pure and simple playability, and the results can be seen: WRC 2 Extreme in fact represents in all respects the best videogame reproduction of the behavior of a rally car. Controlling one of the numerous four-wheelers available is a real joy, thanks to a realistic and satisfying driving model, capable of returning the real sensations in their entirety; the physics of the cars is practically perfect, as is their response to the different types of road surfaces present. Furthermore, the splendid sensation of speed does nothing but add adrenaline and pathos to the game sessions, thus bringing the SCEE production to the top of the genre. Nonetheless, WRC 2 Extreme is by no means a perfect title, above all because of the questionable collision and damage management system: the Evolution Studios programmers seem to have concentrated above all on the behavior of the car, practically flawless, leaving however in the background marginal elements at first sight but in reality important in the overall economy of the game. The far from infrequent contact with the edges of the track (be they barriers, rock walls and so on) can in fact in most cases cause an unrealistic spin of the car, even if in reality the angle of impact should have carry no more than a scuff of the bodywork. What may appear as a minor detail turns out to be a decidedly frustrating aspect, especially in rallies  such as Corsica  where the lane is narrow and contacts are numerous. Being on the verge of cents and having to redo a stage because the car stuck to the guard rail turning on itself, we can assure you that it's not the best... Furthermore, more often than not you can find yourself completely stuck even in the face of very surmountable obstacles , such as a small rock no more than 15 cm high. The same, little attention has also been paid to the management of the damage to the cars, really light years behind what was seen in Colin Mc Rae Rally 3; in fact, the cars seem almost indestructible, so much so that before seeing some broken glass or a dented door it is necessary to make several leaps into the void into precipices or ravines. For this reason, the repair phase of the damage in the pits is never a problem, since there is all the time necessary to put your racing car to new condition. An awkward and poorly intuitive menu interface complete the list of defects of what remains the best rally on Ps2. Finally, the excellent sound should be mentioned, especially as regards the perfect reproduction of the engines and mechanical noises, such as the engagement of gears or over-revving; anonymous instead the accompaniment arero, fortunately limited to replays only. Comment The defects to be corrected on the first WRC were really numerous; fortunately, Evolution Studios has done its job almost flawlessly, so much so that WRC 2 Extreme is undoubtedly the best exponent of the genre on Ps2. The splendid reproduction of the car's behavior and the excellent driving sensation are in fact the best quality aspects of the SCEE production, which nevertheless does not reach perfection due to missteps in the aspects relating to collisions and damage management. Pros The best rally simulation on console Unparalleled driving sensation Exhilarating, rewarding and refined Excellent reproduction of the roar of the engines Cons Collision system to be reviewed Bad damage management Frustrating at times About a year ago, Evolution Studios made its debut on Ps2 with World Rally Championship (WRC), a title with high potential but which turned out to be plagued by numerous problems; among the many, we recall a very little sensation of speed, a behavior of the cars that is not always realistic and a reproduction of the roar of the engines that is truly ridiculous, more similar to the noise of a fake moped than to that of a 300 horsepower four-wheeler. The margins for improvement were therefore decidedly wide, but SCEE's faith in the project has always been evident, so much so that work for the sequel was immediately started; now, with the definitive version in hand, we can undoubtedly say that this trust has been amply repaid.", "date": "2002-12-27", "grade": null}
