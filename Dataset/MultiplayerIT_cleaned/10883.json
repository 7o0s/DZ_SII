{"name": "F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fear-2-project-origin-recensione.html", "text": "We wander through a dripping tunnel, covered in damp junk and bricks. A group of clone troopers advance under cover, while anthropomorphic creatures scurry along the vents and across the ceiling. We try to eliminate the former, illuminating the dark corners we hunt for the latter. The very instant of the attack we slow down time, we start a dance that leaves corpses and debris on the ground to then restore the sensation of never finally being alone: it is a shadow that moves in the background, that has just around the corner? Oh again. 30 Minutes of Overlay Now close to the objective, the pathfinder agent of the F.E.A.R. (Contact, reconnaissance and assault in situations characterized by paranormal activity) sends Commander Rowdy Betters the evidence of the guilt of the director of Armacham Tech Corporation (ATC), Genieve Aristide, guilty of having conceived and directed a project of forced confinement and exploitation of a child with exceptional psychic powers, Alma Wade, used as the parent of human prototypes (Project: Origin) able to telepathically guide selected divisions of cloned soldiers (Project: Perseus). Then, he plunges into the basement of the headquarters, where the young woman has been imprisoned in a state of cryostasis. A few minutes later, escaping the demons unleashed by Alma's rancor, now freed and in the throes of an irreversible vengeful reaction, the man finally manages to get out. Shortly thereafter, a nuclear explosion embraces him, and fills his mouth with a kiss full of dust. We are in the final minutes of the original F.E.A.R.. Let's go back 30 minutes, all of this has yet to happen. Across town, a team from the Delta Force counterterrorism division is making its way to Genive's penthouse with a warrant for her arrest, the immediate consequence of sending that evidence. It is here that we possess the soul of Michael Becket, the group's top soldier. The order is to keep her in custody, but for now, Aristde's tense face at the moment of capture mixes with the dirty air that can be glimpsed igniting behind the windows, while invisible smoky arms capable of lifting skyscrapers up to the clouds are evoked by an immense atomic detonation. Alma must be stopped (and this paragraph will probably serve you even after finishing the game to remind you why you accepted this task). Wandering Soul The development of the plot proceeds by alternating in-game sequences experienced in first person, with and without control of the character, and text logs, which we find in the middle of the rooms we walk through, to read on the PDA. Opening the PDA means summoning a menu, exiting Becket. We tend to ignore it, read everything at once, try to keep it in mind. After several minutes, we struggle to remember the less evident details and, honestly, who they are and what intentions all these groups and stereotyped characters have. In the meantime, Alma allows herself to be admired, and as if she were playing with a mouse, she strangles us but without really wanting to kill us, is it enough... a Quick Time Event to push her away? He prefers to watch our easy struggle for survival. The concept on which our fear should be based is evident: how can we oppose a little girl who kills only with her own presence? Yet the question quickly changes: since it never becomes a real threat to our safety, why fear it? Are we still so sensitive to a bloodline, to the dear old mutilated mannequin, to the umpteenth hallucination with open eyes, to the little girl who wanders slowly with her hair in front of her face, to the infantile litany? Especially when represented in such a pimping and not tragic and visceral way? How many times can you use the same formula and hope that the public is affected by it? F.E.A.R. 2 in this he is like a cowardly and cumbersome boxer, who constantly fakes the blow but never throws it, so why cover your eyes and feel imprisoned in a state of tension? You can't try to terrorize, and be lenient in doing so. You cannot try to cause horror, and be insincere in displaying those shameful perversions by which you, the author, first, are attracted and terrified. Little Boy, Little Girl As director Miike Takashi recalled at the release of Dead or Alive 2: Birds, ~making a sequel is an insult to the original film, because the producers think that we can make a better film than the first for less money. When the first film has success, you immediately think about making a sequel. A sequel is a project that is always based on a negative way of thinking~. A purely commercial exploitation of the success of the original, that's what a second episode is for the client. How does a creative entity who receives the commission to imagine and make it react? He operates a violent denial of those dynamics, he distorts them with the instrument of art. ~When I was offered to do the sequel~, he concluded, ~I saw an opportunity to resist, to rebel, not to make a sequel as a sequel, it was an opportunity to change things~. Isn't it with this sincere disgust for superficiality that the most convincing works following an original were born, such as Silent Hill 2, Fallout 2, Shadow Of The Colossus, Half-Life 2, Terminator 2, Alien 2? F.E.A.R. 2 immediately reveals its dark soul. There is a lack of sincerity and the courage to dare, the rebellion against trivializing dynamics, the strategies designed to ~work~ with the mass public, the acceptance of the creative challenge. The birth of Alma takes place when the American industry discovers the role of the Japanese onryo (spirits of the dead, capable of returning to influence the physical world for revenge, often women with long black hair in front of their faces) and hastily saturated the West of this peculiar treatment of the genre, sold under the label of J-Horror. Furthermore, what defines her is now even more explicit: a girl with psionic powers who embodies a weapon of mass destruction is the shadow of Akira. Perhaps the fear of a ~Little Boy~ (Girl) who escapes the control of his creator by annihilating within his own borders all life on the greatest spatial extent in the shortest possible time still works in America. Today, it is probable. Surely, this is the most trivial way to elaborate it. Dying of Fear? Or Fear of Dying? No, it's more like killing After a few hours, it will take about ten in total, the feeling reigns of living two different experiences that continue in parallel like lines that try to meet without ever joining, but only sporadically cross. On the one hand we are actors in frenetic and direct shootings, which act on a ~physical~ level, on the other we are spectators of constant apparitions which try to affect us on a psychological level and do not convince, they repeat themselves as if they were distributed by a machine programmed to release them periodically and forge them all identical. We look at horror, but we don't live it. If the second component immediately becomes painless, the first turns out to be the least bland ingredient of a well-prepared dish. From behind the filter of a rich HUD, the clashes are perceived as tense, and totally frontal. Artificial intelligence is certainly excellent and incredibly versatile for any environment: in the frequent narrow spaces it seems to react more aggressively, preferring direct assaults rather than outflanking and cover tactics, and in fact pushes us to frequent use of slow-motion. This slowdown is still the main mechanism in the action, it underlines the explosions of blood and embarrassment in critical moments, but it's never really necessary and it shows that it doesn't have the freshness it once did, it pushes F.E.A.R. to portray itself as a game built generically on top of a couple of archaic and derivative mechanisms, and the quality of the fun does not rise above a certain height. Many shootouts end with the use of only one weapon to choose from a more than varied arsenal. After the classic semi-automatic projectile weapons, the most effective ones become science fiction ones (except for the excellent automatic shotgun), from lasers to nail guns, up to the cannon that releases disintegrating charges. A Thor's hammer against the few types of antagonists we meet (let's still say that some will be ~unique encounters~), but each useful to eliminate one in particular - The laser is basically perfect for those who become invisible, grenades are perfect if cooked for groups, the missile launcher is the only asset against the bots. And there is plenty of ammunition, have as much fun as you like, never touched the pistol, which can no longer be doubled in dual wield. In the most difficult moments the cover system, that is to create shelters by overturning furniture with the square button, offers us the time to choose how best to defend ourselves and gives the highly destructible scenarios, much improved in detail and variety compared to what was seen in the original, albeit quite obvious, a new level of interaction (and consequently, a more active role for the scenography than that linked to their choreographic destructiveness). Even in this case, however, we find that we can do without it and prefer the impact to prudence, or, if anything, to defend ourselves against a few steps backwards. Particular, that of destructibility, which finds its climax in the sequences in which we drive a war exoskeleton, capable of pushing the direct confrontation to theextremes of linearity and violence. Only then appear huge robots armed to the teeth, what timing! Enough, But It Doesn't Advance We were saying, finally the scenarios vary, even if they remain unoriginal. We welcome the school (the most detailed and complete), the sewers, the subway, the streets between the ruined buildings on fire. Yet they are so detailed, they rarely stop being evocative. F.E.A.R. 2 is a game with a long pre-production, and it boldly shows it in some glimpses, together with its cinematic nature. And it also proves that, no matter how much we've said against it, it works well for what there is, that if that's enough for you, you'll definitely like it. It is surprising, given their quality, that the technology however proves to be so fluctuating: a fluid control system with excellent animations and particle effects are opposed in contrast to a constantly tired framerate, really low resolution textures and some polygonally not very complex objects, to which is added a rich but somewhat standard sound sector of music and effects. All this suggests why it is impossible to remove the strong noise filter, so necessary to hide and very little useful to the atmosphere. A detail that swings between realistic and poorly finished (that is, we don't understand which of the two) appears to be our walking movement: it seems to move like an automaton, and on sprints, stamina is really limited. The multiplayer experience is faster, here a decidedly classic accessory, but in which one mode stands out: Fronte Armato. It is the improvement of the old Conquest mode: you need to secure five key points on the map, and you can also use turrets and mecha exoskeletons in the process. The trick is to have to do it in a forced sequence, and the ability to bring up a minimap of the scheme in the foreground will certainly be useful for orientation. Probably, if you miss a co-op mode, it will prove to be a sufficient diversion to share with someone. The system is linked to a subdivision into types of soldier - depending on the starting weapons - to be chosen at the beginning of the sessions. The choice is linked to a points system which, once accumulated, can be spent to invest in new types, which have more powerful weapons. Unfortunately, the lack of bots and testers did not give us the opportunity to test it thoroughly: for this reason, we invite you to follow the discussion on our forum in the next few days. Comment In all fairness, F.E.A.R. 2 presents itself both as a clumsy failure in trying to make an impressive, incisive and memorable experience, but also as a clean action blockbuster, focused on the direct firefight, capable of working well in the little it offers and unfortunately, all interior, only decorated with mildly horror wallpaper. If only F.E.A.R. 2, in addition to an Alma, had a soul... Pros Improved interaction with scenarios The opposing AI ensures challenging matchups Varied, detailed and evocative scenarios... Against ...but predictable a synthesis of mechanics completely derived from the past Stereotypical plot and theme Low quality textures and slowdowns, particularly in the PS3 version", "date": "2009-02-10", "grade": null}
