Koei, the parent company that deals with its production, has been able to create a brand with a strong characterization and with a completely personal style, both from an aesthetic and gameplay point of view. The great success at home, combined with the characteristic conservative tendency of the Japanese, however, has led the game to have very few evolutions along its evolution through countless chapters and spin-offs. The latest game dedicated to Dynasty Warriors has just come out, it's a stand-alone expansion of the sixth chapter and it's called Empires. The empire strikes again The desire to innovate and change something in the now too old and abused gaming system can already be seen from the first presentation and from the new look of the menus, in which the classic scrolling list is finally abandoned in favor of a modern and captivating design. Unfortunately, once the game has started, we have to go back down to earth and see that the desire to turn the page was evidently not enough in the developers Omega Five: Empire is the usual Dynasty Warriors. For those not accustomed to the series, it is a hack'n slash of pure action in which, immersed in a context of war, we must advance with our character and army to conquer the areas controlled by the enemies. The setting takes up that of Greater China during the Three Kingdoms, where the territory was fragmented by many small fiefdoms controlled by Warlords, commanders, army lieutenants. The aim of the game is therefore to reunify the state by invading all the occupied areas and defeating the bosses who control them. There are dozens and dozens of characters to choose from and to unlock: each of them has specific characteristics, just like in a role-playing game, which must be upgraded and increased over time. By fighting, you continually learn new combos and new moves, even if unfortunately using one or the other doesn't make much difference in battle, regardless of the different choreography performed. Ironically, Dynasty Warriors 6 Empire (just like its predecessors), can be carried forward simply by slashing with the main attack button, always being careful to recover energy if we find ourselves in crisis, sporadically helped by special attacks and warriors Musou. Compared to the main episode, a strategic component has been added in Empire: you can choose to be a ~Ruler~ or an ~Officier~; in the first case we can give orders to our army based on the territories we want to attack, in the second case we have to obey the commands of the Ruler, and by leveling up we can go so far as to advise our superior some strategy. There is always a base to defend, and others to attack and conquer. The main strategy also lies in knowing how to balance our army between attack and defense, so as not to be overwhelmed but still be able to conquer the enemy. Xbox 360 goals Dynasty Warriors 6 Empires, like its predecessors, sweats its 1000 points available to the player. Most of the achievements are achieved by increasing the power ups of the various characters, taking them to very high levels. Still others by unlocking a large number of items and weapons. Then there are many objectives linked to specific actions to be performed in battle, never simple and immediate: it will be hard to conquer every single objective of the Koei game. The Dynasty is conservative Regardless of the choice of territories to attack and the organization of the battle, the game system and gameplay remain identical to all the other chapters of the series. You make your way through hundreds of opponents by slashing and charging energy for special shots: through the Musou bar, once filled, you can unleash choreographic and very powerful combos and attacks. We can also unlock special abilities, such as riding, evading attacks, rolling, etc. During the battles it is also possible to find items, upgrades and weapons on the ground, which can also be purchased through the various shops and wayfarers that we find moving from Kingdom to Kingdom through the game map. Another interesting addition of this expansion is the use of editable and customizable characters: there are hundreds of weapons, equipment, clothes to use to create our perfect warrior to throw into the fray. This element does not change the substance of a comma, but it is alwaysand satisfying to see ~our~ character in battle. In Empire there are no secondary modes, mini-games, special options: it is exclusively the single player campaign. While proving to be very long (almost infinite if you decide to level up all available characters), the overall completeness of the game does not benefit from this limiting choice. There is multiplayer for up to two players, but offline. However, there is a single, full-bodied extra: the game encyclopedia. It is essentially a leisure activity, a reading of all the stories of the characters, insights into battles, territories, history, all very accurate and in-depth: for fans it will take time to read everything. Moving on to the graphics sector, however, there is very little to say: the settings are always very bare and hastily created, mostly recycling elements from the previous chapters. Obvious pop-ups are unpleasant to observe, in this decidedly low-detail context. The character design of the characters is always very nice, but it would take an update to the animations that are once again the same. We note an improvement in artificial intelligence and a slight increase in difficulty: already setting on ~Normal~ it will not be uncommon to die in the famous melees to which Dynasty Warriors has accustomed us. The soundtrack is evocative at times, but most of the time it feels too repetitive, even if in the important moments it still manages to underline the gameplay.", "date": "2009-07-23", "grade": "6.0"}
