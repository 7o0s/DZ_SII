{"name": "I Fantastici 4 e Silver Surfer - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/i-fantastici-4-e-silver-surfer-recensione.html", "text": "Let's say I'm the rubber man and you're the human candle The videogame Fantastic 4 and the Silver Surfer is - pad in hand and vision of the film archived - a very free adaptation of the homonymous film being screened these days at the cinema. Taking a cue from the news of the arrival of the silver surfer, Visual Concepts have built a very broad, varied and above all more rhythmic story than the film, to adapt to the media represented by the video game. The game takes its first steps inside a cave lost in the jungle, Reed (Mr. Fantastic) and his team have discovered a mysterious force coming from this place and therefore decide to investigate. The Fantastic 4 and Silver Surfer offers a very simple game scheme, bordering on monotony, in which the four superheroes explore different environments (ranging from caves, to deep space passing through New York) fighting all the enemies that constantly appear in front of them . In addition to the classic third-person action game scheme mixed with scrolling beat 'em up elements, the game also offers special flight sessions of the torchman, useful for breaking up the pace of the game but which also become too repetitive after a while. Taking up a concept dear to two other video games based on superheroes (X-Men Legend and Marvel Ultimate Alliance), the entire gameplay of the fantastic 4 revolves around the possibility of using all four characters and thus exploiting the power that best suits the situation . If on paper this element could bring a strategic aspect to the whole adventure, in fact the only moments in which we find ourselves ~forced~ to change characters are those in which the game forces the player to pass certain sections with a specific power of a member of the quartet or, even worse, when your character is dead and you are rightfully redirected to another. The reality of the facts is that the four characters, despite having skills of a different nature, are more or less suitable for certain situations: Reed and his invisible woman are the weakest and least versatile fighters, often and willingly used only to overcome particular sections that require the use of their powers (such as pressing overhead pulses, or moving objects with telekinesis); the Thing and the human Torch are the best choice to face the large number of enemies present in the game, the first especially for hand-to-hand combat while the second is very useful in the battle ~lightening~ phase, or in cases where it is absolutely necessary hit and run to give your teammates time to recover from the rigors of battle. Super simple super moves The game will not end until all four heroes find themselves without energy at the same time, and if during the levels it is possible to recover it only by breaking particular objects present in the setting, which release special coins bearing the effigy of the team, when one of the fantastic four ends up knocked down, just wait a few seconds for this - rested - to regain full control of his body and his energy, ready to restart the fight; this is one of the elements to take into account when you take part in the battle with the end-of-level bosses or find yourself in a room facing dozens and dozens of enemies: more often than not it will be enough to run around the stage avoiding the enemies to give time to companions to recover from apparent ~death~. One of the strengths of this Fantastic Four, Rise of the Silver Surfer is undoubtedly the quick accessibility to the various special moves of each hero: simply pressing the right backbone R2 opens the interface dedicated to attack powers (four for each character), while with that of the L2 left backbone the fusion attacks are activated. These last attacks are precisely called fusion because they allow the player to combine the powers of the character currently in use with another power chosen from among those of the other three companions; obviously these powers are far more powerful because they actually mix two elements doubling their power, also consuming twice as much psychic energy. Part of the group's special powers and Johnny's flight sections have been implemented for the PS3 version which, thanks to the presence of the sensor in the sixaxis, gives players the possibility to ~feel~ the flight of the torch and increase the destructive power of some moves simply by ~tilt~ with the pad. Parallel to the game levels, it is possible between one stage and another to increase the skills of the fantastic four thanks to the experience gained inand the fights outdated, the capabilities that can be increased vary from purely generic ones (such as the recovery time in the event of death), up to the enhancement of particular special moves, in order to specialize on one's favorite shots. Super simple super moves The substance of the game, unfortunately, is all here: too often it all comes down to a continuous and inconclusive pressing of keys, while you run around the stage waiting for your teammates to recover and above all for the psychic energy bar of the protagonist in use recharges, to allow the player to fire another burst of special moves. The levels chase each other with monotony and boredom, too similar in the game structure and even in the characterization of the settings. Graphically Fantastic Four, Rise of the Silver Surfer however remains above average: animations, particle effects, and textures combine to create a good atmosphere that follows quite faithfully that of the film, in the same way as dubbing, music and sound effects. Fantastic 4 and the Silver Surfer isn't a bad game, but it has the fault of being terribly monotonous. The combat sections take up a good 90%, the remainder is made up of flying with the human torch and very short puzzle sections. The game therefore certainly represents a good experience for fans of the comic and of the film, a title sufficient for all those who want to spend a couple of hours using the powers of the fantastic four but an avoidable product for those looking for a solid and varied action game. Pros: They are still the Fantastic 4. Valid graphics and sound sector. Cons: Too repetitive and monotonous too soon. Very uninteresting extras. Fantastic Four and the Silver Surfer is available on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and PlayStation 2. The tested version is the PlayStation 3 version. After thwarting the criminal plan underway by Doctor Doom (or Doctor Doom, as you prefer), The Fantastic Four, true and unique catalysts of cosmic misfortune, find themselves entangled in the threat deriving from the arrival on Earth of the Silver Surfer, a metallic alien who he is tasked with destroying planets to save his own. These are the foundations from which the new Fantastic Four film begins, and these - with the necessary modifications - are also the foundations of the official video game developed by Visual Concepts (certainly best known for the acclaimed NHL and NBA brands of 2K Games). The four superheroes are back on the console in a game with strong action hues, will they be able to be ~fantastic~ in a video game? To the superpowers of the editor the arduous sentence.", "date": "2007-06-26", "grade": null}
