{"name": "Impossible Creatures", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/impossible-creatures.html", "text": "God creates them, man modifies them Year 1947, we take on the role of Rex Chance, a famous adventurer and war reporter. We have spent our lives exploring wild places like Africa, the frozen wastes of Antarctica and the Amazon rainforest. Obviously you have met every type of wild beast that populates the earth, indeed, that populates the earth A few days ago we received a letter from our father, with whom we had long since lost all contact, Dr. Eric Chanikov, who inexplicably disappeared many Years ago. We hadn't heard from him since then and suddenly his request came to meet us. From this moment the problems will begin, from the moment we board the plane that will take us to the Variatas Islands, in the South Pacific, where our father continues his research on behalf of the wealthy industrialist Upton Julius. Once we reach our destination we will discover many things and from that moment we will see some good ones... This is the beginning of the story that will therefore put us in the shoes of this experienced adventurer in search of his missing father. The narration is based on a series of static black and white screens that will recount each discovery and follow the deeds of the protagonist from mission to mission. This system, in my opinion very apt, adds that ~50s~ atmosphere that fits perfectly with the setting of the game. In addition to the black and white narrative screens there will also be fully animated screens with the same engine as the game, which often take you directly to the battlefield. A feast for the eyes.. Lately we often talk about graphics in these latest generation Rts, see C&C General where the new graphic restyling speaks for itself. By now most of the manufacturers point to a great improvement from a graphic point of view, switching to a 3D engine. Also in this case IC is no different, the world is animated by a good graphics engine capable of moving a very large number of units very well while remaining fluid and fast. The maps, entirely three-dimensional, are rich in detail and very varied, passing from the cold arctic expanses, to the warm and humid tropical forests, all with different fauna and flora. The animals, the real protagonists of the game, are perfectly animated and even the textures that make them up are clean and well colored. The feature that first catches the eye is the definition and attention to detail of each individual creature, and it is a real joy for the eyes to be able to zoom in on a group of animals in movement to be able to admire their fluid and very real movements . A little less attention to detail of the characters but still at good levels. Graphically it is nothing striking, while remaining very accurate, it gives that impression of ~already seen~. The only point against it is the almost absence of the soundtrack, in fact there are only clips that start every time your creatures enter combat. On the contrary, in the main menu of the game and during the creation of units, there is a singular composition, always remaining in the style of the 50s, creating a bizarre and unreal atmosphere, but truly effective. The sound effects emitted by the animals are really realistic, making up for the lack (or choice) of the soundtrack. Create and give life to infinity.. But what makes this game so original? I'll explain it to you right away by starting to talk about SIGMA technology As already explained, this technology will give you the possibility to create mutated animals, but how does it work in practice? The creator (combiner), is the machine that completes the union between two animals, creating the project of a hybrid creature. This is the area that will keep you busy for a very long time, where you will decide both on the combinations to make and on the tactics to use. And the fulcrum of the game is precisely in the combinations, 50 animals that can be combined into more than 40,000 monstrous creatures, ranging from melee units to real artillery units. In addition, each creature has its own natural abilities, such as flight, fury, poison, acute senses or even group hunting. A large part of the abilities of the various animals is connected to each anatomical part of their body, the head, the torso, the forelimbs, the lower limbs, the tail and finally the wings. After the creation you will have to produce your units through a precise structure that depends on the type of animal to be produced, the animals with wings will be produced in the aviaries, the amphibious or aquatic ones in the water chambertica and so on... The costs are based on the only two resources in the game, electricity and coal, varying according to the power of each creature. A good strength are also the available upgrades, in fact you can improve any aspect of your favorite little beast, for example you can increase the damage inflicted in close combat, the damage at a distance, the hit points, the speed and the sight. The style of play is very reminiscent of the first (only the first? N.d. Matt) C&C where the number of units mattered more than anything else, also in this case it will be much more effective to use a disproportionate number rather than a small number of chosen troops for targeted attacks (see Warcraft III), making each battle very chaotic but just as fun. All in all, it's not bad even under the ~strategic~ profile of the game, thanks to the numerous combinations you can adopt any type of tactic, going from guerrilla tactics with melee units or espionage tactics using stealth units, to real naval warfare using powerful amphibious or aquatic animals. Tigron I want you! What shouldn't be missing from this title to make it a must-have for any type of user? Obviously, the multiplayer mode which, by now, is inserted as a means of infinitely multiplying the longevity of a game. Looking at the main screen you can understand that it is particularly designed for multiplayer challenges, in fact a special area has been inserted where you can create your army of units and then use them when and where you want. Those who don't want to create their own army can still play using preset combinations or even use the combinations of key characters in the story. The games are created on a special server created by Microsoft, very similar to the famous Battle net, giving the possibility to create and play games from 2 to 6 players and registering the results on a site dedicated to this (IC Stats). The final words What to say more? The Relics have done an excellent job, perhaps not technically spectacular (although accompanied by pleasant and tidy graphics) but creating an original and at the same time well-studied and calibrated strategy, which will be able to offer hours and hours of pure fun to every type of user. Who knows if this title will be able to break through the most famous games from Westwood (wave the white tissues please... sniff, N.d Matt) and Blizzard... Pros The most original RTS released so far Infinite combinations between creatures increasing longevity Clean and very accurate graphics Cons Lack of a persistent soundtrack Character textures not very accurate Mom! A flying donkey! Well yes, thanks to this new and extravagant game, even donkeys will be able to fly. The title in question is Impossible Creatures, produced by Relic Entertainment thanks to the collaboration of Microsoft Games Studios, which offers us one of the most original real-time strategy games ever seen. In fact, the game will take you into the world of genetic mutation and, in particular, will give you the possibility of controlling a technology that makes possible the genetic combination of two animals, thus obtaining a new creature. This technology will make you real ~mad scientists~ capable of giving life to these genetically modified animals, preserving the best characteristics and peculiarities of each animal, ignoring the disadvantages. This way you can make an elephant agile and fast or even give it the ability to fly! As an idea it is very original, the genes of Relic have struck again, after the masterpiece of Homeworld they have decided to give a change to the genre, bringing with them a very promising title from all points of view. But let's continue in order, let's continue with ... the story ...", "date": "2003-03-03", "grade": null}
