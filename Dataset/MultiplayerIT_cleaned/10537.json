Despite an excellent variety of genres, even in spite of a control system that is not very easy to manage in the design phase, that of puzzle games is predictably one of the strongest drifts on the iPhone, with several quality exponents and a continuous search for solutions that can combine the touch screen with the necessary ease and speed of use. Enigmo 2, developed by a veteran of the game on Apple platforms such as Pangea Software, therefore does not arrive like a bolt of lightning, continuing on the path already traced by its predecessor and going up against a good number of competitors but still managing to have more than something to to say. Let's get physic(al) The game fits into the deep groove of physics-based puzzle games, asking you to channel water, a laser beam or plasma from time to time that come out of the appropriate sources up to the collection container, accumulating a given amount of points to then go to the next level. The idea is very immediate and the goal is very clear every time, a pity that with the succession of schemes what initially appears as a simple matter of placing in space the tools useful for redirecting the flows of the three substances to be managed, becomes a nightmare made of walls, buttons and seemingly impossible situations. Enigmo 2 is therefore a difficult game, with a fairly steep learning curve after a couple of levels designed to get carried away, and equally satisfying, with lots of ideas expressed and a lively feeling of satisfaction every time you manage to come to head of one of the proposed challenges. So if it were only for the idea, the quantity and the study of the mechanics, the latest from Pangea Software would be an indisputable must have, unfortunately however for a series of positive elements there are others much less convincing, above all the control system. If the selection and movement of the elements useful for interacting or changing the direction of water, plasma or laser beams is not excessively complex and with a little practice it can be done quite easily, the same cannot be said of the view: zoom, rotate and interact around each of the complex structures placed in the game space is necessary given the three-dimensionality of the gameplay - novelty of this second chapter - but often made complex beyond all tolerability due to the little and not very precise reactivity of the two-finger system, so much to systematically prevent the success of the operations you would like to perform. The problem is obviously not of the device since similar problems have been brilliantly solved by titles such as Star Defense, and is accentuated here by a system of menus and buttons that is not exactly stratospheric. Visually, the focus was on clarity, with the structures clearly showing the individual elements that compose them - in short, nothing to mask the editor used to create them - and a style that is not exactly charming but not annoying either, letting the technical aspect focus on the physics, perhaps a little distorted in the case of water but always coherent.
