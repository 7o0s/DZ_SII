{"name": "The Outer Worlds", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-recensione.html", "text": "Obsidian has been playing the same game for years. It is as if he had a formula closed in a safe around which he builds each of his titles, so much are some of the traits common to all of them recognisable. Obviously, sometimes she took more space to experiment (Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer, Alpha Protocol, Pillars of Eternity 2), while other times she chose the path that gave her the most certainty of bringing home the result. As we will see in the course of the review of The Outer Worlds, the title belongs to this second category, in the sense that it invents absolutely nothing neither in the context of the genre to which it belongs, that of first-person action role-playing games, nor among the productions of Obsidian itself. Many have seen in The Outer Worlds the possible spiritual sequel to Fallout: New Vegas, another title from the American developer, not straying too far from the truth. It is difficult to say how the game was conceived, but we imagine that the disappointment of the fans for Fallout 4 and for some compromise solutions compared to New Vegas, has not been secondary in the decision to create a title that follows part of the structure of what remains one of the most famous chapters of the entire post-apocalyptic Bethesda series. History The Outer Worlds tells the story of a survivor (or a survivor) of the spaceship Hope, adrift in space for reasons that will be discovered during the game, who is awakened from hibernation by a space criminal, a certain Phineas, after a journey that lasted more than budgeted for the colony of Alcione, i.e. a system of planets governed by a conglomerate of multinationals, dedicated to the intensive exploitation of local resources. Still reeling from his abrupt return to the living, our character is sent by Phineas to a colony planet in search of a spaceship and answers. Why did what was supposed to be a ten-year journey into a new life turn into a seventy-year nightmare (the time spent in hibernation)? What does Phineas want from us? Why was Hope abandoned without anyone doing anything to save its occupants? Many more will be added to these questions, as our events intertwine with the government of the Alcyone colony and with the factions that were born on its planets, all in their own way in open conflict with the policies of the Council, the governing body of the colony. Character creation The first thing to do before venturing into The Outer Worlds is to create a character. The included editor allows you to determine their appearance, gender, as well as basic attributes (Body, Mind and Personality), which will directly affect skills. The latter are the most important characterizing element of the character, which also have the function of putting decisive stakes on the gameplay. The skills are divided into groups of two or three and can have a value ranging from 0 to 100. For example the 'Range' group includes the skills Pistols, Long Guns and Heavy Weapons, while the 'Invisibility' group includes Stealth , Hacking and Breaking In. Up to a value of 50 the skill points must be assigned to the group and not to the single skill, from 50 onwards the assignments become individual instead. In this way it is possible to specialize the character in a certain skill, after having made him capable in a certain field that includes the skill itself. After the skills it is necessary to select the aptitudes, that is, it is necessary to choose a character trait with a relative bonus. Once this is done, we are ready to go. Consider that the gameplay foresees the possibility of having second thoughts: once we board the spaceship with which we will travel far and wide in space, the Unreliable (it's called that), we will find a terminal with which we will be able to reassign all the initial points and those obtained by leveling up. Game structure As widely told in the preview phase, The Outer Worlds is divided into more or less vast territories that can be visited individually. So no open world. In reality it is a perfect solution for the style of play, given that it would have been really difficult to manage the adventure as an open world while maintaining the same narrative structure, which involves frequent travel to very different places, with the latter being able to be planets, giant spaceships, satellites, secret bases and whatnot. The first area, a portion of the planet Terrarum 2 with a town in the colony of Alcione dedicated to the production of tins of a strange tuna, serves as an introduction to the game system, as well as to the political situation we will have to deal with from here on out. Talking to thelocals we will discover that the multinationals essentially consider the settlers as their property and have completely bound them to the production system, conditioning them physically and mentally. Those who didn't want to accept the impositions, or who simply became aware of their miserable state, rebelled by becoming plunderers or by founding small communities outside the cities of the colony. In the first portion of the game, the social division is clearly represented, with us being called to take a position by making a radical and in some ways too abrupt choice. Fortunately, with the opening of the universe, everything becomes more nuanced and the vision of the world of the Obsidian authors lights up with really interesting aspects. Basically The Outer Worlds seems to be a criticism of the capitalist system and the alienation it produces in people, in reality the system of choices within the game greatly limits the revolutionary message inherent in the plot, which results in one of two possible endings. Without giving you precise advances, know that often acting in the way that seems right leads to results that are completely opposite to the desired ones. As already mentioned, Obsidian's title is essentially a first-person action role-playing game in which the gameplay changes enormously based on the progression chosen for the character. Basically it is possible to play it as if it were a first-person shooter, i.e. by shooting any enemy on sight, or to decide for a more thoughtful approach, perhaps using stealth or other skills at our disposal so as not to have to carry out an indiscriminate massacre. We don't think it's possible to finish him without firing a shot, but some situations allow you to avoid firefights. For example, it is possible to persuade a certain character not to commit a certain action simply by speaking to him, or the ravines of some levels can be exploited to go unnoticed behind the enemies (the maps almost always have side accesses or hidden passages that allow you to reach the objectives unnoticed). It's all up to the player. Of our own we have opted for a character specialized in long firearms, decidedly stealthy and with developed scientific skills. In this way we were able to try the combat system, the stealth one, despite having paid a little in the dialogues. The combat system The combat system of The Outer Worlds is very reminiscent of that of Fallout. Basically it is a first-person shooter in which it is possible to slow down time to aim better and carry out a certain number of actions (shoot, use consumables and so on), after which you go back to fighting in real time, waiting for the bar of time manipulation recharges. Having time to aim is essential to exploit the localized damage of enemies, or to hit their weak points. For example, some robots are very resistant to damage, unless you hit them in a specific spot. There are many weapons available and they are almost all modifiable through kits found in the game world. We therefore have melee weapons such as electric bats, plasma blades, hammers and more, assault rifles that with the right coupling can become sniper rifles, heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, pistols, plasma weapons, scientific weapons (from often very strange effects) and so on. Even in terms of armor there is a certain variety, although the slots that concern them are only two: body and head. Each piece of equipment is subject to wear and tear and, from time to time, must be repaired at the workbenches, using spare parts obtained by disassembling unused weapons and armor, or by contacting specialized non-player characters. The workbenches also allow you to improve weapons and armor by manipulating them or applying the aforementioned kits, so as to increase the level of customization of the entire experience. The enemies are of many types and range from the aforementioned marauders, to crazed robots, some of a decidedly large size, to get to the local fauna, which to define as unfriendly is an understatement. For example, it will happen to meet large mantises capable of killing us in a few blows or insidious swirling swarms. Depending on our behavior we will also be able to annoy some of the factions of the colony, increasing the number of characters eager to kill us. The combat system is linked to the progression of the character, because killing enemies is one of the main ways to accumulate points experience. The others are to solve the missions that are assigned to usand o use the skills developed when possible (for example, picking doors and containers, or persuading a character through dialogue choices). If desired, we can act alone for the entire adventure, or we can take one or two of the six companions that we will find by exploring the colony with us. We have opted to always have two companions with us, not only to have help in combat, but also to follow their stories and to discover their relationships with other non-player characters, which often give rise to unexpected and beautiful dialogues to read . As announced by Obsidian, the main character cannot commit to any love affairs. Without revealing too much, however, we can tell you that in reality there is something like this and it concerns some comrades. Paradoxically, the fact that love stories are lived in an indirect way has allowed the writers to make them more delicate than the brutality with which they are usually faced in video games, complete with courtship and hangover sequences capable of forgetting a love disappointment. In short, they are always linked to quests, but you are not rewarded for having taken this or that character to bed. From a stylistic point of view, with The Outer Worlds Obsidian has done a great job, probably the best in its history. Knowing that he didn't have an unlimited budget, he staked everything on writing and creating illustrations that describe the colony of Alcyone in a utopian, yet grotesque way, creating what to many seemed like a Fallout imagery of space, full as it is full of irony and great contrasts, which are reflected in the society, only apparently united, and in the game world itself. In particular, there are some truly memorable dialogues, between characters who end up revealing unthinkable sides of themselves and others who turn out to be just absurd, despite their apparent seriousness. There is no shortage of amusing moments, such as the dialogues with ADA, the artificial intelligence that guides the Unreliable, or some chats with Nyoka, one of the companions. On a technical level, however, the style is a little less marked and the quality of the different places visited is more fluctuating. Above all, the interiors are decidedly anonymous, where the external areas stand out at least for their chromatic refinement and the attempt to hypothesize original architecture. Too bad for the excessive compression of some maps, in which the relevant areas are very close to each other. In general, smaller places, those intended for a single function, which do not have that snow globe aftertaste of larger territories, do better. To say: at a certain point you have to visit a gigantic spaceship, in which, however, the key places are in a row (one in each room, practically), complete with a hidden area full of marauders a few steps from the center of command of the Mordets, a military security force commanded by one of the independent factions. Probably everything is due to the lack of funds to do something bigger, but it is undeniable that we pay attention to it and that it can be alienating. Fortunately, the negative impression is mitigated by the quick trips, which allow you to reach the key places of each map by selecting them from the general map, and by the numerous movements we will make during our adventure. For the rest, we would like to point out that it is better to play one of the last two difficulty levels right away, especially if you are an expert in the genre, because the normal one is really easy. Playing on medium-high difficulty, it took us about thirty hours to finish the game, but opening each container and trying to better explore each map. Fortunately The Outer Worlds is highly replayable, thanks to the play system itself which invites you to experiment with all the possibilities offered, both in terms of mechanics and in terms of the plot itself. In short, we are faced with a great single player adventure that deserves your money and your time.", "date": "2019-10-22", "grade": "8.9"}
