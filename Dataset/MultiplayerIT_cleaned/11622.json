{"name": "Behind the Frame Il paesaggio pi bello", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/behind-the-frame-paesaggio-piu-bello-recensione.html", "text": "A painter is intent on painting a picture to be sent to an art gallery. It is an abstract landscape of which you have already defined what the surfaces will be, tracing black lines, but you lack the colors to complete it. However, the woman lets herself be distracted by the neighbor, who inevitably intrigues her: he is an old man who lives alone with a cat. He is also a painter and, looking out of his window, he notices that some of his paintings are similar to those hanging in his house (a romantic bohemian attic where other artists probably stayed in the past). The realization of your new work therefore alternates with the search for the truth about the mystery that surrounds your home and your neighbor: how are they related? Who is that man? Why, even though I don't know him, is he somehow familiar to him? What is hidden behind those paintings? Why do they seem to be part of one big story? These and other questions are the basis of Behind the Frame The most beautiful landscape, a small and fascinating independent title with a visual style inspired by the works of Studio Ghibli which, as we will see in the course of the review, is a real bonsai game, perfect within its limits. The picture of the situation Behind the Frame painter The most beautiful landscape and its charming neighbor Behind the Frame The most beautiful landscape is basically a graphic adventure where you have to solve puzzles to advance the story. Then the time is spent searching for and collecting objects, following visual clues, such as the footprints left by the neighbor's cat or strange messages on a computer, and drawing what the painter noticed to get ideas on how to proceed. Eggs and toast are also cooked and hot coffee is drunk, so as not to miss a touch of narrative minimalism to the whole. The puzzles themselves are not very complex and serve above all to enrich the mystery that is revealed picture after picture and which can be solved in just over an hour. The main peculiarity of the game is certainly the involvement of painting in the gameplay and in the story told, with the player who will often be called to complete the paintings by coloring them or adding details (don't worry, you don't have to know how to draw, because it's all very guided). Between one chapter and another there will also be some animated cutscenes, very well done (although victims of some bugs in our test, so much so that at one point we thought we were blocked), which will serve to add details to the story , making it progress towards its natural conclusion. Unfortunately we cannot go into too much detail about the puzzles or the narrative because they are so intertwined that the risk of inappropriate anticipations is very high. Let's say that a good adventurer won't have major problems getting to the bottom of the mystery, also because most of the adventure takes place in a single environment where it's not easy to miss something. Despite its underlying simplicity and limited duration, Behind the Frame The Most Beautiful Landscape proved to be a fascinating and poetic experience, as well as profound, despite its small size. It will be for the delicate and refined visual style, or for the story itself that touches all the right strings, without ever transcending, but we were really positively impressed by it. Take it as a good movie to spend an alternative evening to the usual massacres offered by video games.", "date": "2021-08-23", "grade": "8.0"}
