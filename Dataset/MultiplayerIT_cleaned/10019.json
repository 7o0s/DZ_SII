{"name": "Iron Man 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/77128-iron-man-2-la-guerra-delle-armature.html", "text": "Tony Stark, one of the largest arms manufacturers in the world, is kidnapped following an attack that reduces him to death. To survive, he draws the old ~Arc reactor~ project from his memory and builds a prototype, implanting it in his chest to prevent the shrapnel from getting close to his heart. His captors want to force him to build missiles, and Stark pretends to follow orders... What he creates, however, is much more than a missile: it is an armored exoskeleton, powered by reactor energy, which allows you to defeat an entire army of terrorists and flee into the desert until it is recovered by American troops. Back home, Tony Stark has become a new man: he decides to stop producing weapons and at the same time to continue working on the Iron Man project to ensure peace in his own way. This happened in the first film, we all remember it. In the sequel, recently released in theaters, Stark has to contend with the dangerous ~Whiplash~, aka Ivan Danko (although in the original comic the character is called ~Mark Scarlotti~ and is of Italian, not Russian, origins), as well as with the slimy industrialist Justin Hammer. Antagonists who are indeed present in the iPhone and iPod Touch tie-in made by Gameloft, but who follow different paths compared to the film despite having the same squadron of combat androids. Iron and fire Right from the start, Iron Man 2 presents itself as a relatively complex action game, which adapts to the peculiar input capabilities of the Apple device with a series of solutions that are sometimes spot on and sometimes not, rather than simplifying its gameplay on the altar of immediacy. And so our armored superhero can run, use the famous repulsor beams as well as various attack combos and homing missiles, and finally manage his flight in two different ways: ~levitating~ to different heights or proceeding like a rocket towards the your goal, at full speed. Given the amount of actions that can be performed, the controls require a little practice to be well assimilated, and even then there will be difficulties due to an arrangement of the commands that often turns out to be cumbersome, also due to situations that generally do not facilitate us the life. To run for cover, the developers thought (badly) to level the difficulty down, instead obtaining a boomerang effect as regards the quality of the gameplay. In the nine stages that make up the game we find ourselves wearing different armor and also controlling War Machine (i.e. Tony's friend, Jim Rhodes), facing a large number of androids and a certain number of final bosses. The latter move and attack according to the usual patterns to memorize, but generally the strategy of always moving and attacking when possible works without major problems. It must be said that more than an effort has been made in the direction of variety, for example in one scenario we have to find and free civilians, in another we have to defuse bombs, in yet another we have to clean up enemies, etc. The points earned at the end of each stage also allow us to enhance the armor from an offensive (making the weapons more effective or acquiring new combinations of shots) and defensive (making the shields more solid) point of view, with a good practical feedback during the action. Moving on to a purely technical discourse, we have a really well done Iron Man in his ~classic~ armor, which gives its best in close-up shots and is equipped with decent quality animation. Everything that revolves around him pays duty, however: from the people we save (horrible) to the androids we fight, we note the use of really simple and angular polygonal models. The scenarios move between high and low, but in principle they offer a good compromise between the quantity of objects and the level of detail, with a constant frame rate. The sound is a little too ~soft~ and lacking in bite, but the voices of the original actors during the cutscenes are noted to brighten up the atmosphere a little.
