On the other hand, the last time we met him it was already an interesting project, characterized by a complex sandbox dimension focused on prospecting and collecting different minerals, crafting, breathtaking landscapes, very believable fauna, realistic state of health and animations in such quantity to include the transport of logs. At the time the horses and various combat elements were still missing but in recent months the pieces have all fallen into place, finally bringing us to the 1.0 release. But are they all roses and flowers? Life is Feudal has come out of the Early Access phase but this step may have been rash In the footsteps of Ultima Online Let's start from the interface which has undergone some refinement, including a suggestive main menu, but the essence of the experience has not changed. Pressing Tab activates the cursor to interact directly with icons and commands while pressing it again Freelook mode comes into play, which allows us to go for a stroll and face ferocious animals or enemies controlled by flesh and blood players. Pressing the C key instead, the third-person view comes into play and by pointing to the ground or objects, contextual menus are activated that allow us to tear off branches, dig, collect shrubs and replant them to start a cultivation. Combat leans towards simulation with free aiming and Mount & Blade style directional attacks, but is more advanced. First of all, to inflict damage it is necessary that it is the correct part of the weapon to impact the opponent and to cause greater damage it is necessary to strike with the far end, taking care to make a nice wide movement to increase the impact force. In short, taking the right measures is fundamental especially since hitting from too close a distance makes the attack in vain. Furthermore, the blow weapons allow you to stun the opponent and this allows you to rob him without killing him, reducing the loss of alignment which, once the -50 parameter is exceeded, marks them as criminals for life and makes a player permanently attackable by anyone. Finally, it is even possible to surrender to avoid a bad end, directly delivering our goods to a possible aggressor and the latter is a possibility not to be overlooked. In fact, dying involves the loss of skill points and recovering them can require a lot of work, especially if the server admin hasn't activated the multiplier that allows you to accumulate experience more quickly. Even in this case, however, the progression can be decidedly slow especially if you want to specialize in many of the countless skills that structure collection, crafting, construction and combat. But it is not said that it is possible to be an expert in everything, given that the admin can set a maximum limit of obtainable points, even if the player is often forced to use skills that are not fundamental to his specialization. In order not to waste points, it is possible to block the growth of skills, set them so that they go down if not used or decide to let them grow exactly like in Ultima Online, which is a clear source of inspiration for Life is Feudal. Inspiration that includes the customization of the avatar, unfortunately limited by a series of presets that are not always varied, and which fortunately also extends to the characteristics and various skills. In fact, these can reach up to a value of 100, just like in Garriott's historic MMORPG, and allow you to fully specialize the character both in combat, between throwing weapons and two-handed broadswords, and as regards the professions that involve everything you can imagine in a realistic medieval world that includes forges, tunnels, siege weapons, needle and thread, potions, structures, animals, art, prayers and lots of cooking recipes. MMORPG tech tests? The evolution of Life is Feudal includes the implementation of the indispensable horses complete with combat in the saddle and breeding, but the most important changes concern the structure of the game with the introduction of perhaps less visible yet even more important mechanics such as ownership and the hour of judgement. To establish a property it is necessary to create and maintain a monument with the sacrifice of objects, which in addition to allowing you to create a guild allows you to claim a portion of territory that extends as the level of the object increases. At this point if a foreigner enters the land and is discovered by the proowner or a member of the guild, can be accused of breaking and entering and therefore be branded as a criminal, thus being attacked without risk of penalty. The law, however, does not apply in the hour of judgment which allows you to attack others and to assault buildings, even destroying them, including the guild monument, with siege weapons. At the same time, the technical sector has also undergone important changes, first of all the decay of the objects and tunnels that now collapse, cleaning the server from unused elements that could unnecessarily weigh it down. But the optimization has also improved from a purely graphical point of view, although Life is Feudal remains a rather heavy title with maximum settings. In return, however, it offers breathtaking views, detailed models, defined textures and excellent quality animations which, however, have to contend with uploads, pop-ups and bugs that are only partially fixed by a combo of post-launch hotfixes. Due to these problems, part of the magic is lost but if nothing else a mid-range configuration returns a splendid glance, dominated by a dense, detailed and believable forest that prevents the atmosphere from irreparably dissolving. The merit, however, also goes to the sound sector which boasts an apt soundtrack, strengthened by a main theme of those that enter your head, and sensational samplings that project the player in the middle of a forest amid rustlings, crunches and sounds of countless animals. In short, the cure can be seen. But if on the one hand Life is Feudal shines for subtleties such as the movement that changes according to all types of terrain or as the greater loss of more skill points if you die with a negative alignment, on the other hand there are obvious shortcomings such as stealth and 'impossibility to stoop with all that it entails in terms of realism in combat. We can define Life is Feudal as a title made up of ups and downs, an experience in the making that can force an extreme grinding and which for this very reason is easy to hate, but which can also be appreciated viscerally provided you find the conditions for be able to fully enjoy it. And when everything fits together, the situations that are created are undoubtedly interesting. Having recently entered a European server, in a few hours we went from being accused of being thieves, threatened by two thugs while we were terrified on our knees in the mud, to then join, also thanks to the integrated voice chat, a close-knit group in a server where role-playing is not the extreme one but is practiced respecting the rules to the maximum and without exploiting any criminal brand due to a simple mistake. In this context we had a lot of fun, at least for a few hours, until even in the presence of organized players it became clear that Life is Feudal can give much more in a much broader context, with the slow progression linked to a world alive and permanent in which every action has a weight and there is no risk of having to start all over again in a server that forces extreme grinding. In this regard, among other things, with the 1.0 release of Life is Feudal the MMORPG is finally back in the works even if the features developed for the latter such as animal-drawn carts and dynamic climate will also be implemented in the standard version here reviewed.", "date": "2015-11-24", "grade": "7.0"}
