{"name": "Sega Casino", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sega-casino.html", "text": "Games If the first impact with the game is not the most encouraging due to concise menu items both for implementation and for available choices, by accessing the various tables the impression certainly does not improve. Sega Casino is actually a collection of games, related only to the account at your disposal. In the beginning you will not have all the games available, and the level of your bets will also be limited. Only by increasing your nest egg will you gradually unlock all the tables and bets made available by the title. This is the unique reward and incentive to spend some time over at Sega Casino. When you have opened all the tables you can choose from the following menu items: ~Black Jack~, ~Roulette~, ~Craps~, ~Baccar~, ~Texas Hold 'Em~, ~Chuck a Luck~, ~7-card Stud , Keno and Video Poker (the latter in 3 variants). If for some titles there is no need for an explanation because they are rather famous or practiced, for the others there are rather in-depth instructions describing the rules inside the cartridge. Craps for example is a game where you win if you get the sum that comes out from the roll of two dice right. This at least in principle, then there are a whole series of sub-rules that at times outnumber those of baseball. In ~Baccar~ however, we have two packs of cards available and we have to guess which hand (between banker and player) has the score closest to nine. Both ~Texas Hold 'Em~ and ~7 Card Stud~ are similar to poker. In the first one starts with two cards face down, and first three are dealt at once, and then two more in two rounds. Whoever has the highest score wins the pot that was formed with the challengers' bets as the deal progressed. In the second one, however, you start with two cards face down, and in turn you give another five, of which only the last one is face down. Here too the high point takes home the pot. Keno is a game of chance: you have to choose 10 numbers between 1 and 90, and you win based on how many come out in the draw. As well as ~Chuck a Luck~ where you have to guess the score of the dice. You will probably know all the remaining games and let's spend a few quick words only for Black Jack, a sort of seven and a half, where, however, you have to make 21. ...which are boring The attraction of Sega Casino is all here, and considering that some of these games are objectively uninteresting or fun, one can realize how little this title has to offer, even to people tantalized by electronic casinos or betting. The only objective of interest is to unlock the tables closed at the beginning, then everything is put back in the hands of the user, who, if he manages to get passionate, will spend some time on the various games for the pure pleasure of doing it. In this sense, a kind of career mode would have been more than welcome. For example, the player could be given the opportunity to play the role of a man in search of glory who starts from the most infamous casinos to get to the most prestigious ones. It wasn't going to be anything fancy, innovative, or intriguing, but at the very least it was giving the user the ability to drive a story forward and at the same time making them care about their character much more than a file on which the bill is stamped. If this was the ~casino~ mode, to tell you about the ~free~ mode, just say that it is identical to the casino one (with the same menus and games) with the difference that what you win or lose will not affect your credit. To help comes the single cartridge multiplayer mode that allows up to 5 contenders to challenge each other in ~black jack~, ~texas hold 'em~ and ~7-card stud~. The technical aspect also stops at the minimum wage, with spartan and unrefined menus, and really simple 2D graphics, with some equally simple 3D elements such as roulette and dice. Comment Sega Casino is a low-budget business. But in addition to the budget, there is also a lack of ideas and the desire. What we have in hand is a series of totally unrelated games that neither attract nor excite; we could re-read everything in terms of pastime for those who have to spend a few minutes waiting for something, but in this case, precisely on the DS we find several much more fun and indicated releases, such as the launch title Wario Ware Touched. Perhaps one shouldn't expect more than a collection of casino games, but the fact remains that we doubt that such a packaged title will make even the most die-hard green table lovers happy. In short, Sega Casino is a game that we still find difficult to recommend even to those who have been waiting for such a game, and indeed we invite them to prolong the wait even further in view of something more deserving Pro A good nnumber of games available Costs about two-thirds of normal DS games Cons Half-hearted execution Not very stimulating Minimal throughout Imagine nine different tables with as many games, imagine three save files with your account, imagine two game modes that are actually the same, finally imagine a touch screen interface. Done? Well, you've just imagined Sega Casino.", "date": "2006-02-06", "grade": null}
