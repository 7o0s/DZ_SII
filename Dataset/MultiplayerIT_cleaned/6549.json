At the time we played the beta version available in Steam Early Access with great gusto, discovering a potentially great title but still with some balance problems. If we had to express a preliminary opinion on the final version of the game, we would say that Defiant, the developer, has demonstrated in practice how direct contact with the public should be exploited, avoiding frustrating buyers with excessive waiting times between updates and following their feedback to improve an already very solid starting point. So what still remains an independent production, today appears refined and intriguing to the right point, despite basing many of its mechanics on luck. How is it possible? Hand of Fate comes out in the final version after a fair period of Early Access: let's find out how it is Lots of luck The protagonist of Hand of Fate is a warrior who finds himself playing his life at cards with an arcane dealer, who sets him challenges of increasing difficulty. At the beginning of the game you can choose whether to face the story mode, or the endless one. Besides the bosses, there are some special enemies like Liches Preparing a good deck is essential In the first you have to defeat the twelve bosses of the dealer in sequence to finally get to face the dealer himself, while the second is a mode that does what it says, that is, it continues indefinitely until the death of the protagonist. The levels, if we want to call them that, are generated randomly by drawing cards from the dealer's deck, a deck formed by the selection made by the player and by special cards inserted by the dealer. Some cards have a strange raised symbol at the bottom. These are cards that earn tokens when you pass the challenge. The tokens are used to unlock new challenge cards or new pieces of equipment, the latter always linked to cards that flow into a separate deck. This big pit of different cards, to which we can add those of curses (permanent penalties for the hero) and blessings (permanent bonuses), makes each game different from the others. Trying the Early Access version, we complained about the excessive weight of the case on the gameplay, with cards that could kill the player on the spot or others that were completely unbalanced compared to the theoretical level of challenge. Fortunately, most of the problems have been solved by refining the values of luck, which in video games are always mathematics. So now the difficulty turns out to be more balanced, with the first chapters of the story mode going off quite smoothly, while the advanced ones still represent a good test. This is where Defiant has been very receptive to players, listening to their complaints and using their experience with the game to polish it. For example, some of the curses that made games a plague have been removed, replaced by others that are always penalizing but not to the point of ruining a game. Some damage cards have also been removed or made much rarer, so you no longer find yourself dying from a single failed challenge, with some very rare exceptions, or you don't end up having the character irreparably crippled by a stroke of bad luck. The fights Normally Hand of Fate has two ways to solve challenges. One is linked to luck and glance: once a card is turned over, a situation is proposed that can be solved by drawing one of four luck cards. Fights can get chaotic Depending on what you have drawn, you can have bonuses such as food, money, equipment cards and so on; or malus, such as cards that permanently remove energy or others that remove money and so on. In some situations, however, the challenges will require you to fight. The dealer will then draw the cards of the opponents to face on the battlefield and the player will be required to directly control the hero against the enemies. The combat system takes up what was seen in Rocksteady's Batman, or in Shadow of Mordor, even if it is not as precise. The hero can offend opponents in different ways depending on the equipment possessed. Basically he can slash with the weapon in hand and dodge incoming blows with a leap, but already having a shield in the other hand allows him to counterattack or reflect projectiles. Just have the right timing when the related icons appear in his head. Some weapons, including shields, also have special powers like electric shockwaves or life drain from opponents, which make life easier.there is. If desired, it is possible to bring depletable magic cards into battle that provide additional attacks. In general, however, the best weapon is knowledge of your enemies, who may be bandits, undead, ratmen, or lizardmen. Their strength varies according to the level of the card drawn by the dealer. Once the bosses are defeated, they too end up in the deck of enemies that can be faced during the levels. Let's say that if the fights of the first part of the story mode are simple enough, with the introduction of bosses and special enemies such as fire golems, liches or minotaurs, the situation becomes considerably more complicated, to the point where it becomes essential to find or buy in shops, with money accumulated by playing, equipment suitable for the challenge.", "date": "2015-02-23", "grade": "8.8"}
