The favorable season - we could say the Renaissance - that the Zombie category has been experiencing since the release of Left4Dead, evidently provided an interesting opportunity for a cooperative multiplayer shooter, all in all on the same strings. Similarly to the Valve title, in fact, Killing Floor offers strictly cooperative gameplay, where up to 6 players are seen facing successive waves of grotesque humanoid creatures, in a crescendo of monstrosity and difficulty, up to the final climax against the so-called Patriarch. The enemies are characteristic: different from the traditional living dead, but rather crazed specimens of a military research project conducted by the very shady megacorporation of the day (Horzine Biotech), evidently having gone a little too far in terms of genetic manipulation and mechanical implants. These are almost disturbing horrors to see, of the kind that one would expect to find in a Doom or a Wolfenstein, shooters far from the clearly distinguishable self-deprecating vein characteristic of Left4Dead. The soundtrack of a violent and effective heavy metal and the five included maps contribute to the dark atmosphere, labyrinthine arenas with settings ranging from the crumbling streets of London to the haunted offices of Horzine, from a squalid suburban farmhouse to a horror film laboratory. All strictly non-linear and full of passages and shortcuts and the possibility of barricading yourself and even influencing the movements of enemies, unlocking or sealing the doors with the supplied welder. The Night of the Screaming Lives Each match is punctuated by successive waves of howling and limping monstrosities, with a meter in full view informing players of the number remaining in the current attack. At the end of each one, you have one minute to restock on weapons and ammunition by reaching the odious merchant placed nearby to supply the supplies. The initial equipment includes only a pistol, knife and hypodermic syringe to heal, so the goal of each game is to survive and gradually earn enough money for the weapons necessary to take down the extremely difficult Patriarch. The ~persistent~ element is the experience gained in the six different 'perks' - benefits - (which lead to the specialization of Commando, Medic, Support, Berserker, Firebug and Sharpshooter) that can be cultivated by the characters, generally linked to a particular role or combinations of weapons and whose advancement depends on a series of objectives to be achieved. The perk from ~Firebug~, for example, increases the effects caused by the flamethrower and goes up in category for the first time if you exceed the 25,000 damage mark with said weapon; the Medic is required to heal his companions enough times, and so on. It is possible to ~train~ all the perks simply by choosing what to focus on at the moment, perhaps according to the available equipment, without having to select a character ~class~ beforehand. Furthermore, once the maximum level is reached, in addition to the normal bonuses, new and advanced starting weapons are awarded, present in the inventory from the beginning of each game.", "date": "2009-08-07", "grade": "7.2"}
