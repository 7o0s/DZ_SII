So let's talk about a pure shooter, where all that matters is blowing up zombie heads and which is offered for free download: but be careful, because Glu is not a charity, and like all self-respecting freemium titles, even the The subject of this review will not let itself be played without stealing some money. Invalid but lethal In Contract Killer Zombies you take on the role of an anomalous zombie hunter, light years away from Chris Redfield, Leon Kennedy and company: our protagonist is in fact quite old and above all confined to a wheelchair, an element that more than provides depth to the game's (sparse) plot serves to give a handy justification for the static nature of the on-screen action. While it might look like a normal FPS at first glance, the Glu product grants the user control of aim only, forcing him to spot targets around him and eliminate them before they can reach his position or that of his allies. The play structure is really very simple, if not downright spartan: you continue - together with your partner Evelyn - from mission to mission, with the aim of collecting supplies, saving civilians or simply surviving the onslaught of the undead. Having reached a certain score target, you arrive at a special scenario in which you must protect the survivors as they run towards a helicopter, and then start over. It is obvious that everything rests on a grinding mechanism which, however, in Contract Killer Zombies is not based exclusively on the player's skill. As in many other similar titles, you get money and experience points for each kill (with the inevitable bonus for headshots), which are essential respectively to buy new weapons and to have access to the various classes of offensive tools. However, even the most infallible sniper will at some point find himself forced to make an uncomfortable choice: literally repeating the same stages endlessly to accumulate enough money to improve his equipment or give in to the temptations of the store by using his credit card and by buying some in-game currency. This happens because as the adventure continues, the difficulty of the levels increases much faster than the evolution of the arsenal, making it virtually impossible to continue without first paying a visit to the gun shop. Nothing particularly new under the sun (freemium titles certainly weren't born today and even the previous Contract Killer was based on similar mechanics), a pity however that Contract Killer Zombies doesn't do its best to make the user hungry. The gameplay is in fact rather repetitive, the settings rotate cyclically as well as the objectives of the missions but at least the feeling of the various weapons is rendered well, with pistols, uzis, shotguns and sniper rifles that behave more than satisfactorily and whose large number really leaves you spoiled for choice. Instead, the control system is anything but an example of comfort: emblematic is the unfortunate decision of the developers to place the keys to aim and shoot at the opposite ends of the screen, which forces you to continuously alternate the hand assigned to move the view . Even from a technical point of view we are not dealing with something transcendental, with functional three-dimensional graphics and little more, in which the angularity of the polygonal models and the general mediocrity of the animations stand out in the negative.
