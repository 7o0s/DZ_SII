In the case of Virtua Tennis Challenge, however, the developers of SEGA have taken the necessary precautions, packaging a product that grants players not one, not two but as many as four possible variations regarding the management of the character on the screen and the execution of shoot. The default setting is based on gestures and brings with it an undoubted load of originality and immediacy, with the tennis player reaching the various points of the court when we touch them with our fingers and making his shot by following the lines we draw on the touch screen : forehand, backhand, volley or bunt, depending on the direction of the vector. This type of controls are undoubtedly the best for casual gamers, as well as for getting into the game immediately, but they suffer from a couple of important limitations: first of all, you have to play with an index finger instead of your thumbs and the system doesn't always correctly interprets the input that should determine the movement of the character; secondly, the degree of automatic assistance is inevitably very high. Things improve substantially with the transition to one of the three variants characterized by traditional buttons, therefore a virtual stick on the left side of the screen and four buttons on the right. In this case, the inclination of the stick decides the direction of the shot, as in the episodes of Virtua Tennis for consoles and PCs, and the ball ~hooking~ routines immediately appear well implemented. In short, it is possible to enjoy an experience extremely close to the classic one, enriched by the possibility of selecting various levels of difficulty and settings relating to the length of the matches. Beat her? Having ascertained the solidity of the gameplay, Virtua Tennis Challenge reveals itself to be fairly rich in terms of modalities, with the single exhibition that is accompanied by the full-bodied SPT World Tour (consisting of twelve tournaments with increasing degrees of difficulty), with all its implications, and from the possibility of challenging a friend or a perfect stranger thanks to the local or online multiplayer mode. The latter works very well in terms of matchmaking, but the quality of the match obviously depends on the connection of the two participants: if you catch an opponent with a hamster wheel feeding the router, a bit of lag or a drop in signal will be inevitable . Unfortunately, a variant capable of combining career and minigames is missing, as in Virtua Tennis 4, and this can only be reflected in the longevity of the SEGA product, however more than discreet thanks also to a nice unlockable bonus mode. Nothing to say, however, as regards the technical sector: the developers have done an excellent job with the graphics, using the assets of the console versions where possible and thus offering us a high degree of detail and fluidity. The number of locations is good, enhanced by the shots during replays or when the players enter the field, and the animations are also good. The sound punctually underlines the various phases of the game and follows a traditional approach, ergo it is rather essential.", "date": "2012-06-20", "grade": "8.0"}
