After our test a few weeks ago, we are ready to sum up The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles, the collection containing the two titles The Great Ace Attorney: Adventures and The Great Ace Attorney 2: Resolve never released from Japan. We can finally embody the ancestor of the famous Phoenix Wright, Ryunosuke Naruhodo, a law student in Japan who travels to England to learn as much as possible from their judicial system, only to find himself embroiled in a series of seemingly unrelated cases. from each other. Delving deeper into the matter, you will discover disturbing backstories about characters who manipulate events in the shadows. As a simple port of the original 3DS versions, there are no changes in terms of gameplay, just a better refinement of the models, although not flawless. Having reached the conclusion, we can say that we have found ourselves in front of an excellent package, where not all cases shine in terms of interest, but overall they present a compelling narrative, especially The Great Ace Attorney 2: Resolve. The fact that they are two connected games and can be played in quick succession makes them all the more intriguing. For the review of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles we played the PlayStation 4 version. Aspiring lawyer Of the story, for obvious reasons, we cannot tell you much. Ryunosuke Naruhodo is a law student in Japan in the middle of the Meiji period, when the judicial system was still nascent, and for this reason he is sent to England to learn everything there is to know, with the aim of bringing the his knowledge. To be honest, it shouldn't have been Ryunosuke to undertake this journey but his best friend (and in a certain sense mentor) Kazuma Asogi: due to circumstances related to the plot, Ryunosuke will instead take his place, together with his young assistant Susato Mikotoba - a very brilliant girl, often even more than the protagonist let's face it, with an immoderate passion for Herlock Sholmes, who will prove to be an indispensable support both during the investigation and, above all, during the court trials. Without going too far, once we get to England we will have to face immediately with Barok van Zieks, legendary prosecutor known as ~Grim Reaper of the Old Bailey~. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles, our trusted assistant Susato Mikotoba The reason is quite simple, at least as disturbing: any defendant he prosecuted is dead, one way or another. In case of guilty, for serious charges, in England the death penalty was in force by hanging, but if someone managed to survive the trial, he was still killed sooner or later. It is curious that van Zieks had retired from the scene for the past five years and, precisely in conjunction with our arrival, he decided to return to the courtrooms to give us a healthy hard time. The events of The Great Ace Attorney 2: Resolve follow those of the previous chapter, thus calling into question already known characters, but we will not tell you further so as not to spoil the surprise. Of the two, we found this second game much more narratively engaging, nevertheless the set of parts makes the adventures of Ryunosuke Naruhodo worth playing, despite some shortcomings. Objection! The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles, van Zieks is one of the best characterized characters The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles does not differ, in terms of gameplay, from any other chapter in the series: a case is presented to be solved, you look for clues before ending up in the courtroom and, once inside, you listen to the witness statements with the aim of finding any inconsistencies and bringing the case back in our favor, often also presenting evidence to support our arguments. Occasionally we will be asked to choose the correct answer among several others but the possibility of always having a log of the conversations at hand helps us in case something should have escaped us. After all, Ace Attorney is a series that talks a lot and, in the rush to continue, it can happen that you miss an important detail. If in Japan, where the introductory chapter takes place, the management of the process is not very different from what the chapters set nowadays have accustomed us to, it is when we land in England that the music changes: the English judicial system in fact, it is based on the popular jury, made up of six people whose opinion heavily influences the trial, to the point of declaring its end in one way or another. Our work will therefore be twofold: on the one hand, to challenge the testestimonials that seem to present some false notes, on the other hand recovering the favor of the jury that we promptly end up losing without almost opening our mouths. sometimes excessive disparity between the defense and the prosecution: that is, where the prosecution does not seem to need to bring evidence, it is enough for the witnesses to declare often clearly conflicting facts to suddenly convince the popular jury, we have to dig our way with nails and with teeth. If on the one hand we understand its meaning, on the other hand the game ends in redundancy whereby we find ourselves against the popular jury within a few minutes, without having said a word, with the excuse of starting the so-called ~Summation Examination~: it is a mechanism whereby, by finding two conflicting opinions in the (often non-existent) motivations of the jurors, we can restore the right balance to the trial by making them change their mind about their hasty decision. Depending on the case in question, this could happen more than once, always with the premise that on very many occasions the jury acts in a completely random way, above all considering the presence, among them, of people who have their own reasons for not being completely honest - and here too we would have to object to the consistency of certain processes but we are equally aware of how much Ace Attorney has over the top characters. The popular jury remains a good mechanic, one that pushes us to repeatedly analyze the facts to find the flaw. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles, the moment we've all been waiting for Since we are talking about two games with their years behind them, we encountered the somewhat typical problem of the series: the tendency to dwell excessively, circling around itself with the excuse of unnecessarily complicating a case. It may be due to the fact of not considering obvious inconsistencies in the statements of witnesses, which are passed over in silence when at times they could very well close the issue (focused examples would be needed which we cannot give you to avoid spoilers), or due to the need to extrapolate evidence that they should form the initial basis of any trial, but some of the cases presented in both games, despite an interesting background narrative and a respectable antagonist, stagnate to the point of being tiring. We drag ourselves towards their conclusion no longer driven by the desire to know how things went, also because in most cases they can be easily anticipated, but by the need to put an end to that torture. It is a pity because, as we have mentioned, the characterization of some characters is exceptional, first of all Barok van Zieks (while the witnesses manage to be above all irritating): fighting him in court transmits the right feeling of adrenaline and when we counter his statements irrefutably, the satisfaction it is undeniable. We liked the understanding between Ryunosuke and Susato just as much, as well as the presence of Herlock Sholmes in his ambiguity, which represents the other novelty of the gameplay. In fact, when we are not busy asserting ourselves in court, it may happen that we have to solve small cases whose relevance could actually manifest themselves during the trials themselves: here, it will be the famous investigator who will lend us a hand through the ~Dance of Deductions~. This is a mechanic for which The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles, our trusted assistant Susato Mikotoba he will begin to unfold a series of bizarre theories, through which he will arrive at two conclusions as precise as they are erroneous which it will be up to us to put back in the right perspective (Course Correction) by analyzing the offending scene: it is difficult to say to what extent Sholmes is really the infallible detective being talked about, a role that seems to fall much more on the character of Iris Wilson, but the fact remains that her interludes are funny in their absurdity. They don't require particular skills, if not the patience to carefully observe part of the scenario to find the right detail to replace Sholmes' inconsistencies, but the characterization of the character and his relationship with Ryunosuke and Susato makes them all pleasant - however often have the strong temptation to strangle him. The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles, a moment where we dismantle Herlock's dance of deductions The Great Ace Attorney 2: Resolve is almost identical in terms of gameplay, just going to recover the fingerprint mechanics from the previous chapters. As already written, we preferred it as a story and cases, especially since the original chapter suffers from una management of tutorials, explicit or not, excessively frustrating: not only is the main tutorial far too long and verbose, covering practically the entire process, but the same introduction of the popular jury saw us remain more than half an hour helpless in front of the screen only to then be introduced to the aforementioned ~Summation Examination~. While taking into consideration that these are old games, we hope that in the future of the series there will be room for more immediate tutorials and less at the expense of our time. Above all because the series, in its main mechanics, is always the same. Having said that, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles stages a captivating story, adding as the only narrative novelty a series of small short stories (Escapades) that go into depth on some characters and for this reason we suggest playing them only once the game is completed. However, we are warned of potential spoilers when we want to start one. Graphically, the games make clear steps forward compared to the 3DS version but they are not excellent and in many cases the characters are rather angular. As for the localization, Italian is absent and considering the type of experience, even in the face of the use of slang and ways of expressing oneself related to the nationality of some characters, having a good knowledge of English is mandatory to understand what is going on.", "date": "2021-07-26", "grade": "8.0"}
