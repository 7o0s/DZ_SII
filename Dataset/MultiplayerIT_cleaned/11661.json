The beauty is that for the most part it even succeeded, Burnout Paradise is frenetic at the highest levels, fun, long-lived, and with an excellent control system, a godsend for any fan of the saga and arcade racing with that pinch of more madness. A few improvements here and there (especially in the interface which is not an interface) and an online with more personality would have positioned it even higher in our approval scale. Pro Fun and adrenaline-pumping Paradise City lives and teems with secrets Fluidity and extreme speed Cons Innovative but sometimes distracting interface High learning curve Online lag-free but not exciting Welcome to Paradise! The innovations brought about by Burnout Paradise are felt from the very first bars, when the voice of Crash FM, strictly in Italian (the game is completely localized in our language) illustrates its main features and what it is possible to do in Paradise City, a fictitious city built for the occasion, extensive and full of leaps, shortcuts, alternative routes and so on and so forth. The transition to the actual game is painless, the interface apparently does not exist, and we start with a car available, taken from the junkyard, which can be immediately repaired in some points of the map. It is therefore possible to explore it in its entirety right away, according to a free roaming concept dear to productions of other kinds and which allows you to immediately familiarize yourself with the controls and with its morphology, truly complex and which denotes maniacal care in every aspect. On the idea of making the gaming experience increasingly integrated and uninterrupted, to take part in the first competitions you don't have to select any menu, but instead just position yourself near a traffic light and press the R2+L2 keys at reduced speed to start one, the type of which is indicated in the lower right part of the screen. The most classic is the race against seven other opponents, which usually takes place from point A to point B and must necessarily be completed in first position, then the ~Man in the viewfinder~ mode is interesting, where three or more cars manage by the CPU they will try, with very good artificial intelligence among other things, to prevent the player from reaching a checkpoint before it is destroyed. Do not miss ~Murderous Fury~ where instead it is necessary to channel a pre-established number of Takedowns to the opponents within a time limit, which will vary according to the type of license possessed. Welcome to Paradise! The progression in the game is in fact entrusted to a sort of points scheme, which leads to the promotion of rank and provides events of increasing difficulty and a new machine. The remaining ones (there are 75 in all) can be acquired after being tracked down for the game scenario and inflicting a nice takedown on them; they will then be sent to the junkyard and can be used at any time. Finally, they are divided into three large categories, the aggressive, fast and stunt ones, which have, as can be easily understood, different qualities of agility, heaviness in clashes and so on. The stunt tests are among the funniest ones, because you have to take advantage of the numerous jumps present, the shortcuts and the turbo to quickly increase your score and therefore reach the one necessary to complete the test successfully. But that's not all, by pressing the L1 and R1 keys at any time it is possible to take part in the show trials, in which you have to destroy, literally by jumping, as many cars as possible, in order to earn money and overcome the record of each road. There is no shortage of any multipliers that are obtained by eliminating the buses on the streets of Paradise City. And again, positioning yourself at the beginning or end of a road, a stopwatch will start aimed at recording the best time on that stretch, a sort of Time Trial revisited in a new key, always on the altar of maximum integration for the player. These last two modes join a series of rankings, both offline and online, easily accessible by pressing the upper digital cross of the pad, which, for the record, in the Dualshock 3 version supports vibration and does it well. Critical, however, is the lack of the ability to reconfigure the game keys, something always welcome in a racing game, and therefore you have to ~make do~ with the lower backbones for accelerator and brake, and with the quadrato for that by hand. Impact and graphics The real protagonist of the game, in our view, is the map, because it provides a multitude of possibilities and offers extremely varied passages, ranging from coastal rather than mountainous areas, which thanks to a complete system of objectives suggest to delight in crossing billboards, finding all the jumps or shortcuts available. In short, there is always something to do, and all in absolute fun and frenzy, which in Paradise is further enhanced by the perfect control system and graphics. Sixty immovable frames per second, an exceptional sense of speed, perfect visual depth and many details are the technical visiting card of the Criterion production, which also boasts an excellent sound sector, above all as regards the reproduction of the racing cars' engines and of the clashes. If we analyze in detail we certainly notice some flaws such as an unimpressive number of polygons or honest textures and nothing more, but the overall impact is absolutely excellent, above all because it is treated with skill in the most important aspects for a game of this kind. Precisely due to its nature focused on extreme freedom, at the beginning it is rather chaotic to juggle the map and above all to successfully complete some types of races, because there are so many roads, shortcuts and the very high speed risks causing many clashes if the route is not well known. The learning curve, we would dare to say strangely due to the type of game, therefore turns out to be quite long, but certainly satisfying as the hours of play go by. A second problem lies precisely in the fact that there is no option to restart immediately in a lost competition, but it is necessary to return to the starting point which often risks being minutes away from the current point. It is true that the concept of Burnout Paradise is to take part in competitions that are on site and then return to those previously lost at a later time, but equally such an option would not have displeased anyone, quite the contrary. Online too! The natural extension for a game of this kind is the online component, which can be accessed in an absolutely transparent manner by pressing the right digital arrow. In this case you can compete with people on your friends list, create your own race from one point to another and also save it for later use, or take part in one of the available competitions, which represent a subset of those offline. In this sense we would have expected more; moreover, precisely because in Paradise the best things are obtained by interacting with the map even offline, the online mode, albeit fun and with various accompanying statistics, does not add much to the gaming experience. As positive notes there are a practically absent lag (but it is to be confirmed as soon as the game will be available in stores in the next few days) and the interesting and nice use of the PlayStation Eye (and the equivalent Live Vision Camera on Xbox 360) to shoot the photo for your driving license and send your snapshot to the other players following, for example, having undergone a Takedown, a feature certainly aimed at increasing the sense of identification, complicity and fun with other human opponents. Finally, the presence for voice chat is inevitable.", "date": "2008-01-22", "grade": null}
