{"name": "Burnout Revenge - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/burnout-revenge-recensione.html", "text": "R for Revenge Burnout Revenge immediately denotes a marked aptitude for restyling, already evident from the new (but not unforgettable) introductory video and from the various cosmetic solutions adopted for the menus and loading screens. Although far from being transcendental, the cleaning and finishing work of Criterion in this sense is nonetheless commendable, thanks to the deletion of superfluous elements -which in one way or another ended up weighing down navigation- and to the general embellishment of the look of the screens. And the term ~embellishment~ is perhaps the most suitable way to describe Burnout Revenge in its entirety, obviously starting from a decidedly non-next-gen technical sector but not even slavishly reproposed without any modifications. As it is reasonable to expect, graphically the game gains on Xbox 360 more than anything else in terms of definition, showing in particular textures that are more accurate and equipped with a better bump mapping effect, but obviously everything stands out exponentially with the complicity of a good HDTV system. The term ~beautification~ is perhaps the best way to describe Burnout Revenge in its entirety R for Revenge However, the improvements do not stop there, and can include slightly enriched polygonal models, even more massive and spectacular light effects (a note of merit goes in particular to the explosions, which are truly excellent), a considerably greater fluidity and, last but not least, a upgrade to the management of collisions between cars: in addition to deforming and losing pieces in an even more convincing way than before, the cars of Burnout Revenge now scratch, lose paint and get dented as the impacts follow one another during a race, arriving at the finish line almost always in pleasantly disastrous conditions. The restyling work also involved the already excellent sound of the Criterion title, which in this new version enjoys even more varied and powerful effects, which accompany the succession of events on the screen with enviable effectiveness. In the end, the only technical objections that can be raised to the developers concern some - sporadic - slowdowns in the action and loading times that perhaps could have been shorter. Everything else is Burnout Revenge to the nth degree. Play it (un)safe Surprisingly in some ways, Burnout Revenge does not limit the finishing touches to the audiovisual department alone, but carries out a reduced but painstaking labor lime also in terms of gameplay, obviously without distorting its winning formula (and for all the details regarding the play structure, we refer you to the review of the PS2 and Xbox versions at this address). Hence, the Criterion title offers the user the well-known plethora of competitions within the mammoth World Tour, the real single player soul of the game: over 160 medals to be won among the various specialties (Race, Traffic Attack, Tour Unleashed, Road Fury, Eliminator, Grand Prix), with cars and special events to unlock, within eight scenarios that host tracks with an attractive design and tasty full of shortcuts. It goes without saying that facing the road tests remains an exhilarating experience even on Xbox 360, with the adrenaline-pumping gameplay typical of the series which benefits from the greater fluidity of this latest version proving - if possible - even more capable of taking your breath away at the user. Burnout Revenge does not limit the finishing touches to the audiovisual department alone, but carries out a reduced but painstaking labor lime also in terms of gameplay Play it (un)safe The filings we mentioned earlier concern some tweaks to the opponents' AI and the elimination of real ~hiccups~ such as the external camera set as default and the golf game-style starting indicator as regards the scenarios Crash. In short, Burnout Revenge on Xbox 360 proves to be more enjoyable than the previous incarnations and is therefore undoubtedly the best choice for those who have not had the opportunity to play the last chapter of the EA course series: conversely, it should also be emphasized that this ~cleaned up~ version of the Criterion title does not ultimately present sufficient reasons of attraction for those who have already had to deal with it. And yes, because moreover Burnout Revenge on Xbox 360 brings with it not only strengths, but also some defects: above all the perhaps excessive length of the World Tour mode, which tends to become repetitive also due to the obligatory repetition of the same eight tracks and related variants. Live from the streets On the other hand, an aspect that Criterion has taken care to expand to the fullest is that relating to the Live functionality of the gioco, actually more substantial in this Xbox 360 version. Again nothing particularly shocking, but at least the effort to add something has been there and should be valued. First of all, Burnout Revenge allows you to record and share clips of your best performances with Live users, simply by recording them during the replays that conclude each race: it is therefore possible to show the world your exploits and at the same time admire those of the most skilled, for a playful element that is perhaps a little impromptu but still pleasant. Speaking of actual online play, Burnout Revenge features a leaner and more user-friendly menu structure, and above all an interesting memorization system of the opponents you play against: essentially, the game takes into account the Takedowns suffered by the user or made by him to the detriment of others, thus prompting the furious pursuit of revenge whenever one is faced with an old ~enemy~. For the rest, Burnout Revenge online works like a marvel, certainly better than the previous versions, but even in this case not to the point of pushing PS2 and Xbox veterans to buy. Comment Burnout Revenge is certainly a title that suits the Xbox 360 line-up: and it could not be otherwise, considering that it is the revised and corrected version of the undisputed king of arcade racing games. Leveraging on an improved audiovisual sector and on a granite gameplay filed with some imperfections, Burnout Revenge may not be the maximum expression of the next-gen concept, but it is still a product that no ~virgin~ user of the last chapter of the series should let slip. For all those who have already explored it on Xbox or PS2, however, this latest version probably does not offer sufficient reasons to justify a new purchase. Pros The best arcade racing game on the market Technical section perfected Impeccable live features Cons Some sporadic slowdown long repetitive Let's face it: the announcement of the conversion of Burnout Revenge on Xbox 360 has aroused more than a few suspicions. The fact that the title was put on sale for a new console despite its backwards compatibility immediately induced malicious and non-malignant people to shout at the sinister commercial operation, a move designed ad hoc to simultaneously force new and old users to buy a new copy of the game. But after a careful analysis of the EA product, similar conspiracy theories do not struggle to slip away, driven by the continuing excellent quality of the Criterion racing game and by some visible technical improvements.", "date": "2006-04-07", "grade": null}
