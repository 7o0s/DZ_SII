But the present here Mighty Switch Force is the first title developed exclusively for the online store of the latest Nintendo portable, of which it does not particularly exploit the characteristics, however managing to carve out a prominent space for itself. Female hooligan That ~Mighty~ placed as the first word of the title makes us clearly understand how much WayForward considers this game as the third episode of a series that also includes two of the three software mentioned in the opening paragraph. However, what binds these three episodes is essentially limited to their hybrid nature of platform and puzzle, as the other elements (story, setting and the same basic concept) have little to do with each other. In this case we are in a technologically advanced future, populated by funny cartoony robots and in which the police, grappling with old problems, are helped by new technologies. Patricia Wagon is the name of the protagonist, and if it is a futuristic cybernetic organism half woman and half machine, her goal is as old as justice itself: to recover escaped prisoners, namely the Hooligan Sisters, a band of five sisters who at the beginning of each level he manages to escape from the clutches of authority to scatter and hide in the most improbable ravines. If from the screenshots around here you could get the idea of a traditional platform game in which to reach the end of each level after having explored it well, thus discovering the refuge of each of the five fugitives, know that in reality there is a strong puzzle component, which it conditions the gameplay and the very structure of the levels, often and willingly small by extension but full of things to do and areas to visit several times. Patricia can actually jump and shoot like any Mega Man, but the idea behind this puzzle component is the possibility for our agent to change the arrangement of some of the level's platforms: in particular with the simple pressure of a key, and here even if only vaguely the characteristics of the machine come into play, those platforms that are in the foreground will become part of the background, and vice versa for those that were already in the background. All this allows for the presence of various puzzles that first require ~intellectual~ planning and then a practical solution that also involves the player's reflexes and pure videogame skills. We are just describing a basic situation to give you an idea and not spoil the pleasure of discovering the more ~fanciful~ ones for yourself: to overcome a crevasse in a platform generally we have a series of blocks arranged in a more or less regular way. Imagine now that some of these platforms are not on the same level as the protagonist, who therefore has to worry about moving them but being able to do it only while jumping, because if he did it first the same block he is on would be moved to the background with consequent ruinous fall. The 3D effect In a game with 2D graphics, stereoscopic 3D cannot work miracles and limits itself to clearly detaching the various parallax levels from each other, which are numerous and this makes the visual experience even richer and more pleasant. But the 3D also gratifies the block-moving mechanic, which is visually much more noticeable when the effect is activated; it does not affect the gameplay in any way, but neither does it affect the always perfect fluidity of the whole, and this makes us lean decisively for a positive judgment and for the advice to always play with the active effect. The cyber arm of the law The imagination of the programmers has allowed, already with these few basic elements, to create a whole series of extremely imaginative and fun puzzles, but there are many other arrows in Mighty Switch Force's bow: first of all, we must consider the fact that the blocks, moving to the foreground, can damage both enemies, and sometimes it is the only chance to eliminate them, and the protagonist herself. Secondly, gradually along the course of the stages we find blocks with particular characteristics: from those capable of throwing Patricia and the enemies in a certain direction (and in certain situations we have long sequences of these, in which the timing necessaryor to move and activate them it reaches levels almost from Rhythm Game), to those that it is possible to ~fix~ in the foreground by remaining on it for a few moments, except to make them removable again as soon as they are abandoned. Without considering the features not related to the basic idea, such as explosive enemies which are the only way to eliminate certain obstacles. In short, a sarabanda of original and well-chosen ideas, exploited in an absolutely intelligent and stimulating level design: it is truly a pleasure to tackle the different levels and find yourself from time to time faced with completely new or already seen puzzles but always declined different; as we said, each stage is basically small enough, but structured in such a way that it has to be covered several times to reach a Hooligan Sister that may not be recoverable without first having done a certain thing elsewhere. A pleasure that however does not last long: their particular structure only partially hides the brevity of the levels, which are only 16 and which begin to offer a challenge, both intellectual and practical, actually notable only from just over half of the game. To get around this drawback, each of the 16 stages offers a time limit to beat: however, these times seemed unnaturally low to us, perhaps precisely to artificially lengthen the experience, and they can only be broken by memorizing the levels and actions to be perform in a very fast and precise sequence. Furthermore, they do not constitute a particular incentive to replayability except for perfectionists, as they do not penalize those who do not deal with it nor do they particularly reward the player who wants to put himself to the test. The brevity and the artifices created to hide it ultimately constitute the only defect of this Mighty Switch Force, a relative defect given the few Euros required: also from a technical and aesthetic point of view we have only good news, with very nice 2D graphics and full of details halfway between an American comic and a Japanese manga (the interlude drawings between one mission and another are delightful and comically sexy), and which, among other things, makes an excellent impression on the small 3DS screen thanks to large, animated sprites and numerous levels of parallax, and very good techno music perfectly suited to the spirit of the product. A defect in the graphic design can be found in the not excessive variety of backgrounds and settings, but this is a limit which, in a game intended for Digital Delivery, can also be overlooked.", "date": "2012-01-05", "grade": "8.2"}
