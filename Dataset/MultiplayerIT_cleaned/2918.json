If the answer to this question is yes, you are undoubtedly an advantage, because after seven years with the review of Surgeon Simulator 2 we are ready to put our imaginary degree in surgery back into the field. Developed by the Bossa Studios team (the same as the equally crazy I Am Bread), the second chapter of the Surgeon Simulator series arrived exclusively for PC on the Epic Games Store a few days ago, with the aim of bringing back all the features they have made its predecessor one of the most popular games by content creators on YouTube. For those who do not know Surgeon Simulator, we remind you that the effort of the London team was in fact noted above all for the hilarity aroused by some game situations, in which the player found himself breaking bones and slicing limbs with results often hilarious and surreal. In addition to bringing back the main features of the game released seven years ago, Surgeon Simulator 2 also tries to expand the dynamics of the gameplay, presenting some new features that are quite interesting on paper. We just have to go and find out how the test went in the operating room, between a scalpel and a leg to be replaced. New modes The main novelty introduced by Surgeon Simulator 2 is represented by a real story mode, which accompanies the possibility of playing a quick game. The story set up by Bossa Studios leads us to face a series of levels within a mysterious clinic, proposed at least in the initial stages as a place where ~anyone can become a surgeon~. We will soon find ourselves dealing with strange happenings within the structure, accompanied by a voice to which we never end up associating a face. From this point of view, the narrative proposed by Surgeon Simulator 2 is very similar to that of Portal, proposing an atmosphere dictated by the spirit of the series which tends towards a somewhat macabre humor. The plot itself is nothing particularly memorable, mind you, but it is sufficient to keep the player motivated to move forward and conclude the story mode. In case of problems, this time it is also possible to ask for help. The second novelty of Surgeon Simulator 2 is in fact the fixed presence of a cooperative multiplayer for up to four players, who therefore find themselves having to collaborate to try to bring home the level of the round. But it is precisely in these novelties that the game begins to discover the side towards some defect, as matchmaking almost always ends up not finding anyone within the servers. When you finally manage to find someone who participates in the same game, the characters begin to lag moving almost to the limits of teleportation, effectively making the cooperative game for which the Bossa Studios effort was designed impossible. The only lifeline is represented by the online presence of some friends, also to prevent people who only intend to make confusion end up ruining the game. For the benefit of those who want to express all their creativity, Surgeon Simulator 2 also offers a fairly powerful level editor. The most tenacious can thus give birth to crazy things, which can then be explored from within the game. It is precisely the creations of others that give Surgeon Simulator 2 a potentially infinite longevity, at least for the most loyal ones. The gameplay The heart of the game dynamics of Surgeon Simulator 2 remains quite similar to that of its predecessor. Through a deliberately difficult and imprecise control system, the player can move his character's arm up or down with a combination of mouse and keyboard, lengthening or shortening it as needed. It is also possible to rotate the wrist 360 degrees, as well as gripping elements such as saws, hammers, scalpels and other diabolical tools with which to clean out the entrails of the unfortunate Bob. Precision, at least in a high-level speech, is not required: if, for example, we have to transplant a heart, the operating procedure can easily be to split the ribcage and remove the lungs across the room, before reaching the objective. This time the player can also move within the scenario, jumping or crouching if the situation requires it. The surgical aspect of Surgeon Simulator 2 is in fact only a part of the gameplay studied by Bossa Studios for this sequel, which has also been given connotations of puzzle games. To access areas containing replacement organs the player often has to pull levers or solve amb puzzlesientali, including for example using parts of the body just removed to unlock doors. If in front of the operating table the deliberately crude control system puts Surgeon Simulator 2 in a position to express all its madness resulting in entertainment, unfortunately we must say that in solving the puzzles it is the controls themselves that make everything frustrating. We must also consider that the more advanced levels have been expressly designed to be played together with more people, which unfortunately, as already mentioned, becomes quite difficult with the current matchmaking system. Beyond a good story, the general impression that Surgeon Simulator 2 gives is that of having strayed a little too far from the spirit of its predecessor to try to offer a product with some novelties, which however fail to fit properly into the context of the series created by Bossa Studios. Graphics and customization From a technical point of view on Surgeon Simulator 2 there is little to say. In fact, it is not the game with which you will squeeze your new RTX 3080, thus making it affordable for most of the configurations present in our homes. We point out the possibility of changing the physical model of our character, with the possibility of customizing it by unlocking some aesthetic elements as the various levels are completed.", "date": "2020-09-04", "grade": "6.0"}
