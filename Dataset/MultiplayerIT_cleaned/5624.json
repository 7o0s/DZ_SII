Day Of The Tentacle, sequel to Maniac Mansion released in 1987 (included in an easter egg, even if not subject to review), can rightly be considered as an expression of popular culture with which many kids (including Italians) have grown up ) of the early 90s: a work with which Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman, the two main programmers, unknowingly became fathers of a large group of adventurers. The remastered version is a camouflage copy of the original one that can be recalled at any time Sometimes they come back Like any self-respecting masterpiece (or almost...) Day Of The Tentacle has not experienced enormous commercial success: at the beginning, according to the estimates of the creator himself, just under one hundred thousand copies were sold. The fame grew thanks to the critics of the time and the title became a real cult in the years to come, appearing at the top in more or less all the ~hall of fame~ that videogame information sites (and not only) have compiled . The legendary Bern in the laundry Commercial logics therefore wanted this sacred monster to pass under the gallows of modernization: a damned dangerous practice that risks sacrificing the charm that a production of this kind carries with it, distorting it to meet the favors of an enormously larger audience. heterogeneous and, let's pass the term, less ~hardcore~ than the one that over twenty years ago juggled with the configuration of the autoexec.bat to start the title from the DOS prompt. The front of the old guard, to which the writer belongs, is usually very reluctant to this type of operation, but it must be admitted that, in the case of Day Of The Tentacle Remastered, the update work was wisely limited to a very adherent graphic redefinition to the original ideas of LucasArts and to a slight simplification of the SCUMM interface which however has remained conceptually unchanged. The result is a 1 to 1 copy of the original: fortunately no additions of any kind have been made, so much so that, if desired, it is possible to complete the title in the venerated and very pixelated 90s version - just press the F1 key to do a step back in time, just like that of Hoogie, one of the three protagonists of the game. Get your handkerchiefs ready The future of humanity is threatened by the megalomaniac Viola tentacle who, after drinking radioactive water, acquires super powers with which he wants to subjugate humanity: he is captured, together with his milder test-tube brother, by his creator, the scientist crazy Fred Edison who decides to eliminate both creatures to avoid the catastrophe. The effects of pollution will lead to the end of humanity The clumsy doctor Bern Bernoulli arrives to help the defenseless Verdone accompanied by a couple of assistants: the psychotic student Lavigne and the aforementioned Hoogie, a worthy exponent of the roadie category. The rescue attempt is unsuccessful because Viola manages to escape: to stop him from his diabolical plans it will be necessary to go back a day, thanks to the prototype of the time machine just developed by the good Edison. As easily predictable, even this move doesn't work properly: while Bern remains anchored to the present day, the two boys are catapulted 200 years into the past (Hoogie) and 200 into the future (Lavigne). Initially instead of the stars there was supposed to be the pacifist logo... The fil rouge that connects them passes through the lavatory of the cabin of the time. The player will then find himself jumping between one era and another in an attempt to put things right and save the human race. One of the most successful aspects of Day Of The Tentacle is the very witty plot, which was also written by Ron Gilbert, father of the SCUMM engine and Monkey Island. Our heroes will often find themselves in paradoxical situations just as absurd, but not without logic, are the numerous puzzles whose resolution allows the plot to continue. The three protagonists will have to help each other by throwing seemingly insignificant objects down the toilet: so it will happen that the advertisement for a vacuum cleaner will end up influencing the American constitution, making the possession of the appliance a right for everyone in the future, which will come in particularly useful in the scenery of Lavigne. The level of challenge is quite interesting for those approaching the title for the first time: naturally a little less for those who remember every step of the game by heart, considerndo that, as mentioned, it is a faithful replica of the original. Despite the weight of the years everything still works wonderfully: using the new user interface, clicking on the hotspots a radial menu appears in which you can only choose between the actions actually available for that type of object (for example you cannot talk to a washing machine , an action that was instead contemplated in the old release). This setting makes navigation in step with the times and at the same time allows you to use the very heretic joypad (the title is in fact also available for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita). Respect for the source Our three heroes ready for a time jump To give new life to her masterpiece Double Fine relied on Yujin Keim who had the blessing of Peter Chan and Larry Ahern, the two original designers: the result is truly commendable, because the artist has faithfully respected the 1993 sketches , reproducing in high definition what once could only be imagined. The possibility of jumping, in real time, from one version to another by pressing a button still deserves applause, just to remember how it was played in the past and at what point modern technologies have reached. The soundtrack has also been remastered and integrates seamlessly with the visuals just as it did back then. Furthermore, the possibility of activating the programmers' comments is a very welcome option that adds a touch of replayability to a title that will take about ten hours to be brought to the end credits.", "date": "2016-03-28", "grade": "9.0"}
