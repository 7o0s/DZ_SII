The formula is the classic one, four maps, a new weapon, and obviously the inevitable (and highly requested) Ezo Zombies mode. Equally classic is the price: fifteen euros. We want to know if the classic salty price is right for the quality of the contents. For the quantity it is better not to talk about it. So let's try to understand how much good there is in this first Havoc package. It being understood that it will not change the mind of all those who see DLC as a sinister, but legitimate, commercial operation. First DLC for Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare among the usual content and jumping zombies! The Devil's Tower Let's start with the four maps, all brand new, fortunately none of them are a reissue of old levels in an ~advanced~ version. The most colorful and exuberant of the lot is undoubtedly Sideshow. It is set at the foot of the Devil's Tower, the iconic mountain seen in Close Encounters of the Third Kind: we are inside the enclosure of a hotel with a clownish/house of horrors theme, with obvious references also to the Far West, they are not for the typologies of houses and huts, but also for the presence of the entrance to the mine. The map is not particularly complicated at ground level, the large spaces allow long lines of fire, you can enter several houses, complete with raised ~courtyards~ for a good glance. In addition to the roofs of the structures, trucks and cars, there is no shortage of extremely raised points on which snipers can really enjoy themselves, such as the tall Clown Inn sign that stands out in the center of the map. A very large battlefield, where the wide open spaces make players move with extreme caution, too exposed to crossfire, even from long distances. Core instead takes us to the Gobi desert, for a map set inside a decidedly labyrinthine and tortuous industrial complex, among the crumbling ruins of the structures, gutted buildings, tunnels, bottlenecks, such as those of the gigantic machinery, and raised points that are truly not too numerous. A decidedly unopened circular map, more ~normal~ given its complexity than Sideshow, featuring a ground layout full of rubble, low walls and ruined buildings and collapsed silos that make racing through the narrow ~alleyways~ perfect for lethal ambushes. Intricate isn't just about close combat. Leaving the central structures, the spaces widen and it is not uncommon to come across luxuriant vegetation that dilutes the persistent ocher color of the map. A nice battlefield, classic if you like, but definitely well thought out. I zombie, you zombie, he shoots! Urban is a very small map, with a layout similar to a square; consequently it is very fast and frenetic, perfect for accumulating kill after kill, or on the contrary for dying a lot of times. One hundred percent close-quarter urban combat, with parts of the scenario that open up after a few minutes, where in any case the possibilities offered by the suit are put to the test. However, it is not a trivial and flat battlefield, two-three storey buildings located next to each other give us considerable jumping points, without forgetting the possibility of entering many buildings, from ~garages~ up to the upper floors. The classic map in which, turning the corner, you can get a sonic shotgun shot in the face, but in the same way the verticality - still present - gives us a never dull and satisfying gunplay. Without a doubt the most chaotic battlefield in the pack. Finally we have Drift, a decidedly large map set in a sort of alpine village / shopping center in the middle of winter, complete with snow, an old-fashioned carousel, Christmas trees, lights, booths and many shops that advertise sales that you cannot pass up . It goes without saying that you will be able to enter many of these shops, the map is not flat, it is in fact on several levels, with ascents and descents, obviously without forgetting the roofs and terraces to jump on. There is no shortage of large spaces for long firing lines, for a decidedly ~average~ battlefield, perfect for all types of players and gunplay. There is also an avalanche that submerges the highest part, the one towards the mountains, of the map, effectively creating a whole new portion of the level. In terms of maps, Havoc is not surprising, but without a doubt the level design work is by no means a failure. The four new theaters of war of our armed raids will never become classics, but at the same time they will never be discarded regardless of the rotation. And then there's obviously the zombie mode. The big names in Hollywood are back to narratively ~frame~ the usual cooperative massacre dthe zombies, this time far more gymnastic and jumping than in the past. Bill Paxton, John Malkovich, Rose McGowan and Jon Bernthal are the mercenaries called to clean up the usual mess unleashed by the usual bad multinational, Atlas in this case. We start slowly, without the suit, but once recovered the zombies will also have them, making everything even more difficult and ~complex~ than in the past. Complex and complicated like the base that gradually opens by spending the credits earned, in the typical way of this mode. Nothing to say about this extra content, except that it is an extra, and not a type of game as usual included in the basic package. We close with the unprecedented AE4 rifle, a directed energy weapon, decidedly precise and very powerful, even from long range. Just a pity (long live balancing!) that the reload is very slow and that it cannot penetrate the covers. A weapon therefore for specialists, ~caciaroni~ players stay away from it.", "date": "2015-02-24", "grade": null}
