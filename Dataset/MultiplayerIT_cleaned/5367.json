{"name": "Lets Sing Abba", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/lets-sing-abba-recensione.html", "text": "With over 400 million records sold worldwide and many immortal hits to their credit - ~Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)~ and ~Dancing Queen~ just to name a few - Abba certainly don't need of presentations. And the same is true in the videogame field for the Let's Sing series, the protagonist of many pleasant evenings based on fun and karaoke. On the occasion of the band's reunion and the publication of Voyage, Abba's first album forty years after their sensational breakup, Let's Sing Abba wants to retrace the salient points of the Swedish quartet's career: it does so with a certainly conservative approach, re-proposing the same structure already tested in other ~monothematic~ chapters, such as Let's Sing Queen. Let's find out how it went in the Let's Sing Abba review, which we tested in its Nintendo Switch version. Lots of variety, some notable absentees The structure of Let's Sing Abba is the classic one of the series Let's Sing Abba offers 30 classic hits from the band, as well as ~I Still Have Faith in You~, the highlight of the last album. With a production of very high average quality like that of Abba, the selection could only be difficult: in the face of inevitable hits (~SOS, ~Waterloo~ ~Fernando~) there is no shortage of illustrious absentees (~Head over Heels~, ~Lay All You Love on Me~, ~Ring Ring~). Satisfying all the fans would have been impossible, but who knows - it could be the goal of a future DLC. The product is obviously aimed at a very specific target: fans of the music of the Abba. Not surprisingly, even the avatars are the four members of the band, who can level up and earn new costumes taken from the most famous looks of Agnetha, Benny, Bjrn and Anni-Frid. aesthetic - Let's Sing does not aim to offer an amazing experience from a purely technical point of view - but certainly something that will make fans happy. Microphone or app? Let's Sing Abba is, unsurprisingly, designed for fans of the Swedish band As usual for the series, the title is available on various platforms, namely Nintendo Switch (the version we analyzed), PlayStation and Xbox consoles, both old and new generation. Two different versions are on sale for the Nintendo console: the first, available at 39.99 euros, including the game only, while the second, costing 49.99 euros, also includes the USB microphone. If you have the opportunity, we recommend this second solution: the functioning of the microphone is really excellent, while the same cannot be said of the Let's Sing Mic app, available for iOS and Android smartphones. In addition to some input lag, we had problems establishing the connection between the device and the game software on several occasions, due to frequent error messages. However, this is a discreet option especially when using the multiplayer mode, to avoid having to provide microphones to all the participants (up to eight), provided you are prepared for some possible malfunctions: we encountered problems, in particular, in the establish the initial link with the game. This all happens by inserting a code provided by the game into the app, but often the code is rejected and you have to start all over again. Not to mention the rather frequent cases in which the connection is interrupted for no apparent reason: we specify that the test took place with an excellent fiber Internet connection, and therefore we can imagine that this problem may be even more felt by those who do not have available this option, which is not present throughout the Italian territory. Tons of game options Let's Sing Abba's multiplayer mode will be the heart of many parties As usual, this latest chapter of Let's Sing offers seven game modes. ~Legend~ offers the possibility to compete against an AI to beat with good intonation (the game does not understand the correctness or otherwise of the words spoken, it only counts to get it right and, if necessary, keep the right note), using one of the four avatars proposed and obtaining a satisfactory evaluation at the end of each level. It goes without saying that a good knowledge of Abba's music is a necessary prerequisite in order to obtain good results, but since it is a product openly aimed at the fans of the band, it shouldn't be a real problem. In ~Classic~, however, you can interpret it at will one of the thirty-one pieces proposed - classified according to their level of difficulty, which can vary from one to five stars - in solo or in four at most. The ~Feat.~ mode he sees us in a duet with a partner: at the end of the piece, an evaluation is obtainedion of affinity, while in ~Mixtape~ you sing to the rhythm of five excerpts chosen by the software or by the player with the composition of special playlists. Then we have the ~Jukebox~ option, the only one to unlock (not that it requires much effort: you only need to play one song) and perhaps also the least interesting: it is in fact a ~passive~ mode, in which you simply listen to the selected piece, without interacting in any way. Ideal for moments of pause in the evening... As for the LS World Contest, you compete against online opponents in order to climb the world rankings; finally, in what is perhaps the most iconic mode of Let's Sing (and the real reason for so many purchases), with ~Let's Party~ one to eight players can participate in team challenges or against the AI: whoever accumulates the the highest number of points. In short, nothing new under the sun: Let's Sing Abba has been proposing a formula that has been the same for years now, without providing any innovations. There is no doubt that the proposed modes work - provided you play in company: few things get bored as quickly as a karaoke done alone - and from a technical point of view the last chapter Let's Sing does not disappoint, except for the problems already reported in relation to the smartphone app, which is also compatible with other episodes of the series.", "date": "2022-10-21", "grade": "7.0"}
