What gains most from this characterization is strategic depth and, above all, longevity. The accentuated differentiation of the factions, in fact, makes each campaign replayable several times; and we don't say it just to say. Unfortunately, however, the campaign of the conquistadors can be the most boring in the long run, above all because all the management of the assault on the castle is missing. The villages of the natives have no walls and therefore the fighting very often translates into brute clashes, in which it is not even possible to position the troops at will, making it in fact difficult to develop alternative tactics to direct confrontation. It's also hilarious to see Native Americans using the military arrays typical of European armies. We understand that it was difficult to reconstruct the military techniques of each population, especially due to the game engine designed specifically for medieval battles, but we are also convinced that it could have been avoided to include a scenario that does not allow, by its nature, to participate to battles of the same level as the others. Perhaps the story of American colonization deserves a separate Total War. Obviously the other three campaigns do not suffer from these problems, since their settings are closer to the original and therefore do not have the same inconsistencies. Yet the European Middle Ages could offer ideas for dozens of other campaigns. That the developers have tried to involve US users more by staging a piece of their history? Hot oil From a gameplay point of view there are not many differences compared to the base game which, however, could hardly be improved. The mechanics of the battles, now tested by the vast experience made by Creative Assembly in the creation of the various Total War, are those that fans of the series know and love well, while the strategic mode offers no surprises, if not an expanded management of the aspect religious, which however does not change the way the matches are played very much. In reality, there have been some additions to the fighting, such as the boiling oil that is thrown on the opposing attackers when the fortress is sufficiently developed or the possibility of leading one of the two armies in multiple battles, however being able to switch from one to the other at any time. In general, however, even here there is not much new to report. As usual, it will also be possible to play in single scenarios unrelated to the campaigns (not very many, actually). But now there are some shortcomings. For example, while being able to organize skirmishes in each campaign, it will not be possible to make armies from different campaigns collide (no Teutonic knights against conquistadors), this is probably due to the structuring of the game into four distinct parts. Too bad because greater versatility in this sense would have been welcome and would have expanded the interest of the online mode. unfortunately, however, the campaign of the conquistadors can be the most boring in the long run, above all because all the management of the assault on the castle is missing Hot oil Another flaw, concerning the sound, is the use of the same voices for all factions. Hearing an Apache chief called ~Mighty Lord~ is a little funny and, even if you get used to it immediately, the use of different and more suitable voices for the various armies would not have hurt. From a technical point of view, there isn't much to say given that, substantially, what has already been tested in the base game is also found in this expansion: well-characterized and accomplished troops, spectacular battles in which thousands of men take part, a maniacal reconstruction of different settings and the usual high quality textures. Even the new battlefields are made with the same care as always. What more could you want from an expansion?

If you loved Creative Assembly's latest effort, you can't miss itturn this package, also because four extra campaigns are no small thing, especially so well-kept and vast. Also don't underestimate the new material for playing online, which further extends the longevity of the game. Nothing revolutionary, but certainly a huge and very welcome confirmation. While waiting for Empire: Total War we couldn't ask for better. Pros Four extra campaigns Dozens of hours of gameplay await you Many new units Cons The conquistadors' campaign isn't very well-finished A few small additions to the gameplay would have been nice It is not possible to make the troops of the four campaigns fight each other The installation of Medieval II: Total War Kingdoms is long and divided into four phases in which as many additional campaigns are installed. Each campaign can be started in a distinct way so as not to confuse the saves and the settings and is set in a different territory during a particular historical period, not only in the Middle Ages: the American campaign puts you in the shoes of the Spanish conquistadors, ready to do anything to take the control of the new world discovered by Columbus; the campaign of the crusades allows you to participate in the so-called Crusade of the Kings, which began in 1189 and ended in 1192; the British campaign, on the other hand, is concentrated on the war for the dominion of the island disputed between the populations scattered throughout the territory; finally, the Teutonic campaign represents the fight against the pagan populations carried out by the fearsome Teutonic knights. The common thread that connects all the four events, and which gives complete meaning to this expansion, is the importance given to religion and the characterization of the armies that make each campaign unique. In short, the conflicts will be both military and cultural, and it will be necessary to learn to manage the troops in a very different way depending on the faction chosen. Let's take for example the campaign of the conquistadors where choosing to be on the side of the Spaniards rather than on the side of the natives will completely change the strategies to be adopted in battle, much more than what happened in the base game: the Spaniards can count on more developed technology, and therefore on much more powerful weapons than those of the local populations, while the natives are quantitatively greater than the invaders and must compensate the disadvantage in the equipment with actions of force based on the quantity.", "date": "2007-09-11", "grade": null}
