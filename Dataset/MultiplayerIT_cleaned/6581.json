{"name": "Mostri al macello", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/144682-deathtrap-mostri-al-macello.html", "text": "Conceived as a spin-off of the successful The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing saga, Deathtrap, as we specified in our recent trial of the Early Access version, represents a natural evolution of some of the tower defense concepts already expressed in the main series, from which it takes also borrow several role-playing ingredients, thus winking at hybrid products like the delicious Orcs Must Die and Sanctum. The bet of the Hungarian software house Neocore Games is justified by the good commercial success encountered by the genre, which in this case, in addition to translating the same and obscure stylistic figure appreciated in the adventures of Van Helsing, is embellished with some interesting features that expand its medium-long term appeal, a historical weak point for this type of product due to a certain underlying repetitiveness. After having completed it and having analyzed the various methods, we can confirm that it is a won bet. Neocore Games' latest effort is a successful mix of different genres! I'm coming too. No, you don't The monstrosities from the mysterious Ink, a parallel universe populated by evil creatures, knock on the door of the house cyclically crossing the inevitable portals, in this case locked up inside some fortresses to stem the threat. One step away from the new invasion cycle, three different heroes, namely a warrior, a sorceress and a hunter, with a surge of pride stand as the last bulwark in defense of civilization, ready to drive back the waves of abominations. This, broadly speaking, is the simple plot of the latest effort by Neocore Games, where the player, at the command of one of the aforementioned heroes, must kill all enemies - either by attacking them directly or through deadly traps - before they manage to pass the core of each of the thirteen levels present, under penalty of the inevitable Game Over. The three heroes represent classes traditionally available in role-playing games, and differ from each other in their intimate approach to battle; the hunter, for example, is a character comparable to Van Helsing himself, thanks to the mix of ranged and melee attacks, as well as the ability with potions; the warrior, a classic tank, instead prefers close combat and can be equipped with war hammers, halberds, broadswords and the like, while the sorceress uses the dark arts (linked to the elements such as fire and ice) to keep threats at a distance. By advancing in the campaign and leveling up - the level cap is set at 100 - you can unlock a plethora of powers in the skill tree, which is specific to each class and capable of dramatically expanding the strategic approach, thanks to passive and active. The warrior, for example, at startup has a short-range freezing shock wave and a physical malus to be launched on all enemies on the map, however, progressing in the game it is possible to unlock a sort of chain that traps monsters (dragging them within hammer range) and an ice vortex that creates splash damage. The tactical options are therefore multiple, and at the end of each level it is essential to invest the points accumulated in battle to improve the power, duration and effects of the various skills, which can be used with the mouse keys and keyboard numbers. Despite the remarkable effectiveness of direct attacks, the portals pour waves of enemies against the player such that they cannot be stemmed by a single warrior, thus forced to rely on the so-called traps, a key element of any self-respecting tower defense. In Deathtrap there are 25 of them, with a total of 150 upgrades to unlock: among them we find simple machine guns, saw launch mechanisms, pillars that shoot lightning and freezing rays, pools of acid, spiked floors, allied creatures and much more, as well as to special towers linked to some specific scenarios. Each level of the campaign consists of a handful of waves with increasing difficulty, until the inevitable arrival of the big and very bad final boss, the only one able to immediately decree the game over, if he manages to reach the core of the map. In addition to the thirteen basic levels, playable in three distinct difficulties and various customizable tiers, there are some bonuses that are unlocked at the end of the game, moreover they can all be tackled in Scenario or Endless mode, with specific conditions that allow you to accumulate more experience points or gold to spend in the shop. In fact, between one turn and another, in addition to being able to improve skills and traps, the player can buy more effective equipment, or build it through a simplesimple crafting system. All levels can be tackled in the fun online cooperative mode, while the rather limited PVP also offers an interesting asymmetrical gameplay, where the attacking player can directly take control of the various monsters, through a very fast light spirit. Among the most interesting features of Deathtrap there is undoubtedly the deep editor linked to Steamworks, which allows the creation of customizable scenarios from multiple points of view. There are already many of those created by the community during the Early Access phase, which ended on February 4th. Monsters & Co. Developed through the Coretech proprietary engine, already appreciated in the two chapters of The Incredibles Adventure of Van Helsing, Deathtrap is not only characterized by the same artistic direction of the main saga, where steampunk elements merge into a gothic macabre, but there is also a certain recycling of elements, especially as regards textures, enemies and structures. Naturally, there is no shortage of new ad hoc introductions, and the well-animated and varied bestiary ranges from small fast creatures to flying monsters, passing through mighty golems, armored automatons and other amenities, mostly fished with both hands from Slavic literature. As we underlined in our previous test, the graphics of the menus and the various windows in the game are a bit too ~sophisticated~, and sometimes a little confusion is generated with the color palette. Sometimes, for example, during the most chaotic battles we happened to sell a trap instead of checking or enhancing it. Overall, however, while not stupendous in terms of effects and polygonal mass, Deathtrap's graphics are pleasant and with a certain personality, as is the audio sector, which is also partly translated from the original saga.", "date": "2015-02-09", "grade": "8.0"}
