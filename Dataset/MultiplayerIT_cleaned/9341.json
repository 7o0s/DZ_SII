Appearing out of nowhere, sold for less than ten euros on PC and an integral part of the Orange Box on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, it managed to leave its mark on the brains of many gamers, despite an evident brevity and gameplay reduced to a minimum. . But paradoxically it was precisely this being a basic puzzle game that surprised, grafted onto a single game concept reiterated for the entire duration of the experience but each time with minimal variations to always return a feeling of freshness. And then when you least expected it, the game took an unthinkable drift, increasing the density of the obligatory path with a thin plot thread, barely perceptible but extremely pleasant once discovered and followed. A sequel was therefore clamored for by all fans eager to discover something more than Aperture Science, Chell and GlaDOS and, just under four years after the release of the original title, we find ourselves talking about its inevitable sequel. Of meta-stories, narrative and atmosphere Therefore, if the first Portal almost asked the player to investigate, to try to find out what really happened in the Aperture Science laboratories, the sequel is much more direct. The story shoots it in the player's face, without too many mysteries or roundabout words, with a long narrative canvas that is slowly eviscerated, with all the small plot pieces that slowly intertwine with each other through the nine chapters that make up the single player campaign and which conclude leaving the player with the inevitable questions of a universe that seems to never end and which appears increasingly intertwined with that of Half-Life. But at the same time it feels accomplished to finally understand what Aperture Science is; why Chell, the protagonist of the first chapter, retraced her steps after being able to escape from the absurd laboratories; what are the origins of GlaDOS, the magnificent artificial intelligence that sometimes acts as a nemesis, sometimes as a companion and other times as a cynical friend of the protagonist; and we still appreciate the entire narrative arc of Wheatley, the original comic companion of this sequel who on more than one occasion will stun us with the twists and turns that involve him. Everything works perfectly like a well-oiled gear, nothing seems to be left to chance and Valve plays all its cards masterfully to leave practically no doubts to the player who, in some situations, is even overwhelmed by information and his need to interpret it is practically reduced to zero. Perhaps this is the element that most detaches Portal 2 from its predecessor: there is no longer anything sibylline, just mentioned, almost secretly that needs to be discovered. In the sequel we will be literally overwhelmed with dialogues, pre-recorded messages, writing on the walls and all almost seamlessly for the 10-12 hours it will take you to complete the story in single. And if this amount of information is not enough, there is always the cooperative that opens the door to a further unedited campaign that continues in parallel to the main story by adding a slightly lower amount of hours than the single player, albeit much more focused on the puzzles versus the actual narrative. There is no doubt that as players we can only appreciate this longevity especially when linked so expertly to a story, but at the same time we cannot help but underline a decidedly subdued central phase of the single game, which is probably too ~stretched~, almost elongated. Surely it's nice to detach a little from the natural progression of the puzzles but perhaps more than a few passages are excessively repetitive, almost redundant, add very little to the gameplay and force us to put up with dialogues that are always pleasant but not so crucial. Unfortunately we cannot go into more detail to avoid spoilers but a few more classic puzzles and fewer walks through ruined places and disused offices would probably have helped the overall story. And while we're at it... ... let's talk about the puzzles that are the real protagonists of the sequel. All readers who have tried even for five minutes to play the predecessor will immediately find themselves at home since the game concept is practically the same, enhanced with some new elements to complicate and vary the puzzles. For everyone elseinstead, at least a minimal explanation is needed. Portal 2 is a puzzle game with a first-person perspective. There are no enemies to kill or threats to defeat, except for the cute little turrets. Chell, our protagonist, has a single weapon available for the entire game: a rifle capable of opening two different portals on certain walls, one for entrance and one for exit. That's all. The player will have to face and go through rooms and scenarios interacting properly with all the environmental elements through the portal gun to reach the coveted exit. The game does not have a selectable level of difficulty but obviously as you progress through the adventure the puzzles will become more complicated and alongside the usual company cubes to be placed on a few buttons or sentient turrets to be avoided and demolished, tractor beams will appear whose flow can be reversed, spring platforms, bridges of light and, about halfway through the campaign, we will also have to deal with the acceleration and repulsion liquids that Valve has wanted to show since the first trailers of the game and with a special paint capable to transform inert walls into areas where it is possible to create portals. The learning curve is absolutely perfect in its gentle steepness and very rarely will you find yourself in incomprehensible situations or where it is not clear how to unravel the puzzle. And in this sense the automatic saves are perfectly implemented which manage to flawlessly take into account the individual progress made in each room in order to avoid the player having to repeat the more complex sequences of skills if for some reason he loses his life after a few falls or riddled with bullets from turrets. Inevitably it will happen to get stuck during the most difficult puzzles: the only hope is that this does not happen during the central tired phase because you may find yourself not very stimulated to continue the adventure. But don't give up: usually within a few minutes the inevitable stroke of genius will arrive to resolve the situation. Who doesn't play together Portal 2 does not offer any type of competitive multiplayer but, as already written above, contains a full-bodied cooperative mode for two players that can be tackled in split screen, system link and of course Xbox Live. The developers themselves wanted to point out that this second campaign is strongly recommended only for those who have already completed the single player and the motivation is easily explained. In fact, you find yourself in the shoes of two robots equipped with portal guns, P-body and Atlas, grappling with five different paths of increasing difficulty to be tackled in sequence, each consisting of a variable number of rooms ranging between 6 and 9 . In this case the gameplay is strongly biased towards the puzzle component since the thin plot line is a mere tinsel, however pleasant and obviously we will have to deal with all the environmental elements already seen in the single player enhanced by the possibility of managing four different portals. two per robot. Cooperation really becomes a crucial element and it will be essential not only to talk to your partner but, in some situations, to be perfectly synchronized as well. In this sense, even if the system of gestures and visual signals that can be activated by pressing the backbone and the left analog of the pad meets the needs of players who may not know each other, our dispassionate advice is to make the most of the split screen because being side by side really allows you to fully enjoy what the title has to offer. Xbox 360 goals Portal 2 offers 50 overall achievements for the usual total of 1000 points. Two-thirds are related to the single-player campaign, its completion and some actions that must be performed within certain rooms or in the presence of precise plot implications. The remaining achievements are instead related to the solution of puzzles in cooperatives with a small handful that are unlocked by performing particular executions in combos with your partner. At a first single and multiplayer pass you will not struggle to unlock 500-600 points. Skinny? No, differently rich The technical aspect is undoubtedly the only element overlooked in Portal 2, obviously with the necessary clarifications. The Source Engine has now reached limits that can no longer be masked and if in Left 4 Dead this could already be noticed but was compensated for by the frenzy of an action where we find ourselves constantly surrounded by enemies, in this sequel from Valve we have plenty of time to look at each other around, indeed this action is an integral part of the gameplay. And it is impossible not to notice faded textures, repeated to the bitter endand poor in detail that combine basic and animated models with the bare minimum. The scenarios are always very broad and also offer a fair variety even if they appear rather static and perhaps excessively aseptic, also taking into account the stylistic choice adopted to characterize the Aperture Science laboratories. However, where the game improves its graphic fortunes is on the one hand in the very credible management of shadows and on the other in the behavior of fluids and more generally of all materials when subjected to physical interactions. From this point of view the Source combined with the Havok seems to have no rivals. Seeing crumbling walls, deforming pipes and interpenetrating rooms crumbling due to the thrust of hydraulic pistons leaves you amazed on more than one occasion. Of course Portal 2 doesn't have any kind of uncertainty in the frame rate. The absolutely excellent audio sector of the game deserves a separate discussion and worthy heir to what was heard in the predecessor. The title is only localized in the texts in our territory and this can only be a positive element if we take into account the excellent quality of the English dubbing, perfectly recited and with characteristic features for each of the main characters: from the wonderful female voice of GlaDOS to Wheatley's maniacal sympathy, passing through the dozens of recorded tapes. However, someone may turn up their noses being forced to read all those texts which, among other things, are not highlighted on the screen because they are written in white without an opaque background. The musical accompaniment with ambient and electronic tracks is also very good and the inevitable very catchy final song.", "date": "2011-04-19", "grade": "9.1"}
