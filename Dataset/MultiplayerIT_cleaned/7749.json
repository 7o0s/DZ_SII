On that occasion we had taken a look at the main features of the 2014 chapter by putting our hands in first person for a few minutes on the Xbox 360 edition. Now that we have been able to play the final release extensively both on iPad and on PC, we can however dedicate ourselves to a more in-depth evaluation of the game offer, obviously with the risk of repeating ourselves at least as regards the contents. Let's start with the single player. Magic 2014 like the prequel, tries to focus more on a narrative component by proposing a small story that is the background to the player's evolution through the tutorial, the various floors and the individual clashes. This time we will first have to confront and then help Chandra, a fire witch who fell victim to an ambush by a ruthless wizard who we will have to chase through five dimensional planes each consisting of four clashes with as many challengers. There will also be a sixth setting where we will limit ourselves to fighting against the final boss and another five separate encounters with as many Planeswalkers that we will always be able to face within the campaign but in any order. As if this weren't enough, once the main mode is completed, the additional Vendetta will be unlocked where it will be possible to face ten wizards again, each tied to a specific deck from the 2014 Magic edition, in a particularly fierce free mode. There are also challenges, much appreciated by the players of this digital version of the popular card game: ten in all divided between the initial ones and the advanced ones, even if, it must be admitted, all quite easy. Compared to the classic fights, the challenges are more reminiscent of the puzzles since they force the player to solve a specific fight in a single turn, finding the best way to exploit the cards in hand and those on the ground. In all other game modes, Magic 2014 - Duels of the Planeswalker follows the traditional rules of the card game created by Wizards of the Coast to the letter and for which we can recommend the Wikipedia page dedicated to the topic in case you want to know more. Want to start playing Magic? Duels of the Planeswalkers 2014 is made for you! You call it if you want, draft But the main novelty of this new digital chapter of Magic is the introduction of Sealed Play, the particular modality that many players of the physical card game know because it is among the most exciting and which is sometimes called Draft in a reductive way. By accessing this option, the game will provide us with two slots, each of which will allow us to ~unwrap~ six boosters to go and compose a library of at least 40 cards. With this deck we will be able to face a separate single player campaign consisting of five encounters and which will allow us to open three further sachets that we can use to further enhance our previously created deck. The library can also be used to play in an ad hoc multiplayer mode that will allow players to compete only with decks created through Sealed Play. To underline Wizards' desire to pocket some money is the fact that the two slots cannot be reset in any way: once the two possible decks have been created, we will have to spend real money (1.79 per slot for a maximum of 18 total slots) to be able to ~unpack~ the new sachets. Probably the slots that are granted to us when purchasing the game, which we remember have a freemium formula in the iPad and Android versions (the game is downloaded for free to access the first tier of challenges and can be unlocked in its full version at any time by paying 8 ,99), will be enough for most players to experiment and have fun with this component of the game, but we feel we consider questionable the choice of the producer not to leave total freedom to the player to try his luck again, with the risk that in PvP the imbalance against players who may have been much more fortunate in unveiling their 9 boosters is strong. In any case, the most interesting part of Sealed Play is the management of the library which finally becomes completely free: the deck can in fact be completely configured by choosing the cards to insert and even deciding the number of lands per color in a completely manual way. Through the management screen we will also be able to see on the fly the number of cards by type and the mana curve of our deck so as to make assessments about its speed. Furthermore, seqPerfectly matching what is the main purpose of the Duels of the Planeswalkers series, Sealed mode offers a series of consistent aids to newbies: from choosing lands to fully automatic decking starting from any number of cards chosen by the player. All managed by artificial intelligence. In fact, this year as well, it is clear that the Wizards of the Coast video game project is totally dedicated to those who have never played Magic live, have perhaps only heard of it thanks to some friends or know it briefly. You should never get this consideration out of your head because in fact, in the opinion of the writer, all the assessments on the impossibility of completely managing the library in the classic campaign and in multiplayer or on the lack of most Magic cards (Duels 2014 contains only a selection of the 14th edition core set of the card game) are useless and rather out of context. For those who play Magic regularly or in any case already have a certain smattering on the subject, it is certainly more suitable to turn to Magic Online or, even better, to the classic physical card game. All the rest As far as multiplayer is concerned, the offer of Magic 2014 remains rather limited: it is in fact possible to challenge each other only in 1 against 1 both with the Sealed Play decks and with the classic 60-card decks plus the 30 unlockable through the single player campaign . It is also possible to create custom duels in both Free for All and Two-Headed Giant with up to four players, obviously with the challengers controlled by artificial intelligence. On a technical level, the game is slightly more optimized and cleaned up than the 2013 edition, with an even more ~minimal~ and decidedly more configurable interface, especially as regards the various animations and the ~forced~ stops of the various phases. Now it is finally possible to ensure that the matches are particularly fast and free of aesthetic frills. As for our long test session, if on the one hand, with the PC version, we did not encounter any problems whatsoever, with the iPad mini version we instead noticed some problems. First of all, probably due to the not excellent hardware of the Apple tablet, all the computer graphics movies have noticeable slowdowns in the frame rate. Slowdowns that it is sometimes possible to experience even during the games, not so much in the fluidity of the graphics on the screen, but in the long pauses that the computerized opponent sometimes takes before making his moves. Although the game is graphically rather basic (as it should be for a card game, mind you), the loading times before the start of a match stand out and to complete the not exactly bright picture, it takes several bugs that on numerous occasions caused the application to crash during a fight, effectively forcing us to repeat the game. It is natural that these are side elements that do not undermine our evaluation of Magic 2014, but it seems fair to report them.", "date": "2013-07-08", "grade": "8.0"}
