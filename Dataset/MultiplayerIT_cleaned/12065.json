{"name": "Rush'n Attack - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rushn-attack-recensione.html", "text": "The game puts us in the role of an indomitable marine engaged in a bloody rescue mission in a Russian concentration camp. Armed only with the trusty knife and the weapons that he can find along his way, his task will be to go through a series of horizontally scrolling two-dimensional stages, teeming with enemy soldiers of all kinds. Let's pay attention to those in the blue uniform, since killing them will result in the release of some special weapons, from the flamethrower to the bazooka, which, although equipped with limited bullets, will prove to be of great help in completing the levels. The controls are limited to two single attacks, with the knife (we'll use it most of the time) and with the special weapon, while the stick is responsible for moving and jumping. It's really all here, the only aim is to get to the end of the stage by destroying anything that opposes us and the goal, in perfect line with the old arcade school, the lack of an energy bar means instant death on simple contact with the enemy. Technically Digital Eclipse has reproduced the original coin op in an absolutely faithful way, to tell the truth today considerably aged graphically, but for this the graphic update option comes in handy, which significantly distorts the appearance of the title. All the bitmaps have been redesigned with a vaguely cartoony style, a bit in contrast with the original one, but the animations have remained the same, with the protagonist taking an embarrassing stride. Nostalgics can however restore the original cosmetics. The problem that afflicts this edition for Live Arcade is another, and unfortunately not a small one: for reasons unknown to us, the developers have omitted any possibility of continuing a game after Game Over. It is an incomprehensible choice, especially for a title conceived as a chip-eater, and therefore decidedly demanding. It would have been enough to enable even a limited series of continues to maintain a consistent level of challenge, but in this way, although the game is very short, completing it in a single attempt is an unlikely and frustrating undertaking. The impossibility of playing in cooperative mode does not help, as the title only offers a questionable multiplayer option, where each player engages in his own game, and then adds up their respective scores in the online ranking. He could easily do without it. Comment Rush 'n Attack is a perfect transposition of the original coin op, also available in an updated version, which however did not completely convince us. The old Konami glory is still fun today, albeit in its extreme simplicity, but the impossibility of continuing makes the game too difficult to complete, without considering the boredom and frustration resulting from having to restart the levels every time. A missed opportunity, too bad... Pros: Still fun today You won't finish it in a hurry... Cons: ...If you finish it The lack of Continue unacceptable Unsatisfactory multiplayer The Konami classic line of XBLA is enriched by a new exponent, Rush 'n Attack, known by us as the Green Beret, a very successful coin op dating back to the eighties. For the first time, it is now possible to enjoy a perfect transposition of the cabinet on the console, in original or revised form, for only 400 mp.", "date": "2007-08-10", "grade": null}
