{"name": "Operation Winback", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/operation-winback.html", "text": "What a disaster The game opens with a real-time presentation that is well done, apart from the constant lack of anti-aliasing, and which sees the US Secretary of Defense preoccupied with threats from a dodgy terrorist group who intend to blow up the entire earth by means of a particular satellite whose detonator is located in a base occupied by the aforementioned criminal gang, the ~Crying Lions~. The name says it all. It will therefore be up to a group of specialists, the S.C.A.T., to thwart the threat with an operation called precisely ~Winback~. In the initial FMV, the special team is sent on a mission thanks to a helicopter which, strangely and for unknown reasons, has problems on the way that force the members to jump with a parachute after listening to the instructions of their boss. During the adventure, the player impersonates one of the members of S.C.A.T., namely, Jean Luc Cougar, a career rookie who wants to defeat any bad guy who wants to endanger the safety of society. Quite a good boy then. The action begins when he lands with his parachute right in the middle of a large group of bad guys ready to fire at anything that moves. So better stay still, you'll say. But no. As the primary objective is to infiltrate the terrorist-occupied base and disable the main detonator. Grab your BERETTA and fire! Graphically speaking, the game struggles to impress, presenting a fairly high detail combined with a chronic slowness of the animations. Needless to say, anti-aliasing doesn't exist either (sigh). The resolution is good and also the frame rate (we are talking about 50 fps). The real cosmetic problem is neither the detail nor the textures, which are of decent quality. It must be sought in the aforementioned extreme slowness that envelops the game and in the poverty of colors and settings (really meager and approximate). The latter are reduced, in fact, in some dumpster or some wall that serves to shelter from enemy attacks. The colors are too surreal enough to give the game an extremely ~playful~ look unlike what happens in MGS2. Or at least in the demo. Stealth mode Having read the previous lines, one might think that OW is an action game very similar to that masterpiece that is MGS. Nothing more wrong. In fact, the title in question of the Konami game has only the fact that you can take cover from enemy fire and you can take enemies by surprise, or behind you. Everything else is Game Over. In fact, the KOEI game suffers from a certain lack of variety and ~pure~ and frenetic action, the latter being too slow and heavy. Only by seeing the speed with which Jean Luc runs from one side of the screen to the other do we realize what awaits the player throughout the course of the adventure. The gameplay isn't exactly bad, on the contrary. The controls respond very well to impulses given to the joypad. Its real weak point is the lack of freedom of movement and action offered, which is limited to running, shooting, shooting and running Really too small and fluctuating compared to announced masterpieces such as MGS2 and DMC (although here we are on another planet). In the KOEI game the keys used are several and well distributed. With the directional cross or the analog stick the main character moves, with the square (combined with R1) you shoot, while alone it is used to collect items and to perform various actions (such as opening doors, climbing stairs, etc.) . With the X key you reload the weapon, while with the triangle you frame an enemy. With the other backbones and precisely with R2 and L2 it is possible to rotate the view to find the best shot in the rain of bullets that will fall on the poor virtual ego. All the action during the mission translates into a really repetitive ~shoot and reload~, which leads the player to get bored from the first minutes of the game. The latter problem tries to provide the presence of the multiplayer mode that allows you to organize real orgies of blood with three other friends. This is possible thanks to the presence of the good old split-screen that divides the screen into four parts thus giving rise to your most hidden homicidal delusions. The usable characters are very numerous and increase in number as the adventure progresses. Fairly pleasant but not that much as all the fun is a little limited by the lack of freedom of action. However, with friends you can have fun even with the worst video gameAim well and miss little. Operation Winback is an action game that offers very little, both in terms of originality and entertainment. However, the story changes if we refer to the multiplayer mode which is much more fun (virtually killing your friends is always fun). The KOEI title also suffers in terms of longevity undermined both by the possibility of completing the game in a few hours and by the fact that it is not very varied and therefore repetitive. The sound effects certainly do not compensate for the other negative notes, settling on mediocre levels. A separate discussion must be made for the dubbing which, although in Italian, was done in a rather poor way. A real shame if you consider that in our country most voice actors are highly qualified (have you forgotten Amendola yet?). In conclusion ~OW~ is a mediocre title that presents a hackneyed game structure that can only please those maniacs who anxiously await the great masterpiece MGS2 and are in abstinence from action games. The multiplayer mode alone fails to elevate the title in question and slightly lengthens the gaming experience offered to the user. Are you a fanatic of third person shoot and run? Buy yourself ~OW~ but be careful! Check it out first, you might still be disappointed. If, on the other hand, you like the action game and you are suffering like yours truly, wait for a certain Devil May Cry which will certainly brighten your hours of bloody outburst better. Stay tuned! A ~missed clone~ of Metal Gear Solid. There are not many supporters that KOEI has on its side, mainly due to some products on the various consoles of mediocre workmanship. And here, with this action game, the aforementioned softco tries to get out of the pit that it had dug itself some time ago with its own hands. Mission accomplished? Mmhh Not at all. In fact, the reviewed game has very few noteworthy features and no original ideas, just think that the N64 version released a long time ago is almost identical, except for the renewed graphic design which, being PS2, seems really minimal. It almost feels like the draft of MGS due to some similarities on a structural level (like gameplay and story). We are faced with a title that disfigures in comparison with others available on the market such as eg. ~Onimusha~.", "date": "2001-07-16", "grade": null}
