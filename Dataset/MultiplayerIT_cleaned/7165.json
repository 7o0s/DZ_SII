We have consequently modified the text and the final grade. The exploitation of Mario as an athlete reached its peak a few years ago, between Gamecube and Wii: in that period the plumber was in fact forced to switch from tennis to golf, from soccer to baseball and basketball, from sports from the winter to the summer olympics, from hockey and volleyball to dodgeball and dance. An exaggeration even for a multifaceted character like the mustachioed Nintendo hero, to the point that this saturation has led to an inevitable rejection of the public towards this type of production, which is not always impeccable from a qualitative point of view. A process that has given rise to a sort of ~natural selection~, allowing the survival of only those series based on disciplines actually similar to the skills of the good Mario and company. Among these, undoubtedly one of the most successful - and not coincidentally also the longest - is Mario Golf, developed by Camelot since the 1999 Nintendo 64 chapter. After 10 years of silence since the last episode, that Advance Tour for Game Boy Advance, Nintendo has finally chosen to step back on the green with a brand new title exclusively for Nintendo 3DS. Mario Golf: World Tour proves again that this is precisely the sport in which the plumber is best Drive envy Mario Golf: World Tour manages, from the very first moments of the game, to make it seem as if an entire decade had never really passed. There are those who could translate this feeling into a negative, criticizing Nintendo for the usual immobility that according to detractors distinguishes the productions of the Kyoto house. In reality, the familiarity in the gameplay is nothing more than the confirmation of the extraordinary care placed in the key elements of the most successful games: mechanics that have no expiration date, and that manage to remain fresh and enjoyable even after many years. Playing Mario Golf: World Tour is a bit like riding a bicycle: has anyone ever complained that there are always two wheels or that you have to pedal? So here is that the foundations are the same, which are also those exploited by most of the golf video games made so far: you choose the club, the direction of the shot taking into consideration the influence of the wind, after which with the first press of the button the power is determined, with the second the precision. Eventually you can also choose where to hit the ball, to give it effect or vary the height of the trajectory. A rock-solid base, on which Camelot wanted to add something anyway. See for example the management of topspin and backspin, with relative ~super~ versions, to be achieved by pressing combinations of the A and B keys at the end of the swing operation. But if all this should seem too complex for the more casual user, don't worry: in fact, automatic management can be activated at any time, which simplifies the matter as much as possible, leaving the player the pleasure of crossing the various paths. It should also be noted that the control system can be freely addressed in its entirety both via touch screen and with traditional keys: for our part we preferred the latter solution, but both are able to guarantee optimal results and good precision. Overall, therefore, Mario Golf: World Tour is confirmed as an arcade golf game with a very pleasant and fun gameplay, balanced and suitable for both short sessions and longer matches. Merit of the Camelot experience, the convincing exploitation of the mariesco universe, the simple painstaking quality of amalgam of the various ingredients and the splendid technical component. We already said it in the preview, but we want to repeat ourselves: Mario Golf: World Tour is undoubtedly one of the most technically beautiful games available on the Nintendo laptop, with a richness and vivacity of images that is only limited by the low resolution of the 3DS screen. The various courses then, in addition to always enjoying an interesting design of the holes and free of missteps, are enhanced by an exceptional variety of settings, which clearly distinguishes each of them. The characterization of the characters is also remarkable: seeing Bowser destroy the camera after a disappointing double bogey is really fun... Heavy sweater If the evaluation of the gameplay of Mario Golf: World Tour is therefore a rather simple and linear task, the discussion regarding the contents is less easy. Firstly because this time Nintendo wanted to adapt to one of the most ~hot~ trends, but also moreContemporary video games have been discussed: we are obviously talking about DLCs, i.e. additional paid content, even less digestible due to the availability of the first package immediately on the day the game is launched on the market. So far, three packs have been announced, destined to be released by the end of June, each capable of bringing with it two new eighteen-hole courses and an extra character. Anyone who wants to can take advantage of a Season Pass through which to get all the DLC at a cheaper price. This is evidently a turning point for Nintendo, in truth not particularly expected or desired: although in the past there had already been more or less timid attempts to enter this kind of sales mechanisms (see Fire Emblem: Awakening, or the free to play of Steel Diver: Sub Wars), it is precisely with Mario Golf: World Tour that the Kyoto house has most decisively chosen to take this impervious path full of pitfalls. The question is the usual: if some of this content is ready for day one, why was it not included in the game from the beginning? And is the latter rich enough not to make the purchase of DLC almost an obligation in order to enjoy a robust experience that gives an acceptable sense of completeness? Even on these questions, the answer is unfortunately not so immediate. The Camelot effort is in fact essentially divided into two macro sections, called respectively Mario Golf and Club Castello. The latter is none other than the famous ~RPG part~, which has now become a classic for the series: inside it, the player's Mii can interact with different characters, buy parts of his equipment in the boutique and face challenges and tournaments. In reality, those who really expect an RPG similar to that of Advance Tour will be disappointed: in fact, it takes a few minutes to fully explore each room, and the interaction with NPCs is practically of no use, except to receive trivial advice and rarely interesting. The external area, which is also very compact, is limited to guaranteeing access through two lanes to the individual paths; there are only three ~main~ eighteen-hole classics (forest, beach, mountain), once won, you will be able to watch the final credits sequence. But let me be clear, that's not all: you can then go back to the club to face training or, better yet, the particular challenges on the thematic nine-hole courses linked to the different characters (Peach, Yoshi, Torcibruco, Bowser's castle and so on). away) and especially to reach the basement area which is the entry point for local and worldwide online tournaments. It is therefore clear that the Club Castello is not an RPG at all, but rather a sort of hub for reaching the various areas of interest. The 3D effect Delightful, like the rest of the graphic component. The three-dimensional properties of Nintendo 3DS are fully exploited by Mario Golf: World Tour, giving a perfectly enjoyable and highly effective sense of depth. As usual, nothing essential, but those who appreciate stereoscopic vision will certainly find in the effort of Camelot one of the best results obtained on the Nintendo laptop. I would like to play online The story is different for the Mario Golf section where, by choosing from the abundant dozen characters available, it is possible to access a robust single and multiplayer offer via simple menus: the first, as well as allowing you to face structured matches on different types of requirements for victory (by strokes, points, holes or time) also provides a fun, challenging and varied collection of challenges. These may involve collecting coins or passing through rings, using a limited set of clubs, needing to complete three of a kind holes within minutes, and so on; each challenge won allows you to get a Star Coin to then unlock other courses. Then we talked about the multiplayer section, available both locally - up to four players, each with his own copy of the game - and online; in the latter case, and also taking into account the complementary contents present in the Castle Club, the offer becomes particularly interesting thanks to the presence of regional and world tournaments and Nintendo's commitment to organizing specific and particular competitions. The formula is that of competitions that remain open for a few days, during which anyone can participate trying to give life to the best possible performance. The data relating to it will then be sent online, to form the ranking which will be made public at the end of the scheduled period. A structure that should turn out to be enougheasily manageable by Nintendo even when the servers will be solicited by millions of players around the world. Usually a prize is guaranteed for participation (a fantastic set of Game Boy branded shoes, pants, shirt and visor is worth mentioning), while the overall winner can take home a rich jackpot in game coins. The variety of challenges offered is remarkable: at the time of our test there were traditional tournaments but also Gold Races based on the collection of coins, Flag Objective in which to get as close as possible to the flag with a single shot, Speed Golf where you complete a lap in the shortest possible time, One Drive and one Putt in which to try to reach the hole with just two strokes and the Best Drive Competition which rewards the longest drive. You can also create custom tournaments, public or private, to which friends can access thanks to an associated unique numerical code. It is therefore evident that the online component of Mario Golf: World Tour is certainly not a secondary element, but rather represents an extremely substantial and tasty slice of the offer created by Camelot.", "date": "2014-04-24", "grade": "8.7"}
