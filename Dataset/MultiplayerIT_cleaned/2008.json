{"name": "Tekken 4", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tekken-7.html", "text": "Namco returns to beat from orbi! From that moment it has always been a head-to-head between Namco and the Amusement Vision 2 (Am2) department led by the legendary Yu Sukuzi (father of OutRun, Space Harrier, Hang On and, recently, Ferrari 335 and Shen Mue): we have seen the conversions for Saturn and Dreamcast, respectively, of the second and third chapter of Virtua Fighter, while Playstation hosted Tekken 2 and 3, to leave the conversion right for Sony Playstation 2 to Tekken Tag (compilation of the prequels, with the addition of the 'unpublished boss Unknown and a splash of super-improved graphics, one might say, in hindsight) and to the present Tekken 4, which we will analyze in its entirety, starting from. Storylines Twenty years before the events narrated therein, Heiachi Mishima had thrown his rebellious son Kazuya (now possessed by both Devil and Angel) into a volcano after a strenuous battle, as all players of the second episode of the saga will remember. Miraculously, Kazuya was saved by the G corporation to be subjected to studies, but the Tekken Force, Heiachi's private army, suddenly bursts into the company's skyscraper to find death at the hands of a revived Kazuya, ready to take revenge of the affront suffered years earlier and recover the Mishima Corporation and what better occasion than the fourth edition of Tekken, the famous competition established by Heiachi where the strongest wrestlers from all over the globe meet? Towards true 3d As soon as the DVD is loaded, the first big sigh of relief: it is possible to play by activating the 60hz mode, thus avoiding the slow motion fun that one felt when playing the pal version of Tekken Tag Tournament and it is also possible to play in progressive mode, in which case have a television that includes the use of this new function. We are therefore witnessing the full motion video already seen in the arcade, with the addition of unpublished footage, starring the new entries in the situation: Christie Montero (a lethal as well as fascinating Capoeira expert wrestler who takes the place of Eddy Gordo from the prequels ), Craig Marduk (a beast that seems to be taken by weight from the Ultimate Fighting Championship saga with a splash of Jack, present in the first 2 chapters of Art Of Fighting) and, above all, Steve Fox, perhaps the most atypical of the new faces present in the fourth chapter of Tekken: being an expert boxer, the 2 keys dedicated to kicks are replaced with practical escapes, which combined with his offensive techniques, make this blond Englishman a formidable opponent, if used by expert hands. Towards true 3d The game modes available are: Story, Arcade, Time Attack, Survival and Tekken Force, in addition to the classic versus and team battle modes; finally, the Theather mode is available again to review the final films or the 2 openings (that of the game room and that of the home, as already mentioned, slightly expanded). Obviously, only the story modes and Tekken Force are worthy of mention, the others being common to almost all the fighting games on the market, primarily for the saga there worthy of our attention; by selecting the story mode, we will get a variant of the arcade one, made up of hand-drawn fixed screens (complete with a background on the reasons that prompted the character we used to participate in the fourth edition of the Tekken championship), some unexpected events (by selecting Kazuya, the seventh match with his son Jin will be canceled due to the kidnapping of the latter and so on) and some unreleased full motion video clips in Arcade mode. As in the latter, by winning all eight matches, it will be possible to unlock a character that is also inaccessible, thus adding up to the start-up of ten wrestlers (Kazuya, Paul, Yoshimitsu, Law, Christie, Marduk, Steve, Hwoarang, Xiaoyu and King ), as many that will gradually be added (Kuma/ Panda, Lee/ Violet, Anna/ Nina, Lei, Jin, Heiachi, etc); the Tekken Force game mode, as already seen in Tekken 3 for Playstation, is a scrolling fighting game where you will have to advance through levels built with polygons and textures of normal arenas, beating hundreds of soldiers from Heiachi's private militia, returning the lethal ones to the sender boss at the end of the area, munching on the food here and there that will allow you to regenerate your energies. A discreet subgame that increases the already very high value that this domestic version of tekken 4 offers us: such and so many are the innovations introduced in the fifth video game of the Namco saga, to make the veteran of the series slightly lost. First, the left grip was replaced by anothera which, depending on our position, will allow you to reverse the current situation, pushing your opponent forward slightly or reverse the situation, making him stand against the wall; in Tekken 4, in fact, forget about the arenas that extended to infinity, here we have differences in level (level set in the forest or the one in the Shinjuku district), obstacles (dozens of people in the level which is a real tribute to the film Fight Club, walls and cars in the parking lot), among other things also eliminated (the crowd collapses on the ground, the statues in the level on the skyscraper shatter, in the same way as the telephone booths in Shinjuku and so on). Towards true 3d We add, to the above, the possibility of moving one's alter ego in all dimensions, although not quite yet in 360 degrees as in Soul Calibur to have a complete picture of the innovations introduced in this episode. After the list of the most striking innovations, let's analyze the combat system: as already mentioned, the new type of grip, so to speak, defensive, harmoniously links with the huge arenas, now (finally) delimited and equipped with obstacles and differences in level, but this would be of little use if there weren't interesting characters to command, especially the newcomers. If Paul, Nina, Heiachi and company need no particular introduction, it is good to spend a few words on the newcomers: let's fly over Christie, practically Eddy/Tiger in the feminine and Violet/Lee (enriched by new moves that detach him more and more by Marshall Law), let us dwell on the energumen who responds to the name of Marduk and the boxer Steve Fox. As already (fittingly) done with the prequels, Namco has managed, once again, to integrate with the pre-existing characters (and related fighting styles), the newcomers: the rough style of Craig's street fighters, together with the boxer Steve (very fast and lethal, as well as devoid of any kind of kick, instead of quick dodges), merges with Law's jeet kune do, with the karate of the Mishima gym or with a Jin who, to ward off the demonic blood, inherited from the father, who flows within himself, decided to revise his technique from scratch, changing it from the roots. Obviously, the super moves capable of canceling three quarters of the opponent's energy bar remain, like the counters, with which it is possible to grab the opponent's blow and send it back to the sender in the form of a projection and rapid lateral sidesteps, excellent for perform a lateral grip. In the case of games against the CPU, the medium difficulty level is the optimal choice for beginners, although the computer, unlike in the previous episodes, will hardly be taken by surprise after the same, identical, hit for the fourth time of line. Wanting to conclude this paragraph immediately, to move on to an examination of the technical side of Tekken 4, Playstation 2 edition (pal), we can say that Namco has hit the target once again: the technicality is still at high levels (even if not we are at the extreme levels of Am2's Virtua Fighter 4, but fortunately much further than the still excellent Dead Or Alive 3 by Tecmo), the various fighting styles, the (more or less) delimited arenas, the renewed freedom of movement, they give new life to the Tekken saga and the game modes designed for the home market (tekken force in the first place), constitute the classic icing on the cake. Jaggies? No thank you After Virtua Fighter 4 (magnificent, graphically, if it hadn't been for the abundance of Aliasing), the fears of Playstation 2 owners of seeing the infamous jaggies also in Tekken 4, have dissolved like ice subjected to the scorching sun: not only , as mentioned a few lines above, Namco has inserted the beloved 50/60hz selector, to enjoy the original game speed and support for progressive scan televisions, but it gives us (so to speak, sigh) a perfect conversion from 'original arcade based on System 246 (Playstation 2 with more ram, in practice), devoid of any jaggies, unless you activate them yourself in the graphics menu (!). Although devoid of that obsessive attention to detail that permeates Akira Yuki Jacky and Sarah Bryant of Virtua Fighter 4, the (still) considerable number of polygons is covered by tasty textures that create well-animated faces, knurling on clothes and a more than excellent vision of 'together for the twenty fighters included in the video game package. Jaggies? No thank you Now the differences between the two ~costumes~ of each character are profoundmarked minds: Hwoarang for example, selecting his alternative version, sports an unprecedented haircut and clothing that brings him closer to a street bad boy than to a lover of martial arts of master Baek Do San; Kazuya, on the other hand, in addition to his classic bare chest (complete with a scar) and trousers, wears casual, with sunglasses, shirt, polo shirt and jeans; we close the examples (what has been said so far obviously applies to each of the characters), with Paul Phoenix, from the unedited bob with clothes purely for strolling around the center up to a look more similar to what he has accustomed us to in the past, hair worn 'up (as usual) including. The excellent animations of the characters, which have always been a strong point of the saga, have been further improved: the side steps are more natural, as well as punches and kicks or you want to make a hold (the animations for defensive holds are excellent). The recognition for the graphic gem of Tekken 4, however, goes to the wonderful backdrops: starting from the sunbeams and the excellent movement of the stream in the forest, passing through the rowdy crowd that squirms, to the disintegrable structures in the parking lot, on the skyscraper at night, up to the stage set at sea or in the laboratory (with an excellent fog effect), there is no reason to believe that Namco has not heavily exploited the possibilities (difficult, for most developers) offered by the Emotion Engine by Ken Kutaragi. In short, a real graphic riot. Music, master! The Tekken saga has always presented an excellent vocal characterization to the characters, an excellent cure for the sound effects and music, with the most disparate, more than discreet sonorities, touching, from time to time, very high artistic peaks, as in the sung endings of the prequel. Music, master! The same discourse reappears here, with very catchy music and some of which (the one in the laboratory, in the airport, but also the one that underlines the final battle) are truly tripping, assisted by a more than adequate dubbing (always legendary are the voices of Law, Heiachi, Paul and Kazuya) and powerful sound effects, which give the sense of physical pain when you give a direct Heiachi or a sudden trip, in the sensual role of Nina Williams. An excellent job in this sector too. Conclusions Tekken 4 is a masterpiece from every point of view: graphically stunning (one of the best games for Playstation 2, from a visual point of view, if not the best really), acoustically well-finished and characterized by an enviable longevity (20 characters, hundreds of moves , unpublished game modes) and, incredible but true, converted for the European format as all NTSC video games should be adapted, it is one of those few games that cannot be missed in the collection of every enthusiast, no matter if they already own the equally wonderful Virtua Fighter 4 (in any case intended for a more technical and passionate user of Tekken 4, more usable by fighting game newbies). A must Pro: Exceptional graphics, perfect conversion Very entertaining skyrocketing longevity, especially if often played in pairs Cons: Tekken detractors stay away fans of ONLY Virtua Fighter 4 stay away Namco returns to beat from orbi! In the now distant 1995, to counter the then innovative Virtua Fighter of Am2, Namco also decided to produce a 3D fighting game, with an accurate technical realization and overflowing with characters, each equipped with an impressive number of secret moves. The proximity of this release, based on the System 11 coin op card (basically Playstation), therefore eons behind the graphic virtuosity of Virtua Fighter 2 (obtained thanks to Lockeed Martin's Model 2 for Sega), was accompanied by good critical acclaim and public, greatly magnified when, less than a year later, the conversion for the 32-bit Sony peeked out, identical to the game that was raging in the arcades (including the 20-plus wrestlers) with the welcome inclusion of Galaga, the historic Namco shooter , during the first load.", "date": "2002-09-19", "grade": null}
