{"name": "Boogie DS - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/boogie-ds-recensione.html", "text": "Boogie is a musical game that comes from the basic setting of many other games of the genre, but makes the structure more open in order to cater for even less accustomed players to the genre. As in all dance games, it is a question of performing dance steps by entering an input, whether it is sent via a mat, buttons or other systems. The main difference is that in Boogie you are not forced to respect the steps imposed by the game, but you can decide which command to provide, the important thing is always to go in time. In Boogie for DS there are actually three different ways to approach the game and we're going to discover them right away From Wii to DS Although the two hardware are incomparable in both performance and interfaces, the two versions of the game are quite similar in content and style. Many of the songs are the same, the graphic design is the same, and so are the characters. The karaoke mode has disappeared on DS, and new dance styles have been added as well as Freestyle, the only mode on the Wii version. Even the defects of the home version, however, have been carried over to the DS edition. The new play styles and mini-games introduced during the performance weren't enough to break the boredom and add challenge during the match. As on the Wii for the DS, Boogie's major flaw is the lack of interest in what happens on the screen, which looks more like a simple pastime than something really enthralling. Boogie doesn't have the sparkle of Elite Beat Agency, and it doesn't even have the classic charm of Konami's Dance Dance. It is something simpler, certainly more accessible, but at the same time less fun and more repetitive. In fact, the fact of not having passages expressly programmed according to the music makes the games all the same from start to finish and from first to last. The many mini-games that alternate during the dance (all quite simple like touching a point on the screen, drawing some figures, or sliding the stylus in the recommended direction) do not change the result, and in the end what we have in hand is a pocket copy of the same errors on Wii. Comment Boogie for DS is not a bad or neglected game, it is made with care both in terms of presentation and stylus detection, except for some inaccuracies that are still present. Even the audio tracks have been carefully chosen, however the game fails to fully satisfy the player who will soon get bored in front of laptop screens and will probably be satisfied after a few games. The reason is to be found in a low level of challenge, linked only to scores, and to a repetitive and elementary game system. The DS additions don't change the situation, and not even the 3D goggles once again bundled with the game, and which seem to have become a brand of recognition, are useful to make everything more satisfying. Pros Made with due care Effective playlist Cons Unchallenging Repetitive Not very exciting Boogie is available for Nintendo DS, Nintendo Wii and PlayStation 2. The version tested is the one for Nintendo DS. Boogland First of all, in Boogie the dance steps must be performed using the stylus, i.e. it will be sufficient to draw a straight line in one of the 8 possible directions (diagonals are also considered). In addition, with a quick tap on the screen we will have a further step available, that is a jump on the spot. The arrow keys (or keys for left-handed people) will be used to move around the stage and to turn the character front/shoulders. In career mode you will choose a character and then move around a map in search of new stages for new performances in the world of Boogland, accompanied from time to time by several story lines that are more annoying than interesting. Once you arrive at your destination you can decide in addition to the song on which to perform which type of match to face, or ~Pappagallo~, ~Freestyle~, or ~Choreography~. In the first mode you will have to perform the steps that will be indicated to you on the screen, up to a maximum of 4 at a time, while the metronome on the sides of the interface will mark the time which is actually quite audible even by ear thanks to the well-chosen music tracks. The ~Freestyle~ mode, as the name implies, will leave you free to do as you like, the important thing, in addition to going to the rhythm, is not to repeat yourself, otherwise the score assigned to the pace will be reduced. Choreography is similar to the modes of other dance games, the icons will scroll in series to a marker, which will decide when you have to execute the command. In addition to the main mode, Boogie DS allows you to play a single game, to customize the characters with glthe clothes unlocked and with the drawings that you can make with the editor, and to play multiplayer even with a single cartridge.", "date": "2008-01-10", "grade": null}
