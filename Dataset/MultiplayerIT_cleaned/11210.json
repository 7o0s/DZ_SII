{"name": "Pure", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pure_a.html", "text": "Put a ~stunt~ vehicle (quad, motocross or even BMX) into a video game, fill it with spectacular tricks and add a signed, preferably punk soundtrack to it all: you will probably get a blockbuster in the USA. It is not known for what reasons, American gamers have always been very attracted to this kind of racer, even when it comes to products that technically leave something to be desired. However, this does not seem to be the case with Pure, which will be released here in Italy on September 26 (only in the versions for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360) and which really promises entertainment. Not for the obvious and inevitable presence of tricks and acrobatics to the limits of possible, but for a mix of graphics and gameplay that looks extraordinary and will probably be joined by a solid structure full of substance. Will the mobile reduction, managed by the expert hands of Living Mobile, be able to guarantee the same impact? From the start screen, Pure allows us to start immediately with a quick game, with random values, or start a rather rich and multifaceted career mode. After choosing our character among those available, in fact, we will be able to check a world map on which new events and challenges to face will gradually appear. Each race passed earns us ~estimate points~, which we can spend to buy events, new stunts and new quads. Once on the track, we will have to perform a series of spectacular tricks and contend for victory against a series of increasingly fierce opponents. Very often we will receive invitation letters to particular events, where for the first time we will get to know different settings than usual: dirt, ice, tall grass, water... there is no limit to the natural obstacles that we will have to overcome before cutting The goal. There are various ways to do this: if there are opponents, the race will be divided into as many sections as there are other drivers involved, framed as real ~duels~ in which we will have to be able to overtake, choosing the best areas of the tracked so as not to lose speed and taking advantage of all the jumps to be able to load small but precious boosts. Arrived in front of the large ramps, we will move on to the actual tricks: we will have to choose one of four (they are cataloged in order of importance, but you can have much more in the ~archive~) by pressing the relative direction on the d-pad, then act always on the d-pad to keep the balance indicator centered. Although physical clashes are not of fundamental importance in this mobile version of Pure, we will always have to keep an eye on our quad's energy bar: once it is depleted, in fact, we will be forced to retire. Beyond a unfortunately average sound sector, but which at least has independent volume adjustment, this new title developed by Living Mobile boasts a respectable technical achievement. Firstly, the sprites are very well designed and boast a good number of animations, which are shown in particular through the execution of the various tricks. The element of greatest impact, however, is represented by the locations: there are so many, and they are all different from each other; not for mere aesthetics, but for a functional question. Ice, grass and water are important variables within each race, and you have to deal with their impact in the best way to build an advantage over your opponent. PRO Very different tracks from each other Good number of events, tricks and vehicles Technically excellent AGAINST Anonymous sound Limited trick execution system Sometimes frustrating", "date": "2008-09-09", "grade": "S.V."}
