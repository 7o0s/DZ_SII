But the most dangerous citizen is the protagonist of the game, a paid killer who must save enough credits to buy the necessary documents to get out of the neighborhood. That's all. The game can be broken down right away into its essential elements: choose a task, kill the target, collect the money. The graphics inspired by the old 8-bit games are not a stylistic choice, but an essential element of a stealth shooter that downloads the superfluous we are used to. Metrocide coincides with its game system, studied with precision in every detail. In the populous metropolis of the game there are no characters to talk to and not even a side story. Every pixel is there for a reason: to participate in the game design of Metrocide. The developers were good at resisting the temptation to bring the action inside the buildings, a choice that would have given the player the illusion of a larger game but which would have proved redundant, if not downright hindering. We too fell into the trap at the beginning, used as we are to confusing substance with quantity, and we admit that we felt a touch of disappointment at the fact that everything took place on the street. But it was enough to scratch the surface of the game to discover that everything we needed was already included. And day after day we returned to the city with the same desire to start over. Because with each game you discover something new, you refine your technique, you enter a little more in depth. Above all, it gets better. Improving yourself is a must in Metrocide, because you die a lot, very early and very easily. And there is no remedy for death. What did you think: in a city where even those who stop to read the newspaper on the street can be a vigilante, the difference between who is the killer and who is the victim is established in the blink of an eye. Metrocide has the quality of games that last for years: gameplay that you never stop mastering One hit and you're dead Metrocide is a game designed to be difficult in the best way possible, which is by making every death a lesson. If we end up lying on the asphalt in a pool of blood we always know where we went wrong, and there's no reason to puff, because the game system is satisfying in itself. The difficulty as we have said is inherent in the design of the game, but it changes shape as we become familiar with the rules of Metrocide, discovering one level of complexity after another. At the beginning we have to practice with the pulse pistol, the basic weapon with which we start each level. It is a rock that for the first ten, fifteen games seems difficult to overcome. In fact, we have to calculate the reaction times of the weapon and, until we become experts, many types of assignment are unthinkable to carry out. So our immediate goal is to buy a serious gun as quickly as possible. However, if at the beginning we use four murders to improve the equipment, after many hours of playing we are already good enough to immediately conclude a difficult contract and exchange the credits collected for a shotgun or a sniper rifle. After becoming familiar with the basics and improving the equipment we must therefore learn to conclude more risky but better paid assignments. Our presence in the city, as we will see shortly, almost always ends up attracting new dangers, so it is better to leave the area as soon as possible. From the murder of an ordinary person we therefore pass to that of a paranoid person, who flees if we are too close to him. Then the bar is raised and we start chasing an armed target, an armed paranoid target, an armed paranoid target about to leave the area, in a crescendo that can lead to a contract killing of an armed, paranoid citizen in a hurry and with a bodyguard, whose body we have to make disappear and who also drops a briefcase to be recovered. Further up there are those escorted by the police, but you know what we mean. Clearly the more difficult preys earn more money, and for this reason they are tempting. We thus find ourselves undertaking increasingly complex assignments in an increasingly risky context. For example, if we pull out our gun and there's a vigilante around, we can be sure he's going to try to take us out. If we leave a body behind, someone will report it missing. Above all, if we unleash a Wild West in front of everyone, dozens of witnesses will denounce us. And when these are many, take them out before it runsno to blurt out everything is hard. In short, you understood that the police, in Metrocide, are the number one enemy. martial law Killing without being seen and making the victim's body disappear down a drain or in the waters of the port is for professionals. But it's not always possible. That's when flying police patrols arrive at the scene of the crime. If the number of corpses grows, so does the number of patrols in the city, and if someone saw us committing a crime, we get on the wanted list. This means that until the police shut down the crime scene, running into a patrol is tantamount to certain death. Unless we buy an expensive drone detector, or pay a good amount of credits to a hacker who, from small locations scattered around the city, manages to clean up our criminal record in a second. Both solutions are very expensive, and credits in Metrocide are hard to earn. For us, it was much more exciting to work in a city full of cops on high alert, even when they decided to pay a hit man to take us out. The heart pounding of seeing a patrol in the sky when we know a witness might recognize us makes every misdeed more precious. Then there are the surveillance cameras, the scanners that detect if we have illegal weapons with us (all except the pulse pistol) and other new things that are discovered by progressing through the game levels. For our part, we can also buy gadgets such as the holographic decoy that lures the target into a less busy alley, but you already know how we feel about spending credits when it's not strictly necessary. What matters is that each element of the game integrates perfectly with all the others and opens up a range of possibilities with which the player is free to experiment. For example, you can perform feats like drawing your gun in front of an armed target, who will in turn draw their weapon, only to have them killed by a nearby vigilante so you don't even have to get your hands dirty. And once you beat the game on normal level there's hard mode and then impossible mode. Or the timed challenges or matches with only the pulse gun under the raincoat. The only obvious flaw, which kept us from giving an even higher rating, is the instability of the game which, at least for us, crashed several times unexpectedly, both in the version released during Early Access and in the 1.0 version. available at launch. Considering the care that the developers have put into the project so far, we expect them to fix the problem soon. Also because Metrocide contains endless hours of gameplay compressed into its small world and, as with games like Rogue Legacy or Spelunky, the urge to come back for a new game never seems to run out.", "date": "2014-12-19", "grade": "8.0"}
