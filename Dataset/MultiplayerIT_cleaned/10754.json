{"name": "Una galassia di puzzle", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/puzzle-quest-galactrix-recensione_a.html", "text": "With the first Puzzle Quest, the programmers of Infinite Interactive managed to create a mix of very unoriginal elements (a match 3 puzzle and a simple rpg) which, however, combined together gave life to an intriguing and engaging title like few others of its kind. A few months later, obviously unable to abandon a franchise born under such a brilliant star, the team therefore gave birth to the obvious sequel, on this occasion subtitled Galactrix. Stellar puzzle? The plot, absolutely negligible as well as rather boring and verbose in the dialogues, represents a mere pretext to somehow justify the fact that, by moving colored tiles, the protagonist can save humanity from the alien menace. The biggest novelty in this new episode is certainly to be found in the game grid, now made up of hexagonal elements that fit together forming a kind of beehive. The need remains to put together (at least) 3 elements of the same type to make them disappear and thus earn the relative resources, but the gems destined to re-fill the game board no longer descend from above but from every direction, specifically in based on the direction in which the last element was moved. This is basically the only significant novelty of Galactrix, since all the other elements have been roughly only redesigned and adapted to the new setting of the game. Therefore, as previously written, it remains necessary to obtain the resources of the gems of the various colors not only to restore the shields of your spaceship, a real battle tool against the various enemies, but also to perform attacks and special shots to unlock in the continuation of the adventure (instead of spells); to remove life points from the enemy in turn, the main tool is still the numbered mine-tiles. The strategic balance, the concepts of attack and defense to be taken into consideration and the presence of special shots therefore continue to form the backbone of a puzzle game which, however, had probably already squared the circle with Challenge of the Warlords. A practically perfect compound which this time however is compromised by the only significant new feature; too often chance, luck, fate affect the ~work~ of the player in an excessively marked way, who therefore finds himself frustrated in the face of challenges in which his efforts can be frustrated without any real demerit. Also sorry for the disappearance of the ~classes~ from which to choose your character; now, however, the customization possibilities are linked to the spaceships, which can be up to a maximum of three with different characteristics of speed or attack power with which to move within the huge game world. This is in fact made up of a galaxy made up of many planetary complexes to explore, joined together by portals that must be unlocked through a rather boring and repetitive mini-game. Finally, some problems related to the interface should be noted, which is a little too cumbersome and which generates some embarrassment in using the stylus.", "date": "2009-04-17", "grade": "7.6"}
