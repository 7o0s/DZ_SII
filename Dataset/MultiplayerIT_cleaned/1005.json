{"name": "Rayman DS", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rayman-ds.html", "text": "The great escape Quite predictably it was decided to start the sequel, but in the meantime the panorama of platformers had been revolutionized forever by the arrival of Super Mario 64; the French programmers didn't lose heart and even brought their hero into the era of three dimensions: Rayman 2  The Great Escape came out in 1999, and the Rayman DS that we have in our hands is none other than the conversion, with all the necessary adjustments, of this game, precisely, and obviously, of the Nintendo 64 version. The usual two words on the plot in this case will really be two, because in the best tradition of platform sequels it is not that we wasted more much: the fairy-tale world of Rayman is threatened by evil robot pirates, several characters and the hero himself have been imprisoned, but, precisely because you are a hero, you manage to escape and you must at this point free your friends and send the robots back to the factory from which they come from. Stop. Well, in reality the story ~develops~ through a good number of cut scenes during the game, but more than complications of the narrative, these are funny skits that elicit more than a smile while adding very little substance. Not bad, we're not complaining... what distinguished Rayman 2 [...] was the excellent level design The great escape Despite the three-dimensional graphics, the game concept remains firmly rooted in its 2D origins and the development of the many stages remains fundamentally linear: the fearless being's objectives are to recover the Lums, energy spheres necessary, among other things, to advance in the game, to recover vital energy and to gain new powers, and free various creatures, including the very nice ~Teens~ tribe, trapped in the most disparate and hidden corners of the levels. So far nothing strange; what distinguished Rayman 2 from the great mass of the ~Mario 64 wannabe~ who then infested the market was the excellent level design, the presence of numerous variations to the main game action and the excellent dosage of the same. The actions to be performed were many, far beyond the classic platform jump: Rayman could operate the ~helicopter~ to glide on the ground and cover a greater distance with a jump, shoot beams of energy with which to hit enemies at like shoot 'em up, even moving sideways, a real strafe, to facilitate the fights. Again: venturing on dizzying slides, tackling otherwise inaccessible terrain using strange vehicle-bushes or riding wild bombs with legs, obviously after having tamed them... All within extremely well-crafted levels that never let the same action repeat itself twice times without first being interspersed with another; the picture was completed by the excellent characterization of the characters, ~silly~ and fairytale enough for the player to fall in love with them at first sight. Reference points And why, you may be wondering, have we talked about a game from six years ago so far? Because Rayman DS is practically the same game, if there have been changes to the levels and actions of the character, in all honesty we have not noticed. An evil? For those unfamiliar with Rayman 2, absolutely not: it's not that in the meantime the platform scene has, alas, evolved a great deal, and if Rayman 2 was a masterpiece then (because it was), today maybe it isn't anymore, but it remains still a top notch game. For those who knew it, however, it could have been an excellent opportunity to relive old passions, except that The DC Studios programmers, in charge of the conversion, found themselves working on a machine that is different, precisely by vocation, from the old Nintendone, and consequently they had to make changes and choices. Had they got one right First and most obvious problem, the control system. The DS lacks the analog stick that Nintendo itself set as the standard for 3D gaming; if the directional cross fulfills its task with all the limitations it carries with it in relation to a three-dimensional environment, we have already seen that the touch screen in Mario worthily replaced the stick, albeit without the same convenience. In Rayman, however, the approach was rather peculiar: while in Mario, every time you place your thumb on the touch screen, the program recognizes that position as the center of your movement, in Rayman, the center must be fixed first, and will remain so for the entire duration. of the game session. The game thus becomes, at least on some occasions, decidedly frustrating. Reference points A virtual stick will then appear on the lower screen as a visual reference point only, but you will understand che, especially in the most agitated phases, does not always lean the thumb strap (let's not even consider the nib, for this kind of game it is simply not good) where it should, with the result that Rayman will perhaps move in the opposite direction to the one in which we want to stretch, simply because we have placed our thumb a few millimeters outside the exact center in the excitement of the moment. If this is just a small nuisance in the great outdoors, in moments, and there are many, in which maximum precision is required, get ready to throw off a lot of saints from the calendar to the sound of curses ... The possibility of choosing a virtual stick more larger than normal mitigates the problem, but is far from solving it. And that's a big deal, because Rayman DS is a tough game. Mindful of the old videogame school, the programmers had perfectly calibrated the difficulty that from little more than an internship tutorial rose up to truly old-fashioned levels, and to complete the more advanced frameworks it was not uncommon to have to replay them numerous times. according to the classic formula of ~trial and error~ also dear to an old way of understanding video games. The perfect control system made this difficulty never frustrating, and indeed an incentive for replayability; on DS instead we find ourselves forced to choose between the two different systems not the best, but the ~least worst~. The game thus becomes, at least on some occasions, decidedly frustrating. Why the development team didn't take the same approach as Nintendo remains a mystery. For the future of the genre on DS it is important that a standard is imposed, we humbly allow ourselves to suggest that Mario's path is preferred to Rayman. Sensazzzzzztional! Longevity is therefore ensured by the good number of levels, their extension, the level of challenge and the amount of Lums to collect and little creatures to free, but at the same time it is undermined by the frustration that will begin to rise from mid-game onwards due to of the control system. The save system also doesn't help: you can only save your game by exiting the level, and there are usually only two ways to exit the level, by getting to the end or by going back to the beginning. Given their extension, it will not be pleasant to perhaps have to give up everything you had collected until the moment in which, for one reason or another, you will find yourself forced to leave the game. For the portable version they should have foreseen a remake of the system, but nisba. Positive and negative notes also from the graphics, which surprise the player with high-level cosmetics: you will never have so many characters on the screen, but those that exist, Rayman in the first place, are made with skill, and the same goes for the highly detailed landscapes , always taking into account that we are dealing with a game of the last generation. Above all, however, what excites are the textures, almost always good with points of excellence: they are clear and colorful, and some (few, to tell the truth) even clean, such as not to disfigure, without wanting to go too far, in a game for PSP. It is above all to the quality of the textures that we owe the beautiful, fairy-tale, somewhat ~Rareian~ atmosphere that one breathes in Rayman. what excites are the textures, almost always good with peaks of excellence Sensazzzzzztional! All this has a price: on the one hand, a fluidity to which we honestly had to get used to a bit again, it was the norm in the days of the Nintendone but today it is a little below the standards; even some hesitations here and there, but never such as to make the title unplayable. On the other hand, the lack of texture filtering is felt (but it is also thanks to its absence that textures are what they are) and the relative presence of aliasing and pixellons. One consequence in particular is serious, daughter of aliasing, of the very low brightness and paradoxically of the very richness of the textures: the image in certain moments is dirty and dark, such as to make it even difficult to distinguish elements of the game screen that are fundamental to move forward . You will therefore find yourself turning back and forth in search of that passage that had always been before your eyes... A more accentuated brightness would have been enough, or even the possibility of setting it in the options; once again, an action that seems necessary for the game to perform at its best on a portable, has not been adopted. Finally, only joys from the sound: the music, although never memorable, is very funny and well underlines the moments both in the game and those in which the story unfolds. The effects are excellent, especially the sort of ~language~ that Rayman and his friends speak, rich in both English and French inflections, but unidentifiable in any language spoken on theanta. Rayman 2 was a masterpiece in '99 and remains more than an excellent game in 2005. And so it's even more sad to note that those few but fundamental steps necessary to best adapt the game to a portable system, and moreover so particular like the DS, they have not been undertaken, or they have been accomplished but in a questionable way. As it is, the title remains recommended to anyone who deprived themselves of it at the time, but much less warmly than it could have. Furthermore, if you believe that you do not really have Job's patience, think about it a couple of times: it will take time before you adapt to one of the control systems, and in the meantime you could be excommunicated from the Vatican by direct means. Pros A great game still today Beautiful graphics, excellent textures Good characterization of worlds and characters Cons Few new features Questionable choices on the touch screen The image is too dark Ubisoft was among the very first software houses to throw itself headlong into the new Nintendo portable, and it saw fit to start testing the waters by sending what can now be defined in complete tranquility as its symbol. Rayman, the likeable and heroic man-ray (but man-eggplant would be more suitable, given the unusual shape of his body) without limbs (but don't worry, he has hands and feet. How does he do it? Dunno) was born, for who does not remember it, now a decade ago, in 1995, none other than on the Atari Jaguar, a 16-bit passed off as 64-bit with which the historic American company was trying in those days to return to the fore on the market. It goes without saying that the experiment failed miserably, but Rayman was a nice platformer and in Ubi they immediately sensed its potential: it landed on the then brand new PlayStation and Saturn, enjoying well-deserved success, and since then the road to Michel Ancel's hero has been always been downhill.", "date": "2005-03-16", "grade": null}
