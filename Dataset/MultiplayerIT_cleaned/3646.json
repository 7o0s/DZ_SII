{"name": "Metroid Prime Remastered", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metroid-prime-remastered-recensione.html", "text": "Announced and released as a surprise, after having been rumored for years of its existence, Metroid Prime Remastered is a remake, by its own (very humble) declaration a remastering of the Retro Studios masterpiece dated 2002. A game that obtained a Metacritic rating of 97 and over the years his myth, also thanks to a progressive rarefaction of the saga, has increased dramatically. As written at the beginning, Metroid Prime Remastered was announced and published instantly, almost as if it were a secondary project; nothing more wrong. The quality of the work done by Retro Studios, assisted by other satellite teams, manages to transport one of the best playful experiences of this century into modernity and, consequently, to make us optimistic for the fourth episode (from 2019 back in Texas, after two years essentially useless, it is rumored at Bandai Namco Singapore). For those who don't know it, Metroid Prime at the time was defined as a First Person Adventure, in opposition to the prevailing genre of the moment, the First Person Shooter, first person shooters of course. A cataloging that is perhaps instrumental and rarely reproposed, but which makes the essence of the work clear: Metroid Prime is in first person and yes, in Metroid Prime you shoot, but the soul of the game lies mainly in exploration. It is a faithful three-dimensional transposition of the core of Super Metroid and - in retrospect - it is the best three-dimensional Metroidvania ever developed. In 2002, various Nintendo products were released on the GameCube, including The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and Super Mario Sunshine: when they were announced, also due to the tumultuous problems involving Retro Studios (founded in 1998, and still without publications in 2002 ), no one could have thought that Samus Aran would be the protagonist of the better game. And so it was: GameCube remains to this day the only Nintendo platform whose best title, without much discussion about it, is a Metroid chapter. In the 21st century, also due to the slowdown in releases, Nintendo has released fewer masterpieces than in the past: Metroid Prime is certainly among these, together - to name a few - with Super Mario Galaxy, Mario Kart 8 and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. For this reason this Metroid Prime Remastered review is a small event: it is the possibility to talk again about one of the greatest games ever, this time revised and corrected so that it can also be enjoyed by modern gamers. The game Metroid Prime Remastered: the incipit of the game Metroid Prime Remastered, in terms of game design and level design, is practically identical to the original - we noticed some minor differences, such as the Reload Ray which takes longer, but these are trifles. It is very important to shoot and fight your way through enemies, but despite appearances, the heart of the work lies in exploration and boss fights. The enemies you find on the map, while progressively more challenging, are largely ~discursive~, more likely to mislead your path, perhaps to make you end up in a harmful section (for example, a lava lake) and to pace the experience , than to put your life in danger. The world of Metroid Prime is largely composed of tunnels and tunnels, to unite more open and stratified areas: it is in all respects a metroidvania, indeed, it is a kind of bible on how three-dimensional metroidvanias should be created . During the exploration you will find sections, whether they are doors or particular territorial conformations, which prevent you from reaching a certain area at that moment: you will have to continue, find the appropriate ~new power~, and you will be able to access that passage which was previously closed to you. The essence of the game is essentially this: what makes it exceptional are the masterful level design and the varied nature of the powers themselves (from the Morphosphere, which allows you to roll like a ~ball~ and observe everything from another perspective, to the different types of Ray, passing through the viewers to scan the world in various ways, the Suits that allow you to explore different climates and environments...). Metroid Prime Remastered: here is the canonical first-person view of the series The other indisputable quality of Metroid Prime is its atmosphere. We have already told you about its tunnel nature, which the first person view makes even claustrophobic, and about its sudden, airy openings; there are many biomes to cross on Tallon IV (the planet that hosts the adventure), almost all evocative and characteristic (honorable mention for the snowy Phendrana and the arid Chozo Ruins), but the constant is that you are alone. Desperatelyyou alone, evacuated to a wild planet inhabited by monsters, hoping to recover your powers. Also thanks to the highly inspired soundtrack (by Kenji Yamamoto, mainly), exploring Tallon IV means challenging, without help or emotional support, the fear of the unknown. The progression of the adventure is basically perfect, as is the overall management of its pace; Metroid Prime is also one of the first cases in which a high-budget three-dimensional game has managed the narration through the deepening of the ~lore~, in particular by exploiting the viewers to analyze the architectures and objects of the surrounding world, which they propose, compared to progress of the adventure, a parallel - and optional - cognitive path. Metroid Prime Remastered still borders on perfection. We have some doubts about the various control systems proposed, which we will shortly externalise, and above all about certain mechanics which, in our opinion, have not aged very well. They work in the specific case, but they could be unwelcome to anyone who has just started playing, or doesn't want to commit too much, especially on a mental level. Because Metroid Prime requires tactile ability, but above all a remarkable spatial visualization, as well as a fair amount of patience in case you get stuck. The map, which grants (deactivable) suggestions if you don't continue, is really complicated: you can rotate left and right, up and down, approach and move away. It is conceptually identical to that of a 2D metroidvania, but the three dimensions exponentially increase the difficulty of navigation: finding and recognizing unexplored streets is not easy at all. Above all, and this is undoubtedly an anachronistic feature, it is difficult to continue in the game in more than one way, and for an exploratory title it is quite frustrating: you will find yourself stuck, and all you can do - besides unlocking optional upgrades - is try to understand where to go to continue. When a new power is unlocked in a metroidvania, the feeling should be that of exaltation for the new ways that it will allow you to explore, perhaps encountered at the beginning of the game. In Metroid Prime, if you are not careful, the opposite could happen: that is, as soon as you have conquered a new power, you will not always be clear how it could be useful to you. Above all, we reiterate it again, there is often only one way to continue the adventure: when you don't understand it, you will find yourself stuck, and with no other important activities to do. The last aspect that hasn't aged very well, although typical of the genre (but more functional in 2D) is the continuous rebirth of the enemies, who have fairly repetitive behaviors, and the limited environmental interaction, which however hides some very valuable ornamental details, such as the drops falling on Samus' visor, or rippling water shooting at it. The controls Metroid Prime Rematered: the phases in Morphosphere Metroid Prime Remastered's controls are excellent, both in terms of precision and responsiveness. The way in which the Morphosphere reacts to the slightest relief, to the slopes and ripples of the terrain, is still surprising twenty years later, as is the fluidity and naturalness with which Samus Aran switches from first to third person. The commands are even exceptional in the jumping phases, not so much for their complexity, but for the chosen view, which would have suggested a simplification of this mechanic: but no, the sensation of jumping with precision is intact, and it is difficult to imagine what sorcery is behind it. Because it is true that video games in general are composed of mirrors and smoke, to give the impression of functionality and cohesion, but in this case the spell is even more incomprehensible: like Retro Studios, and in particular Mark Pacini (game director , now out of the company for fifteen years), managed to give the impression of ~precision~ in the leaps, because that's what it is, it's difficult to conceive. Playing in first person, we don't know what Samus' collider is, i.e. her effective ~encumbrance~ in terms of interaction (certainly larger than what it would have been in third person), but the final sensation manages to reproduce a sense of precision bewitching, for anyone who is sensitive to certain characteristics, and functional for all the others. When you miss a jump, it never feels like the game is at fault. Metroid Prime Remastered: Ridley in the new graphic design Controlling Metroid Prime, in 2002, worked great; all despite not allowing the use of the two analog sticks, which is the most popular and widespread system for FPS on consoles. It was possible to aim at the opponent after locking him, and move around it without losing track of it; being a title devoted to exploration, one never had the impression of being limited, although, of course, the freedom of movement was less than that of a normal shooter. Metroid Prime Remastered offers various control possibilities, and they are all well structured. You can play with the classic system already seen on GameCube, and another that repeats it while supporting, at the same time (and only during the ~aim~ phases), the gyroscope. To these is added the option totally entrusted to the motion sensors, functional only to unattached Joy-Con (strange in fact that the developers have not bothered to block it in other situations), and the most widespread one, which uses the two control sticks, one for moving (the left) and the other for aiming (the right). Now, as every Nintendo gamer knows, the highest degree of accuracy possible (on consoles) has been achieved by combining this system with gyroscope support, exactly as it happens in Splatoon: a setting also present in Metroid Prime Remastered, but it must be looked for, because it is not part of the four main control systems. You have to select the mode with the two control sticks, and then add (under ~vision~) the gyro support. As we said, they all work very well; the problem, and in a completely atypical way for a Nintendo game, is that they offer alternatives that are not equivalent to each other. The classic control is effective, but also restrictive compared to that with the two control sticks. The latter, let alone if assisted by the gyroscope, is far too ~free~ for a title originally designed with the classic control system in mind. It's not a big problem, but we hope that in Metroid Prime 4 there are fewer options, and above all that they are more similar to each other, so that the developers can draw the map, and the enemies, knowing exactly the speed (and freedom) of movement by Samus. The graphics Metroid Prime Remastered: Phendrana has never been so cold Visually the work done by Retro Studios - and helpers - is stunning. Metroid Prime Rematered is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful games to see on Nintendo Switch, and travels at a granite 60 fps. On a graphic level, the title has been totally reworked, starting from the polygonal models, to get to the most important thing, namely the lighting system, capable of transporting - apparently effortlessly - Metroid Prime into modernity. We are not referring only to the lighting of the shots, to the reflection of Samus on the helmet, in general therefore to the improvement of what was already present in the game. We are alluding mainly to the total overhaul of the lighting system: in Metroid Prime Remastered when it's dark, the screen doesn't get darker... it's literally dark, and the setting is lit only by the light sources present, whether they're bright flowers, lamps or holes from which external light filters. The Chozo Ruins are really ~hot~: there is a beautiful effect, coming from a tunnel and approaching an open area, so the new section seems to blind Samus. Then, entering it, his eyes slowly adapt to the new ~temperature~, detailing the scenes. It's not just technical excellence, it's the very valuable artistic direction that amalgamates everything: Phendrana appears cold like never before, thanks to the refractions of light due to the snow. But the greatest merit of all, also to be attributed to the art direction, is that Metroid Prime Remastered manages to be ~as we remembered it~ and, at the same time, completely different from the original. Try to compare the two titles: there is almost nothing that has been reproduced in an identical way. Neither the Chozo columns, nor the mechanical structures, nor the grates. Yet, despite everything being different in decorations and structure, the final effect is a embodiment of our memories. A very difficult result to achieve, and of superfine quality, superior to that obtained by Nintendo in the HD remake of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. One last note: in the main menu there are options for those who have difficulty viewing colors correctly. An undoubtedly welcome addition, which we hope will be re-proposed in future Nintendo productions; a company that, in this respect, is certainly not at the forefront.", "date": "2023-02-15", "grade": "9.0"}
