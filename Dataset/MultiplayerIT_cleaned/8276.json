Let's see if under this deliberately bizarre social criticism there is also a valid product in terms of gameplay. Brain drain The story that forms the background to the game has Craig as its protagonist, who inadvertently decides to go out for a hamburger just as a dramatic zombie invasion is underway: also transformed into an undead, our ~hero~ will continue to pursue his original goal to feed himself, however replacing the sandwich with the humans who populate the various levels. From here starts a play structure with extremely simple foundations, but which gains considerable complexity and depth as the adventure continues. The user controls Craig by tracing a path along the stages with a finger conveniently framed from a bird's eye view, simultaneously trying to collect the three brains scattered on the street and to bite the survivors to transform them into rotting monsters to add to their ranks : it is possible to vary the trajectory at any time, as well as stop the zombie in place at your commands simply by touching it. With such elementary mechanics, it goes without saying that the first handful of Plight of the Zombie stages offer a zero challenge rate, but just have a little patience and the work of Spark Plug Games in terms of design begins to peep out, in the form of a whole series of variables that add a lot of spice to the action. To begin with, you can take control of different types of undead, all endowed with unique peculiarities to be exploited in the best possible way: the weak but fast standard zombies are soon accompanied by large, slow but extremely tough specimens and others capable of becoming invisible when stationary. Again, the more advanced stages bring into play a series of parameters to be taken into strong consideration if you want to achieve the best scores: in fact, the greater structural complexity of the scenarios adds brains to be collected within a certain time limit and humans armed with guns and rifles to be circumvented in various ways, including the most sadistic one which involves sacrificing one of your zombies by making it riddled with bullets, with the others reaching the victim while he is busy reloading the weapon. Even with all these precautions, the level of challenge never reaches particularly high peaks, and Plight of the Zombie flows away which is a pleasure, so much so that it is possible to complete the five worlds that make up the adventure in a short time all in all : an incentive to retrace one's steps is made up of the extra coins that are given as a reward for each perfectly resolved stage, and which are used to buy funny clothing items to customize one's undead. Not exactly the best of stimuli, but it's still something that can entertain while waiting for new packs of levels already promised by the developers with future updates. The picture of an undoubtedly successful title is completed by a pleasant and detailed graphic creation and an inviting launch promotion that makes the download of the application still free at the time of writing.", "date": "2012-10-09", "grade": "8.0"}
