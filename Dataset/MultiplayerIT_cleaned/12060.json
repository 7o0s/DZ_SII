{"name": "Trauma Center: Second Opinion - recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/trauma-center-second-opinion-recensione.html", "text": "History In Trauma Center: Second Opinion we will take on the role of Derek Stiles, a young surgeon who has just started practicing but who immediately reveals himself as having exceptional abilities, in this case the so-called ~gift of Aesculapius~. This paranormal faculty allows him to reach superhuman levels of concentration and to operate extremely quickly if circumstances require it. During the story, we will see him work at different hospitals and deal with standard interventions as well as completely exceptional procedures: from the extraction of foreign bodies to the recomposition of fractures, from the removal of blood clots and tumors to the merciless fight against a new and terrible virus The plot of the game is told through images and textual dialogues, with the introduction of numerous characters (each characterized in a precise way from the early stages) and through seven chapters which will alternate conventional medical practice with the most advanced intervention procedures for eradicate apparently incurable diseases, children of bioterrorism. A new genre? The structure of Trauma Center is very simple: it consists of a certain number of interventions which are linked together by a series of sequences with text and images, which are responsible for narrating a fairly articulated and engaging plot (which also leaves itself go to easy moralisms, but so be it). Analyzed in this way, the game does not appear to be more than a series of ~minigames~ glued together, but it is precisely the substance of these applications that in fact represents something new: if Trauma Center: Under the Knife was created specifically for Nintendo DS, the Wii version, as mentioned, is not a mere conversion but has been redesigned to take full advantage of the characteristics of the Nintendo console: completely renewed graphics, modified controls, expanded and ~strengthened~ storyline, as well as many completely new tools that will be possible to use. We read a briefing of the intervention in which we are explained exactly what are the objectives to be achieved, then we leave: a smear of antibiotic gel, then the patient is opened with the scalpel and, once the organs are exposed, we proceed with the 'real operation, which, depending on the case, will see us extract splinters and suture wounds, or drain blood and remove tumor masses, or still fight against surprisingly intelligent and cunning viruses. Once the work is finished, all we have to do is close the incision, disinfect and apply a bandage, always under the watchful eye of a supervisor who will label our moves as good or bad. All this is managed through the Wii-mote / Nunchuck combination: the first obviously replaces the surgeon's hand in all its actions, the second allows us to select the instrument to be used (gel, forceps, scalpel, ultrasound, laser, drainage tube, suture needle, and syringe) depending on the direction in which you press the analog stick. The controllers are used together only when it comes to maneuvering and operating the defibrillator. To check the area with which you interact, the Wii-mote projects a luminous dot onto the screen: it is what you must refer to for each action, trying to be precise and to have a steady hand: as mentioned, every aspect of the intervention is monitored, eventually assigning us a different recognition depending on our ability. It is clear that making many mistakes can result in a game over (even for the patient...) or at least in a poor grade at the end of the operation, so you will have to learn to quickly manage the various tools and to intelligently dose the ~healing liquid~ ( which gives back some energy to our client). In general, however, be prepared to repeat the same stages even several times before completing them in the best way. Technical features There has been a lot of talk about the Wii's technical capabilities and the fact that most of the video games released so far don't exploit them properly. This discussion with Trauma Center: Second Opinion is not reflected, as the title developed by Asus makes use of graphics that are absolutely functional for the purpose, without detailed anatomical reproductions and without having to manage complex polygonal environments. What the game needs is all there, in a deliberately sparse patient model and in a long series of very well drawn two-dimensional characters. The sound sector, rather, stands out for a series of really high quality music, which in many cases recall the soundtrack of the various Resident Evil and which contribute not a little to creating the right atmosphere (failing, sometimes, due to contrasts too sharp between light motifs and serious). What matters most for Second Opinion, however, is undoubtedly the effectiveness of the control system, which is more important than ever in this case. Well, the Wii-mote always behaves very well, demonstrating unexpected accuracy and making up for any ~flaws~ with some expedient. The result is truly appreciable, and manages to give a particular, extremely engaging gaming experience. Comment The need for a good Wii video game was really felt. Furthermore, the need for a good video game designed specifically for the Wii was really felt, and in this Trauma Center: Second Opinion certainly does not disappoint. Immediate, engaging (sometimes bordering on frustration), with a very particular taste, the Atlus product can only garner acclaim from the owners of the Nintendo console, as it fits perfectly with its philosophy. The control system is not perfect but almost, making it difficult only when it is necessary to resort to the ~gift of Aesculapius~ (drawing a star on the screen). What about longevity? Perhaps this is the only real limit of a game that boasts seven ~chapters~ divided into about ten stages each, but which you end up completing in a week, such is the ~grip~ it exerts on the player. Advantage or defect? Pros: Really addictive Precise control system A good number of internships Cons: but they don't last long Sometimes really, really frustrating Using the special ability is hard Special operations At a certain point in the game, you will happen to try your hand at absolutely non-standard interventions, treated as real internships. In some cases (see image) it will be a question of solving puzzles with colored blocks, with the aim of helping the laboratory technician to develop an effective cure against new viruses. In other cases, however, you will even find yourself defusing time bombs using the tools of the trade! Merciless viruses The story told in Trauma Center: Second Opinion soon takes a precise turn, fueled by a powerful subplot. And so our Dr. Stiles will find himself operating on patients with GUILT, a virus born at the behest of terrorist organizations. It is to all intents and purposes an intelligent evil, capable of quickly creating tumor masses and reproducing itself. To deal with it we will have to use all our skill, switching tools very quickly and resorting, if necessary, to our paranormal power. Apparently, the innovation brought by Wii to the video game market goes hand in hand with what happened with the Nintendo DS. Despite being different in many respects, in fact, the two consoles share a control system that makes manual dexterity its central point, and which allows players to do exactly what their virtual alter ego does on the screen, instead of just pressing of the buttons. This is basically why Nintendo has sold millions of Wiis, and that's exactly what console owners have come to expect from every new release. So no one will be disappointed by Trauma Center: Second Opinion, a conversion of a title released some time ago for Nintendo DS (Trauma Center: Under the Knife) but completely redesigned for the occasion.", "date": "2007-08-14", "grade": null}
