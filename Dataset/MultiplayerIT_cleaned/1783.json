After watching the introductory movie we will be catapulted into the main menu of the game from which we will have the possibility to choose whether to load an old game or start a new one. if we decide to embark on a new career we will have to select one of the 4 characters, and with this embark on the adventure!. The game options will have to be defined once the character has been chosen, in the same menu we will then be able to decide whether to start a career or whether to have fun with the bonus missions available. It begins!! Now let's look at the actual game. The first thing you notice is the faithful reproduction of the driving style of the truck, in fact we won't be able to turn in short spaces or at high speeds, but we will have to learn to take the measurements well and calibrate the curves in the correct way. After up to an hour, however, the management of the truck will no longer be a problem, and you can concentrate on more important things. While we will drive from one city to another we will have to take into account some important factors: First of all we will have to pay attention to the fuel level and the damage suffered by the truck as, initially, the cost of refueling or repairing it will significantly affect the budget. In case you find yourself out of fuel on the road you will be automatically transported back to your city of departure. In addition to petrol and damage, another problem you will encounter during your travels will be the motorcyclists who, if run over, will join forces to attack your vehicle, causing you considerable damage (they get on the trailer of the truck, and to get them off you will have to zigzag, thus increasing the chances of an accident). To be able to accumulate a lot of money it will not be enough to have a good nose for business, but it will also be necessary to be excellent pilots! Every day you will be contacted by another truck driver who will challenge you to beat him in a speed race towards a city of your choice. The money up for grabs in the bet will depend above all on how much money you have available. If your badget will be high, then you will be able to earn a large sum, on the contrary, if your figures are too low, you will not find anyone willing to challenge you. In some cases, you will also be able to face special challenges. Going to talk to the barmaid with no load on board the truck, you could be offered a job, which if completed would bring you a nice nest egg. Going forward in the game you will find that it will be easier and easier to earn money, and therefore it will also be less tiring to spend it!. The wisest way to spend your money (aside from reinvesting it in new products) will be to upgrade the truck. There will be many upgrades available, from the most common horns to the rarest super engines, and will allow you to make travel easier. Vibrations The part that struck me the most about the title was the beauty of the vibrations. The developers have managed to exploit the potential of the microsoft pad very well as, unlike other titles, we will not have a continuous and annoying vibration. The vibration modes will be multiple and will be activated in the event of a skid when cornering or a collision with another vehicle. But what made me pleasantly surprised was the characteristic vibration when descending from a slope, which gives a really good idea of reality. Graphically speaking Certainly the look and feel is not the flagship feature of the title as this is nothing special. a rather ironic aspect on the subject is the fact that a gigantic truck, capable of destroying cars, signs and buildings, in some cases is unable to get on the sidewalk due to a block that automatically throws it backwards... However, the environments are created quite well, as are the vehicles. Conclusions Big Mutha Truckers is a very original game, and is therefore recommended for anyone who wants to discover a ~new~ genre, or in any case for racing enthusiasts. Probably the biggest flaw of the title lies in the monotony. It is true that we will be able to choose 4 different characters and undertake some bonus missions but, in the end, once the first 10 (in the game) days have passed, everything turns out to be the same... Big mutha truckers in my opinion is one of those titles that must be tried before being purchased and it cannot be excluded that asomeone i can like too much. Pros: ease of play the vibrations of the PAD originality Cons: in the long run repetitive graphics not great is not suitable for everyone History But Jackson has decided to retire from the business and leave Big mMtha Truckers Inc. to one of his 4 sons. The problem that arises is that of having to choose which of the 4 children will take over the reins of the family business. To escape this decision and to be sure that the position goes to the best, Ma Jackson inaugurates a competition between his ~babies~: whoever manages to accumulate the most money in 60 days will have Big Mutha Truckers Inc!. It is in this situation that the Big Mutha Truckers adventure will begin, in fact it will be us, with our deeds, who decide which of the 4 children will become the master!", "date": "2003-01-31", "grade": null}
