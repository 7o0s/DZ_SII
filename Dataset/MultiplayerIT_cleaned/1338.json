{"name": "Dead Man's Hand", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dead-mans-hand-3.html", "text": "I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride Glacial look, pointed boots, spurs, ankle-length coat, big hat and, of course, a full-featured belt with a pistol on each hip. It's true, we have left carnival behind us again this year, but it's also true that the budding cowboy, present in the ego of every lover of this piece of history, dreams at least once of decorating himself in this way. Not being able to do it at this particular time of the year, unless you particularly care about wearing an elegant straitjacket, we will still be able to vent our instincts by slipping into the virtual shoes of El Tejan. This gunslinger's reputation is one of the best: fast, cold and ruthless. The narrative, told through black and white cut scenes in the style of early 90s cinema, will tell the story of this character and his goals for revenge. Yes, because the gunslinger we will take on his behalf will have some unfinished business with his former gang, called The Nine, guilty of betraying him and - presumably - killed him. In fact El Tejan seriously risked death, but as every good Western teaches: if you don't finish it, sooner or later he will dig your grave. Hence the furious search for all the members of the 'distracted' band, in a succession of deja vu taken here and there by some progenitors of the cinematographic genre. Dead Man's Hand has the indisputable advantage of accompanying the player, rather faithfully, through those places that are the very soul of the Far West. We will therefore face the duels proposed in saloons, woods, ghost towns, deserts and hills. However, although the levels are scenically immersive, they turn out to be rather neglected, either due to their excessive brevity, or due to the equally excessive linearity comparable just to the rails on which an old steam train walks. The elements that distinguish the design of each location are few and poorly developed, barely regenerated by a discrete interaction with the seabed and by the numerous 'safety zones' immortalized in a table, a tree or a boulder in which to hide while waiting for the right moment to open fire. I'm wanted dead or alive The setting of Dead Man's Hand is typical of any first-person shooter adapted to the joypad. With a control system that can certainly be improved, but far from being bad, the Atari title offers some hints of novelty thanks to a combo system and the possibility of having two different shots for each weapon used. A visible bar in the lower left corner of the screen will indicate the special charge that can be used for extra shots, which can be a multiple shot from a Colt, the zoom for the sniper rifle, or the stun shot from the shotgun. The basic paraphernalia, as you will have well understood, will be divided into the three freshly mentioned categories, which will each boast a distinct set of weapons, in addition to sticks of dynamite and the dagger. The combo system is effective, even if a mere waste of shots. By hitting the specific targets proposed in the game at intervals of time, which will be both enemies and objects of various kinds, we will only replenish the secondary hit bar, which is useful on more than one occasion. On the other hand, the shooting accuracy is very bad, calibrated more than in spans, in meters. With this lack, the US developers enable the player to have greater accuracy in long-range shots rather than limited-range ones. A paradox. Furthermore, the implementation of minigames such as poker or horse sessions, similar to Panzer Dragoon Orta only for the shoot'em up-like setting on rails, is rather superficial. Something more is obtained by squeezing the four online modes present, which however do little to regenerate the interest of those who enter this Atari title. In terms of enemy AI, everything is quite normal, without particular cues but not even showy vertical collapses. The technical side of Dead Man's Hand is also on the wave of anonymity, which graphically gets along, despite passing through a sluggish frame rate and a rather low quality of the textures. The models of the bad guys don't shine either for polygonal composition or for animations. Only the settings manage to move the flat line of a graphic sector without jolts of any kind, provided that the Western-style backgrounds are appreciated. Also affected by the same problem of anonymity is the background music which, although always themed, never succeeds in pressing the action. Comment Human Head has done his homework without giving a soul to his work. In fact, Dead Man's Hand channels into uA tunnel made up of strengths linked to love for the type of setting and genre of game, and defects attributable to a basic carelessness that is felt for the entire duration of the game. A few good ideas and little more make this title advisable above all to those who are never satisfied with FPS and to those who dream instead of being able to reincarnate as a new Clint Eastwood. Without infamy and without praise. Pros: Evocative settings. Immediate. A few points worth noting. Cons: Flat level design. Technically poorly maintained. Shooting accuracy totally to be reviewed. The younger generations probably won't fully know the golden age of cinema twenty years, and even more, ago. They were the films of lone heroes and their faithful steeds; films full of lead and sentences to be tattooed on the forearm; the films of women in eternal and anxious waiting for the return of their lover, who logically had other things to think about. One could go on for centuries quoting this or that actor, director or composer, but it would only be a melancholic wave of memories, precisely those memories that stick, who knows why, to one film rather than another. The last true exponent of this genre, squeezed to capacity, dates back to the first half of the nineties; that Tombstone which, on balance, is absurdly one of the best Western productions ever, with its exemplary vision of the pivotal episode in the life of Wyatt Earp: the shooting of Ok Corral. The matter is different for what concerns the world of video games, which has always been rather snobbish towards the setting linked to the old Far West. And now a little quiz: think of the most suitable genre for a Western game. You did? That's right, it is First Person Shooting that fully embodies the essence of the legendary shootings of America that was. The Americans Human Head must have had the same opinion, who with their latest effort, Dead Man's Hand, take the player to the sandy settings of a Western with all the trappings.", "date": "2004-04-08", "grade": null}
