This is unless particular compromises are found, modifying the standard features to be able to carry a fighting game on a portable device with a touch screen, as we see in this review of EA Sports UFC Mobile 2 on mobile platforms, but the results can be quite disappointing for those expecting a faithful transposition of the original classic experience. A game so strongly focused on the control system and the timing of executing moves and counter moves cannot fit well in this context, therefore a profound adaptation to create an alternative specifically designed for iOS and Android is - at least ideally - the best solution. but it obviously risks distorting the whole structure to which it should refer, just as happens in this case. EA Sports UFC Mobile 2 on iOS and Android therefore derives from a good job in conceptual terms, evolving what was also done with the first chapter and adapting it even better to mobile use, but in this way moving away even more clearly from what the spirit should be of a fighting game. What comes out is something in between, a compromise that works perfectly with the touch screen but fails to be as engaging as a fighting game or a real fighting simulation, also burdened by the usual complications of free-to-play games between currencies in -game, running out of energy and micro-transactions. The aim of the game is to evolve your own gym by hiring new fighters and leading them to win matches in order to climb the world rankings, therefore we witness on the one hand some management elements on the evolution of the fighters and on the other the main element of game experience: the fight in the octagon. Gameplay: orbi beating and workouts EA Sports UFC Mobile 2, a scene from a fight UFC 2 takes advantage of the official license of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, thus proposing real fighters from the mixed martial arts organization, which obviously represents a significant plus for MMA fans. For all the others, the game perhaps doesn't have much to offer, beyond a truly remarkable technical impact on mobile platforms, with a very spectacular aspect even on not too advanced devices. Playing the role of owner of a new emerging gym, we find ourselves recruiting new fighters and evolving them, winning matches and climbing the world rankings through a Campaign mode with progressive matches and limited-time live events. The gameplay is essentially divided between the fight in the octagon and the management of the fighters, with training to be carried out in the gym, the conquest of new cards for fighters and challenges and the use of bonuses and consumables to increase the value and power of the fighters. The fight phase in the ring takes place in real time, but is based on a highly simplified fighting game mechanic to accommodate the use of the touch screen and typical mobile use, with very short matches featuring an extremely gradual challenge rate. EA Sports UFC Mobile 2, some of the real licensed fighters featured in the game The controls are based on quick taps and swipes to deliver quick, medium or powerful blows and chain them into combos, with the addition of a few special skills characteristic of each fighter. Being a game inspired by reality, deriving from a sort of real simulation, the clashes tend towards realism and do not present the fantastic spectacularity typical of the classic fighting game: here we are dealing with real athletes who fight using real moves, therefore also the game mechanics are necessarily simpler and more repetitive. In essence, it is above all about dodging and parrying at the right moment or starting one's attacks trying to avoid the opposing guard, however the considerable input lag makes everything a bit random, while the not very advanced artificial intelligence somewhat lowers the level of challenge and strategy required to win matches. Entertainment and micro-management EA Sports UFC Mobile 2, the progression between fights to get to the top Looking at images and videos, it's easy to notice the most striking aspect of EA Sports UFC Mobile 2, or rather its realistic graphics that manage to have an excellent impact, thanks also to animations built with a good use of motion capture. This is probably the most satisfying aspect of the game,which pushes you to return to the octagon to take part in new meetings, at least until you realize that there aren't many variables at stake and the experience tends to be a bit repetitive. At least, some tactical elements of a certain interest have been introduced: for example, there are different fighting styles to which the various wrestlers belong, and to face a fight in the most balanced or advantageous way possible, it is advisable to select the fighter with the style who can better counter the opponent, based on a circular ~rock-paper-scissors~ scheme. Beyond the rather limited gameplay mechanics such as attack and defense solutions, an aspect that tends to flatten the gaming experience it is the fact that the clash is mainly focused on the power level of the fighter, which can be increased through the purchase of bonuses in the various in-game currencies. This introduces a sort of grinding, which leads to advancement in the game simply through the purchase and application of power-ups through training rather than actual improvements in the player's skill. If this is combined with the whole apparatus of micro-transactions it is easy to understand how UFC 2 falls precisely into the classic problems of free-to-play, although in truth it presents a very gradual introduction and allows you to play quietly for a while bit without hitting any paywall.", "date": "2022-01-24", "grade": "6.5"}
