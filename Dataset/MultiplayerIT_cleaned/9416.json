However, with Buddy Rush the qualitative bar of browser games (later also transported to iOS devices) was, at least according to the wishes of the developers, quite raised: managing an RPG with a three-dimensional view in fact, as simplified as it can be, certainly represents a challenge more difficult than the traditional and basic immediate strategies presented so far on Facebook. Hunting for Oblins with Facebook friends An essential prerequisite for playing Buddy Rush is therefore having a Facebook account: the cross and delight of gamers, synchronization with the famous Social Network is rather invasive, due to the game features aimed at recruiting as many ~friends~ as possible. In fact, as in many other exponents of the genre, inviting contacts will result in a series of direct and indirect advantages, which can be concretized in an immediate availability of chips (which represent the coins of the game) or in a greater choice of characters that can be used in the party during the adventures . Buddy Rush is therefore ultimately a rather classic role-playing game, even if the type of selectable characters is at least anomalous: in addition to the classic warriors, wizards, thieves and swordsmen, it is possible to choose, for example, an attractive girl whose ability is ~distracting enemies~ through her charms, or Cinderella's sister (Cinderella in the Anglo-Saxon version), Botherella, perpetually frustrated by the notoriety of her blood relative, as well as an elegant ~Vampino~, inspired by Tom Cruise's ~Interview with the Vampire~; irony and humor are therefore the elements that unite all the bizarre game extras. Once the choice is completed, the customization is practically nil: only the objects encountered during the adventures and received as a prize will be able to change the appearance of the character in the slightest part. In a small way, the protagonist's village contains all the clichs of an RPG: the merchant, inventory management, skill upgrades, the mission log (entrusted to the door guard) and even a (useless) mini fishing game. However, as mentioned above, the peculiar aspect concerns party management: to tackle the quests, the choice of companions is entrusted to the characters created by other Buddy Rush players scattered throughout the vast world of Facebook; bringing the avatars on missions contributes to their growth, for a limit of 4 consecutive missions. Each quest consumes a stamina bar, the depletion of which causes the game to stop until the arrival of a new comrade in arms (or for 45 minutes if you want to reuse the previous ones); the inevitable microtransactions apply to the purchase of the aforementioned chips but, at least for the first half of the game, they are not necessary for the correct execution of the gameplay. After 4 missions, the change of travel companions is therefore mandatory, an event that will push the furious rotation of occasional partners via Facebook (as well as fomenting wild spam on message boards); however, the choice of companions must be made carefully, depending on the type of quest to be faced: in fact, the game requires a minimum of strategic approach in the more advanced levels. To move the group of characters, just touch the portion of land where you want to place them on the screen; the attacks are automatic, but it is still possible to choose a primary target in case of multiple attacks. To attack large groups of enemies or imposing end-of-level bosses, standard weapons are flanked by effective defensive and offensive spells; the type of opponents ranges from simple and nice worms to the Oblins, without the G in front but still quite familiar to fans of fantasy games while each of the 5 game worlds is infested by particular themed monsters, particularly difficult to defeat. The real nature of the quests is the most unpredictable imaginable: we go from a classic search for objectives in the various dungeons (always rather small) to the defense of posts, from rescuing friends in difficulty to finding antidotes and potions; a particular mission is worthy of mention, which involves the recovery of some rolls of toilet paper necessay to a poor unfortunate person locked in the bathroom... The problem with these nice quests is that, although they are numerous, in order to unlock important objects and experience levels, they must be faced at least 3 times each, causing the infamous Gran Turismo effect; considering the level cap set at 60, it is therefore understandable how the longevity of the title is truly enormous, to the detriment of the variety. Technically speaking, while certainly not being able to compare the game to more serious productions, there is at least a detachment from the classic Browser Game setting, with simple but clean 3D graphics, a fluid framerate and nice different animations for each class; the possibility of playing both at home and on the move with the same character is in any case a welcome plus, a policy that Microsoft intends to implement in the near future with Xbox Live for Windows Phone. Finally, a demerit note on the accompanying melodies, nice for the first 5 minutes but then decidedly unbearable.
