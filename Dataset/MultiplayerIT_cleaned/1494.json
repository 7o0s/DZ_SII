{"name": "Silent Hill 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/silent-hill-17.html", "text": "Who we are? Silent Hill 3, like its predecessors, offers survival horror gameplay, a mixture of action, exploration, combat and puzzles. We are Heather, a girl we know nothing about, and who wakes up in a shopping mall, having had a terrifying nightmare, in what appears to be a horror playground, filled with blood-covered human beings, slain dead amusement characters and sharp-edged monsters bent on killing us as soon as possible. The story is not immediately clear. At first we meet a detective named Douglas who tells us he wants to help us, but the situation quickly spirals into a whirlwind of terror and we find ourselves running inside the mall, chased by terrifying monsters and creatures. Unlike the previous Silent Hill chapters, this time the story is perhaps a little less engaging at the beginning. The main reason is that, for once, we're not looking for someone who was dear to us and who disappeared in Silent Hill; this time we are trying to discover ourselves, but with very few elements that can help us from the beginning. Furthermore, for the first time, the story does not originate in the very unsmiling town of Silent Hill. Gameplay The game structure is almost unchanged from its predecessors. We have to explore areas and solve puzzles to be able to access the next areas; in the meantime we find ourselves having to fight against bloodthirsty monsters, hellish dogs and a myriad of increasingly ugly and evil monsters, determined to take us to the grave with them. To defend ourselves we have at our disposal a well-nourished set of weapons, both for hand-to-hand combat and for ranged combat. If you thought in previous chapters that it was difficult to stay alive, now you will find yourself changing your mind in no time. Silent Hill 3 is even more difficult, although it is always possible to select the level of difficulty of the fights between three different options. Often we will have to fight against several monsters at the same time and we will not always be able to rely on firearms; instead it will be advisable to learn to run quickly and to distance our pursuers. To recover energy we have first aid bottles available, and as far as weapons are concerned, there are various ammunition scattered in the game locations. We can also use meat as bait for certain monsters, in order to distract them and be able to overcome them without having to engage in combat. Fortunately, among other things, we can recover the maps of the areas in which we move and use them to understand exactly where we are at any time and keep track of the areas that are not accessible or that we have already visited and where we have not been able to solve riddles or special situations. Settings Silent Hill 3 introduces a series of new environments and others already seen in previous games. The mall where we wake up at the beginning of the adventure should remind us of the first Silent Hill, while the subway station, sewers and other areas are completely new. Only halfway through the adventure will we really return to the town of Silent Hill. During our pilgrimage, we will continue to go from real life to nightmarish versions of the same settings. What until a few minutes before had seemed like a normal shopping center, with only a few misplaced waste bins, will present itself again as a terrifying place, with walls covered in blood, monsters from our worst nightmares and secrets to reveal. These passages from one world to another are underlined by the state of mind of Heather, who from time to time feels dizzy and loses consciousness, before finding herself in the corrupted version of the same place she was a few moments before. It goes without saying that as we find ourselves in the dark side of the world, everything becomes darker, more frightening, covered with bodies piled up in every corner and bloodstained, with rusty grates on the floors and echoes of noises and screams that come from afar but seem get closer to the turn of each corner. Differences between the PC and PS2 version Silent Hill 3 hits the mark and at the same time disappoints a bit in its PC version. On the positive side, there is the full exploitation of the greater graphics capabilities compared to the PS2. Indeed, we can set the game to reach resolutions up to 1600x1200 at 32bit depth.dity of color. All without affecting the speed of the game in any way. To this we also add the possibility of being able to save at any time. We are no longer forced to look for pentagrams that represent the areas where we can save; at any time we can access the game menu and save. If on the one hand all this is very comfortable, on the other hand it loosens a little the tension that normally arises when we are in the middle of a rather difficult situation and we cannot be sure of getting out alive. The fact of saving allows us at any time to make sure that we won't have to redo a certain section of the game from scratch, to the detriment of an otherwise guaranteed dose of adrenaline. The only aspect that I feel like defining negative, even if in the end it is not totally problematic, is the control system. Konami has ported the exact same control system used on PlayStation 2 to PC. The problem is that if you don't have a gamepad available, moving around with the keyboard and mouse isn't exactly intuitive. It takes some time and some getting used to. We control the character with both the keys and the mouse: this is used to aim, shoot and move the view, which makes it rather complex to move and at the same time change the viewing angle. All of this has repercussions above all in situations in which we have to fight or escape some monster, as we are often unable to move and at the same time to have a view of the direction in which we are going. Another sore point is that the ~making of~ will not be included in the PC version either, i.e. the movie showing how Silent Hill 3 was created, which has instead been published separately in recent months in some national and foreign magazines. What makes Silent Hill 3 unique in its genre? There is no doubt that the strength of Silent Hill 3 lies precisely in the obsessive attention to detail. Once again we find the film grainy effect we had encountered in Silent Hill 2, and if Konami had been reduced to publishing a new adventure with the same graphics engine, it probably would not have made a hole in the water. Instead, with Silent Hill 3, it went further by introducing new special visual effects, such as the animated walls in which blood moves appear to be living creatures ready to emerge from the flat dimension of concrete and come to life before our eyes. The light and shadow effects have been further improved, and we can appreciate the efforts by observing Heather as she moves around with the flashlight in her hand which casts dynamic light and shadows in real time. And as always, we find ourselves in front of some of the most beautiful cinematics ever in the history of video games. The characters have been created, animated, with attention to every detail so that they look as real as possible. Even the monsters, in their deformities and attitudes, take up some of our most unconscious fears and go fishing in the community for the symbology that we have learned to associate with what is evil and dangerous. A world without music has no meaning to exist Already Silent Hill 2 had amazed with a refined and captivating soundtrack. Silent Hill 3 is no different. Once again we find ourselves running and walking in dark corridors, where our footsteps echo and where the echo of the damned reaches our ears from the depths of hell that lives in our minds. The monsters seem alive also thanks to the sound effects that give them credibility and make them look like demons who have come from hell to take us away, to devour us or crush our bodies under their weight. There is also a soundtrack in a style that goes from pop to rock, complete with songs played and sung by Vanessa Williams. The only flaw, for us Italians, is the lack of dubbing of the voices of the characters, which have remained in English and subtitled in Italian. It's a real shame as the original version of the voices has been treated very much and helps to identify ourselves with the part. Having to occasionally take your eyes off the animated scenes to read the subtitles somewhat detracts from the overall experience. Comment In conclusion, Silent Hill 3 is the right sequel to a successful series. The story is captivatingand is sufficiently varied to keep us glued to the monitor. The gameplay is not particularly different from what we have been used to for this genre of games, which makes it particularly appealing to fans of the series and those who are passionate about all that is dark, gloomy, scary and breathtaking. Pros: Engaging storyline Beautiful setting Excellent soundtrack Cons: Unconvincing control system Slightly repetitive gameplay The save system slightly distorts the experience And the story continues A lot of time has already passed since Konami released the first Silent Hill, in 1999. Silent Hill was the first step of the software house in the survival horror market, a genre until then controlled almost exclusively by Capcom with its Resident Evil. Konami hasn't tried to replicate Capcom's work and has instead ventured down a path that is darker, more terrifying, and even more immersive. It is no coincidence that the story of Silent Hill, as well as its monsters and its settings, have become a real cult that has transformed in a short time into a series that up to now has not betrayed the expectations of the players. Silent Hill 3 must live up to the tradition of quality seen up to now, and it does it loudly, with a new adventure up to the standards expected of a Konami product.", "date": "2003-11-10", "grade": null}
