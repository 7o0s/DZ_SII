With Cast of the Seven Godsend, the all-Italian team of Raven Travel Studios drew inspiration above all from the second title, paying homage to many aspects, so we will see that, although the final result has a fairly amateur imprint, it managed to make us go back in time. Starting from the plot, it does not seem that there are too many pretensions: seven centuries ago, the evil emperor Zaraiima was imprisoned by the seven deities of Dareca who ensured a period of peace and prosperity for the kingdom. But prisons, as you know, have an expiration date (as Superman's General Zod also teaches) and, therefore, Zaraiima is about to return with the typical anger of someone who has been segregated without doing anything for the last seven hundred years . To complete the ritual that will allow him to return to doing what he pleases, the emperor needs the newborn son of King Kandar and for this he has him kidnapped by his henchmen who, for safety, kill Kandar himself. Nothing is lost, because the seven Gods are about to put things right again this time but, since the son of Kandar is involved and after seven hundred years the desire of the Gods to get their hands dirty again is somewhat limited, they decide to resurrect the king, who is still quite young and vigorous, by placing their powers at his disposal. It won't be an Oscar-worthy screenplay but it is much more than the plot of the titles that went on thirty years ago and in which the most common excuse to justify the fight against monsters and demons was the kidnapping of the beloved on duty. Cast of the Seven Godsends is a tribute to the ~jump and gun~ platformers of the past Lucky 7 Cast of the Seven Godsends is a very fast-paced two-dimensional side-scrolling platformer in which you'll only be able to jump and throw your currently equipped weapon horizontally and vertically. On your way you will meet, thanks to divine intervention, ~orbs~ containing both bonus items, which give points or small advantages such as an increase in jump, and armor which, if kept intact until the next bonus item, activates one of the powers of the seven gods. These powers, chosen randomly, change the graphic appearance of your hero, depending on which god is granting you his favor, and vary both the basic attack and the special attack, which is obtained by holding down the attack button and releasing the ~violence~ of the God: the combinations are thirty-five and constitute the most interesting variant of Cast of the Seven Godsends. There are four selectable difficulty levels ranging from Easy to Retrogamer (a sort of Hardcore level) and the sore point is precisely the difficulty level of the game: having or not having a divine power really makes too much difference. Although it is probably a desired setting, an end or mid-level boss, in our opinion, cannot make us go from a ridiculous difficulty to an almost impossible one without having the power equipped, even if playing on the Easy level. It took us something like thirty lives just to kill the mid-level boss unarmored. In addition, there are some purely platforming parts that you can easily fall into and, if this happens while you are in possession of one of the aforementioned powers, it will be a pain to get them again to face the end-of-level boss. Another problem to highlight is the response of the jump command which, sometimes, does not coincide with the moment in which we press the button to perform this action, causing annoying falls and loss of the aforementioned bonuses. There is the option from the main menu to freeze the frames at 60 frames per second and this, while making the action even more frenetic, amplifies the imprecise response of the jumps too much. My dear friend The graphic style of the character we control seems to be taken from Japanese manga while, more generally, the backgrounds, enemies and settings are reminiscent of Amiga 500 platformers such as Shadow of the Beast or Leander. The map of the various areas of the game is in full Ghost'n Goblins style and is used to identify the progress of our hero: it is not possible to change the screen resolution but it is only possible to make some small adjustments to the graphic effects to lighten the game engine. game and allow it to run even on older PCs. The presentation in which the preamble of the game is told is in English with Italian subtitles while the game is available not only in our language but also in English, French, Spanish, German, Russian and Japanese. The dialogues are notnothing special but in this the game faithfully reflects the video games of thirty years ago, story limited to a few lines of text and lots of action. The musical sector, although the effort to compose what we called 'musicette' in those years is appreciable, remains quite anonymous: they are catchy melodies but, in our opinion, they do not hold a candle to those of the Capcom titles that most inspired Cast of the Seven Godsends.", "date": "2015-07-20", "grade": "6.0"}
