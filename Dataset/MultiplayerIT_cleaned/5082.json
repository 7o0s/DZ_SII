Products that take the experience developed by the most famous PC franchises and reduce it effectively, summarizing the timing of the matches, adapting the controls to the touch context and making the use of objects more immediate, but all without reaching a degree of simplification such as to distort the strategic and highly competitive gameplay that has always characterized multiplayer online battle arenas. A promising scenario, which has led to the creation of various valuable productions, at least until Supercell decided to take the field with its Clash Royale and defeat everything and everyone with the strength of an intuition that immediately proved to be successful. In fact, what the authors of Clash of Clans managed to do was make MOBAs an experience within everyone's reach, with various strategic substrates that it was possible to deepen or ignore beautifully, while continuing to enjoy one-on-one matches -one and better enhance your roster of characters. Well, how would the exact same formula be enriched by an important license like that of Star Wars? Netmarble Games shows it to us with Star Wars: Force Arena, a title that involves right from the start thanks to the very fact of possessing mechanisms completely similar to those of Clash Royale, however presenting heroes, villains and basic units taken from the universe of famous film saga. Star Wars: Force Arena is an excellent Clash Royale clone, less immediate but with something extra Jedi and arena After completing a simple tutorial that leads to the unlocking of some characters, including Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia, the Star Wars: Force Arena main screen allows you to try your hand at the first online games against other users and therefore notice the many similarities with the experience of Clash Royale. The two factions face each other in scenarios well known to fans of the franchise, although the connotation of the map is always the same: a track with two main lanes in which our objective is to destroy the enemy base by passing through three turrets of defence. As time passes, the action energy indicator loads and allows us to recall the units we have inserted into our deck: their role is to stem the opponent's assaults, but also absorb the blows that they would otherwise be addressed to our hero. There are something like eighty characters to unlock, including those from Rogue One, so we're literally talking about a paradise for Star Wars fans, even more so if they enjoyed the experience of the aforementioned Clash Royale. In fact, between one game and another, there is a plethora of unlocked objects and ~sachets~ of virtual cards to open: by collecting a certain number of the same type and using some coins, it is possible to enhance the relative units by leveling them up. The fundamental difference with the Supercell blockbuster lies precisely in the presence of the protagonists, who move around the map like the characters of any MOBA, whereas the units that act automatically play a bit the role of minions, although they certainly have greater importance strategic. In short, the structure developed by Netmarble Games manages to involve in the long term, unlocking the two-against-two multiplayer after a few games and offering bonuses and special events every day that keep interest high, together with the same connotation ~ to classes~ of the heroes, which differ both in terms of the type of attack and the ~special move~. For example, Luke fights with a lightsaber and can perform a special using the Force, while instead Leia strikes from a distance with a laser gun and can call a group of soldiers to her instantly. The system is well supported by a well-made technical sector, with well-detailed and fairly animated polygonal models, as well as sound effects and music that draw heavily on the Disney franchise.", "date": "2017-01-24", "grade": "8.5"}
