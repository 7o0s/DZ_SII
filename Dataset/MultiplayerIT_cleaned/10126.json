Whatever your preference at the moment, Tilt to Live will ask you for a moment to calibrate and then will offer you the usual dose of spectacular action where a lot happens but there is only one certainty: you will die. And we are not referring to the natural end of your earthly life, so you can take your hands out of your pockets. The fact is that the product developed by One Man Left Studios appears to be strongly characterized by two fundamental elements: the first, mentioned in the introduction, is the control system based exclusively on the accelerometer; the second is its ~survival~ nature, which sees each game as a unique opportunity to score the highest possible score, with only one life available and game over that occurs mercilessly as soon as our ~cursor~ is touched from an enemy. I will survive The gameplay of Tilt to Live is extremely simple: we are inside a stage as big as the screen of our Apple device, and by tilting it we can move a white pointer. The level of inclination and the speed with which we produce it directly affect the movement of the pointer, which can therefore move quickly from one part of the scenario to another to avoid enemy units. The latter are represented by red dots which, as the seconds go by, not only multiply in a monstrous way, but can also aggregate to create forms with greater resistance and speed. Since touching an enemy even once results in the end of the game, how can we survive and maybe score a good score? Well, objects appear on the screen in a completely random way that are activated on contact and which allow us to destroy those hateful red dots. At the beginning the weapons in question are only three: a sort of bomb with a limited range but whose detonation persists for a few seconds; an old-school purple ~beam~ that can be directed at will; a charge of homing projectiles that strike the closest enemies. Others can be added to these tools using a very interesting mechanism, based on the achievements that are unlocked as we enter our scores in the world rankings via the AGON service. The upgrades in question are capable of literally transforming the gaming experience, allowing us to survive much longer and reach otherwise unthinkable scores. On a technical level, it is clearly the control system that dominates: the movement of the device is captured with great precision, allowing us improbable evolutions in the presence of a simple virtual d-pad, and the learning curve is anything but steep . The graphics of the game are characterized by a very clean and effective style, which on the one hand takes advantage of geometric shapes and pre-packaged figures, on the other hand manages them in an absolutely fluid and convincing way, creating a lively, colorful and spectacular environment. Music and effects accompany the matches in the best way, with sustained rhythms and sounds of sufficient impact. The tested version is 1.0 App Store links", "date": "2010-03-23", "grade": "7.9"}
