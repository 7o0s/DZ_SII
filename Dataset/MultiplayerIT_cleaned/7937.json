Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a cent. After the Ruzzle phenomenon, which for a certain period literally monopolized smartphones and social networks, the Swedish developers of MAG Interactive are attacking with a new, ambitious project: QuizCross. The game is available for free on the App Store and Google Play, but even in this case it is possible to use an in-app purchase to switch to the pro version, so as to eliminate the ads (which, however, did not seem particularly invasive) and access the statistics related to your matches. The basic idea for this new puzzle game is simple but interesting: mixing trivia and a classic like ~tic-tac-toe~ within the well-tested asynchronous online multiplayer mode, thus allowing users to challenge perfect strangers or to draw their own antagonists from the friends list on Facebook, from followers on Twitter or from the internal list of QuizCross, which we can edit at will. But how does it all work? Once a challenge has been set up, we are presented with a board made up of nine boxes and the objective is to conquer three of them, forming a horizontal or oblique row, as in the ~tris~. The boxes are ~thematic~: there is one dedicated to history, one to entertainment, one to geography, one to sport, one to music, one to science, one to trivia and then there is the central one, which includes questions belonging to various genres. To conquer a box, we must select it during our turn and then answer three themed questions: guessing all three will give us complete control, while getting one or two answers out of three right will leave a window for our opponent, who can try to conquer the same box providing a greater number of correct answers. A lot of stuff, little thickness The use of simple mechanics such as ~tic-tac-toe~ has a clear ~demeaning~ effect on the experience, which certainly cannot boast the depth of other competitive puzzle games, but the huge amount of different questions undoubtedly represents one of the strengths of QuizCross. During our tests, we have never yet come across two identical texts, which is certainly a good sign in terms of the longevity of the title and the consistency of the challenge it offers. During a game it is possible to touch the icon at the top right to access some extra options: the inevitable text chat, with which to maliciously tease the opponent on duty; the ability to add the current challenger to the friends list; the possibility of giving up the match and therefore handing over the victory to the opponent; and finally an in-depth overview of the game rules, currently only in English but certainly useful for better understanding certain aspects, in particular those concerning the ~disputed~ squares. Also in the case of QuizCross the use of asynchronous online multiplayer proves to be perfectly functional for the purpose, assisted by simple and clear graphics, enriched by some nice drawings and pleasant background music.", "date": "2013-03-23", "grade": "7.0"}
