{"name": "Gears 5", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gears-5-recensione.html", "text": "Gears 5 review: the new episode of the exclusive Microsoft series, available on Xbox One and PC (this first article is based on the console version), really had a lot to prove after a very nice but not revolutionary fourth chapter, openly used by the team of development as a test bed to fully understand what the mechanics and structure of the game were, in a work of deconstruction that would prove to be invaluable in the future. And here we are, precisely, admiring what the guys from The Coalition have managed to achieve, both in terms of the campaign and in terms of multiplayer. The events narrated in this fifth chapter are placed immediately after the story of Gears of War 4 and go to deepen Kait's past in particular, revealing important information on the girl's family and her ties to the Locusts, but also on the origin of these creatures. The authors have managed to combine various elements in a convincing way, answering questions that fans of the saga have been asking for quite some time and using a system that tries to go beyond the confines of linear third person shooters, all using a very precise progression: the first act of the campaign acts as a link with the past, whereas the subsequent ones introduce the novelty of the Skiff, a sailing sled that allows you to cover long distances, to project us into open maps that are very reminiscent of the sections on the Uncharted 4: A Thief's End jeep and allow you to try your hand not only with the main missions but also with some side quests that increase the duration of the single player experience, which is around thirteen hours. Then of course there is the online component, which starts precisely from the possibility of tackling the campaign in a cooperative and extends to a mix of modes that include absolute novelties (Escape, a fight against time for three players) and very well-tested elements ( the Versus in its various forms and the Horde). Gears 5 story and characters In an attempt not to anticipate anything about the history of Gears 5, we can say with great tranquility that with this episode the series takes a big step forward in terms of storytelling, direction and characterization. Epic Games has created an undoubtedly fascinating lore, but without ever feeling the need to delve into it too much, an aspect that The Coalition instead seems to have put in first place. The introductory sequences that see JD, his father Marcus, Del and Kait venturing underground in search of important data relating to the Hammer of Dawn, are extremely evocative and definitively close the door to the ocher tones of the classic chapters, turning to extremely colorful settings and suggestive, as well as always ready to be remodeled due to a sudden collapse or an unexpected event. The sentences that the characters exchange, especially during the cutscenes, draw a picture of great uncertainty for what will become the absolute protagonist of the adventure from the second act onwards, Kait precisely: the death of her mother and the mysterious connection with the Swarm have put her to the test causing her nightmares, headaches and visions that are represented in a very interesting way in the game, passing from in-game action to real-time cinematics seamlessly. Even in these situations the influence of the works of Naughty Dog appears quite evident, but Gears 5 does not renounce its own personality in any way and indeed imposes it frequently. For example, there is a moment in which we see good old Cole again and it seems that the character has been considerably weakened compared to his glorious past, put a little on the sly; until he comes up with one of his spectacular actions that save goat and cabbage, redeeming himself big time. In short, action and narration go hand in hand, in a skilful mix capable of creating a great atmosphere between one firefight and another, and also able to indulge in some whim by rummaging through the lesser-known releases of the franchise. Only note: there is a little filing missing in the closing of some scenes and there is a moment in the campaign in which the voices of the characters go out of sync, which is very annoying since it is a rather important scene. An update will hopefully fix these little pieces of the puzzle that are still out of place. Gameplay and weapons The mechanisms underlying the Gears 5 experience are those that fans of the series know well, but the developers have added an interesting extra substrate by giving greater relevance to the figure of Jack, the drone that accompanies the lostnages in their missions. In its new version, the robot is in fact used to activate distant switches, open doors, sneak into air ducts in search of a device to interact with and more. However, his value in battle represents the main dish: Jack does not limit himself to throwing electric shocks on enemies, but can use a whole series of special abilities to be unlocked during the campaign, which can be upgraded through the use of components hidden around, which they greatly enhance exploration and provide us with far more interesting reasons than collecting nameplates to sneak into rooms and hidden corners. The valence of the ~powers~ of the drone embraces a wide range of situations: a pulse allows us to detect enemies and nearby objects, a barrier makes us invulnerable to fire and gas for short distances, invisibility allows us to go around opponents and the turrets, the barrier also protects us from heavy fire for a few seconds, and then again the flash stuns the locusts just enough to give us a concrete advantage, the electric trap proves to be very useful against the waves, the remote control allows you to corrupt a unit robotics in the hands of the Swarm, and so on. These are very important innovations, which together with the retrieve maneuvers (Jack can grab and deliver us any weapon found on the map, avoiding exposure to enemy fire) and an excellent balance in the amount of available ammunition add a lot to the fun and definitely make the fresher the experience. To these aspects are added the new actions that can be performed from behind a shelter, in correspondence with an opponent, using the knife, and the unprecedented stealth component, which allows you to carry out silent eliminations where our presence has not already been detected. In support of this system we find an arsenal mostly borrowed from Gears of War 4, but with some interesting additions: the huge Mazza Breaker, a war mace that introduces an unprecedented melee approach and allows you to literally tear enemies to pieces, even the bigger ones, in a short time but has limited resistance; the Claw machine gun, which should be used for long bursts as it progressively increases accuracy rather than losing it; the Cryocannon, which transforms opponents into ice to be split with a kick; Flashbang grenades, which stun those within their blast radius; and the Lancer GL, which forgoes the chainsaw in favor of a powerful missile launcher. Scenarios, structure and enemies As anticipated, the Gears 5 campaign starts by trying to offer us the best possible version of the classic formula, both from a technical and an artistic point of view. In short, the first act stands as a connecting element between the past and the future of the franchise, remaining anchored to a traditional structure with linear levels, while not missing anything in terms of spectacularity and atmosphere. You move inside bunkers, but also in the middle of cities devastated by war, in the corridors of an abandoned hotel or behind the scenes of a theater that gives life to a particularly choreographic clash. The shades are completely new and a bit of everything is experimented, from the vegetal invasion to the mix of gold and blue, but it is from the second act onwards that things literally take off and on all fronts. Kait assumes the narrative command of the experience and her story is put at the center, leading us to visit settings that are as fascinating as they are fresh and diverse, which include, for example, a large snowy valley and a ~Soviet~ region full of red sand. The developers have not forgotten the windstorms, and this is how some of the most engaging sequences of the exploratory phase come to life, which takes place within large and freely explorable maps: small open worlds to go around aboard the Skiff , focusing on the main missions or taking the time and freedom to discover some secrets and identify side assignments. Be careful though: all quests must be completed during the run, because at the end of the campaign it will not be possible to return. So let's come to the enemies, who in Gears 5 play a very important role also on a narrative level due to the aforementioned link between Kait and the Locusts. Well, the bestiary that appears before us is certainly very broad, drawing on the rich roster that we already know and adding some weighty new entries: the kamikaze versions of the larvae, which explode on contact; the Bastion and the Stump, corrupted mutations of robots in the service of the COG; the Guardian, who protects himself with his clubs before tearing us apart; newand variants of Swarm soldiers, with armor that makes them harder to take out; the terrible leeches that fly in swarm and bosses like the all-powerful Matriarch. An integration work has therefore been done which has the merit of increasing the types of ~bad guys~, adding some aberrations of sure impact and consolidating a system that already feared few comparisons. The multiplayer modes Gears 5 boasts an extraordinary campaign, but the series is also and above all known for its multiplayer modes, which obviously are not lacking in this new episode. We were able to test them thanks to a couple of sessions organized by the developers, but it was a less thorough test than we would have liked, especially with respect to the amount of options available: we will keep an eye on the situation in the coming days for any adjustments. Let's start with the Versus, which we tested during the Tech Test and which is more or less the same, obviously net of the possible stipulations. There are currently twelve multiplayer maps and they offer an excellent variety, with some encroachments beyond the traditional symmetrical structure (Mostra and Vasgar), and it is possible to play in nine different types of matches: Arcade Deathmatch, Arms Race (with the weapons that are changed as the kills are made), Dodgeball (each kill brings a member of our team back to life), Escalation (territorial mode in which you have to control the rings that appear on the map), Execution, Guardian (you have to kill the leader of the opposing team in order to stop his teammates from respawning), King of the Hill, Team Deathmatch and the classic Warzone. The latency of each server is clearly indicated when setting up a custom match, as well as the cross-play functionality can be adjusted so that PC and Xbox One users also compete in ranked or unranked. There are ten characters, but in the Ultimate Edition Sarah Connor and the T-800 from the film Terminator: Dark Fate are added, respectively from the ranks of the COG and the Swarm. Apart from these extra figures, the new entries are represented by the presumptuous Fahz, by two anonymous soldiers in armor and by the three protagonists of the Escape mode. The latter undoubtedly represents the most relevant novelty of the package: it is a cooperative for three players in which you find yourself inside a Beehive and you have to escape making your way through the enemies with very few weapons and ammunition, trying to be faster than the chemical we purposely released into the lair to eliminate its occupants. Four locations are currently available, but thanks to the brand new Map Builder it will soon be possible to download new scenarios created by the community and share your own to offer a potentially infinite challenge. The Gears 5 editor is simple to use, it works by linking predefined sections and placing the enemies we want in them: it is easy to imagine a great enthusiasm from users and the rapid debut of many customized maps. Finally there is the Horde, which in the classic episodes of Gears of War had the undoubted merit of proposing a cooperative experience of great value, with damningly engaging situations to be faced with a close-knit group of companions. In the fourth chapter, the charm of this mode was somewhat lost due to the robots, devoid of the Locust character, and unfortunately we find the same approach here too, with the same energy collection and crafting system but also a renewed focus on character classes. This aspect could give a little freshness to the new Horde, but it is an element that we will have to evaluate in the coming weeks. Xbox One goals There are 68 Objectives in Gears 5: an abundance also and above all linked to the multiplayer modes of the game, which in fact allow you to unlock a large number of achievements by performing specific actions for the first time. The rest depends on the campaign: there are Objectives that are obtained by upgrading Jack to the maximum, going as far as possible in exploring the scenarios and collecting collectibles, but also obviously by completing all the acts. Technical realization Gears 5 pushes the Unreal Engine 4 to the maximum of its capabilities on Xbox One, and in fact the basic console from Microsoft (in our case the S model) undoubtedly struggles in some situations, even if using the expedient of the dynamic resolution that scales the load based precisely on the moment to keep the frame rate of 30 frames per second as stable as possible. It does not always succeed, indeed there are moments of evident uncertainty", "date": "2019-09-04", "grade": "9.2"}
