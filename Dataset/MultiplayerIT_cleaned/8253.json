Simple: the rabbit in question decides to kill anyone who has seen the photos, in this case a hundred ugly, big and bad monsters within ten levels in which Dantesque scenarios alternate with areas of ~futuristic~ inspiration, in a mix that more than one occasion brings to mind the stages of Sonic the Hedgehog. However, this is only one of the many quotes that the Arkedo Studios guys wanted to include in Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit and which can often be recognized during the ~fatalities~ that Ash, the aforementioned rabbit, performs to finish off his opponents once their health bar is at its minimum. At that point, in fact, a very rapid WarioWare-style minigame appears on the screen, the mechanism of which must be grasped on the fly for a positive resolution and a very painful end for the unfortunate person on duty; otherwise, the procedure will have to be repeated after having undergone a small electric shock. These minigames sometimes ask us to press the right sequence of buttons on the pad (the Xbox 360 controller is perfectly supported, by the way), to identify a target among those proposed and ~shoot~, or even to stick your finger in a beehive without that a bee notices that we are doing it. If the sequence ends well, we will see several skits in which Ash slaughters the enemy, perhaps dressed as a Mexican luchador in a ring that appears out of nowhere, throwing him in the air to quote the Batwing scene in Tim Burton's first ~Batman~, and finally crashing it to the ground between mighty splashes of blood. My name is Ash. Hardware department The gameplay of Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit is the typical action platformer, but with some variations on the theme. In fact, our infernal rabbit starts ~on foot~, completely harmless, but is soon joined by his trusted adviser (a zombie-octopus), who provides him with a bizarre circular jet pack, equipped with a rotating blade at the ends and numerous weapons guns that you can unlock and upgrade through the shops scattered throughout the levels. Once on board the vehicle, the control system and the ~feedback~ of the character change quite a bit: the A button continues to activate the jump, which however becomes much wider thanks to the propulsion systems, while the right trigger operates the saw and allows us to ~hook~ and drill rock walls to collect money and diamonds. The left trigger, held down, creates a powerful shot that destroys everything between us and our final destination, while the left and right back buttons are used respectively to change the equipped firearm and zoom- out on the map (accessible in full version by pressing the Back button on the controller). Finally, the analog sticks are used to move Ash (left) and manage the aiming of the weapon (right), which opens fire by pressing the left trigger. Eliminating enemies requires a combination of all these maneuvers, even if certain solutions adopted by the developers didn't drive us crazy, for example the fact that an opponent is not hit by our weapons when he is out of game view, while the opposite happens yes. The management of the jet pack is also ~slippery~ due to inertia, and this on more than one occasion gives rise to episodes of frustration, because perhaps at the end of a perfectly executed jump we end up on electrified spikes and it's game over. Fortunately, the checkpoints are numerous and it is rarely necessary to redo large portions of the game; unless the prevailing backtracking is considered in the same way, which however is a characterizing element of the ~Metroidvania~ trend to which the Arkedo Studios title undoubtedly belongs. Lots of colors, especially blood red The levels of Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit are an alternation of platforms and tunnels that gradually become more complex, even integrating puzzle sections that are used to move forward in the adventure. In a certain moment, for example, we are asked to push a block of stone in a sort of labyrinth, looking for the correct path to make it end up on an otherwise unapproachable enemy. Similarly, in a stage you have to sneak into ~acceleration lanes~ (again in Sonic style) to be able to fall to the ground from a certain height and thus cause a series of events that lead to the destruction of another opponent. In short, the expedientsEntries to try to make the action more varied are not lacking, but despite this, the initial enthusiasm is soon replaced by an annoying feeling of ~already seen~, such as to deprive the experience of any bite already starting from the third scenario. The developers have no particular faults, simply the action platform genre is so inflated that by now you really need to do something extraordinary to be able to stand out; see for example the work done by Ubisoft Montpellier with Rayman Origins, a title with which Hell Yeah! in some ways it shares the graphic style, cartoonish and very colorful, even if in some situations the lack of ~maturity~ in the stroke is perhaps noticeable. The aforementioned ~fatalities~ are undoubtedly a fun extra but at a certain point, understandably, even those will begin to repeat themselves and therefore little will remain to keep our attention alive. The only extra present, the island, which however can only be accessed between one game and another, also does not represent a pastime of great value, given that the only thing it allows you to do is assign the defeated monsters ~jobs~ which result in the production of bonuses to be collected later.", "date": "2012-10-17", "grade": "7.0"}
