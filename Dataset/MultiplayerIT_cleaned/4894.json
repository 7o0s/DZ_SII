Unchained is available on Steam in the final version, if this definition makes sense for an ever-evolving multiplayer game. It is no coincidence that the Robot Entertainment title, initially centered around the Siege mode, has faced a big change with the abandonment of the direct competitive component that clearly distinguished it, enhancing the MOBA component, from the previous two chapters. Part of the community did not take well the abandonment of the five-on-five mode, seen as a surrender of the developers in the face of balancing difficulties, but there are many who appreciated the decision to concentrate efforts on the formula of the two original chapters, both based, like Unchained, on the combination of hordes of orcs, tons of traps worthy of the most complex tower defense and an important action component. There are, however, rather important peculiarities which include the free-to-play structure and the new sabotage mode which joins the infinite one, the weekly challenges and the Battlegrounds mode, like the others designed to be played alone or with a maximum of two companions. It's finally time to get to grips with the full version of Orcs Must Die! Unchained Back to the origins All game mechanics can be unlocked by playing, although things can be speeded up by putting real money in hand which allows you to buy both prize boxes and the game currency that allows you to unlock heroes and upgrade traps. But the wallet is strictly necessary only for the purchase of the Vanity boxes which contain objects whose function is purely aesthetic. This means Orcs Must Die! Unchained is a free-to-play based on the placement of traps and guardians, essential for stemming hordes of monsters that swarm from one or more portals towards a dimensional breach that we absolutely must defend. By eliminating creatures and placing particular devices, coins are obtained which, wave after wave, allow us to build real engineering works, lethal labyrinths which become increasingly effective by unlocking and activating upgrades which help to bump, dismember, block and torment monsters in every imaginable way. But victory also passes through our direct intervention, in command of a hero who can cooperate alongside two others and can be chosen from a roster of sixteen champions, five of which are immediately available, who can count on differentiated stats, basic attack , secondary attack, special abilities and a dozen of upgrade possibilities linked to the progression of the hero during a game. Among these there are the classic ones that increase resistance and speed, but the upgrades go as far as the Unchained skill which increases a hero's damage and reduces its recovery times, making our role on the field decisive even in moments of greater chaos. On the skill front, unfortunately, the headshot is missing, with the tutorial that reminds us of it with a joke with a bitter aftertaste, but there are combos that reward the ability to make an enemy receive damage from as many different sources as possible. In any case, although the renunciation of the siege mode takes away a pinch of bite and vivacity from the action, moving with timing, without forgetting the companions, is very important, especially in the new sabotage mode which recovers part of the competitiveness by allowing two formations to challenge the same map in parallel. In order to protect their bases, the two teams have at their disposal random cards that can grant bonuses, weaken enemy heroes or make them have to face a greater number of monsters. The aim is to use them at the right time and to do so, given the impossibility of directly observing the antagonists' game, it is necessary to keep an eye on a mini-map that shows the position of opposing heroes and monsters. The result is a rather fast and addictive mode, albeit made unbalanced by the randomness of the cards, the lack of voice chat and the possibility of bringing the enemy team to their knees with a single well-chosen move. The rest of the experience is made up of the battlefields that ask us to overcome a certain number of waves, the weekly challenges that impose a predefined setup starting from the heroes and the infinite mode that works like any survival by asking us to resist as many waves as possible possible. An arsenal of possibilities Deprived of Siege mode, Orcs Must Die! Unchained leaves the end game to infinite mode, weekly challenges and sabotage that is certainly not pacomparable to direct confrontation in terms of thickness and intensity. But the road to get to the end of the race is quite interesting thanks to the excellent balance of the maps, at least in cooperative, which on the one hand forces us to pay close attention to the placement of traps and, at the same time, allows us to give vent to our imagination. Furthermore, it takes a lot to pass level forty and thus be able to face the battlefields in Rift Lord difficulty and it is difficult to get bored too soon thanks to the incredible variety of gameplay that starts from the heroes to get to the guardians, even these sixteen, which can be found in prize chests like any other gameplay-related item. In addition to fighting, these invaluable sidekicks have special abilities, some of which extend to nearby heroes. Heroes who can also be upgraded with various objects, such as the lightning ring, which can be found in the loot boxes as well as the components to be mounted on the traps that change the functioning of the device by altering its characteristics or adding a specific effect. Combining all this with the talents, once again linked to cards available in the prize boxes, and with 53 traps, we find ourselves something that in terms of customization has few competitors on the square. There is a limit, however, and it is that of the equipment that forces us to choose a limited number of devices, guardians, objects and talents which, among other things, must be combined with the right symbol to obtain an extra effect. But the combinations, which include the classic retractable spikes and countless other tools of death, are countless and to help us exploit them there is the loadout editor that allows us to quickly set and choose a large number of setups. Finally there are the consumable items, some to be equipped and others linked to specific modalities or given by the monsters, which influence all aspects of the experience, further increasing a variety that creaks only when it comes to the characterization of the maps. The situations, however, are numerous and when the enemies start to come out of various portals, forcing us to replace dozens of traps in a few seconds, the strategic component is magnificent and things get decidedly complex, so much so that the solo game becomes too much tough and tiring. But on the other hand we are talking about a title that bases its survival on online dynamics and for this very reason it cannot be one hundred percent faithful to the previous two chapters. On the other hand, the outline does not disappoint, with the exception of the lack of the Italian language, which includes a graphic design that is as simple as it is captivating. Valuable animations, spot-on cartoon traits, well-differentiated heroes, stylized offal in quantity and light effects frame a simple but successful artistic sector, perhaps a little weak from the point of view of the monster models, but cared for in every other detail, sound effects and interface included.", "date": "2017-05-05", "grade": "8.0"}
