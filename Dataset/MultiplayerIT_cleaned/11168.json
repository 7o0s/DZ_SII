{"name": "Pure - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pure-recensione.html", "text": "Easy to do, hard to explain If the focus of the game is on aerial acrobatics, at the base of everything there must be a control method that guarantees a fast response to the commands but above all ease of use given the extremely frenetic and chaotic nature of the title. Black Rock Studios seems to have hit the mark, both because it has avoided the inclusion of long combos to be memorized to create the tricks, but above all for the peculiar, almost tactical system of aerial and turbo evolutions. More difficult to explain it than to do it: in practice, the more evolutions you make, the more the turbo bar and the number of evolutions increase, the more you use the turbo, the less advanced figures you do. Tricks are achieved by preloading the quad (down-up) before a jump, and then initially pressing X and d-pad. After a certain number of numbers, the circle key is unlocked, and then you get to the triangle. After this there is only the special number, achievable (bravely!) with L1+R1. This level up involves the simultaneous filling of the turbo bar. Using this lowers the level of the achievable number until you reach zero degree, the one achievable by pressing X. Obviously it's not all so schematic, given that always doing the same evolution doesn't raise the turbo/trick bar much, it is therefore necessary to remember which evolution has been carried out, also because each one has a time to complete and not all jumps are the same, one does not always leap from one mountain to another, perfect timing in landing is essential. This system has a strong impact on the conduct of the race, knowing the tracks, including shortcuts, and therefore choosing wisely when to use the turbo, but above all which tricks to perform are the necessary requirements for success in the game. A couple of races are enough to master everything, and with great satisfaction you manage to ring in kilometer combos and at the same time to file the lap times. The fun is very high, the frenzy of the races, almost to the limit of frustration since falling is the order of the day, it makes us glued to the screen without a breather, winning, or performing that damned special trick, is extremely gratifying . The artificial intelligence is quite good, the little train effect is avoided, there is always tussle between the pilots managed by the console, who humanly miss many jumps, with the ~nice~ side effect of ruining our vehicle very often, perhaps at the last corner, screwing up a practically won race. 10 championships in one leap The offers of races and events in the main mode for one player do not differ much from the averages of similar productions: the highlight is the world tour, 10 championships of obvious increasing difficulty, each made up of a minimum of four tracks and a maximum of seven. These are made up of 3 types of races: the first two, Race and Sprint, are quite similar, the only difference being played by the brevity of the tracks in the second type. The third one is decidedly different. Meanwhile there is no set number of laps to go, time and petrol which is abundantly consumed are the stakes that the game places in front of the player. The purpose of this mode is not to finish first, but to score more points, and to do this Black Rock Studios has implemented a series of icons to catch on the fly during jumps, which give bonuses or malus to the quad, doubling of points, level of tricks and turbo to the max and extra fuel. Surely of all three types of game, Freestyle is the most fun, the one that fully captures the spirit of the game, given that without the hassle of the final classification and the rogue overtaking at the last corner, it is possible to create aerial combos kilometers that make the Frecce Tricolori look bad. All the other competitions unrelated to the world tour are those already completed in the queen competition, without embellishments or modifications of any kind. It follows that, depending on one's skill, it is possible to complete the game rather quickly, despite the good implementation of the customization of the means which gives an extra gear to the not really full-bodied main mode. This, contrary to the totally arcade nature of the game, gives the player the possibility to create his own quad from scratch, choosing practically all the pieces that compose it, engine, handlebars, body, tyres, nitro, shock absorbers and so on. The many pieces are obtained by winning races on the world tour, and change the characteristics of acceleration, driveability, maximum speed, turbo and special moves of the vehicle. It is certainly a good idea this, since it is possible not only to debug beforeeach race its own vehicle, but create more quads, and then choose the one that best suits the track and the type of race. On the multiplayer side, Pure explodes the game mechanics peculiar to the title into great brawls, presenting races, classified and not, up to a maximum of 16 players, in which the three types of race present are available. On the other hand, the inclusion of a free timed race in which it is possible to choose how to play, whether to improve the travel time or to dedicate oneself to more daring stunts, is very interesting. Given the extremely competitive nature of this game, a nice worldwide leaderboard is there for those seeking fame on the net. On the other hand, a local multi-player mode is completely absent, apparently a precise choice of the developers. Monte Garda? The other ace up Black Rock Studios' sleeve is high-impact graphics, both from a ~quantitative~ and ~qualitative~ point of view. The visual horizon is very wide, and thanks to the long jumps it is not uncommon to see entire portions of the tracks. All moved with a granite frame rate and without hesitation. In addition to the excellent models and animations of the pilots and quads, with the latter extremely customizable thanks to the powerful editor, the many special effects applied are impressive, such as a persistent use of HDR, to heavily illuminate the tracks, and the particle one, given the a lot of dust present. In the same way, applause goes to the level design of the twelve tracks scattered around the world, from Italy to New Zealand, via the United States and Thailand. Each track is very varied, with jumps, ravines, parabolic bends and shortcuts placed where they are needed, furthermore the physics applied to the objects, indeed to the obstacles, which dot the tracks from time to time does its job very well, namely that of slowing down the quad race , with attached sweet nothings addressed to the very bad developers. The background music, a mix of alternative rock pieces and electronic tracks is appreciated, without immediately triggering the desire to turn down the music to fully enjoy the roar of the engines. Comment Pure is certainly an unexpected surprise in some ways, a title that is beautiful to look at, fun, rewarding and above all full of good ideas, finally well implemented. The control method and the unprecedented turbo/tricks system work perfectly, giving the game an unexpected tactical flavor, which is decidedly unusual in a title that represents the maximum expression of the arcade genre. It does not reach excellence only due to the fact of a certain brevity of the single player campaign and the absence of a local multi-player mode. For the rest, Pure is the perfect sleeper hit, an arcade title, very good and very fun, a serious competitor, albeit more arcade for the next storm of engines from Sony. Pros Very fun and immediate Exceptional graphics Freestyle mode Cons Not very long single player Local multiplayer is missing Pure is available for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The trial version is the PlayStation 3 version.", "date": "2008-09-26", "grade": null}
