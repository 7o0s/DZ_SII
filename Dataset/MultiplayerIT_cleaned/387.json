{"name": "Street Fighter Alpha Anthology", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/street-fighter-alpha-anthology.html", "text": "Anthology Let's start with the most important information, or the episodes included in this Anthology: Street Fighter Alpha, Street Fighter Alpha 2, Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold, Street Fighter Alpha 3, Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix. A delightful excursus, therefore, of the saga starting with the progenitor and ending with his own parody. The differences between the five games are not insignificant: everything that was conceived in Alpha is improved and perfected from one sequel to another, to arrive at the masterpiece Street Fighter Alpha 3, still considered today, years later, as the best two-dimensional fighting game ever made. Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold is a bit the icing on the cake: designed exclusively for PSOne and Saturn, Alpha 2 Gold is an improved version of Alpha 2, with the addition of Cammy and some minor firsts. The Anthology, in fact, shines above all for Street Fighter Alpha 3: all the fighters designed for the prequels plus some brand new ones in an unprecedented brawl. The most interesting element is certainly the inclusion of the ISM system that allows you to select your own style of play at will: you can adopt a traditional super-move loading system for the Alpha series, one inspired by Super Street Fighter II Turbo or a completely new one based on combos. The imbalance present above all in the first Alpha between the various characters is therefore corrected in favor of an evident balance of forces, in a product where the player's skill counts more than the power of the selected character. Between aerial parries, Alpha Counter, reverse-rolling and many other basic techniques combined with the vast array of individual special moves, there is really something to indulge yourself. The delightful Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix (original Japanese title of perhaps the best known Pocket Fighter) closes the official Anthology: the essential depth in the older brothers is missing in favor of a combat system and an absolutely parodic technical realization. The result is an incredibly eccentric and fun product, full of references to other more or less veiled Capcom titles (after all, among the list of available characters there are also those of Darkstalkers and Warzard) and not without a certain charm, above all thanks to the irony that pervades every single animation. However, the Anthology does not end here: to the delight of the fans, Capcom has included various ~secret~ versions of the games included in the compilation, unlockable by meeting certain requirements in the base titles. In addition to the ~Arranged~ version of Alpha 3, the most interesting is certainly Hyper Street Fighter Alpha, which allows you to select the various fighters from all versions of the compilation, combining them with the ISMs of Alpha 3 or with brand new ones, which for example Darkstalkers or the fighting games dedicated to Marvel superheroes. A maxi-event, in short, which starting from the practically perfect gameplay of Alpha 3 allows for total customization of one's style of play, resulting in a sparkling fighting game which has the only flaw that it has to be unlocked before being able to enjoy it. If so far the Street Fighter Anthology may seem like a small masterpiece, full of extras and secrets relating to the various individual episodes, it must be said that there is a lack of a job really done well, of a cure for what this represents Anthology for many fans: the almost total lack of goodies unrelated to the various games in the compilation is not a small defect. The exorbitant amount of artwork, advertising and much more that has been elaborated in recent years could have occupied a pleasant space in this DVD, just as it was designed for the compilation dedicated to Megaman: Street Fighter Alpha Anthology, however, it offers four games and half immediately accessible and alternative unlockable versions, and nothing more. True aficionados may be somewhat disappointed. Nostalgia? Being a compilation of vintage titles, Capcom has dabbled in what they've been doing really well lately: a glorious copy & paste with nothing really new, technically, for any of the titles on offer. And this time we not only have to justify them, but also reward them: the port is really well done, with every product faithful to the original in every pixelated sprite. Street Fighter Alpha 3 stands above the others, obviously, not only for its younger age but also for the immense technical quality that already distinguished it at its original launch: the huge fighters therefore return, divinely animated, immersed in suggestive backdrops and full of details and colors. The frame-rate remains mostly constant, with very rare slowdowns, a very important element in such a title. The music tracks are also back in style, along with the centinsbarn of vocal samples that made the wrestlers of this glorious series famous. In short, technically it's all very nice, but it's also all very old: new players will have to adapt to an all in all decent technical realization for 2006 (with graphic orgies like Guilty Gear XX around mostly) while aficionados will probably be happy to have back slavish copies of these classics. The Street Fighter Alpha Anthology is a very welcome addition to the PlayStation 2 toy library which, especially in recent times, has failed to offer the public two-dimensional fighting games of a certain quality. Furthermore, the Alpha series has always had the merit of giving casual gamers a good pastime, hiding an impressive depth and technical complexity that has always delighted experts of the genre. The compilation features practically all the Alpha titles and even the delicious Gem Fighter Mini Mix as well as some very tasty secret editions, but unfortunately really nothing else: all the extras that make a compilation of classics truly worthy of the name are missing. However, it remains a concentrate of excellent playability, and an opportunity for all new players to come to terms with the 90s to enjoy one of the best fighting games ever made. Pros: One of the best 2D fighting game series. Technically very good even after almost ten years. Cool ~Hyper~ secret mode. Cons: Non-existent extras. New players will still feel the weight of the years. After the luxurious Megaman compilation, Capcom indulges in nostalgia with another compilation, this time dedicated to its most famous series, in the incarnation that made it one of the most played in the world: Street Fighter Alpha. If Capcom had already proved to be an artist of two-dimensional fighting games with Super Street Fighter II (remember the era of the rivalry with Mortal Kombat II?) it was only a few years later that it began to walk the path of perfection, precisely with the Alpha series, which in its latest incarnation, Street Fighter Alpha 3, can only be defined as the pinnacle of two-dimensional fighting games. Before talking about this compilation, it is therefore necessary to start with a distinction that could be useful for newcomers: the main difference between Street Fighter and Street Fighter Alpha lies not only in the more comic visual realization, but also in a series of elements, taken initially borrowed from other fighting games, further complicated and perfected over the years. We arrived at the ISM-style maxi-combos starting from the simple super moves of Super Street Fighter II Turbo, ah, what nostalgia ...", "date": "2006-08-11", "grade": null}
