Some titles have been more successful than others, but in general there have been interesting ideas, think for example of the excellent work done by Dontnod Entertainment with Life is Strange. Evidently fascinated by the prospect of shaping a story full of variations and unexpected twists, the French developers of Big Bad Wolf Studio have created The Council, an unprecedented serialized adventure that aims to expand the variables available to the player, maintaining the focus on the narrative and deepening the consequences of their actions during the course of the game. To achieve this goal, an interesting dialogue system has been set up, correlated to a real progression of the character borrowed from role-playing games. The island of the mysterious Lord Mortimer The premises from which the story of The Council starts are undoubtedly fascinating. Without going into too much detail, the short opening sequence highlights the two central figures of the story: the protagonist Louis de Richet and his mother Sarah de Richet, leading members of a secret society called the Golden Order. From what can be understood in the prologue, the organization is entangled in events of capital importance that deserve to be preserved even at the cost of one's own life. After the fleeting introductory movie, we learn that Louis has been summoned to the island by a mysterious and influential individual known as Lord Mortimer. The reason for the invitation is inextricably linked to the mother, who apparently disappeared into thin air under circumstances yet to be clarified, just as she was on the island. But Louis is not the only one who has been invited to Lord Mortimer's estate. Other prestigious personalities have embarked to reach the mysterious destination and it is precisely with these prominent personalities that the player will have to deal with to untangle a skein that seems very tangled at first sight. After setting foot on the island, the choice of one of the three classes to which the protagonist can be associated is immediately foreseen. By opting for the Diplomat, you have the opportunity to improve your skills in conducting dialogues, managing to direct each confrontation in the desired direction with less difficulty. By leaning towards the Detective, it is possible to take advantage of advantages during the investigation phases, including the ability to identify details that any person would not even notice. The third alternative is that of the Occultist, an expert in dark sciences and arts that can be useful in planning subterfuge against one's interlocutors. Each of these categories corresponds to a skill tree by means of which the evolution of the protagonist's abilities is guaranteed for the entire duration of his investigation. Investigation, subterfuge and oratory In The Council all the characters you interact with have a strong personality. In this regard it is interesting to note the contrast between immunity and vulnerability which is the basis of any social interaction: all characteristics that must necessarily be brought into the open during the interaction. Understanding the nature of each individual housed in Lord Mortimer's manor is of paramount importance to achieve the objectives set in each of the four missions in which the first act of the story is divided. More specifically, the mechanism revolves around the so-called Effort Points, points that must be exploited during the dialogues to access specific answers directly connected to the skills that it has been decided to activate. As you may have already guessed, these opportunities vary precisely in relation to the kind of evolution imparted, therefore some sentences or actions will be inaccessible a priori. Also interesting is the dynamics of the Comparisons, or those situations in which the player must try to persuade a character on a certain matter, using a sequence of arguments and logical passages. An indicator positioned at the top of the screen reveals whether the attempt is proving fruitful or not and the success of these interactions is in turn capable of influencing the progress of the plot. In order to balance the gaming experience, without precluding too many alternatives when choosing the path, the developers have introduced the Manuscripts trick; during the exploration one can therefore come across some volumes with which to learn about specific skills not necessarily related to thetheir own class. These same resources can then be activated at your discretion at the start of the next mission. The pseudo-role structure of The Council has also allowed the introduction of some consumable objects to be exploited for various purposes. The Devil's Thorn, for example, allow to reveal the immunities and vulnerabilities of the interlocutors during the dialogues, facilitating the choice of answers and the development of the most suitable strategy. The most intriguing aspect of the game, however, is linked to the presence of crossroads that literally overturn the cards on the table; sometimes it happens that you have to decide whether to indulge a certain character or follow another, while in other cases you have to choose whether to go elsewhere or stay in the room you are in to find out what will happen shortly thereafter. In this first phase of the adventure, the system designed by Big Bad Wolf Studio seemed to us to work brilliantly, while also leaving the player plenty of time to become familiar with the playful dynamics proposed. It must be said that we have perceived a certain simplicity in successfully completing almost all the objectives foreseen in this first episode, but it is equally true that the potential to make things more interesting in the episodes to come is not lacking at all. In other words, the foundations for having an excellent series in your hands are all right, but we reserve the right to explore these aspects in future articles. Predictably the painful notes come from the graphic sector, saved only in part by the fascinating eighteenth-century context that reigns in the corridors of Lord Mortimer's palace. The faces of the characters would have deserved more expressiveness and a more careful management of the shots and movements of the protagonist would not have hurt either. However, we must think that these are weaknesses on which it is possible to turn a blind eye, bearing in mind that the interaction is kept within limited boundaries. For the sake of completeness, we point out that the game is dubbed in English but Italian subtitles are not available. Despite this obstacle, we assure you that the story can be followed without too many problems even by those with only an intermediate knowledge of the language.", "date": "2018-03-18", "grade": "8.0"}
