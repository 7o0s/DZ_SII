This new chapter does not focus only on timed races, but thanks to the loss of the official WRC license, it entertains the player with an extremely diversified and well-structured swirl of off-road events. As written exhaustively in the substantial preview published last month, the heart of the game revolves around a series of races and events that are unlocked as our reputation, and consequently the level (with a ~level cap~ set at 30 ), salt. It's not enough just to finish first, it's also very important to win mini-missions, which reward the player with experience points, for example for the drift and the longest jump, the time and kilometers traveled and so on. This is a way to add more adrenaline to the races, but above all to not have to repeat the same competition several times if those few points needed to access the next round of competitions are missing. Play as we please The world tour takes us around the planet: China, Japan, England, Malaysia, Morocco, Croatia and the United States, these are just a part of the countries where it runs. The extreme variety of Codemasters' offer is immediately noticeable. The competitions are not limited to races against the clock but are of different types: long solo raids (and not) alternate with track races, muddy street circuits for the occasion, elimination races similar to those seen in Burnout, or particular events such as the Gate Crasher and the Domination. The purpose of the first is to destroy dozens of small cartoons which increase the time available to conclude the event by one second each, while in the second our performance in the various splits of the track is evaluated, at the end of the race the calculation between sectors dominated and those lost will determine the winner, in short, there is no need to necessarily finish first. Dirt therefore no longer being able to be ~only~ the rally simulator par excellence, strengthens its new nature, confirming that it is a real traveling circus on dirt roads. Its simulation aptitude remained the same though. The title works and is a lot of fun, the initially rather short races are very frenetic and adrenaline-pumping, only with the transition to the pro categories do they become longer and involve a very high concentration rate. Another, if not the greatest strength of Dirt 2 is the almost total possibility of customizing the gaming experience. As if we were dealing with a sort of editor, the player can establish how to use the Codemasters title. All this is possible since now, as in Grid, you can correct your mistakes by rewinding the tape, and avoid that killer reversal or that shortcut that turned out to be an ~extension~. Depending on the difficulty level chosen (there are six) you can push the replay button from zero up to a maximum of five times, and contrary to the build sent to the editorial team for the preview, playing easy or champion also leads to a 'appreciable reduction of the times available and a greater skill of the opponents. As if that weren't enough, it is also possible to make changes to the set-up of the car, but above all to decide whether the aesthetic damage also corresponds to the mechanical damage to the car. The game therefore adapts to all types of players: we can win easy by rewinding the tape at every little hesitation, but in the meantime leave the damage activated, or try the path of realism by paying for every mistake but letting the impacts have only aesthetic consequences. A game for everyone At a superficial glance, such a mechanism would seem to distort the simulation essence of the game which still works also by virtue of a rather plausible driving model, in balance between simulation and arcade. The many classes of vehicles available then, serial derivatives, trucks, SUVs, prototypes, dune buggies and so on have a truly different behavior from each other, and also the elaborations on the same car that are carried out to access the championships pro involve a significant change in the player's driving style. Fortunately, the criticality that afflicted the first episode has been corrected, and now the cars are very nervous (especially trucks and dune buggies) and as it should be they make the player with an easy crossing pay the price: small corrections and partialtions are the bread and butter of Dirt 2. Speaking of the multiplayer portion, Codemasters has heavily revised the online part of the game, which is very important given the numerous criticisms received for the first episode. All the competitions present in the career mode can be run by up to a maximum of eight human players, divided into timed races, multi-car with contact and alternatives and very interestingly, all the cars of the single player can be selected, bought or not by the player. The only problem with this title, which objectively marks a big step forward compared to its predecessor, lies not so much in the goodness of its mechanics as in the eye and expectations of those who play it. Dirt 2 is in fact no longer just a rally simulation; beating the clock by memorizing the curves is only a small part of the offer. The spirit and the approach are very different from the old gen chapters, everything is much more ~caciarone~ and less serious, the paddock that serves as the game menu is a case in point. All of this in no way affects the overall value of the stock, but we believe that the hard and pure of the rally may not like this now confirmed decisive swerve towards the widest possible audience. For these old-school pilots, zero helps and activated damage: this is the way to fully enjoy (sweating the proverbial seven shirts) the game's 100 or so events. Playstation 3 trophies The title rewards the player with 48 trophies, 1 platinum, 3 gold and the remaining bronze. The golden three are obtained by winning all the events, the X-Games and above all the tribute competition dedicated to the never forgotten Colin McRae. The others are obtained by totaling certain kilometers and hours of play, beating and befriending the superstars present, reaching the maximum level and so on. More generally they are quite natural to obtain, they are unlocked by progressing in the game with relative ease. Postcard landscapes From a technical point of view the game is of absolute excellence. More than the detail, however very high but not at the levels of other noble competitors, what is striking is the sometimes unsettling amount of trackside elements and special effects that color and bring the competitions to life. The cars that get dirty and lose pieces with each accident are polygonally rich and with good textures to cover everything, but all this takes a back seat in front of the brawl of the cars on the track and the surrounding elements. We pass with ease from the postcard landscapes of Morocco, with its narrow streets between the villages to the rides of Baja California that start in the mountains, blinded by a dazzling HDR, and end at the seashore. At night, however, in the city circuits of Shibuya and London, one cannot fail to be enraptured by the lights, the neon lights, the reflections on the car bodies and the mud puddles. However, all of this has a small price to pay. Dirt 2 is almost always very fluid but in excited situations there are some micro jerks, not slowdowns, which in no way affect the gaming experience, but which must still be reported. Another strong point is the artificial intelligence of the opponents, always in constant struggle against them and aggressive to the point of impropriety so much as to commit frequent mistakes and rollovers. The notorious train effect is absolutely absent and it is not uncommon to witness a change of direction of the opponents after a replay in the numerous crossroads that characterize the raid races.", "date": "2009-09-07", "grade": "8.7"}
