As with any genre, they too evolve and perfect year after year. Yet, more than any other video game type, they remain tied to the past. Think of the latest Mortal Kombat, or Street Fighter 4 and derivatives. How did the developers come up with such super-fine games? Simple, they went back to basics. Don't get us wrong, we don't believe that this return to the past is due to the lack of valid ideas on the part of the software houses, far from it (as proof of this, the latest fighting games present multiple brilliant original solutions in parallel with mechanics already seen). However, it cannot be denied that some fighting games with decades behind them are so well thought out and current that they deserve to be used as a foundation for the creation of new generations. Some of these illustrious ancestors are so successful that they still have legions of ardent and stainless fans today. One of the aforementioned giants is Street Fighter 3rd Strike, considered by many to be the apotheosis of the famous series. For years, fans have been clamoring for its return, and Capcom has finally decided to indulge them, making a special Online Edition of the game available on Xbox Live and PSN. The Japanese company made two promises to gamers: the port would have been ~arcade perfect~ - therefore no changes to gameplay, and HD graphics without remodeled sprites - and should have boasted superfine multiplayer thanks to GGPO, presented as one of the best netcodes In circulation. Today we will reveal if the promises made have been kept, and if the king of Street Fighter has managed to return in all his splendor to the homes of lovers of the genre. It's not the third shot that counts, it's the parry What sets Street Fighter 3rd Strike apart from the crowd is the gameplay. There are many deep fighting games, but with the 3rd Strike Capcom has reached the zenith of technicality. The game has precise and immediate controls, introduced EX moves and selectable super combos. All stuff copied and reused from what came after. Nonetheless, the most distinctive mechanic of the title is another: the ~active parry~. In fact, it is possible to actively parry the opponent's moves by pressing forward when you are hit (down + forward in the case of low blows). Doing so ensures that you can counterattack safely and often punish your enemies brutally. Said like this, it seems like a piece of cake, but monstrous timing is needed to perform parries, especially if you consider that special moves tend to strike multiple times, and with extremely diversified timing. Practically impossible therefore to parry ~skin~ effectively. The art of parrying is acquired by practicing for hours and hours, and assimilating the exact timing of each shot. Once you master the mechanics and learn how to distance yourself, it opens up an almost unreasonable number of attack possibilities in the game. The aerial counterattacks are no longer so scary, every position becomes good to start an offensive, and the fireballs (terror of many fighting games) are transformed as if nothing had happened into useful moves only occasionally. Furthermore, safe and advantageous combinations which in other titles are often used continuously due to their reliability, here are very risky as they are predictable. To win against skilled players you need to constantly vary your attacks, which makes the action tight and spectacular. Given the level reached, it is not surprising that the developers wanted to leave the gameplay unchanged in this Street Fighter 3rd Strike: Online Edition. One misjudgment and the aficionados would have unleashed all hell. Ken Masters? It's actually Kenshiro Despite its innumerable qualities, Street Fighter 3rd Strike's game system isn't perfect. The fighting game is known in the environment for having a rather unbalanced roster, with a triptych of characters clearly superior to the rest of the rabble. Let's talk about Ken, Yun and Chun Li, so abused by the strongest players in the world, that they are often used as a term of comparison to indicate when a character is overpowered. In truth it is not that the other choices are brutally inferior, not to mention that the highly studied gameplay of the title allows you to get by with any warrior (Kuroda docet), but they actually have perceptible disadvantages even by those who are not super experts. Keep that in mind when online you see an army of skintight Chinese chicks, blonde karatekas and cap-toting kung fu masters. Perhaps a total rebalancing of the cast was too much to ask, but a few tweaks here and there could have been done. Maybe in a fashionity or separate option, in order not to displease the faithful. Instead Capcom didn't want to take any chances leaving everything unchanged, even the imperfections. Fortunately, at least as regards the contents, something has been done. In the Online Edition there are countless challenges of increasing difficulty, very useful for practice. They range from simple combinations of shots and parries, up to having to reproduce the unforgettable Evo Moment of the Daigo vs Justin Wong final. A challenge that a select few can complete. By completing the various missions you earn points with which to buy artworks, music and animated scenes. All certainly appreciable, a pity that you will have to complete each challenge at random, given the lack of ghosts and videos capable of accurately showing the times of the attacks and parries. Never mind, you don't look a gift horse in the mouth. An online teleporter Capcom has clearly kept the first promise made. Street Fighter 3rd Strike Online Edition is a perfect and expanded port of the original, devoid of the slightest change to the formula. Bad luck has it that the second commitment has not been respected, and the online game leaves a bit to be desired. Anyone knowledgeable about the nature of the GGPO is now likely to be incredulous. After all, the netcode is known for its incredible ability to eliminate lag from matches by automatically adjusting inputs during matches (it takes into account the data of each individual console). Brilliant, too bad the trick only works great when both players connect fast. All it takes is a dancer connection, and the netcode is even worse than seen in most other fighting games, with unplayable moments and characters magically teleporting from one area of the screen to another. To resolve the situation, it would be enough to challenge only European opponents with a decent lineup, but here the first absurdity appears: ranked matches do not have the choice of region. Making a passable ranked is therefore difficult, unless you are lucky. There are tons of American and Asian players, and don't even think for a moment that you can play them without lag. At this point you'd probably expect a lifeline in unranked lobbies but once again we have bad news for you. The rooms are fixed for 8 people. You won't be able to decrease the number of guests, and to find lobbies with few challengers in rotation you will have to search a lot. Really senseless choice by the developers. Why create a game whose primary strength should be online, and limit it to this extent? To fully enjoy the multiplayer experience we recommend that you find some good European players to add to your friends list. Finally, let's move on to the technical sector. Graphically the 3rd Strike was a pearl of 2D graphics at the time of its release, and even today it looks good, thanks to the inclusion of some excellent filters. In any case, don't hope for sprites up to those of Blazblue, the game is of a certain age and you'd be disappointed. The music is great, remixed and still very catchy, as are the high-level sound effects.", "date": "2011-09-23", "grade": "8.7"}
