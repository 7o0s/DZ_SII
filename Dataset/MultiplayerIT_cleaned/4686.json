Last Recode, Bandai Namco has decided to crown the work of the development team on Naruto with a rich collection for the most part remastered, precisely Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Legacy. We are actually talking about a ~modular~ product, as it is possible to purchase all the episodes of the package individually in digital format or limit yourself to the first three with the Trilogy edition. In any case, those unfamiliar with the franchise and wanting to make up for lost time will be faced with four games of great value, full of stories, missions and spectacular fights: no small legacy, that of the studio directed by Hiroshi Matsuyama, who demonstrated how it is possible to make visually better tie-ins than the anime from which they are taken, making full use of the plot and making the characters better in a riot of colors, ninja techniques and catchphrases. Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm The first game included in the collection is Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm, originally released in 2008 on PlayStation 3. It is a title that already starts from the great experience gained in previous years by the development team, and which offers an RPG structure of a rich campaign, made up of main and secondary missions to be accessed by visiting the streets and places of the Leaf Village. The remastering work takes great advantage of cel shading, which hides the simplicity of the polygonal models relating to the characters very well, although the map appears rather bare and distant from its representation in the Naruto manga and anime. The formula, however, is always the same: counting on a roster made up of twenty-five characters, to which are added the support ones, we will have to grapple with increasingly more complex fights by selecting a main ninja and two companions to be called up if necessary . The action is that of a brawler rather than a fighting game in matches, and it is no coincidence that the buttons used for the maneuvers are few: the Circle starts a simple combo, the Square allows you to throw knives from a distance, X serves to jump or dash and the Triangle regulates the ability to accumulate Chakra to perform the most powerful moves. The blows are parried with the backbones, evasion techniques are put into practice and, in general, the gameplay is frenetic and engaging, although some opponents tend a little too often to escape from the clash by lengthening the distances, a practice that can generate frustration where can't land hits. Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 For the second chapter of the series, released in 2010, CyberConnect2 has seen fit to change the hub of the Leaf Village (the first of a set of settings that can be visited), using a system of fixed shots capable of enhancing the richness of the landscape, as opposed to the desolation of the previous episode. Little has changed, however, in terms of structure, with a campaign that once again sees us wandering far and wide in search of access points to missions. If the methods of exploration have remained similar, with excessively dilated timing for the movements, from the point of view of the direction there are various innovations, in particular challenges of a different nature and a much more varied use of characters, which follows in a rather faithful way the events of the plot. When you get to the point, experience confirms its solidity without however revolutionizing the mechanisms already tested at the outset. We therefore continue with a quantity of commands reduced to the bone, an emphasis on timing and on the spectacularity of the maneuvers, especially the special ones, which can also involve our inevitable teammates, to be recalled by pressing the main backbones, and which they make all the difference during fights, inflicting huge damage to the opponent if they hit. As with the first Ultimate Ninja Storm, the remastering work is impeccable here too, indeed it takes further advantage of the cinematic setting of the shots. Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst Published three years after the second chapter, Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 is present in this collection in the Full Burst version and obviously stands as the most refined and solid episode of the original trilogy, the one that basically needed less of the aesthetic improvement that came with the remaster. It is evident how the game demonstrates CyberConnect2's full awareness of the franchise, see for example the double nature of each single challenge and the presence, therefore, of narrative crossroads that is possible forrun during the campaign and which are a valid reason to complete it more than once. It is no coincidence that the part of the anime told in this chapter is also the most spectacular, with many revealed backgrounds, new opponents that stand out on the horizon and a look at the past of the Leaf Village, starting with the terrible attack of the Fox Nine Tails and how this offensive was tragically repulsed. Of course, the ~hanging~ conclusion of the story, which at the time could not count on the conclusion of Masashi Kishimoto's manga, leaves a bitter taste in the mouth; but, ultimately, the experience is certainly worth trying, given the incredible care that characterizes every single aspect. Instead, there is no significant change in the combat system, which continues in the path already traced previously, by now well tested, and plays with quick time events and ~awakenings~ to make the clashes even more frenetic and of great visual impact, net though of a certain basic simplicity. Playstation 4 trophies The four games included in Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Legacy each have a separate and independent set of Trophies, as was to be expected. The amount of unlockable achievements for the entire collection is therefore enormous: there are fifty for the first Ultimate Ninja Storm, as many for the second, fifty-five for the third chapter and fifty-three for the fourth, to which we must add those of the Road expansion to Boruto. Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 - Road to Boruto The conclusion of the Ultimate Ninja Storm series, enriched in this collection by the Road to Boruto expansion and the three narrative DLCs, belongs to recent history, being a production born last year, which marked the debut of the franchise on current generation platforms. From a narrative point of view, the game takes up the events of the third episode and closes them, also thanks to the extra chapter dedicated to Boruto, confirming itself as a title not to be missed for fans of the series. The campaign is in fact more compact and traditional, divided into five parts in which the protagonists of the Fourth Ninja War are explored, but does not spare spectacularity and engaging sequences, as highlighted in our review. From this point of view, the Road to Boruto expansion only confirms the excellent work done so far, further enriching the story and confronting us with unpublished characters and challenges, in what appears to be the worthy conclusion of an unforgettable saga. Moving on to a global analysis of the Legacy edition, it is clear and evident that it is an extremely rich package, which will keep you busy for a very long time and which has been designed above all for those who want to try their hand at the franchise for the first time , whereas the Trilogy turns out to be a better choice for users who only want to recover the episodes released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.", "date": "2017-09-09", "grade": "8.5"}
