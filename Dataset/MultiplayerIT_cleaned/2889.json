{"name": "Hades", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hades-recensione.html", "text": "We had understood for some time that it was a small masterpiece, but having been in early access for months we thought it appropriate to wait for the official release before writing the review of Hades. The time to sum up has finally arrived: Supergiant Games, which has already signed Transistor, Pyre and Bastion, has published the final update of its new title, releasing it surprisingly not only on PC, but also on Nintendo Switch. The patch, however, didn't just bring Hades to version 1.0: it also adds a variety of fixes, balances and new content, including the true ending of the story, which will push even the players who have already dedicated many hours to the version in early access to return to the colorful Underworld imagined by the Californian developer. An evolving story Despite being a roguelite, Hades boasts Supergiant Games' usual care for narrative, which is expressed through an atypical and captivating approach. The protagonist of the game is Zagreus, the son of Hades, lord of the underworld: a prisoner in his father's kingdom since he was a child, Zagreus has recently discovered that his real mother is not Nyx as he always believed, and therefore decides to try the escape to look for Persephone in the world of mortals. The premise is therefore very simple and direct: to reach the surface, Zagreus will have to go through four procedural maps, defeating Hades' henchmen who will block his way. However, the young protagonist is not alone: the gods of Olympus, capricious but unhappy with Hades, will give him various gifts and powers, while some famous inhabitants of the underworld such as Achilles, Orpheus or the nice handyman Dusa, will offer advice, clues and information on true intentions of Hades towards Zagreus. The story therefore develops during the actual escape attempts, through the interactions between Zagreus and the various gods, bosses and residents of the underworld, but also and above all in the interludes between one death and another: whenever the enemies have the better of him, in fact, Zagreus finds himself full circle in his father's office, and has to start all over again. But therein lies the brilliance of Supergiant Games' approach to roguelite philosophy, and not just in terms of gameplay, as we'll see later, but also in terms of narrative. Every escape attempt counts in terms of story and characterization, so the residents will noticeably change their attitude towards Zagreus. The Supergiant Games guys have recorded thousands of jokes, hundreds of dialogues that depend on the most disparate circumstances, mixed with a healthy dose of randomness, but which slowly, game after game, begin to outline more precise patterns. In this way real subplots develop and the background is discovered in the relationships between the various deities, and not only that: Zagreus can ingratiate himself with them with specific gifts, and we can always open the Codex to read other very interesting details about these mythological characters who Supergiant Games has depicted with care and irony. Not only do the illustrations perfectly capture the idiosyncrasies of divinities that have entered the collective imagination for centuries, but they are further characterized by an amazing dubbing - in English, although the texts are completely in Italian - which in sometimes staid and phlegmatic tones it even borders on ASMR. The squabbles between Zag and the supporting actors are often hilarious, especially in the moments in which the rivalries between one escape and another are put aside. It must be said that the progression in the story also depends on the player's skill, since some goals trigger real turning points in the interactions and are also reflected in the gameplay, for example by replacing certain bosses with variants that make perfect sense even at a narrative level: for this reason, even Hades sooner or later risks showing the side to the intrinsic repetitiveness of the genre, but fortunately the combat system and the variety of challenges and circumstances help to lighten the load, prompting the player to attempt one escape after another not only to find out how the story and the characters will develop, but also for the pure and simple pleasure of trying new strategies in battle. Fighting in the Underworld Hades is an intuitive title: you choose a weapon, you start the game, you die, you start over. The control system, reactive and very precise, is mainly based on four keys that can be configured as desired. One allows you to perform a basic attack, another is associated with the special attack of the weapon in use, another allows you to dash in the desired direction, the last allows you to throw a pbullet from afar. There are six weapons in total, and they are unlocked as you attempt escapes from the underworld. Each weapon works in its own way and fulfills a specific role: the Stygius sword, for example, is a very fast melee weapon that also hits area, while the Coronacht bow hits from a distance but requires good timing if you want to inflict maximum damage. The Aegis shield is slow and not particularly damaging, but can defend Zagreus from practically any attack, while the Varatha spear has a short/medium range and can be thrown and summoned at will. Each weapon then has three additional variants to unlock that significantly change the game mechanics and the approach to fighting. If this offer of weapons may already seem remarkable, the truth is that you haven't seen anything yet because the gifts that we will find in the maps and that will be bestowed on us by the gods will further alter our possibilities of attack and defense. Each deity represents a rather specific style or dynamic. Poseidon's gifts, for example, generally confer the ability to knock back hit enemies, while those of Dionysus deal damage over time and those of Athena improve defensive capabilities, allowing us to reflect damage and projectiles. Zeus, needless to say, will electrify our attacks, while the gifts of Hermes will help us move or strike faster. Each deity alters one or more dynamics of the combat system and weapons in use, but the game will offer us the gifts in a completely random order, forcing us to choose between multiple options while preparing what we could consider a real build. Hades is in fact an isometric action game: each map is divided into various interconnected rooms and to move from one to another you have to eliminate all the enemies present. The order of the rooms, but also the amount and types of enemies that appear in each room in the various combinations, is completely random. The exits are marked by icons that represent the reward that we will get for completing the next room, and here the player is often called upon to make a choice: for example, between a gift from Athena and a simple increase in life points, or between a bunch of drachmas to spend in Charon's room and the Hammer of Daedalus, a rare power-up that can drastically change the mechanics of the wielded weapon. Choice after choice, Zagreus' arsenal grows and transforms. Each game reveals new tricks, synergies and potential that we may not see again for many hours: on the one hand this aspect of Hades can appear frustrating, because it becomes difficult to focus on a specific strategy; on the other, the Supergiant Games solution keeps the player constantly on his toes, forcing him to deal with different tactics and skills that test his talent in making a virtue of necessity. A roguelite for everyone It is therefore the amount of options, bonuses, enemies and bosses that entertain players over the long term, especially the most tenacious who will cling to every variable to dissect the combat system and unlock every possible and imaginable content. The longevity of Hades depends a lot on the individual player and how one approaches this philosophy. It takes a few hours to familiarize yourself with the combat system, weapons and various bonuses, and this apprenticeship translates into repeated escape attempts that can last even just a few minutes. Hades is a tough game, but every attempt doesn't result in resetting all progress: sure, Zagreus loses gifts and upgrades, but he keeps the currencies to spend on permanent bonuses and the interactions with the residents of the Underworld, who will reward us with accessories and aids in subsequent games. The less practical can also activate a God mode, in the options, which facilitates the completion of the game, but to get to the ending you need at least a dozen successful escapes, while to really see everything else it will take many more hours, but like hundreds. In this sense, Supergiant Games has attempted to artificially prolong the experience with an excessive grind of resources and materials, winking at the more hardcore roguelites with the Pact of Punishment, practically a series of optional conditions to be met during the games following the first successful escape that translate into bonus rewards: in simple terms, an intriguing loop is created that tests the player, rewarding him for his efforts with materials and resources that, playing normally, would be much more difficult to find. The more casual will be able to safely ignore this Hades content, focus on the story and archive the Supergian titlet Games after a satisfactory number of hours: a direction preferable even to titles like Dead Cells which lock down a large part of the content behind an over the top level of difficulty. Comparing PC and Switch Hades is not a title that moves billions of polygons, and is based above all on the extraordinary artistic direction and engaging music by Darren Korb. The Supergiant Games guys have designed scenarios full of details, colorful and full of atmosphere, ranging from the meanders of Tartarus to the peaceful Elysian Fields, passing through the fiery Asphodel Meadows. Although the four maps soon appear a little few, despite the procedural plan, each of them is unique not only in the arrangement of traps and scenic elements, but also in the way it translates Greek mythology into a modern way. The fights are clear and never too confusing, while characters and enemies move with fluid and precise animations that leave no doubts about distances, ranges of attacks and areas of effect. Also commendable is the variety of animations and additional graphic effects that characterize Zagreus' weapons and divine gifts. In short, everything is beautiful, especially if you play it on PC: Hades is certainly not a heavy title and its performance is excellent even on less performing machines. Its roguelite nature then makes it a particularly attractive title to be nibbled in hit and run games on the Nintendo hybrid console, which however comes down to some compromises. In handheld mode, Hades is a gem - it runs at native 720p and the console screen returns a crystal clear, sharp and brilliant image. In the most excited moments it loses a few frames, but drops very little, and in any case not always, below 30 frames per second, maintaining a more than acceptable fluidity in most extreme situations. By inserting the console in the Dock, however, the question becomes a bit more thorny, because on the TV screen the image loses sharpness: the upscale slightly dirty the graphics, which become a little more blurry, and artificial artifices catch the eye visuals that grain the features and texts. It's not a deterioration that makes the experience unplayable, mind you, but in portable mode Hades managed much better.", "date": "2020-09-20", "grade": "9.0"}
