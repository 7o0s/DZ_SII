So yes, many of us already know what the folks at Oddworld Inhabitants wanted to do with this reboot of the classic Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus, what they did very well (starting from the narration and from the new mechanics) and what instead would have probably needed more time to be adjusted, refined and revised. But let's pretend nothing happened for a few minutes, let's review the characteristics of the game, its strengths and its shortcomings, to get to the bottom of the article and establish whether we all agree on its evaluation or not. Stop there, don't peek at the comment! Rather hurry up and get on this running train: the Mudokons need you again. History Oddworld: Soulstorm, poor Abe. Let's start, as mentioned, from the things that Oddworld: Soulstorm does well, damn well. The story takes up the basics of the classic released in 1998, but gets there in a new way (after all, Soulstorm is the direct sequel to Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty!, itself a reboot) and decidedly intriguing, more adult and interesting First of all, we start by representing an explosive situation: a speeding train, targeted by a swarm of Slig drones, which heads at full speed towards the RaptureFarms. In a carriage there is Abe, intent on observing something intensely, but time is running out and the Mudokons who control the locomotive need his help. Oddworld: Soulstorm, Abe looks at his treasure. The scene changes and we move on to twelve hours earlier, with the protagonist of the game celebrating his liberation from the yoke of the Glukkon with his people but being warned by the seer of the tribe about a new impending danger. Not even the time to finish the sentence that the threat manifests itself in all its vehemence, in a chaotic general stampede that sets the shelter on fire: the enemy is at the gates. Aware of having to shoulder the responsibility of saving his people again, Abe leads his companions in a new, difficult exodus but soon discovers that other Mudokons need him. Faced with certain scenes, with the tenderness of these pathetic yet so courageous creatures, we arrive at the same conclusion: let's give it a go. Gameplay Oddworld: Soulstorm, the throwing system of objects (often flammable) uses the right stick for aiming. Of course, simple determination will not be enough to effectively guide our actions during the Oddworld: Soulstorm campaign. It will also require a lot of skill, quick reflexes, keen eyes, an instantaneous calculation of timing and risks, a large dose of luck, an enormous amount of patience and a calendar to consult whenever we need it. Spoiler: it will happen often. Yes, because the gameplay of Abe's new adventure is the trial & error fair, the kind in which you die like forty times in a row in the same ruthless section. Let's be clear: the formula of the game has historically always been this, but more often than not we see franchises change over time, giving up the systematic bastardy of the origins and softening up, as people of a certain age do. Oddworld: Soulstorm, one of the most unpleasant stages. In this case, no: if we really want to see Soulstorm as an old man, he is not only lively but also grim, he waves his walking stick to hit us and often succeeds, each time triggering a cry of pain and frustration. Because we die so much in the game, but a good half of the time through no fault of our own: when the controls don't respond as they should, when the Mudokons we've released don't move on command, when an enemy gets stuck in an impossible position instead of continue his rounds, when the setting of two and a half dimensions of the scenarios makes it difficult to hit a target. There has always been a lot of wood in the controls of Oddworld, together with a generous dose of slowness, but in Soulstorm the developers have thought well to speed up the protagonist's movements and equip him with the coveted double jump. Evidently enthusiastic about the result, they then saw fit to adapt the challenge to the new abilities of the character, forgetting, however, to refine all the interactions with the environment, which still require timing and precision sometimes impossible to guarantee in the busiest situations. Oddworld: Soulstorm explains why you don't phe can smoke on the train. Given these due premises, we need to think about the often lacking evolution of dynamic adventures, how in the end Abe is a bit the deformed and monstrous son of Conrad B. Hart but still climbs platforms in the same way, yet how the authors of Oddworld: Soulstorm have managed to give this formula an extra thickness, literally, by introducing the aforementioned two and a half dimensions, reiterating the mechanics related to mind control and creating a simple crafting system that is somewhat reminiscent of Stranger's Wrath. Proceeding in the fifteen levels (plus two extra) of the campaign we will therefore find ourselves in the position of being able to use the materials collected around to build mines, smoke grenades, Molotov cocktails and more, as well as use objects such as Soulstorm flammable drinks, flares to light up the dark, rag balls with which to knock enemies out and even electronic devices, in a mix that adds variety to the experience on the one hand, and on the other presents itself as a further challenge. Oddworld: Soulstorm has levels full of traps and switches. As per tradition, each stage presents a series of puzzles to solve and we will be able to do it in different ways, trying for example to avoid killings and to save as many Mudokons as possible scattered throughout the map, using their help wherever possible (at some point they will actually become useful) and making them go through portals to reach a safe place. We will often find ourselves defenseless in front of the Slig guards, but we will be able to get around them by moving silently, hiding inside lockers or using to the aforementioned smoke grenades to hide us from their view. In other cases, however, we will have to be quite active, for example during the sequences in which hordes of Mudokons flee in the background and we will have the task of covering their backs by neutralizing the enemies intent on shooting at them. Structure Oddworld: Soulstorm, a traditional scenario. The system that we have described so far, hopefully exhaustively, is hand in glove with the peculiar concept of structure of Oddworld: Soulstorm. As mentioned, the game's campaign is nominally composed of fifteen levels, but the duration of the experience can change a lot depending on your skill, your luck and the breaks from nervous breakdowns that you may feel the need from time to time. In short, let's talk of a time interval ranging from ten to fifteen hours, but which can increase when you decide to return to the already completed internships in order to obtain better statistics. In fact, there are four different endings, which essentially depend on the number of Mudokons that we will be able to save at the end of the adventure. Oddworld: Soulstorm, a scenic ride. Great importance is therefore given to the element of replayability, also through the presence of secret areas that you will often discover by pure chance, or by insisting on the search for ravines and alternative routes. The fact that the desire to explore the maps far and wide is rewarded by the game is certainly positive. The level design almost never invents anything truly original, but it works, it's varied and lends itself very well to these dynamics. There are some concessions to simplicity and some less convincing sections, but overall a great job has been done to allow the franchise to breathe within much larger and more open spaces than usual. Technical realization Oddworld: Soulstorm, a ride under sniper fire. At the beginning of the review we mentioned the goodness of the narrative sector of Oddworld: Soulstorm, which makes use of really engaging, well-crafted, well-directed and well-acted cutscenes, although the English dialogues are not very easy to understand due to the accents and exaggerated inflections by the actors. However, there are subtitles in Italian, just a pity about some blunders. In-game, the graphics of the game move between ups and downs, in the sense that it is certainly not a next-gen title although it runs at 60 fps (with some too much uncertainty), while the resolution is equal to 1440p on PlayStation 5. Technically we could have done better, as also demonstrated by certain textures and some assets with a dirty and generic look. However it is clear that in a product of this kind the artistic sector counts more than anything else, and there is little to say about that: the vision of the development team seemed quite clear and well-realized to us, some landscapes certainly appear suggestive and, in overall, the stylistic connotation of Abe, his companions, enemies and scenarios is convincing.Sidesound has opted for an essential approach, with little music to underline only the most important phases of the action, while the DualSense controller has been exploited in a superficial way, acting on the adaptive triggers in some cases and, in general, limiting the support to while appreciable haptic feedback. Finally, compared to other PS5 games, we found the loads to be a bit slow.", "date": "2021-04-10", "grade": "7.5"}
