{"name": "Ring Fit Adventure", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ring-fit-adventure-recensione.html", "text": "The Ring Fit Adventure review answers a question that has been posed for a long time: when will Nintendo decide to relaunch that fitness vocation that made the difference in the Wii era, contributing largely to the success of the console? And here we are. The goal is obviously to be able to make physical activity fun, building a real RPG-style adventure around a large set of exercises, which somehow masks the training, providing a purpose to every single movement we make. Does our character have to move within a pre-established path? Then you have to walk or run on the spot for it to move. Come across a muddy swamp? Walking with his knees up will allow him to get out of it. Does he have to face enemies? A turn-based combat system starts in which each exercise has an attack value and a cooldown period, and you have to defend yourself from opponents' blows by contracting your abs. These mechanics are narratively justified by a bizarre story, however told in perfect Nintendo style: the athletic protagonist of the adventure finds a mysterious ring on his path that speaks to him, begging him to free him from his captivity. However, it is a deception: the huge and muscular Drako emerges from the object, a winged dragon obsessed with the gym, who flies away determined to reconquer the world. The only way to stop him is to follow the instructions of Ring, the conscience inside the ring that had blocked his evil ex-student, and complete a path consisting of over twenty environments, for a total of more than one hundred levels, which includes obstacles, enemies and challenging boss fights. Along the way we will come across memorable characters (see for example the soldiers of Sporta or the Atletici Quattro), extra challenges, alternative routes and shops where you can buy new clothing items that not only allow you to change the appearance of the avatar, but they add to his skills important bonuses of strength and resistance; these are characteristics that we will also see improve in the context of a traditional progression based on experience points and on leveling up. Using the coins collected in the various stages we will also be able to buy smoothies, essential for restoring health during longer and more complicated battles, emphasizing certain attack maneuvers and more. The Ring-Con All the elements of Ring Fit Adventure have the Ring-Con as their common denominator, i.e. a Pilates ring to which the right Joy-Con must be connected, while the other must be positioned inside an elastic band to be applied to the left thigh. The device is flexible and offers a certain degree of resistance, but at the beginning of the experience it is possible to adjust it so that it perceives our efforts to compress and extend it more or less intensely. The setup is quite simple, with clear on-screen instructions, and the early stages of the adventure are also full of advice and guidance on how to perform most of the maneuvers. With a view to a playful component that we could describe as an endless runner with turn-based RPG-style combat, you have to run on the spot so that the character proceeds more or less expeditiously along the tracks of a largely pre-established path (but there are also crossroads and alternative roads to be accessed by jumping or after having conquered specific skills, to the benefit of the replayability of the stages), compress the Ring-Con to shoot gusts of wind useful for destroying the inevitable crates and opening the doors along the way, extending the ring to suck up any objects scattered around (coins, hearts or ingredients for the very important smoothies, which we have already talked about) and face, as mentioned, clashes that gradually acquire a more marked strategic value. Exercises and fights When you come across one or more enemies during the Ring Fit Adventure campaign, the view changes as per tradition and you find yourself within a context in which, in turn, you attack and defend yourself. Our character can deliver more or less effective blows depending on the selected maneuver, identified with an exercise that can belong to four different categories, each linked to a specific color: arms (red), abdomen (yellow), legs (blue) and Yoga (green) . The movements can work on single or multiple targets, and have an attack value which obviously translates into a greater or lesser damage inflicted on the opponents, an element this is emphasized by the chromatic combinations: the red monsters suffer more from arm exercises, those blue leg exercises, and so on.How exactly does this mechanism, which is the core of the experience, work? Depending on the type of attack, you have to assume a starting position and then perform a variable number of repetitions, often accelerating the pace in the second half of the sequence, while Ring continues to encourage us with enthusiasm. There are, for example, squats, in which you have to bend over and hold the position for a few moments before going back up; or archery, which involves the triceps of the arm holding the ring and the opposite latissimus dorsi to stretch it; or again the rotation of the torso, which trains the abdominal wall and the obliques; to finally arrive at the various Yoga positions, which require slow movements and work above all on the back and abdomen. ends, however affecting our energy bar depending on the danger of the enemy. The resistance of the Ring-Con clearly doesn't represent a problem for those used to training with weights (after a first game session of a couple of hours we thought we'd find ourselves full of pain the next day, but no), but for all the others can constitute a non-trivial challenge. The Joy-Con detect in a rather precise way what we are doing and how, increasing the effectiveness of the moves based on the quality of the execution; and, although it is possible to ~fool~ the controllers in some cases, doing so would mean betraying the very meaning of this experience, the main purpose of which is to provide us with a valid reason to carry out training which, already in the short term, produces undoubted improvements in physical condition , understood as aerobic resistance but also toning, with particular reference to stabilizers and muscle bands that generally end up being culpably ignored in the gym. Outline and technical realization The Ring Fit Adventure campaign lasts quite a long time, especially considering a commitment of about an hour a day. The situations that are proposed are very simple, as mentioned it seems to be inside an endless runner in which coins are collected and a few jumps are made, although the developers have tried to introduce elements of variation in a progressive way in order to avoid excessive repetitiveness of the action: watercourses to be overcome by rowing with the abs, doors to be opened by squeezing the Ring-Con at high speed, crates that reveal their contents only after a few squats, raised areas to be reached by making leaps wider than the normal and so on. The fights should be considered separately and gradually become longer and more complex, possibly giving rise to episodes of frustration in case of defeat at the last second (although, fortunately, once a boss fight is reached it is possible start the level from there rather than from scratch) but playing well on the strategic depth front from a certain point on. The problem arises when you switch from the story mode to the side modes, because they clearly do not provide the same motivation and the same degree of distraction from the exercises. The twelve minigames, which can also be played together with friends, constitute the exception that proves the rule and prove to be quite fun, but when it comes to the standard training routines (customizable, for what it's worth) or even exercises with only the Ring- With the console off, the ~magic~ runs out and we find ourselves faced with the incontrovertible reality of an activity, bodyweight training, which some might find very boring and which in that case is not diluted by meeting funny characters or from the exploration of very colorful and pleasant scenarios. Naturally everything depends on your motivations: if you are driven by the determination to recover the lost shape, Ring Fit Adventure can prove to be a tool of great value and also provide you with very useful suggestions to improve your lifestyle. On the technical implementation front, it must be said that a surprisingly good and accurate job was done, substantially superior to the various Mii-based sports to which Nintendo had accustomed us. The characters and monsters present in the campaign are in fact characterized by a pleasant design, although far from original, and the protagonist moves within lively settings, full of moving objects in the background, although some sequences end up revealing their limits. The sound sector, fundamental for a product of this kind, includes rather generic music but all in all effective and well paced when needed, while the Italian voice ofRing never lacks enthusiasm even in the most trivial operations, as frankly it should be seen in the context.", "date": "2019-10-18", "grade": "8.0"}
