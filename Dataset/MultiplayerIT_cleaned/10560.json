Oh yes: Guybrush is at sea aboard the Screaming Narwhal, directed to the rescue of his partner Elaine, when another woman boards him (in the sense that he boards his ship). This is the bounty hunter Morgan LeFay, hired by De Singe, the mad doctor seen in the first episode. Unfortunately for Threepwood, the beautiful swordswoman is sharp in more than words, and our hero loses his voodoo-infected hand. From here on, we won't add anything else, and then you won't want to play it. However, know that you can visit the archipelago of the Jerkbait Islands and some smaller islands scattered across the seas. Moreover, you will meet new living beings, half fish and half women (are they mermaids?). It seems like the usual initial summary, but it actually serves us as an excuse to talk about the script of the second episode, even more solid than that of the first, with deeply characterized characters both in attitudes and in appearance. The adventure follows a clear thread, and already in the second chapter makes the player feel fully integrated into the new world of Monkey Island. To tell the truth, there is no continuity solution with the old Lucas episodes, to which the Telltales indeed wink more than once. In other words, we are back home. Curiosity Tales of Monkey Island is a series composed of five chapters and inspired by a saga of the nineties, The Secret of Monkey Island. The work is carried on by Telltale, with the collaboration of a large part of the original team. The episodes are released on a monthly basis and from time to time you can read the review on Multiplayer.it. NOTE: At launch, all Tales of Monkey Island episodes are available in English only. After some time, Telltale releases translations of the subtitles in other European languages, but there is still no official announcement about the timing. Those for the PC version cannot be purchased separately, unlike what happens for the Wii. Cabaret pirates Let's go back to Guybrush, the protagonist of the series, who after the first two episodes of the nineties has no longer found a decent characterization. Telltale gives us back a figure consistent with the past, now more mature. Threepwood's new character emerges above all in relation to the strong secondary figures of the cast, starting with Elaine. The protagonist also appears a little jealous, struggling to emerge, and thus opens up a mischievous view of his love life. There is also the ambiguous navigator of the Screaming Narwhal, the perfect sidekick for some very funny gags. Last but not least Le Chuck: since he recovered from the curse he has become a simpleton, naive and good-natured, but with an indefinable nuance that keeps a vague suspicion alive. Satisfied with the story, now let's talk about the puzzles. It doesn't change much compared to the first chapter, except for the fact that in some cases you will have to combine the right objects in the right place, so as to prevent a constant random association of what the inventory reserves from making you advance without thinking too much. Not that you have to squeeze your brains out, these are fairly simple puzzles, especially for the more experienced. In short, the usual 5 or 6 hours - which seem to have become a constant for Telltales, and perhaps we should also offer a sticker. However, let's make some criticisms, which we risk passing for fanboys. Some ideas, such as the path in the maze of the island, had already been seen in the first chapter, and many locations in this new episode do not shine in terms of characterization and beauty. Even the pace of the adventure is like a siesta on the sofa, although it recovers dynamism in the opening and at the end. And once again the music of Micheal Z, who don't want to know how to take off. The game is in English, which for many represents a limitation, but on the other hand in its original language this series has always given its best. A coke with Dan Connors During the GamesCom 2009, in Cologne, it was possible to exchange some jokes with Dan Connors, CEO of TellTale Games. The likeable Dan, ex Lucas already working on titles such as Sam & Max: Hit the Road, first responded to the catchphrase on the rebirth of graphic adventures as a genre: ~there are many opportunities for graphic adventures, including the growth of the casual market which allowed the genre to recover primarily from a commercial point of view with great successes such as CSI~ . ~We feel like an evolution of what the old Lucas did and in this sense we want to make innovations within the genre~, he continued,~ introducing for example the concept of different consequences depending on the actions taken by the user, so as to have more than una single track but different, dynamically changing~. In short, it seems that TellTale has quite clear ideas: to continue with the adventures and do so by trying to innovate, perhaps developing something not linked to any existing IP but completely new. On the sidelines is it was also possible to learn ~the Apple Store would be a solution for our games, it is a possibility to be taken into consideration~ while the choice to use completely three-dimensional graphics instead of 2D, with a greater visual impact, is due to the fact that ~with 2D it takes a lot of time and once you've done something, there's no going back~ A chat inside the bar in the business area of the Cologne convention center, in short, to find out more about the present and the future of one of the most beautiful and prospective independent realities of recent years.", "date": "2009-08-31", "grade": "8.0"}
