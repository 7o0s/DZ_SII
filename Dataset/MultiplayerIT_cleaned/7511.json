{"name": "Eternal Threads", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/eternal-threads-recensione.html", "text": "Imagine being able to manipulate time thanks to highly advanced technology, but having precise limits to respect, in order not to create paradoxes that would have destructive consequences for the entire universe (but don't exaggerate). This, more or less, is the idea behind the title of Cosmonaut Studios, a first-person puzzle game in which you have to change the course of a specific event without causing space-time disasters. Will it be worth doing? To find out, you just have to read the review of Eternal Threads, fortunately present in only one timeline. Gameplay In Eternal Threads, a lot of time is spent reviewing the events reported on the timeline During the Eternal Threads tutorial, we had a strange impression that we have not been able to shake off for the entire game, that of being faced with a kind of video editor, i.e. a game conceived as such. But let's go in order. We take on the role of an operative sent to northern England, to a house where in May 2015 six people died in a fire. Our aim is to save them, but following some rules. In particular, we are not allowed to avoid the outbreak of the fire by acting on the cause that unleashed it. What we have to do instead is examine the timeline of events that took place in the seven days prior to the fact, and manipulate them to save the lives of the six victims. To examine the events we really mean to see them happen in reality, as if they were clips on which we can act by forcing certain behaviors of the six, with choices made in other events or in the events themselves. To do this, we have a very powerful tool at our disposal, which projects events into the environments in which they occurred, allowing us to study them. The beauty is that we can see them in the order we want, because we immediately have the entire timeline available. Already from this brief description you will have understood why we talked about having had the sensation of playing with a kind of video editor, in which we could not change the order of the sequences, but the sequences themselves. Here the puzzle game nature of Eternal Threads emerges overwhelmingly. Going around the house looking at the various scenes allows us to think about them, to try to understand where and how to manipulate them. In the end everything has to come back, otherwise we have failed our mission. Exploration also complicates things. Going around the big house looking for clues is in fact essential to understand certain events and act accordingly. Examining objects can give hints about choices to make For example, you can read the messages on an abandoned smartphone or you can observe the objects in the rooms of the six, which give suggestions on how to get them to behave in the desired way. Be that as it may, the observation of events remains the essential part of the game, the one on which you spend the most time and which, ultimately, is more cared for in terms of mechanics. After all, it is the most fascinating element of the entire gameplay, the one that justifies it and makes it original. A large part of the game therefore takes place by studying the timeline, of which each node gives essential information, such as the characters involved and the fact that it is the first time or not that we look at it. Soon we will also come into contact with the influence line, i.e. with graphic information that makes us understand when the manipulated event will have weight on future events, which is also vital for the investigation. Investigation The game system is very simple, all things considered Speaking of game mechanics there's not much more to add, because Eternal Threads is all here. In a certain sense it almost seems that the developers have avoided creating too many complications as much as possible, to make the player concentrate on finding the solution to the case. Indeed, it would be better to say solutions, given that it is possible to save the lives of the characters in different ways, acting as you prefer. In this sense we are faced with a very particular title, which brings to mind masterpieces of the caliber of Her Story or Return of the Obra Dinn, due to the freedom of approach left to the player. It really is possible to do as you see fit. For example, you can focus on a single character, or you can go backwards, starting from the fire to reconstruct the events of the six one step at a time, up to the origin of their misfortunes. If you want you can also go at random, selecting events scattered on the timeline and then develop the investigation starting from what you learn. In the event that you do not remember a certain event, you can rewatch it whenever you want, so you can check certain facts right away. From this point of view there are really no limits and the game is designed to be as open as possible, so as to leave the player free to draw his own conclusions. In case, it is also possible to replay to try alternative solutions. In short, the development team gave us the tools, but now it's up to us to disassemble and reassemble the film. You will spend a lot of time in the company of the timeline In this sense, Eternal Threads is a very successful title, which manages to involve you in its coils, especially if you let yourself be fascinated by the investigation. His story reserves more than a few surprises, but it is not the main element of the adventure, which instead remains the investigation itself and the way to conduct it. In technical terms, Cosmonaut Software's game is made with great intelligence. Evidently the developers knew they didn't have unlimited resources and concentrated on taking better care of a single, large environment, instead of widening the shot to, perhaps, get lost along the way. Incidentally: most of the game takes place in the house and the greatest care has been placed on that, perhaps forcing some things, but remaining down to earth throughout the adventure. After all, the presence of so many events will have imposed choices on how to use resources. The events on the other hand are all animated and well done, a sign that the team had clear where to focus.", "date": "2022-05-18", "grade": "8.9"}
