It must be for this reason that he has always received special attention even in video games. A few years ago there were the ~Dance Dance Revolution~ playmats, but since the Wii came out with its new control system, dance games have come out steadily. Now it's Ubisoft's turn with its Just Dance, which with just one Wiimote in hand intends to make us move at breakneck speed accompanied by many choreographies and a nice summary of the last decades of dance music. Top of Dance Collection The Just Dance soundtrack encompasses thirty-two songs in total, thirty-two tracks spanning from the 60s to today, and resulting in one of the best music collections we've ever heard in a single game. Tracks like ~Ring my Bell~, ~Girls Just Want to Have Fun~, ~Eye of the Tiger~, ~Cotton Eye Joe~, ~U Can't Touch This~, ~Surfin' Bird~, ~Le Freak~ and many others worthy of mention. Each of these songs is accompanied by the original text that flows at the bottom left, and above all by an instructor (or instructor depending on the piece) who dances the entire song and who will be useful for us to learn the steps. As in any music game, even in Just Dance there are commands to be performed in time with the music. It is about making the moves required by the icons, represented with a stylized body and an arrow indicating the movement to be made. Not too clear indications in truth and that's why the trainer's choreography is very useful for grasping the approach to adopt. Each song has its own choreography, made up of different steps each time and which will require some work to be metabolized, just as if it were a question of really dancing. Among other things, to meet faster games, each song can be played in full or short mode. I dance alone (but also in company) And in fact it's almost really dancing since the game is limited only to mark the score, which rises by completing the moves with the right time, and which remains stationary in case of an error. Unfortunately, this system immediately shows its side both because it doesn't want to improve, and because the movements we are called to make cannot actually be evaluated by the Wiimote, which is most likely only used as a time marker. In this sense Just Dance is worse than other similar games released in recent years, such as EA's Boogie. The title immediately follows the wave ridden by software for ~non-gamers~ and does not bother to offer them those stimuli which are instead the basis of the more canonical titles. Probably the choice isn't even risky: if they are not players they are alien to their needs. What remains is therefore a package full of good music, accompanied by choreographies that can also be memorized and reproduced without a remote control, and the possibility of playing in the company of three friends. There are in fact three different game modes to play in company, the first is based on the score, and is the same as the fast one, the second eliminates one by one the players who make the most mistakes until the winner is decreed, the last one penalizes whoever continue dancing once the ~STOP~ message appears on the screen. Those who love to dance and don't feel embarrassed to squirm in front of the TV trying to awkwardly imitate the trainer will be able to experience moments of great satisfaction, while those who feel more modest and embarrassed could have some problems dealing with the minimal requests of Just Dance .", "date": "2009-12-18", "grade": null}
