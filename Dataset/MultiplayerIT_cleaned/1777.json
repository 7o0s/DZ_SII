The first thing that immediately catches the player's eye is the different approach that Surreal Software has chosen for the development of the plot. If The Two Towers clearly resumed the film, interspersing the parts played with clips from the film, this title is instead a fairly faithful re-proposition of the book, given that Vivendi and Electronic Arts have purchased the rights, respectively, of the literary work and of the direct triology by Peter Jackson. It follows that we find some characters and situations that for obvious reasons have been eliminated in the film, such as the nice Tom Bombadil and the misty Tumulilande, or some events that happened in a slightly different way compared to the film, where the director took some liberties too many, such as the lack of the fight between Saruman and Gandalf, only mentioned in the book, or Frodo's escape from the Black Knights, where the character of Arwen is totally missing, who will appear only once you arrive at Elrond's palace. A Ring to play them After selecting a new game, in fact the only game mode available, you are directly catapulted into Frodo's house. Immediately you will be asked to complete some quests, in particular to recover objects and go to certain places. Part of the game structure is essentially based on this, that is to complete the various missions that are entrusted to you from time to time by the NPCs that you will find during the adventure. Given the extreme linearity of the gameplay, it will rarely happen that you lose one or another mission along the way, since the entire game is essentially resolved in a succession of accept mission / execute mission / go to the next mission. The combat system turns out to be very simple, perhaps even too much: one key to hit, one to jump and one to use a specific weapon taken from the inventory. Due to the low number of actions that can be performed, the fights tend to be not very varied, but it is not a serious problem since the enemies are not outdone in variety of moves. Frodo is also given the opportunity to use Sauron's Magic Ring, an object that allows him to make himself invisible for a short time corresponding to a specific bar, once you run out of which you will die instantly. Later you will also be given the ability to control Aragorn and Gandalf. While the former has more varied moves and the ability to throw arrows, Gandalf can use offense and defense spells; in both cases, however, the control system varies slightly from when you use Frodo. However, the regret of not being able to use Legolas and Gimli remains, but anyhow The control system in general is quite precise, responding promptly in case you suddenly have to attack an opponent from behind you, perhaps while you are already busy facing one in front . The only doubt concerns the imprecision of the throwing weapons, a problem that will lead you to prefer close combat rather than remote combat. Initially the adventure puts you in command of Frodo alone, but your wandering alone will not last long, however, since almost immediately you will be joined by Merry, Pippin and Sam Gangee, able to give you a hand even in the fights. The idea could be good if it weren't for the fact that your ~helpers~ lack an energy bar, offering the player the opportunity to sit quietly with his hands waiting for others to do the work for him; among other things, fighting against opponents does not even offer any bonuses, since the skills of your alter ego remain constant throughout the adventure: no level-up, no increase in energy bar, no skills to learn, nothing at all. Having said that, it is easy to understand how the fights are not encouraged at all. The clashes against the bosses are also disappointing: the latter never represent a problem, given that each of them has a particular weak point that allows them to be killed with disarming ease. A Ring to watch them One of the advantages of this title is the atmosphere that it manages to give to the player during the exploratory phases. The locations where you will wander are well made, perfectly rendering a world, that of Middle-earth, made up of extensive valleys, small villages, forests, ruins, caves, castles and so on. The forest where you will meet Bombadil is enchanting (among other things it is capable of revealing/hiding passages to the player, making your sense of bewilderment even more), as well as the valleys on the borders of Bree, and the caves of Moria with its huge structures. The levels are huge, however you will never perdervi because the crossroads are reduced to one or two and almost always lead back to the main road. The only flaw, their static nature. The County of the Hobbits is well done, but it is sad to note that it is not possible to enter the houses of the neighbors or interact with the small objects scattered around the village. The same goes for all the other places, such as the Bree inn or the caves of Moria, all too ~firm~ in their beauty. The graphics engine does its duty by showing a high extension of the field of view without any slowdowns. The characters are animated very well even if problems persist regarding the detection of some collisions and some animation frames that are missing in the most agitated phases. The textures are good even if not too varied to tell the truth, as are the polygonal models and the lighting routines. The only element to throw tantrums in the graphics sector is the virtual camera. It often happens that the camera aligns late with each turn given by the player, in general it is necessary to manually redirect it each time with the right analog. It also suffers from a strange problem when using the first person view: let's say your character is facing north and suddenly turns to face you, if the player tries to use the first person view at this point, well, the view will still point north because that is the last camera position in memory. It will therefore be necessary to turn it 180 to solve the problem. Too bad. and in the dark judge them. In the sound sector, the Surreal Software title is doing just fine. The quality of the soundtrack is fluctuating but still manages to be evocative and to contribute to the atmosphere of the title. The dubbing, on the other hand, while being excellent, tends to be very ~disconnected~ from sentence to sentence, as if the voice actors did not realize what the exact sequence of the dialogues would have been once the development of the game was completed. On the other hand, the long loads between one section and another are out of tune; considering that the game manages to load entire sections of a level on the fly, it is not clear how there is a need to load parts of the game every time that could have been combined very well with each other. As for the game mechanics, The Fellowship of the Ring suffers from its too much simplicity. Accustomed to ultra-complex adventures today, we cannot accept the development of titles where it is not allowed to buy items, increase one's parameters through battles, learn new moves and so on. The game is resolved in a succession of fights on fights and this can get tiring in the long run, furthermore the missions that are entrusted to us, as well as being few, are of a monstrous banality not to mention the puzzles, even completely absent. The title turns out to be far from difficult as well as being quite short and worst of all it does not have additional game modes in addition to the main one. Put simply, once you're done you'll leave it gathering dust on the shelf. One last note: the game itself has no bugs whatsoever, the only flaws that led to the complete block in the US version have fortunately been corrected in the Pal version of the game. Comment It is difficult to pass judgment on this title. Compared to the complexity of today's titles, The Fellowship of the Ring can only emerge from the comparison with its tail between its legs, however the final judgment cannot be too negative. Surreal Software has aimed low, in doing so it has created a low-caliber title but at least it has fully achieved its goal. Perhaps, given its extreme linearity, it would have made more sense to direct the title towards a specific target, that of young people rather than offering it to all gamers. In short, if you are looking for a pastime that can entertain you for a few hours in a carefree way, maybe think about it, or why not, after all it could be a valid gift for your little brother / cousin. Others, however, look elsewhere, the PS2 adventure sector has much more to offer. PROS: +Large and atmospheric settings +Plot very faithful to Tolkien's book CONS: -Too simple game mechanics -Bad management of the virtual camera -Once finished you won't play it again Following the success of the first film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, directed by Peter Jackson, it was reasonable to expect the arrival of video games inspired by itirate, and in fact it took a short time for us to find ourselves faced with two tie-ins based on the adventures of Frodo, Aragorn, Gandalf and companions. Unlike the EA game, based mainly on the second book of the series, the Surreal Software title focuses the spotlight on the initial episode, The Fellowship of the Ring precisely. The genre is also different; if in the first case we were faced with a slash'em up, in the second we are called upon to face a classic adventure in the third person, in which we will guide the Company in the journey towards Monte Doom with the aim of destroying the evil ring of Sauron.", "date": "2003-02-03", "grade": null}
