To understand the meaning of such a high-sounding statement it is necessary to play that title firsthand, perhaps projecting yourself into those years in which Doom and Quake dominated to recognize innovations that may appear trivial today, but which were almost illuminating then. This premise actually has little to do with the new GoldenEye 007 produced by Eurocom for Wii since, unlike what the title might suggest, we are not dealing with a real remake, let alone a simple porting. This GoldenEye 007 is in fact something different that assumes, thirteen years later, an identity of its own in a videogame landscape full to the brim with mediocre FPS and clones of each other: it re-proposes the ideas and mechanics introduced from his illustrious predecessor and makes them his own, imitating him without copying him. The result is one of the best titles of the year. From 007 to 007 In the transition from Nintendo 64 to Wii, the first thing Eurocom left behind was precisely... James Bond. The British secret agent, created by Ian Fleming, in the original edition for N64, and in the film of the same name two years earlier, had the features of the actor Pierce Brosnan. In this new edition, however, Bond is ~played~ by the most recent film 007, Daniel Craig, and the story actually bends to the new approach proposed with this actor, more ~brutal~ than his elegant predecessors. However, the presence of Judi Dench as M remains unchanged, while all the other characters, including Alec ~006~ Trevelyan, have undergone an aesthetic restyling. The story, for better or worse, is the same, although some elements have been changed to modernize it, and James Bond will face the usual international intrigue seasoned with betrayals, revelations and beautiful women; the plot unfolds, along the campaign for a single player, thanks to extremely cinematic non-interactive cutscenes, whose only defect is that they cannot be interrupted and jumped under any circumstances, which makes them a bit heavy during further matches. Some of them offer simple QTEs and, in general, are an excellent glue for the various missions that outline 007's adventure. The single-player campaign is definitely the most refined mode of the package and defining it amazing is an understatement: it not only amalgamates perfectly different playstyles, but never forces the player to follow a specific one. It is therefore possible to act in stealth for most of the game or make your way by vomiting lead on the unfortunate opponents; there are also various intuitive puzzles (often solvable with the help of Bond's sophisticated cell phone, which in this edition replaces the old watch) and short but well-designed driving sessions. The approximately ten hours of the campaign are therefore not lacking in variety and imagination and, as if that were not enough, GoldenEye 007 offers a truly rare level of replayability for the FPS genre: each difficulty level offers not only more aggressive and cunning enemies, but also objectives and additional steps that make the experience always fresh and compelling, culminating in the most difficult mode that abandons the modern ~visual~ signaling of Bond's state of health, which can be restored by temporarily hiding, in favor of a more classic energy bar, a real challenge for vintage lovers. A thousand ways to kill with style GoldenEye 007 is a First Person Shooter and generally this genre meets different tastes of users in terms of actual controls. Fortunately, Eurocom's title beautifully supports the main control systems possible for Wii: if the Classic Controller Pro offers an experience very similar to the various FPSs that have followed one another on the most recent consoles, as in the case of the Halo or Killzone series, it is the Wii Remote to be the real star of the stage. Virtually every parameter can be configured to suit the player's needs and the aiming system offers truly remarkable precision and immediacy. That said, as already mentioned, the various stages of the main campaign do not oblige the player to take advantage of the various firearms available, and are structured in an unprecedented and extremely ingenious way to allow a certain level of customization of the game itself; this is not a simple port of the original level-design, if anything on its basis Eurocom has created unpublished maps filling them with slightly more modern elements, such as barrels to be detonated or internal elementsrats with which to wreak havoc. The result is an extremely spectacular action, also made so by the excellent graphics sector, among the best offered on the Wii despite the not always solid frame-rate, due to the amount of moving elements on the screen, truly impressive. A little less detailed, from a graphic point of view, the multiplayer mode which, if in the Nintendo 64 edition it was one of the main features of the game, here instead is a little more obscured by the splendid campaign. Yet, the multiplayer mode offers a truly remarkable variety and longevity, starting with the possibility of playing by connecting to the Internet in games of eight players or simply via split-screen with one or more friends. Multiplayer games offer a system of ~modifiers~ very similar to that implemented in the Call of Duty series and our successes in battle allow us to acquire new weapons and other bonuses with which to customize the games. The multiplayer mode is therefore not something forced, as evidenced by the excellent design of the maps, however the lack of support for Wii Speak is felt above all in cooperative games and it is a shame because it would have definitely been the icing on the cake.", "date": "2010-11-12", "grade": "9.0"}
