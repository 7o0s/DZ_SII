Considered an excellence in the field of sports simulations, the series developed by Visual Concepts is back on time with the NBA 2K18 edition which has already passed through the hands of the editorial staff in the version for the Microsoft and Sony consoles. But this year's version also came in the Nintendo Switch version, which deserves a separate chapter. On the other hand, we are talking about a console capable of surprising especially in the portable version, which allows us to play a real triple A multiplatform on the go. The complete experience The Switch version of NBA 2K18 is limited to 30fps, in both docked and portable modes, against 60 for the PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions. But it contains the complete experience, based on the Visual Concepts proprietary engine and equipped with all modes, including the new Neighborhood Life which allows you to access various activities through a social hub, strolling around buildings and mini-games. However, we will talk about this later. In fact, let's start from the controls that are comfortable both in docked and console in hand mode, allowing us to access all the complexity of the gameplay of the Visual Concepts title. The response to the commands is slightly slower than the counterparts due to the 30fps, and it is a limitation to take into account, but the gameplay works and works regardless of the player's skill, resulting intuitive if played with a relaxed and decidedly deep attitude the more we try. In fact, the ball also turns by simply taking advantage of passing, shooting and tackling, but the action becomes more articulated using the back and right stick that allow you to make almost every imaginable move including hooks, lifts, the Euro step that made arunas famous Marciulionis, slides to the basket, several jump shots and so on. And all this makes NBA 2K18, also in the Switch version, the worthy heir to a consolidated tradition that has allowed Visual Concepts to be the queen of the basketball simulation genre. The experience, it must be said, is more limited using the two Joy-Con as single controllers, given that the right stick leaves the scene, but the possibility of playing with a friend without having to spend an extra euro is still noteworthy . Equally noteworthy, however, are the problems, starting with the need to have an external memory. NBA 2K18 requires 23 gigabytes of space even when purchasing the physical version, apparently due to the decision to use smaller cartridges than necessary, and also demands 5GB of save files. For this, as will also happen for DOOM and other games, a MicroSD is required which, in addition to nullifying the usefulness of the cartridge, forces an additional expense of around twenty euros for an external memory of at least 32GB. A difficult challenge The Visual Concepts guys have admitted that the effort to bring such a game to Switch has been enormous and this does not surprise us given the big difference in terms of computing capacity compared to other consoles. This leads us to the already mentioned 30fps which are however stable, at least in the field, unlike the framerate of the intermission scenes and the My Career mode whose enjoyment is disturbed by some glitches. However, we have not had the misfortune to encounter, with our copy downloaded on launch day, those problems capable of compromising the experience that have raised many complaints these days. We have seen some stumbles, some interludes have lost a few shots and a strange whitish spot in the center of the screen that made us fear for a few moments for the health of some pixels of our Switch, but we were still impressed by what Visual Concepts did . On the other hand we are talking about a home console game that can be played anywhere, a title that among other things enjoys refined gameplay and an excellent technical realization. This is why we hope to see updates as soon as possible capable of solving every flaw and giving due prominence to a sector which, although based on a rather dated engine, gives an excellent glance, close enough to those of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One from surprise us even if the differences are obvious. The first concerns the lack of facial recognition, but it is a trifle that will soon be resolved by allowing you to upload photos to a website. More relevant, at least from the point of view of realism and visual rendering, are the lack of camera flashes of which only the reflections on the parquet remain, the absence of depth of field which has a strong impact in the cutscenes, some lower quality textures, less vivid colors and less defined image, which is very evident in docked mode despite the resolution going from 720p to 1080p. But between reflections, audiences and player models, what matters seems to be in the right place and on the small screen of the Switch it returns an exceptional glance in the portable field. Portable revolution The Switch version of NBA 2K18 contains all the dynamic dialogues starting from the pre-game which includes great personalities of the US basketball and ending with a video of the host city, a piece of the national anthem or other snippets of everything surrounding a match of the NBA. And there's no shortage of courtside commentators, realistic cameras, loads of options and everything we're used to in the NBA 2K series, further enhanced in this new edition that includes several quick challenges and three very full-bodied modes that are almost games in their own right . Unfortunately, the storyline of the new career is banal, a little hasty and takes away the pleasure of growing a player up to the call of a great team, but if nothing else it is a little different than usual and allows us the luxury of choosing which team join us after a short three-way tournament. In addition, the offer also includes My GM: The Next Chapter, which sees us in the role of a former player who has become a manager, dealing with training, tactics, transfer market, sponsors and scouting, with the possibility of taking the field directly at every game . We can take all this for a walk and, while bowing our heads in front of 30 fps, we can only acclaim the efforts made by Visual Concepts which put us in front of a small revolution in the portable field. Apart from the framerate, all considered acceptable, the actual doubts mostly concern the often long waits to find online games, slightly slower uploads despite the use of high-speed storage and the now canonical possibility of buying Vital Currency points with real money, common to all versions such as the price in euros which sadly reaches 69.99 euros. But even with all the doubts of the case, NBA 2K18 is the confirmation that Switch can get by as a home console and has an edge in mobile mode, so as to convince third parties to spend time and money to exploit it properly.", "date": "2017-09-26", "grade": "8.0"}
