{"name": "Tony Hawk Downhill Jam", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tony-hawk-downhill-jam.html", "text": "If the first Tony Hawk appeared on Nintendo DS (American Sk8land, for the forgetful) will be remembered in the years to come as the very first title to take advantage of the now tested and free Wi-Fi connection of Nintendo's portable touch screen, the second ( Downhill Jam) will instead be remembered as the first true spin-off of the main series. Now you say, is it possible to make a spin-off of a skate game that focuses on Mr. Tony Hawk and what he does best, skating? The Vicarious Visions, already developers of the Tony Hawk portable series, say yes, and in support of their thesis they bring a game built on crazy descents (here the ~downhill~ is explained) with only the trusty 4-wheeled skate on their feet, putting partially in the background the component of special moves. Successful experiment or are the so-called ~tricks~ now so rooted in the series that you can no longer do without them? The answer just below. Speed is nothing without control The World Tour, as previously mentioned, is divided into six stages, each of which is in turn divided into a variable number of main and secondary missions to be completed in order to get on the plane to the new destination. The proposed missions are not limited to putting the player in the repetitive condition of the race, they rather provide various objectives that can go from performing a specific highly spectacular trick in a particular area of the city (to give an example: in San Francisco , Tony Hawk asking the skater on duty to perform a double backflip using the railing of an overpass), up to three rounds on the same portion of the track, beating the opponents with the best combination of points and time. Obviously no one is born ~learned~ and Mr. Tony Hawk knows this very well, so before starting the real races each player will be forced to follow a whole series of lessons divided by difficulty useful for learning the game commands, the execution of the basic evolutions and above all the exploitation of the boosts. At the end of each successfully completed mission, players will be given the opportunity to increase their ability to hold, speed and perform tricks, in order to reach a virtual alter ego modeled on their gamer skills by the end of the game. This last element, combined with a not too excessive global difficulty of the game, are the main flaw: given the ease with which it is possible to continue in the game and therefore increase one's statistics, many players will be able to find themselves at the maximum of their abilities with the minimum effort, making the offline and online multiplayer component excessively relieved; in fact, the character that can be used in games against other players will be taken directly from the single player save and novice players could find themselves competing against real champions of the game, good not so much thanks to their skills as thanks to the pumped statistics of their skater virtual. Speed is nothing without control Downhill jam does not make particular progress compared to American Sk8land in terms of graphics, the realization is once again comic, typical of American productions, the result does not make you cry out for a miracle but on closer inspection it remains one of the most solid 3D engines ever seen so far on Nintendo DS, with just the occasional case of flickerio. The soundtrack remains one of the strong points of the game, with 15 tracks taken directly from the best of the current American punk-rock scene and with excellent dubbing (English) present for all the dialogues created for the game. At first glance this Tony Hawk Downhill Jam may seem like a fairly trivial game, but once the surface layer is scratched off, the result is a good game, with excellent longevity and a whole series of modes that can entertain the player for many hours, and to this we add the multiplayer component via wi-fi (and obviously also local) and a really well-constructed soundtrack. Disappointing the almost total absence of use of the touch screen and the stylus, and the non-existent progress in graphics. However, nothing that can't be corrected with a third appearance of the world's most famous skater in a portable version. Pros: The 3D engine of the game works perfectly Definitely long-lived The multiplayer via wi-fi remains one of the strengths of the game Cons: We forgot to use the peculiarities of the DS Graphically not excellent Management of online characters in some cases decidedly unburdened My name is Hawkk, Tony Hawk. In the skate world, just mentioning Tony Hawk's name many eyes shine with admiration and many others with burning envy, in the rest of the world the name ~Tony Hawk~ means only one thing: Skate; this is because the American ace of the table has been able to clear through customs a little-known and little-used sport even in nations that it is still difficult even to name. Downhill Jam starts from this assumption, Hawk is seen as a master of his discipline and as such presents himself to the player to teach him the long and winding way to become totally master of his own skate. The game, as previously mentioned, does not present itself as the classic title dedicated to the American skater with gigantic cities full of useful elements to perform tricks in total freedom, but rather as a series of races on pre-established routes where it is possible to perform evolutions to increase own boost bar, but which in hindsight remain an accessory and optional element. The main mode that follows the game is the so-called World Tour, in which the player will face a whole series of trials and races within six distinct areas starting from the city of San Francisco, passing through a bizarre Scottish castle and ending up on the snowy slopes of Kilimanjaro. The Jam Sessions will allow players to improve their time on a particular course already unlocked, the Fast Races instead will be a simple re-proposition of the four-player competitions present on the world tour, and finally the free skate will allow you to retrace the slopes in total solitary already faced in such a way as to understand every hidden secret. If the modalities listed up to now were not enough, the Vicarious Visions have seen fit to insert a useful option for reviewing the various tricks that can be performed during the game and above all a perfect skate shop to customize your own virtual skater down to the smallest detail . Character customization is basically the first element you will have to deal with during the game, modifying parameters such as hair, clothing, the trusty skate board and above all by designing your own logo; continuing with the tour, by winning the races, you will be able to have a certain nest egg available to spend at the aforementioned skate shop, in order to unlock further boards, clothes and characters. Last but not least, we also note the presence of a strong multiplayer component via wi-fi, with races of up to four players with the possibility of using a voice chat both in the pre-race lobby and during the race (first experiment in this regard): via the touch screen it will in fact be possible to activate a sort of voice recorder capable of recording a few seconds of dialogue to be subsequently sent to the other three participants in the tender, the result is not perfect due to the deferred truism of the message, but the attempt it is certainly interesting and may perhaps find other applications in the future.", "date": "2006-12-20", "grade": null}
