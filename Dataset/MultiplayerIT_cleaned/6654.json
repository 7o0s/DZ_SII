In the case of First Touch Soccer 2015, we are faced with a series that made its debut in 2011 with an excellent debut episode, and which has made use of the experience gained to improve its offer over time. In fact, the new edition arrives on the App Store with a series of new features (including the stadium editor) and can be used completely free of charge, making do with the ~Manager~ mode and four-minute matches; or in its entirety, by paying a sum of 3.59 euros to unlock all the other functions, such as advanced customizations (therefore also the length of the matches), quick matches, tournaments and the ~Become a star~ mode, in which you select an individual player or a team to take them from rags to riches over the course of various seasons. It is an extremely elastic and sensible approach, which allows anyone to get an idea of the quality of the product and to decide, if necessary, whether to pay something to be able to access the extra features or simply play the career, starting with low-level teams. classification. Another aspect of the experience is represented by credits, which are obtained by winning matches or by watching short videos. It is not a question of tokens necessary for playing matches (since no limitation has been inserted in this sense and it is therefore possible to play for as long as you want without forced breaks), but rather a currency that we can invest in the club to increase the budget available for transfers and home stadium upgrades. This last feature is one of the novelties of First Touch Soccer 2015 and allows you to improve the capacity and beauty of the sports facility, so as to attract a greater number of fans and consequently multiply the takings. First Touch Soccer 2015 undoubtedly sets the benchmark for mobile soccer games Solid football Once you take the field, the sensations you feel with First Touch Soccer 2015 are quite clear and sharp, and communicate a surprising solidity of the gameplay. From the options it is possible to modify the ~aids~ for managing the trajectories of passes, shots and crosses, but the default setting already delivers a very balanced system, supported by a reactive, precise and particularly reliable touch control system. Merit of the virtual analog stick, which automatically repositions itself every time we touch the screen with the left thumb, while the arrangement of the three main buttons remains the same and is well organized right from the start, without any tendency to mislead. Located in the bottom right corner of the display, the three buttons allow you to make passes, shots and crosses according to a traditional ~load~ which determines their power, as well as to make tackles and slides in the defensive phase. Finally, by touching the upper right part of the touch screen, it is possible to activate the controlled player's special ability, which often translates into a maneuver that allows you to discard your opponent while running and fly away to the net. And it is precisely in the finals that First Touch Soccer 2015 manages to express itself at its best, thanks to excellent ball physics and, therefore, to the sensation of hitting the net (or the goalkeeper's hands), with exciting rebounds that tend to occur during short-range shots and spectacular long-range shots that can end up in the ~seven~, as well as on the crossbar or outside. The basic assistance (as mentioned, which can be deactivated) does not in fact take away the burden of directing our shots, thus avoiding trivializing a gameplay which, however, at the normal difficulty level, appears a little too permissive and devoid of particular challenge. Commented in English, with a reduced but ~signature~ soundtrack (with songs by Bastille, Imagine Dragons and Black Kids), the new title from First Touch Games boasts a particularly compact size (just 150 MB download) but leaves a lot ' to be desired as regards the graphics, which beyond the sharpness of the textures make use of particularly angular polygonal models, with discrete but tending to repeat animations (see the attacker dictating the pass with his hand), very distant in the physical appearance from their real-life counterparts. Greater attention to the technical sector and artificial intelligence, often incomplete, could really make the leap in quality to an already excellent production.", "date": "2014-12-27", "grade": "8.0"}
