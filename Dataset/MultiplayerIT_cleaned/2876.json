As we have had the opportunity to explain to you previously, the most important logistical change is certainly the fact that from this season Ubisoft's approach to title support veers towards 360-degree coverage, obviously giving up the two-operator model to focus on one alone, and thus having more time for everything else. But let's see in detail what Operation Shadow Legacy has brought with it. Welcome Sam Fisher The new operator is an attacker and is called Zero. However, what is hidden behind this name is an aged Sam Fisher compared to how we saw him in his last personal iteration. Sam will help Team Rainbow as a mentor of sorts, a man with years of experience who will try to teach the team a few tactics of his own. His unique gadget called Argus Launcher fits into this very perspective. Basically Sam Fisher will have a gun that can shoot four special cameras that can use a laser each. The peculiarity of these cameras is the possibility of adhering to penetrable surfaces and, by piercing the wall, being used on both sides of the wall. Zero is equipped with an SC3000K assault rifle (Sam Fisher's iconic rifle) or MP7 SMG as a primary weapon, a special silenced 57USG as a secondary weapon, and claymore or frag grenade as a secondary gadget. We are talking about a hybrid operator, able to give a lot of information with his cameras, to destroy gadgets with the 4 lasers available (one per camera, remember), but at the same time he needs to take advantage of flanking tactics to position his gadgets . The use of Sam Fisher is consistent with the story of the character and his mastery of stealth. An operator that offers many possibilities and therefore in our opinion one of those capable of being an excellent alternative to numerous first choices. Immediately behind Zero, the second big news of Operation Shadow Legacy is certainly the rework of the Chalet map. The scenario featuring a snowy environment has been redesigned to be more suitable for the current state of the Rainbow Six meta. The famous external balcony that overlooked the bedroom on the upper floor has been removed to make room for a new area, more suited to rotations and connected with a new staircase to the lower area of the trophy room. The latter too, reduced compared to the past, it will be flanked by a dining area linked to the famous kitchen. Also on the upper floor, the balcony above the main entrance has been fixed and will now have two more walls to cover the view of the entrance to the upper study. The garage area has also seen numerous revisions with the whole part that connects the garage to the barrel room which has been revisited to offer more rotation possibilities for defenders and better flanking chances for attackers. Chalet therefore underwent a substantial rework to allow it to immediately enter the pulls from which to draw for the competitive, even if perhaps there would have been other maps in our opinion that would have needed a quick restyling. Not too minor introductions Like any self-respecting new season, Shadow Legacy also brings with it numerous ~minor~ introductions that surround the big introductions of the season. In this case, however, what we define as a side dish is a set of innovations so dear to users and which we therefore struggle to actually consider ~minor~ in the strict conception of the term. First of all let's talk about the Map Ban before the start of the match. The two teams will now be able to choose which map to ban among three randomly proposed by the game: the one that will remain will be the theater of the match. In case both teams ban the same map, the game will randomly choose from the remaining ones. Simple and fast, as was the operator ban. A choice designed to increasingly standardize the style of normal games to those shown in competitive tournaments. Below we find the rework of Thatcher's EMP grenades. With the new operation these grenades will no longer destroy the gadgets but will put them in time out, avoiding their use for a few seconds. This rework guarantees the ineffectiveness of the so-called ~Bandit trick~ since once the Bandit charge is disabled, it will take many more seconds. Precise and surgical intervention on an essential operator in the game economy, but which has its many favorable ideas. Another introduction will be thePing 2.0. The classic and anonymous yellow Pings will be accompanied by Pings which, once carried out in correspondence with a prominent element in the game, will show the icon of that element: cameras, opponents' gadgets or defuser, to name a few. This introduction will ensure that players who play alone or without a microphone can interact more effectively with teammates. Also among the minor introductions we have the restructuring of the reinforcement of walls and trapdoors for defenders. The classic two reinforcements per character will be grouped into a pool of 10 total reinforcements available at the start of the round for defense. Doing so will free the roomers from the reinforcement, will allow players to organize the reinforcement faster and better and also the possibility for a single player to manage, for example, all the hatches. The crosshairs have also been changed and now they will no longer see the presence of the ACOG but in addition to the classic Reflex and Holographic, players will be able to find new optics with different zooms in the accessories customization menu. In fact, we will have the 1.5x, 2.0x and 2.5x zoom. Only snipers (Glaz specifically) will have the 3.5x scope. Last, but not least, the introduction is the arrival in the secondary gadgets of the mini heavy breach charge that will allow you to create a single hole (that can be climbed over) in the reinforced walls. As you can well imagine, the impact of this introduction will have to be monitored given that up to now only four operators (out of the almost 100 available) have had the burden and the honor of being effective against the reinforcements of the defenders. On the sidelines of all these introductions, the arrival of the Battle Pass from the beginning of the season. We are not talking about a very big news, but a way to comply with the classic use of Passes for games/services and consequently a tool for players to get more rewards by playing the title more.", "date": "2020-09-28", "grade": "8.0"}
