Even by the leading exponents of this genre, FIFA and PES, over time there have been numerous times in which this platform has been snubbed in favor of consoles. Choices evidently dictated by market numbers, which have forced PC players to often find themselves faced with castrated editions, reduced in content and playability or with a technical level lower than that desirable on such hardware. Despite this, the hope of being able to count on at least one simulation on their favorite platform remains alive every year. After having extensively dedicated ourselves to the versions of FIFA 17 for all the consoles in circulation, it therefore seemed right to turn our attention to its computer edition as well. The PC version of FIFA 17 has also been promoted with full marks, fully in line with expectations! On PC as well as on consoles We say it right away so that whoever is reading this article can breathe a sigh of relief: the PC version of FIFA 17 is 99.9 percent the same as the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions. Only a few small elements make it different, which probably few will care about, because we are really talking about a product that is almost identical to the one we described in our review of FIFA 17 for consoles. In such a situation we will therefore avoid dwell on repeating what has already been said, inviting you to read the article just linked for all the details of the case. Here, it is enough for you to know that the new mode The Journey is included in FIFA 17 for PC, dedicated to the promised Alex Hunter, absent in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game. There are also all the news concerning the Ultimate Team, but in case you want to know more about the latter, we refer you to our special from a few days ago. What has been said for the modes also applies to the novelties in the gameplay, all present starting from the new management of set pieces. There is also the now famous Pushback Technology, which allows you to defend the ball at 360 with lots of thrusts and elbow movements. Pad in hand, the gaming experience in front of the PC monitor is therefore exactly identical to the one that can be obtained in front of the TV to which a console is connected. Matter of details The main difference between the PC version of FIFA 17 and the Xbox One we've already tested is the absolute absence of drops in the number of frames per second. In reality, even on consoles this occurs quite rarely: only in some stages and only after certain conditions that occur during an attack action. On PC, however, the problem does not exist at all: once the number of frames per second has been set to 60 via the game configuration menu, which we advise you to do to improve its stability, it always remains the same throughout the game. match. Only when the ball is in motion, however, because in the cutscenes the number of images per second automatically drops to 30. Now let's take a look at the graphics settings, even if as usual they are not there who knows what parameters to change. We have already mentioned one, and it allows you to freeze the frames per second at a value of 30 or 60, or give them free field, while the main one gives you the option to choose a level of detail from four available, plus one automatic. The same thing also for antialiasing, which can be set to your liking or at the choice of the CPU. In terms of definition, the balance inevitably leans towards the PC version of FIFA 17, even if like last year this difference can be found above all by looking at the details that surround the match. In fact, the most attentive eyes will notice a bit more quality for the audience and the other background elements, as well as a generally cleaner image. As for the controls, the use of a PC-compatible controller is of course supported (as well as highly recommended). Small curiosity: however, the movement mode consisting of mouse and keyboard, or keyboard only, continues to resist. A pairing inherited from the dawn of the FIFA series on PC, but which has now become impracticable given the large number of buttons the player needs to effectively issue all possible commands to the eleven on the pitch. In a way, playing a game with mouse and keyboard can be seen as a kind of diversion, even quite fun, to try to do something in this mode beforecrawl back to the joypad.", "date": "2016-10-07", "grade": "9.3"}
