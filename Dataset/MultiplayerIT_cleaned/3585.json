Ubisoft Montreal had in fact already proposed The Mighty Quest For Epic Loot on PC in 2015, proving less successful than expected. The original version of the game mixed typical dynamics of dungeon crawlers with management elements: a combination that did not convince Steam and Uplay users at all. Precisely because of the meager results collected, in the autumn of the following year the game was definitively removed from the market, in conjunction with the archiving of Ghost Recon Phantoms. Well, after failing to address more traditional players, Ubisoft has chosen to try again by putting on the market a revised version of the product for the iOS and Android platforms. With what results? Read on for our review to find out. A heroic journey in search of loot The previous structure of The Mighty Quest For Epic Loot was based on two different approaches: on the one hand, the assaults on other people's castles and on the other, the construction of one's own through the placement of traps, monsters and obstacles. It was also possible to choose the character by drawing from four different classes of heroes, and then set out to conquer the bases created by the rest of the community in an attempt to grab their treasures. In the mobile version this structure has been set aside to focus exclusively on the action RPG component, with rich loots and a Diablo-style combat system within small levels. The playful experience has therefore been calibrated exclusively on the completion of scenarios filled with increasingly fierce enemies, where the upgrading of equipment and the activation of some special skills become essential to proceed. Obtaining the loot in the fantasy world of Opulencia becomes indispensable in order to survive, improving the endowment in your possession thanks to the over 1,000 unlockable objects. Clearly the control system has been revised to adapt to smartphone use. The orientation of the screen remains vertical, while the movements of the protagonist can be managed with the simple pressure of the thumb. With a quick touch, the attacks are imparted, automatically chained through the small leaps that the character makes to head towards the targets closest to him. If necessary, dodging is also provided, to be performed with a rapid lateral scrolling which allows you to avoid enemy incursions by reacting with the necessary timing. At the same time, the three support skills that the protagonist is able to activate in the heat of battle must be managed with the other hand. The Mighty Quest For Epic Loot mobile edition offers an Adventure mode divided into 10 acts. With the exception of the first, which essentially serves as a tutorial for less experienced users, the others consist of nine traditional levels and a final area that involves facing a boss. The design of the maps is very basic, essentially requiring you to clean up the area, collect the treasures from the chests along the way and possibly try to finish the operation within the maximum time of three minutes to be entitled to a bonus. The conformation of the castles varies in terms of aesthetics and the characteristics of the enemies encountered, although their structure always proves to be very standard. In fact, the gaming experience lends itself to a certain repetitiveness, also by virtue of a combat system suitable for the context but which never offers new stimuli to the player. After completing the first tasks, you begin to collect resources and materials which will then be compared and made more efficient by accessing the Hero section. The criterion is very classic, so you will have various pieces of equipment available for your armor plus the slots dedicated to the melee weapon and the shield. At first, you will only have access to PvE levels, but after reaching level 8 you will unlock the PvP Arena mode, where you can face characters created by other players in an intense free-for-all deathmatch battle for four players. Logically, in the matchmaking phase, the game will try to select opponents of equal rank, so as to prevent the clashes from turning out to be too unbalanced. Then there are the Trials, or additional tasks to be completed to obtain the so-called Promotion Stones, useful for leveling up the various parts of your equipment. To do this, it is essential to access the Forge, where runes are applied and upgrades are performed by recycling useless materials. Microtransactioni and pay-to-win mechanisms Being a free-to-play title, The Mighty Quest For Epic Loot leverages in-app purchases. Equally predictably, the microtransactions introduced by Ubisoft end up triggering the much-criticized pay-to-win dynamics, making it essential to purchase new packages in order to have access to higher quality materials. The progression proceeds without problems at least until the conclusion of the third act of the campaign, after which the growth becomes increasingly limited and cumbersome, precisely to stimulate the user to invest real money. The prices of the packages vary from a minimum of a few euros for the basic prize funds, up to over 100 euros for those who decide to grab the Founder's Package. By investing hard cash, you also have access to gem packs, essential for the purchase of coin chests, access to rare and epic chests or more simply to have enough resources to continuously revive the hero if he falls under the blows of opponents.", "date": "2019-07-19", "grade": "6.5"}
