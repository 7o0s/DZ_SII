This is why it is strange to think that a year has already passed since its release and that we are now here, ready to close the circle with the review of Borderlands 3: Psycho Krieg and the fantastic upheaval, the fourth DLC (at least for this first year) . A content that is not only the closing of the circle of a long and ambitious project, but also the definitive declaration of love towards all the old fans of the series. This detail, fundamental both during the basic campaign and the various additional contents, is always been at the same time a great asset and a sinful defect of the latest work of Gearbox. On more than one occasion, the desire to please the fans has not allowed Borderlands 3 to take off and stand out from its past, albeit giving great satisfaction and several moved smiles. After another handful of hours in the company of our crypt hunters, we are ready to take stock, and understand how bright the future may or may not be for the series. A shocking love story Psycho Krieg and the Fantastic Upheaval kicks off when the Sanctuary doctor decides he finally wants to see more about the very nature of the Psychos. No one has ever really been able to understand its genesis and the reason for homologating into an almost indistinguishable gang. It goes without saying that we will be the hounds in charge of the dirty work, arriving at the absurd task of reaching and exploring the mind of the Psycho Krieg. An old acquaintance of Borderlands 2 players, Krieg was one of the many playable hunters in the past, added precisely with a DLC to the previous numbered chapter. Once we reach the very emanation of Krieg's mind, we see ourselves transported inside the greenest and idyllic field of flowers that Borderlands has ever given us, knowing that it is only a projection of the mind of a madman. After a sufficiently absurd battle, we get to know Krieg Sano, or the part of the Psycho's subconscious that has remained dormant inside him and overtaken by madness. From this moment a swirl of events opens up between the grotesque and the dramatic, which will put us in front of truths of the past, relationships between old characters, the very birth of the Psychos, until we understand a nature that, perhaps, it is right to remain unknowable. It is in the course of the main quest, with all its series of secondary missions, that the concept expressed previously is declared in a simple and direct way: that of dependence on the past of the series. It is undeniable that this content also loses, from a narrative point of view, almost all of its appeal to those who are not a veteran of the series, almost looking more like a Borderlands 2 DLC than the third. Far be it from us to make you believe that the package dedicated to Krieg is not well thought out and thought out, on the contrary we would venture to say that in many respects it is the best, but this does not exclude its nature as yet another bridge between two generations. Overall, the approximately three hours to be dedicated to the main quests alone are played with pleasure, between sufficiently crazy maps, among the most inspired bosses (at least as regards the DLCs) and some really interesting narrative gimmicks. The same cannot be said for the variety which, except for some settings, adds nothing to the previous experience, not even those detours on the route or gameplay additions that had given pepper to the previous DLCs. The usual gameplay - you love it and you hate it Going back to the gameplay of Borderlands 3 for the umpteenth time would be redundant and of little use. Anyone who doesn't know what we're talking about can easily go and recover last year's review. For everyone else, the key aspect to consider is that Psycho Krieg and the Fantastic Mayhem adds practically nothing new to the formula. It is in all respects the most narrative of the contents offered in the third chapter of Borderlands. This does not mean that little shooting is done, or that there are no new interactions, but despite what happened in other cases, the originality of the mechanics has certainly been affected. Even the usual introduction of a new faction of enemies, with their own peculiarities, has left room for the revisitation of something we already know well. Different speech instead as regards the new bosses, in line with the past in terms of number, but scenically and playfully very funny. We are certain that above all one of the clashes will be able to electrify you and make you smile exactly as it did with us. Psycho Krieg and the fantastic upheaval is therefore the worthy conclusion of a journeyof well-kept and passionate expansion, but which never reaches the highest peaks of the series and which, despite everything, remains anchored to the past and to the old fans.", "date": "2020-09-10", "grade": "8.0"}
