The story is a set of clichs that you can pay very little attention to, but it's all about the eternal struggle of good against evil for a change, in this case within an anime-style fantasy world surrounding the territory of Cloudia . Essentially, you start out as a promising youngster among the ~Skywalkers~ (miraculously escaped Lucas' lawyers, it seems), those who are destined to become Guardians, and find yourself drawn into a much bigger fight than us, with seemingly unbeatable enemies but who will take us through a long training path towards self-improvement and evolution into full-fledged fighters. All this in addition of course to the multiplayer implementations in PvP, since it is a hybrid with MMO-style elements. Guardians of Cloudia can present rather strange situations and fights Although Guardians of Cloudia does not really shine for originality, some peculiar and interesting elements can be seen, such as the combat system and pet management, which from tinsel become a real basic element of the gameplay in this particular RPG. From a first glance, between graphic characterization and style of play, the proximity to Tales of Wind is very clear, which is in fact developed by the same Neocraft team, but considering the quality of the latter, this is not necessarily a negative element . Of course, this takes away further originality from a game that is not exactly innovative in itself, so if you have already played Tales of Wind you know exactly what we are dealing with: it is an RPG with real-time combat and the presence of single-player quests PvE player or multiplayer mode between 1v1, Team vs Team, Guild vs Guild, and a sort of Battle Royale, so as not to miss anything. Guardians of Cloudia does not excel in practically any of the different types of game in which it engages, but overall it is a pleasant title, to be tried willingly also thanks to the free-to-play distribution. Between MMORPG and JRPG The game structure is based on the typical mixture of elements between MMORPG and JRPG that has spread dramatically in the mobile sector in recent years, managing in this case to also find a good mediation through a real-time combat system that is also fun and a particular character progression. The MMORPG component is perhaps the weakest one: presenting the usual sequence of quests to be tackled without even thinking about it that much, with the need for grinding to enhance the characters, the whole structure from single player RPG soon turns into the classic festival of autoplay, with the character running alone from side to side towards points of interest and objectives to be completed. We know that it can be difficult, given that the game structure itself pushes us to use tricks of this kind to deal with the endemic grinding, but the advice is to try to avoid recourse to autopilot as much as possible, because in fact it takes away any interest in playing . By directly controlling the characters you can also appreciate a good variation of situation between one quest and another and above all a rather amusing combat system, even if it tends to be confusing. This is based on the direct control of the character and the use of various special abilities with their classic cooldown period, therefore to be managed and dosed in the best possible way. To all this is added the use of pets, which are an integral part of the customization and progression of the characters, as we will see later. Various pets can be collected and evolved into Guardians of Cloudia The Skywalkers, or those who are destined to become Guardians, are endowed with particular combat skills and are divided into five main classes: archer, swordsman, rogue, magician and oracle, each of which in turn can evolve following two different paths, bringing in total to 10 possible specializations to undertake. Although the combat mechanics do not change that much from one character to another, at least ranged or close-range fighters stand out, equipped with special abilities that emerge at more advanced levels capable of significantly modifying the attack power and this way well-balanced elements to build a team in multiplayer. Statistics progress as you increase del level but also using more advanced equipment, for some of which the use of micro-transactions is also required, unless you want to rely exclusively on luck and wild grinding. This in itself is not a big problem in the PvE structure of the game, but it obviously becomes one when you enter the PvP realm, where the pay to win drift can easily emerge. Exploring the world of Guardians of Cloudia can lead to different situations Another element that falls within both the progression and the aspects involving micro-transactions are the pets, a real distinctive element of Guardians of Cloudia compared to many other titles of the genre. Instead of being simple aesthetic elements, pets in this game are an integral part of the gameplay, since they are basically allies who support us during fights. These creatures are endowed with elemental magical powers that can amplify the characters' attacks and imbue them with further effects. Furthermore, pets evolve, changing their appearance and characteristics in a remarkable way and adding further strategic depth to their management and use in battle, constituting a real game within the game, which in this way almost takes on the connotations of a kind of Pokmon.", "date": "2021-06-04", "grade": "6.8"}
