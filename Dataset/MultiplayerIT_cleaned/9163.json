This introduction to say that the present Casey's Contraptions is clearly inspired by the aforementioned classic, offering a series of challenges that seem to find their perfect dimension on the iPad. Take it there and put it here Casey's Contraptions provides a series of settings that host about forty levels, each with its own nice little problem to solve. Whether it is a question of releasing balloons, placing a ball in a box or starting a toy car, it matters little, the important thing is that you do it by exploiting the elements of the scenario and the tools made available, all in compliance with the sacred laws of physics. From a strictly technical point of view, the work of the Snappy Touch developers is impeccable, starting with a simple but very lively and colorful graphic design, which goes very well with the type of gameplay. Things are even better when it comes to the interface and control system: as is by now established, iPad is once again confirmed as a very reliable platform for what concerns puzzle games, which often and willingly prove to be more enjoyable and immediate than ever . Casey's Contraptions is no exception, and it is indeed legitimate to count its being user-friendly as one of its greatest strengths. Therefore, simple taps are enough to select and position an object, which can be rotated with a pinch of the fingers or facing in the opposite direction by quickly tapping twice on it. Unlike many other similar titles, Casey's Contraptions does not present a fixed solution for the puzzles made available, but rather openly invites the user to experiment to find the best trick: precisely for this reason (and also for the credible physics that regulates the movement of objects), the otherwise frustrating logic of trial and error here takes on different connotations, proving to be an active part in the fun. The user is further pushed to rack his brains by two important factors: the first is represented by the presence, in each level, of three stars to be collected in order to obtain the best score. These are often strategically placed in rather difficult positions to reach, which greatly increases the level of challenge. Secondly, the possibility is given to share a short video of one's own solution with the Game Center contacts who own the game (and possibly to view their performance in a given stage), giving the product that pinch of social factor which never fails. Dulcis in fundo, Casey's Contraptions also includes a simple but complete editor that allows you to create personalized puzzles to send via email to friends or to upload to the official website and share with everyone.
