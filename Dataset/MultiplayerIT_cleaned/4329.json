The franchise was carried forward some time later with Deadzone, an episode completely devoted to competitive multiplayer but a little lacking in content. It was therefore with great curiosity that we awaited the debut of Shadowgun Legends, announced a few weeks ago with a trailer that in many ways tried to ape Destiny. Well, in reality the game does not differ much from this concept, trying to offer users a shooter experience that shares many aspects with the Bungie title, but at the same time is foul-mouthed and noisy a bit like Volition productions, adding to the mix a pinch of Overwatch that never hurts. The competition, moreover, is now quite fierce, the mobile market has changed and the advent of blockbusters such as PUBG Mobile and the imminent Fortnite make it really difficult to be able to carve out a large slice of the public. Well, unless you land on the App Store and Google Play with a really, really good product. And guess what? Shadowgun Legends fits that description perfectly. The narrative incipit, which can be beautifully ignored, tells of how the Shadowguns have become stars, with fans and money in abundance, so much so that they transform their mercenary missions into real shows on which to monetize. Tu si que spares Once our mercenary has been created using a simple editor, we will find ourselves in a vast hub in which to interact with other players or with the NPCs in charge of the various functions: one figure allows you to access missions, another to sell or buy weapons, a to sell or buy armor; but there is no shortage of further entertainment and extra activities, such as a real casino for example. The social implications of this setting appear evident right from the start, thanks to the excellent interface, and acquire value as you play, given that after a while it is possible to unlock not only a set of cooperative missions, but also an excellent competitive multiplayer mode, which we found excellent in terms of matchmaking quality and netcode strength. Don't be fooled, however: the charm of Shadowgun Legends lies above all in the progression system, broad and multifaceted, which allows you to gradually update your equipment with more effective and/or different tools, as well as to obtain extra skills within a tree with long branches. It doesn't take much to grow, as the experience has been designed to fit smartphones, with relatively short sessions in mind, in the order of two or three minutes. A limitation that in this case does not turn up our noses, if we consider the quality of a gunplay that can count on autofire to make the action dynamic and frenetic (but the options also allow you to deactivate it, in case you are masochistic). This last feature is hinged on a first-rate touch control system, responsive and precise but above all simple, with a few invisible virtual buttons and sticks, with automatic repositioning. The result is that you move very well, you avoid enemy fire (although the opponents' artificial intelligence never makes you cry for a miracle, on the contrary it is rather basic) and you score eliminations in grand style, perhaps by pulling out the rocket launcher or activating some special ability in case of need. The system works damn well, although it is not original in any way, and is supported by an extraordinary technical sector, capable of offering graphics that are not only fluid but also very detailed, with a fair variety of scenarios within the four planets available. Of course, the structure of the assignments reveals some limits after a while, but also on the front of the freemium dynamics there is very little to complain about: you play for as long as you want and the arrival of the inevitable grinding is welcomed without problems, given the pleasantness of the gameplay.", "date": "2018-03-27", "grade": "9.0"}
