Despite all the problems associated with the hardware limitations of mobile devices and the justifiable ingenuity of a first-time developer, The Fallen King not only demonstrated that it was technically possible to make a vast fantasy RPG on smartphones, but it gave us hope that the The day we saw the equivalent of a Morrowind on handheld devices wasn't too far off. Since then, Crescent Moon has refined the formula and improved its technologies, first with Aralon: Sword and Shadow in 2011 and then with Ravensword: Shadowlands in 2013. Yet, as the graphics improve and the explorable environments expand, the developer does not managed to match a deeper gameplay experience, more interesting quests and a greater depth of characters and monsters. Six years after its first iOS game, Crescent Moon releases Exiles, a futuristic RPG that not only hasn't progressed since Ravensword, but actually seems to be taking a step backwards. Exiles proves that size doesn't always matter in RPGs Alien Desolation If Aralon and Ravensword could be seen as an attempt to propose a miniature version of The Elder Scrolls, Exiles seems to be in some ways inspired more by Mass Effect. Having depleted all the natural resources of their home planet, the Terran people set out in search of more hospitable worlds. Exiles is set on one of these colonies, Aurora 9, which is itself brought to its knees by a corrupt government and which tries to maintain its hegemony by spreading a lethal virus. A premise that would have all the credentials to develop in a minimally interesting way, but which instead is only sketched out in the arc of a short and soporific main quest. Having completed an initial sequence that acts a bit as a tutorial, the biggest flaw of Exiles emerges already after a few minutes from the start of the actual game, when you get on the saddle of a speeder and cross the vast world that will from stage to adventure. Vast, sure, but also so empty and poor that the ocean in Zelda: The Wind Waker looks like an amusement park with a thousand attractions. Outside of a few outposts in which to gather resources or take on side missions, the open world of Exiles is a flat and gray desert, populated by silly and all similar monsters. The desolate game world is not only huge, but also ~unnecessarily huge~, given that the lack of variety (and quality) of secondary content soon leads to focus on the main quest, following the map and ignoring any fort, camp or military base along the road. And when you run out of fuel or don't have a speeder available, having to cross half the desert on foot almost seems like a joke. Graphically, Exiles looks very good, and with a handful of interesting characters and a well-finished role-playing component, it wouldn't have been too bad either. Too bad that's not the case. The combat system represents the other serious grease stain on Crescent Moon's shirt, regardless of whether you decide to use the camera in first or third person. If already driving means of transport is cumbersome and not very fun, moving, aiming and firing at enemies is a real nightmare, and for each shot scored you will find yourself wasting half an empty magazine. Not even the RPG component is saved: at the beginning of the adventure it is possible to choose between three classes, each with its own bonuses and special ability. The soldier fires a blast that damages and paralyzes nearby enemies, the infiltrator becomes invisible for a short time, and the adept slows time to allow for more precise targeting of enemies. However, in no way will the player be able to change his class, learn other powers or redistribute the points spent to enhance the various characteristics, a detail that severely limits the freedom to customize his alter-ego, forcing him to start the game over in if you are not satisfied with your special ability.", "date": "2015-02-11", "grade": "4.5"}
