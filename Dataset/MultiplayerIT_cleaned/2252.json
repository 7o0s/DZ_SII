{"name": "Ace Combat: Distant Thunder", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ace-combat-distant-thunder.html", "text": "The plot Fortunately, this time Namco has left the story that accompanies the unfolding of the various missions intact. In fact, in the third chapter the PAL conversion had completely lost the plot present in the NTSC version. The story takes place in the near future (around 2004), in a country called Erusea where a war is being fought that started after a meteorite fell. The reason for this conflict is the weapon that, following the disaster, was built to shoot down more dangerous meteorites. Obviously this weapon has fallen into the wrong hands and the pilots of the ISAF (Independent States Allied Force), of which our character is a part, are the only ones capable of putting an end to this bloody war. Static images, drawings, which alternate like slides, are accompanied by a voice that tells the evolution of the story that develops parallel to our missions. The voice is in English but the Italian subtitles greatly simplify the translation. Interface Having said that, let's get to the point Once our DVD full of data has been inserted, after a spectacular introductory film, we will find ourselves in front of an aesthetically very pleasant menu. The decidedly high-tech interface outlines a very captivating aspect. The predominant color is obviously blue like the skies in which we will soon find ourselves engaged in exciting air-to-air duels. Initially, from the menu we will only be able to choose some modes, while others such as free flight and the choice of a single mission will only be unlocked after completing the game. For the less experienced there is a sort of very useful training to become familiar with the commands. Of note is the presence of the two-player mode, which I think was missing from the second chapter. Among the various options is the very welcome screen setting for 16:9 televisions which is definitely recommended for those lucky enough to have such television support. Once the training is finished, we can then select the ~start mission~ item... The war begins Four difficulty levels are proposed to us: very easy, easy, normal and hard, but since the normal level didn't seem too demanding to me, I would have liked a ~very hard~ instead of ~very easy~. The first mission, as well as all subsequent ones, is preceded by a small briefing, useful for explaining the purpose of our attack and for highlighting the targets to be shot down, which can be both airborne and land-based. After the briefing, the choice of the aircraft begins, which however will only take place from the second mission onwards, given that in the first we will have only the F-4 Phantom available. In fact, the subsequent fighters will be purchasable thanks to the money accumulated with the conclusion of the missions. In this way, as the game progresses, we will have at our disposal a real garage (GT3 style) in which to keep or even resell the most powerful aerial combat vehicles of recent years: F-14 Tomcat, F-16 Falcon, F-15 Eagle, F-117, Tornado, Eurofighter 2000, Mirage 2000, Mig-29, F-22, F-18, Rafale, Su-35 just to name a few. The first mission is preceded by a splendid movie made with the same graphics as the game and which really makes you cry out for a miracle. The sequence shows an F-4 taking off from an aircraft carrier. Immediately after the mission begins and here we will be called to use our dear Dual Shock 2. Control An action is assigned to every single key of our joypad and everything is damn functional. The left analog stick is used to steer our fighter, while the digital directional cross has 2 functions: pressing up engages the autopilot which will self-level the aircraft in a horizontal position; by pressing down instead we can change the game view. There are 3 cameras, an external one which shoots the game action from behind the aircraft, one positioned on the HUD which shows all the flight data on the display and finally the most suggestive, but also a little uncomfortable which is in practice the pilot's view. From here we will be able to admire the interior of each hunt, everything being reproduced perfectly. So if we are on board an F-16, which enjoys a wide field of view, we will notice almost all of the surrounding landscape, while instead piloting an F-117 the view will be very limited and not very playable given the decidedly particular nature of this type of plane (to be clear it is the famous invisible plane that looks a lot like a bat). Thanks to the right analog stick pinstead, we want to look around or admire our fighter if we are using the external view. The X key is used to fire the cannon, the circle to fire missiles or drop bombs, the select key to change weapons. On the other hand, on the rest of the keys Namco has decided to make the most of the analogy of the Dual Shock 2. In fact, the triangle key, if we have hooked a target with our radar, is used to ~zoom~ on the target, and the zoom level will increase with the pressure exerted on the key increases. The square instead shows the map, and as for the triangle, depending on the force exerted, it will show us a now wider now narrower map. The same goes for the R1 and L1 keys which are used to accelerate or to decrease power. By pressing lunge R1 the afterburners will immediately light up, and our plane will break through the sound barrier in a short time, while a decisive pressure on the L1 key will activate the plane brake. The news For the first time in the Ace Combat series, it will be possible to return to the base during a mission to replenish fuel, armament and repair the fighter from any damage suffered. There is a white dashed line on the map that marks the respawn area. Once this line has been crossed, the landing phase will begin which we can carry out manually or skip it to proceed more quickly. The landing can take place on an airport or on an aircraft carrier depending on the capabilities of the vehicle. Unfortunately in no mission there is in-flight refueling, which I personally would have liked very much. The graphics Finally here we are at the cosmetic aspect of Ace Combat: Distant Thunder. The graphics are without a doubt the greatest strength of this game. It is impossible to remain indifferent to the splendid landscapes that can be admired during the various missions. Mountains, sea, forests, night cities illuminated by lights, everything is incredibly photorealistic when admired from the sky. Unfortunately, getting too close to the ground you notice a gradual graining of the textures that will no longer seem as real as when observed from higher altitudes. This happens especially on flat surfaces, while mountain ranges and canyons are very enjoyable even at low altitudes. In any case, I don't see why you have to fly at such low altitudes... have they never told you that it's also dangerous? :-) The light effects are nothing short of fantastic, the reflection of the sun that clouds the view and the shades of the sea on everything. If we really want to find some graphic flaws, we could say that the explosions could have been better cared for and diversified, being practically always the same. Just as it could be said that the objectives, especially the terrestrial ones, are decidedly poor in details, but I think it is easy to admit that they are really small details that do not in the least affect the beauty of Ace Combat. Absolutely perfect is also the reproduction of the planes, identical to the real ones. The lights that reflect on the fuselage depending on the setting is a small Namco miracle. Such graphic beauty is then rewarded by fantastic replays that you will hardly be able to stop watching at the end of each mission. Seven different cameras selectable with the d-pad will provide you with every possible visual angle to admire your evolutions. I had only happened to admire such exciting replays with Gran Turismo and with Moto GP (among other things by Namco itself). Personally I think Ace Combat: Distant Thunder is so graphically beautiful that it should be taken as a reference point for future games of the genre, both for consoles and for PCs. The sound The sound of Ace Combat: Distant Thunder is also an absolute highlight. The power of the engines is faithfully reproduced, during the replays then, the brutal rumble is perfectly simulated by changing intensity as the plane passes, just as it happens in reality. During the missions we will be in continuous contact via radio with our comrades and with the base who will update us on any developments or changes in the programme. Unfortunately everything is in English and, even if always subtitled in Italian, it will still be difficult to read the texts in the middle of a fight. The musical accompaniment is also superb, especially some orchestral symphonies that adapt wonderfully to various situations. Longevity Surely one could saythat the lifespan of Ace Combat is not the best. In fact, the 18 normal-level missions flew in a matter of hours, but once the game is over, some modes such as time trial and free flight will be unlocked. Furthermore, the possibility of expanding your garage with the numerous aircraft available will certainly lead you to replay it, then also considering the 4 difficulty levels and the versus mode to be played in split screen with a friend, I don't feel like completely rejecting this aspect. Although a greater number of missions certainly would not have hurt. Conclusions After a long wait we have been amply rewarded by Namco. Impeccable realization at the limits of realism. Fans of planes and not, they won't be disappointed by Ace Combat, a game that presents a perfect balance between simulation and arcade and whose only flaw is a limited longevity due to the low number of missions. Despite this, you will have an exciting time with your PlayStation 2 in the blue skies of Namco. Buy it and you won't regret it! Conclusions Pros: Stunning graphics Intuitive controls Great sound Photo-realistic replays Cons: Don't fly too low You finish in no time Game pilots The first aircraft ~simulator~ worthy of the name has finally landed on the PlayStation 2. It is the usual Namco who has thought about it, which with the fourth chapter of the Ace Combat series leaves all the competition behind, although to tell the truth there are very few flight simulators on the Sony console. As you may have noticed, I put quotation marks on the word simulator because Ace Combat: Distant Thunder is fundamentally an arcade game, in terms of playability, which has little to do with real flight simulators, more suitable for a Personal Computer than a console. This also explains the enormous success that the series achieved, years ago, on the old and beloved PSX. In fact, the arcade spirit of this series was certainly its trump card that allowed many console owners to approach this world and this genre of video games. Despite the arcade nature of Ace Combat, the series has always stood out for a decidedly realistic side from a visual point of view, and Ace Combat: Distant Thunder treads this aspect even more, perhaps reaching the highest levels ever reached before. In fact, the great simplicity offered by Namco in the controls contrasts with the absolutely photorealistic side of the images that develop before our eyes. Ace Combat 4 graphically speaking shows, if not all, a large part of the potential of the PlayStation 2. The immense landscapes that can be admired aboard fabulous modern fighters have left me entranced for a long time. The aesthetic beauty of the aircraft and the painstaking care with which they are made is perhaps comparable only to what we saw in Gran Turismo 3. But as I always say let's go slowly and start analyzing the various aspects one at a time.", "date": "2002-02-06", "grade": null}
