{"name": "Rayman Raving Rabbids: TV Party - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rayman-raving-rabbids-tv-party-recensione_a.html", "text": "Rayman, the historic protagonist of some of the most successful platformers in recent history, has for a couple of years been relegated to the role of secondary figure in the games that bear his same name: on the occasion of the title that was to inaugurate the series on Wii, in fact, Michel Ancel and his team had invented enemies as crazy as demented, the Raving Rabbids, an alien race of crazy rabbits intent on invading the Earth. Either for the charisma of the characters, or for the play structure that has gone from a platform to a collection of minigames, within a couple of episodes the poor aubergine man, although in theory still the protagonist, was literally obliterated by the nice rodents that in TV Party they made up their minds to prevent him from enjoying television. It's up to you to reiterate who's in charge; in the game you will succeed, but in terms of image, like it or not, for Rayman the die is now cast... I'm in control here! Actually, we only know the narrative premise of the game thanks to the Wii version, because on the DS, apart from a couple of short and well done FMVs, there is no effort to introduce the situation to the player: never mind, the plot is absolutely secondary in this product. The fact is that the rabbits have invaded Rayman's TV, and to drive them away our hero must face a series of mini-games. This, in short, the structure: the game is divided into five boards on each of which Rayman must reach the goal, a television, before the rabbits. To establish how many squares the two contenders move, the minigame starts: if you pass it you have four squares available, otherwise only two. Rayman, the historic protagonist of some of the most successful platformers in recent history, has been relegated to the role of a secondary figure for a couple of years now I'm in control here! The minigames are divided into ~channels~ each of which is inspired by a different type of television broadcast (therefore we will have the channel inspired by great cinema, the musical one and so on) and there are around fifty in all. In reality, the relationship between a minigame and the channel it belongs to is not always clear, not to mention that in the end they can all be traced back to a few fundamental categories: there are minigames inspired by those that accompanied Super Mario 64 DS (for example, you must accompany the throwing the rabbit using a giant rubber band like a slingshot), the intelligence mini-games, those in which you use the microphone, those in which you have to modify the image of the lower screen in such a way as to make it the same as the one that appears on the upper screen, again, those in which you will only have to rub the touch screen as fast as possible in the direction that the arrow points to, music mini-games a la Dance Dance Revolution A fairly varied assortment, but decidedly not very original unlike the counterpart for Wii that uses the Balance Board in a pioneering and intelligent way. At the end of each level there is one last test to face, and that is the chase of the rabbit in the role of Rayman, which at first glance seems like a traditional platform phase but in reality it is nothing more than yet another test of skill , with the protagonist running automatically and all you have to think about is avoiding obstacles at the right time by tapping the screen. Freddie Mercury is alive, and he's a rodent! All this in the classic crazy and demented, ironic and light-hearted atmosphere that has always characterized Rayman's games, and even more since the evil and very clumsy rabbits appeared. The highest peaks of insanity are certainly reached in the musical mini-games, with the rabbits dancing on the screen and engaged in improbable covers of some really existing songs, among which we undoubtedly point out ~Another One Bites the Dust~ by Queen: poor Mercury he must be turning in his grave, but laughing! That said, there seems to be nothing wrong with the structure of the title, just as there is nothing wrong with the mechanics, with the control rarely stopping you from doing what you think you're doing. Everything works well, yet one cannot help but breathe a certain air of flatness and boredom, never explosive, but always vaguely and annoyingly present: this is basically due to two elements, in addition to the aforementioned, and objectively secondary, little care of the ~side dish~: the aforementioned lack of originality of the mini-games and above all a great lack of rhythm, which, especially from Wario Ware onwards, is a fundamental ingredient for a collection of mini-games. one cannot help but breathe a certain air of flatness and boredom, never explosive, but always vaguely and annoyingly present Freddie Mercury is vivo, and it's a rodent! Many of these are in fact too long and monotonous, they don't show changes of register for their entire duration, and the smile due to the situation soon gives way to a yawn. The situation obviously improves in multiplayer, among other things, some mini-games only make sense if faced against a friend, but not that much also because the multi is limited to only two players. Not even the nice ~dressing~ of the rabbit with various objects that you will unlock by winning more games is certainly a fundamental point of attraction. On the other hand, there is nothing to complain about on the technical and artistic side: the DS hardware is expertly exploited to make the funny protagonists better, and in 3D, while the aforementioned covers of famous songs stand out in terms of sound. Comment There's nothing particularly wrong with the DS version of Rayman Raving Rabbids: TV Party, were it not for a ~simple~ lack of soul. Ubisoft's collection of minigames has all the characteristics of a properly made game, only that it stops here, is satisfied with the minimum wage and dares no further; a real pity, both in view of the fierce competition on the platform, and above all because the Wii version, on the contrary, stands out for being daring and for the great care placed in the whole outline of the game. In short, we really don't feel like recommending this game: it's not like you'd throw your hard-earned cash away, but for everything TV Party does decently, you'll find more than one game that does it ten times better. Pro Good technical achievement Rabbits are always demented! Cons Lack of pace and originality There is nothing that really compels you to play", "date": "2008-12-10", "grade": null}
