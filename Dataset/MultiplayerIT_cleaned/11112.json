For an in-depth description of the game, we refer you to the review of the console version. Here we will mainly deal with the specific problems of the PC version, which are not few. The disappointment comes from the first films, since knowledge of the narrative sources from which the plot is inspired is probably taken for granted and practically very little is explained, leaving more holes than certainties and making it difficult to follow the succession of events. Of course, it is possible to completely disregard the narrative side and jump into the game without too many preambles, but a little less confusion would not have hurt. In reality, the problems, for the PC version, start from before starting to play, or from the settings of the control system and resolution. Speaking of the first one you will be happy to know that it is not possible to use the mouse. Aren't you too happy about it? I understand you. It's a real pain having to use the keyboard to move, to move the camera and to perform offensive and defensive actions; unfortunately human biology has only endowed us with two hands and we can't do much with them. By inserting a joypad the situation improves but other problems emerge (at least in our case). We tried with an Xbox 360 joypad which, theoretically, on PC should be the most compatible with console ported games, but Dynasty Warriors 6 refused to detect the right analog stick forcing us to use the shoulder triggers for hand movements. camera on the X-axis. Unfortunately, the Y-axis wasn't assigned at all and we left it alone throughout the game. Tried to insert another joypad, the situation repeated itself, with the aggravating circumstance of the failure to assign the X axis as well. The difficulty in managing the camera is not a trivial matter, given that the game often chooses absurd shots to show the action and confusion reigns supreme. Very often we found ourselves fighting practically blind. My Renbu I don't know you The second problem, already mentioned, is that of selecting the resolution which is essentially fixed: by selecting different resolutions, the size of the image will not change and, to adapt it to the monitor, large black bands will appear. In our case, but we also believe in others, we could only select one resolution to play in full screen. Probably the most penalized will be the owners of 4:3 monitors, who will be forced to look at the black bars throughout the game, even when the resolution is lowered. often the game chooses absurd angles to show the action and confusion reigns supreme My Renbu I don't know you Leaving behind the considerations on the bad adaptation from console to PC, we come to the game played. As expected, no significant changes were made to the original formula. Once you have chosen one of three characters and selected the level of difficulty, you are faced with the usual tactical map with information on the scenario. After taking a quick look at it, you can get into the game. The aim of all scenarios is to slaughter the rival army. All you have to do is press the attack key furiously while surrounded by enemies and, occasionally, use the other keys as well to produce spectacular combos or more powerful attacks. Trying to fight in a technical way is absolutely useless and counterproductive (it makes it harder and slower to advance), better to press random buttons and watch. The new Renbu system makes it even more advantageous to carry out indiscriminate massacres, because with the increase in the body count, avoiding being hit, the power of the blows also increases. The desert of the Tamarri Unfortunately Dynasty Warriors 6 suffers from the same problems as its predecessors / clones: it's terribly repetitive. It only takes a few minutes of play to understand that there isn't much to do, except collect some bonuses. Even clashing with bosses and mini-bosses doesn't add bite to the action, especially since their presence is hardly noticeable in the midst of the mass of enemies. The scenarios are of an inexplicable flatness and offer so little variety that they get tired in the first game, also because apart from having to go from one side to the other they don't offer much more in terms of interactivity. On the other hand, the main character can now climb the stairs and swim, not really two revolutionary actions but a novelty for the series (we are satisfied with little). the scenarios are of an inexplicable flatness and offer so little variety that they tire in the first game The desert dand tamarri The best part is the enclosed encyclopedia which explains a lot about the history of the era Dynasty Warriors 6 is set in, which is saying something. If the console versions hadn't already convinced, this one is even more disastrous due to the bad conversion that creates many problems and makes it in fact not very playable by those who are not lucky enough to own a joypad that is totally compatible with the game (unless not to be octopuses).
