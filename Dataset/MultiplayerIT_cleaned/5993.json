One of the most recent cases is that of Crossy Road, capable of creating a real trend both in terms of graphic style and in terms of the way to adopt the much loved / hated free to play model. And while the clones flock, here comes a title like Shooty Skies from the same developers of the aforementioned game that tries to apply the same basic concepts to a totally different genre such as that of scrolling shooters. Cube explosions There is no space for a story in Shooty Skies, indeed the opposite would be surprising considering the absolute bizarre elements that make up the setting: the protagonist is a winged ~thing~ (we really can't find a better definition) that flies inside of a kind of cyberspace populated by adversaries who draw from the boundless imaginary of the net and include YouTube kittens who vomit icons, coin-ops who shoot joysticks, bearded hipsters who throw cassette tapes and so on, for a title which definitely does not lack taste to the absurd. In this context, the player's goal is simply to destroy everything that comes within range, trying to get the best possible score in a randomly generated progression that ends only when you are hit by an enemy projectile. Shooty Skies wisely decides to keep things extremely simple as far as the control system is concerned: holding down a finger on the screen activates the automatic fire and moves the ship, while releasing the pressure allows you to load a special attack very powerful, an operation which however obviously leaves it exposed to enemy attacks. This particular element - combined with a far from negligible level of challenge - makes Shooty Skies a shooter that is only apparently simpleton, but which in reality proves capable of entertaining even those who grew up on bread and R-Type, and who especially in boss fights he manages to bring out a ~malice~ not common to the mobile landscape. Fun, challenging and with a careful use of the free to play model: Shooty Skies is a success It's easy to find yourself playing Shooty Skies one game after another, not only because of the pleasant frenzy of the playful action, but also thanks to a decidedly sensible free to play system that for once doesn't try to constantly put your hands in the user's pocket. During the game it is possible to accumulate credits both by collecting them during the shootings and by obtaining them as a reward for reaching certain score thresholds: this currency is used to purchase temporary upgrades which increase the attack power of the ship, but it can also be spent have a second chance after being destroyed. The credits are distributed in good quantities (so much so that, unlike many similar products, here the online store does not even include packages of virtual currency to buy with real money) and moreover the software allows those who want to save money to watch an advertisement to get the desired bonus, so Shooty Skies can be played in absolute tranquility without spending a euro. The only things that have a real price are the various heads that can be mounted on your ship and which in some cases guarantee advantages in terms of gameplay, but these are still accessory elements that can be beautifully ignored without the title losing any in enjoyment. Admirable from a playful point of view, Shooty Skies instead gets lost a bit along the way in an exquisitely technical field, starting with a minimalist and cube-like graphic which however tends to always re-propose the same elements and which, moreover, turns out to be (deliberately?) confusing , often making it difficult to distinguish between enemy shells, upgrades and credits; more could also be done on the sound front, with practically non-existent music and few effects which, if on the one hand they work by subtraction together with the graphic style, on the other they can only be boring and irritating in the long run.", "date": "2015-10-06", "grade": "8.5"}
