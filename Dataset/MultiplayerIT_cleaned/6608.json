After testing the preliminary version a few weeks ago, we had no big doubts that the guys from Hamburg would be able to meet the delivery times, since the product looked very close to its final form. However, appearances were deceiving, as in the final release, on the one hand we were able to appreciate numerous refinements and additions present since the first minutes of the game, and on the other, always in the same short period of time, ascertain how various technical bugs have not yet been resolved. An evil story Starting in order can help clarify ideas. At the beginning we find ourselves once again in the labyrinths under the arena where Cassia, the protagonist of Blackguards 2, has been inexplicably locked up. he will deprive of reason, thus transforming his only comfort in the solitude of the dungeons - the book of the good ruler - into a real obsession. After managing to escape from the prisons, Cassia begins to design the plan that will see her dominate the entire Mengbilla region for at least one day, and to do this she calls on other faces already known to players of the Daedalic RPG: the dwarf Naurim, the gladiator Takate and the wizard Zurbaran to which other supporting actors will be added, such as the mercenaries of the silent legion. Cassia is an anti-heroine driven by a thirst for revenge: in the continuation of the plot she will be able to make unpopular decisions, such as sacking a city or hanging a prisoner after interrogating him. Depending on the alignment, you can activate side missions or influence the development of the party permanently. The story, which shares some details with that of the first episode but does not require knowledge to be fully enjoyed, seems to have what it takes to capture the public's attention, and we shouldn't be surprised: from a pedigree of race like that of Daedalic, in whose showcases shine titles that have made the plot their strong point, one could not have expected less. The characterization of the other protagonists is also good, endowed with a discreet charisma even if with some avoidable stereotypes. As can be guessed from the above, unlike the first Blackguards in this sequel it is not possible to choose one's alter-ego, therefore the first tutorial-missions are enough to quickly immerse oneself in the game mechanics: we are faced with an RPG in which all eliminated the ~classic~ exploratory phases, as the only moments of action in which it is possible to command the protagonists are the turn-based battles that take place on the essential hexagonal grids. Between one battle and another there is time to progress the story and heroes in camps where in fact the protagonists do not move. Strategic refinement Among the most revisited aspects is the character development tree: several entries have been eliminated to make the progression system more intelligible, even if the five skill screens continue to appear a little too dispersive. However appreciable, the programmers' work could have been even more radical, considering that it is not always possible to immediately grasp to what extent an update can enhance a hero: in any case, it seems that more weight has been given to melee combat rather than to the remote and magical ones. The battles are therefore the real focus of the game. The forces in the field are not limited to just the four protagonists, but it is possible (indeed mandatory) to also use other secondary units who in any case gain experience as they continue in the adventure. The aim is to conquer the outposts that from time to time become available on the strategic map. The path to follow is left to the player's will, although in some cases it will be necessary to return to previously captured places that can be put under siege by the enemy. The scenarios are obviously not confined to fixed screens but develop considerably horizontally and this has allowed the designers to propose a fair variety of missions: the most common ones involve eliminating all opponents or reaching certain escape routes, while in other cases we will assistor to escort or rescue operations to be achieved in a pre-established number of shifts. Mixing the cards takes care of numerous environmental elements which can prove useful for quickly eliminating groups of enemies but which in turn can be exploited by artificial intelligence to the detriment of the player. At the beginning of each battle you have to place the traps you may have purchased and arrange your army to try to start off on the right foot. From a tactical point of view therefore, as we had already had the opportunity to underline in the preview phase, Blackguards 2 offers a much deeper vision, also helped in this sense by a more transparent combat mechanics compared to the first episode. The consequences of what will happen when attacking or defending are much clearer; there was also a balance of units that limited the effectiveness of ranged ones that were overly powerful. In trying to improve some aspects of the former, it gets lost in a series of avoidable oversights with stylistic imperfections However, some defects continue to undermine the enjoyment of the title: first of all, the extreme slowness of the turns, in which the player is forced to wait for the characters controlled by the CPU to have finished their moves, makes us impatient; at first it would seem to be a minor defect which, however, gets worse due to the unfortunate choice not to immediately place all the enemies on the pitch, which in some maps continue to emerge like mushrooms. The number of opponents often and willingly surpasses that of the militias that the player can have and forces him in this way to often adopt pre-established tactics. In many cases it will happen to try the same level several times in an attempt to understand which series of moves to impart, almost as if a single mistake could compromise the success of an entire mission. Lowering the difficulty level can help in some circumstances, but in others the feeling that there is only one way to proceed is clearly felt and does not return pleasant sensations. To this we must then add other blunders that we sincerely would not have expected from a shrewd software house like Daedalic; above all the case in which the game did not stop with the death of a hero but let us continue until the end of the mission (therefore for several minutes) before warning us of the need to keep all the protagonists alive in order to complete with the map happened. There are other technical flaws that force you to restart the game for the most disparate reasons (the system crashes, you can't deploy your men, etc.): defects that we had already complained about in the trial version and that we would have hoped to see resolved in that intended for the general public. Certainly in Hamburg they do not sit idly by, given that a patch of almost 800 MB was made available one day after its release, but nevertheless the problems continued to occur with an annoying frequency. Technique and longevity The technical sector is the same as Blackguards: the Unity graphics engine, while not possessing the characteristics to make the mouth wide open, can be appreciated for a refined even if not always very defined style; in particular we felt the lack of more stringent anti-aliasing. The system requirements raise some concerns, which require components that are not exactly ~light~ for such graphics. Instead, praise should be given to the designers who have managed to characterize each scenario with unique decorative elements; the finishing work carried out also on the fighters which in the preliminary version seemed a bit too sloppy: a fleshing out of textures was enough to make them more pleasant and attractive. Nevertheless, a brand error (the choice to block the camera, whose movements are limited to the zoom) is heavily reflected on the game mechanics. Sometimes it can be difficult to reach the hexagon from which to activate traps or levers that are perhaps hidden by other elements of the landscape: much more attention should have been paid to the positioning of the ~hotpoints~, especially in relation to the ruthlessness of the opponents who struggle to forgive even one wrong move. On the audio front we find the usual good dubbing (in English and German): the addition of subtitles in different languages (including Italian) is commendable, which make the plot more enjoyable even for those who are not very familiar with Anglo-Saxon vernaculars. The soundtrack, on the other hand, does not shine: if on the one hand it cannot be denied that it acts as a good filler without ever getting boring,on the other, it cannot be overlooked that it is practically the same used in the first chapter of the saga. The permanence of Blackguards 2 in the hard disks is guaranteed by a campaign that requires more than twenty hours, to which further minutes must be added if you also want to face all the secondary missions: these are important values that do not weigh the lack of a multiplayer mode. The price at which it is offered,  29.99, is perhaps a little high, but in partial justification the software house has made available to all buyers the artbook, complete guide and soundtrack in digital format: truly a commendable gesture.", "date": "2015-01-27", "grade": "6.9"}
