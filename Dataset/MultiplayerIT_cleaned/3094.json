{"name": "Tales From Off-Peak City Vol. 1", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tales-from-off-peak-city-vol-1-recensione.html", "text": "It is not easy to start the review of Tales From Off-Peak City Vol. 1. It is not because you are immediately exposed to multiple risks. On the one hand, it can be trivialized, mercilessly reducing it to its mechanical nature of a simple graphic adventure with a surreal setting, on the other, one must be careful not to mythologize the passive creative fruition that it presupposes, transforming everything into an exercise in style with no outlets . Cosmo D, the author, is a particular developer, who is more interested in the expressive side of the video game than the purely playful one. He had already demonstrated it with The Norwood Suite and Off-Peak, of which Tales From Off-Peak City Vol. 1 is a direct sequel, and now he wanted to reiterate it by launching a real series of stories that take place in the small imaginary universe created by him. Gameplay A boat sails slowly towards the shores of a city that seems to have come out of a dream. There are three individuals above: two strange figures and the protagonist, whose point of view we will immediately assume. We don't know why we are there, we don't know where we come from and we don't even have a name. The two guys give us a mission that they say is of vital importance: to recover a saxophone belonging to an ex-musician who has decided to dedicate the rest of his life to making pizza. To help us, they give us a letter of reference and a drawing of the object to look for. While they're showing us what to do, the boat reaches a small pier that opens directly onto the road that leads to the pizzeria. Here begins the real adventure that will lead us to discover some of the secrets of this small and dreamlike corner of the world. Tales From Off-Peak City Vol. 1 is very easy to describe in terms of game mechanics. Basically, the player is limited to going in search of objects to use to solve the puzzles and ingredients for pizza. Yes, because once we've been hired we'll also have to work, cooking pizzas and delivering them to customers who request them. If you wish, you can buy an old camera, which is also simulated in its functions. So no electronic light meter, no image preview and no automatic settings. Shutter times and aperture must be managed manually and to know the result of the photo you must first shoot. On closer inspection it is the most realistic photographic mode among those experienced in a video game, although it is almost completely optional for the success of our mission. Setting What we realize from the first steps taken for July Avenue and Yam Street, the two streets that form the entire game world, is that the real protagonists are not us, but the place where we are. The city of Tales From Off-Peak City Vol. 1 seems to have come out of an avant-garde painting, it is so distant and at the same time present in this lost and decadent street corner. Exploring, one soon realizes that there is nothing realistic, between buildings occupied by cats that wag their tails at the windows in time with the music, sad buildings that can't wait to eat pizza, shop windows full of water in which sharks swim among the mannequins, a hotel housed in a parking lot and the wagon of a train that swings precariously under a bridge that divides us from the city itself. And yet, although there is not a single realistic element, Off-Peak turns out to be one of the most convincing cities we have visited in video games in recent years, there are so many images and references to what is a broader and cultural vision of space urban. It doesn't exist, but at the same time it is universal in its expressive deformity and in its continuous reference to something else. It's not something you know, but something you recognize, even if you don't quite know why. A piece of a song you heard on the radio. A frame from a film whose title you can't remember. Or a seemingly meaningless description of a book whose plot you don't remember, but of which you keep razor-sharp images. To be honest, Off-Peak has something uncanny in its surreal monumentality, suspended as it is between the Lynch of Strade Perdute and the Borges of the stories of the Aleph. It is music and noise, like the soundtrack that accompanies us throughout the entire adventure, and the characters who inhabit it end up appearing as part of the strange corner of the virtual world in which we spend just under two hours, before coming out with more questions than answers. History Despite the setting, Tales From Off-Peak City Vol. 1 tells a finished story in which life and death, passion for music and pizza, love and hate, as well as reality are intertwined and the virtual. The absurd characters that popolano Off-Peak end up being more interesting than it initially seems, thanks to well-written dialogues and in line with the staging and the situations that concern them. Just to name a few, we'll meet a street painter, some bully gangs, two strange guys with a big pot full of gigantic fish and a girl who prefers pizza to studying. Incidentally, to talk to someone just walk up and listen to what they have to say. Simple and direct. In case you get stuck, an aid system integrated into the adventure has also been thought of, which allows you to enjoy the succession of events without a hitch. Clearly Tales From Off-Peak City Vol. 1 is not and does not want to be for everyone. The problem is certainly not the difficulty, but precisely the vision of the video game it offers. Cosmo D is a title in which time is spent more observing and listening than doing. It invites detachment and contemplation rather than identification. For this reason we believe that it will leave indifferent all those who are looking for something more traditional and who are unable to conceive videogames outside certain reference models.
