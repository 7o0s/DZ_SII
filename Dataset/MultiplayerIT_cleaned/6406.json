The reference is clearly to Crossy Road, the Hipster Whale blockbuster, downloaded over fifty million times and capable of earning its authors something like ten million dollars, all net of a freemium setting with no particular constraints. Well, inspired by that experience, The Quest Keeper was born, a game that incorporates the cubed style and movement mechanisms of Crossy Road, but applying everything to a different context, that of dungeons to be explored in search of treasures. From the starting screen it is possible to interact with a wise old man and buy new adventures or new objects using the coins collected up to that moment, or leave for a standard mission aimed at collecting valuables. As mentioned, the gameplay is inspired by that of the title created by Hipster Whale, but making a series of important variations: the movement of the character is automatic and our task is to give him a direction, trying to avoid the many chasms present within each scenario, the spikes, the collapsing boxes, the fire, the streams and so on. This often results in quick front and side slides on the touch screen, which you can grip either by holding the device vertically or horizontally. When the road is formed by a single block that ~curves~ often, it goes without saying that the movements required are numerous and must also be quite rapid, which undoubtedly makes The Quest Keeper experience quite demanding, while remaining in the perspective of ~casual~ entertainment. The Quest Keeper departs from the graphic style and gameplay of Crossy Road to offer something different Always different What makes this title in many ways more complete and profound than Crossy Road are the quests, fueled by a coin collection system that works based on the distance travelled: the more we manage to go into a level, the closer we will get to a chest ~ virtual~, which once opened will cause many beautiful gold coins to fly into our pockets. With coins, as mentioned, you can buy new adventures and new objects, with the latter acting as upgrades with respect to certain threats, for example there are boots that allow you to walk on fire or to automatically lower closed grates, without therefore having to reach for the shift switch. However, the most prominent element are the quests, given that each of them corresponds to a different setting not only in appearance and colors, but also and above all in the prerogatives: there are those characterized by particularly impervious paths or those in which everything shakes and can collapse at any moment, those in which the traps have something extra and those in which we have to deal with different elements, for example assassin spiders ready to attack us. Considering the random generation of content, it is self-evident how this type of setting translates into virtually infinite and decidedly varied entertainment, which feeds itself thanks to the previously mentioned coin collection system, which makes the in-app purchases relatively superfluous. Just to remedy the shortcomings of a not particularly strong monetization, the developers of The Quest Keeper had to insert some banners and some advertising screens (removable by spending 1.99 euros, if desired), but nothing too invasive. However, watching short trailers can further contribute to the collection of virtual money. From a technical point of view, the influence of Crossy Road is evident but the atmosphere is quite different, given that dungeons are traditionally dark places, whose darkness is cut by the torch that the protagonist of the game holds, moving in various directions and occasionally pausing against a raised cube to catch his breath. The system is accompanied by convincing and perfectly timed music.", "date": "2015-04-18", "grade": "8.0"}
