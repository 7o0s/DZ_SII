It was therefore very unlikely that Ubisoft's bunnies didn't also jump on Xbox 360 with the arrival of Kinect, and indeed it seems almost strange that they took all this time. Raddibs: Off Screen is not only the first episode of the series not to be released on Nintendo consoles, but it is also the first designed to take full advantage of the potential of the new Microsoft device, a move that could bring new life to the brand and give owners of Kinect a party game as fun as it is politically incorrect. Mischievous rabbits In a very similar way to the recent Wii Party, in Off Screen the sense of progression is reduced to the bone: the vast majority of levels are in fact available from the beginning, allowing the player to immediately access the most interesting ones and leaving him the possibility of unlocking some variants and various side extras. Created thanks to the collaboration of the Ubisoft teams in France and Italy, this new appointment with the Rabbids offers a whole series of mini-games designed to be enjoyed by two to four players. Of course, in the absence of a few friends it is possible to play a wide selection of challenges alone, but it is only in the cackling in company and hindering the other participants that the game really makes sense, managing among other things to entertain thanks to the irreverence of the protagonists. Strengthened by the potential of Kinect, the developers have tried to exploit the peripheral to offer mini-games based on the concept of augmented reality, projecting many challenges directly into our small rooms and living rooms. In one of these, the participants have to move back and forth to reach and crush the numerous rabbits that emerge from the floor of the room with their feet, while in another, to say the least, hilarious, instead, they have to rotate their heads to throw a huge drop of mucus. Or again, one level asks you to lick cake off a rabbit's face, or use the Kinect microphone to get its attention in an obstacle course. Unfortunately, there is no shortage of more trivial and less fun mini-games, in which perhaps you simply have to run on the spot or wave your arms at random, where the minimum or maximum limit of players required often ends up reducing the number of challenges accessible to each occasion. It is a pity that some of the games on offer are so inferior in ingenuity and execution that they give the impression of having been included only to make up the numbers. We also noticed some problems in input detection and on-screen response, more or less slow depending on the type of minigame you are facing. Yet despite its many flaws, there's little doubt that, thanks to the originality of several challenges, the bizarre way in which the developers have exploited the technology at their disposal, and the lack of really strong competitors, Rabbids: Off Screen represents to date one of the funnest and most successful party-games in the entire Kinect offer. As already mentioned, the progression within the game is limited to a few levels to unlock and, above all, to a series of gadgets that can be purchased by spending the credits accumulated by playing. These range from funny headdresses to large cows, and are mostly used within a special leisure mode, a real pastime in which to freely decide how to torture and prick an unfortunate rabbit.", "date": "2011-11-03", "grade": null}
