Maybe you decide to go to a renowned restaurant to eat fish with your family and the next day you find yourself throwing up your soul too because the fish wasn't really fresh, or you take a spaceship and end up on an alien planet, unfortunately crashing on it . There is life in the universe and apparently it wants to eat us. These are things that happen, but which can have more than positive implications, as we will see in the review of Stranded: Alien Dawn, a survival that proved to be more interesting than expected. emergent narrative In the beginning, resources are scarce Yes it's true, we ended up on an alien world and we had to face many difficulties to be able to survive. We studied the local fauna and flora, learned about the resources available and sourced new ones. We hunted strange animals and cultivated strange plants, ate everything without asking too many questions and all the while we continued to collect wood and other materials from whatever sources we had on hand. At the beginning we sheltered under canopies built with the wreckage of the spaceship with which we had crashed on this luxuriant and hostile planet. Then we built our first house, which gradually became a villa overlooking Lake Duria, so called by listening to the echoes of primordial creatures in our heads. It's true, we were attacked by dozens of aliens (and if, in this case, the aliens were us?), some of the simple little dangerous insects, others twice as big as us who couldn't wait to taste terrestrial meat. We have never been found unprepared. At the beginning we fought holding spears built with makeshift materials, like primitives, then we erected wooden fences attracting the enemies towards our defenses with a careful study of the base, then we developed impenetrable defensive systems, including automatic turrets, flamethrowers, traps, motion sensors and so on, up to driving real fully armed mechs. In the meantime we have equipped ourselves with every comfort. So if you really have to die on an unknown planet it is better to do it with air conditioning, powered by solar or wind energy, than to let yourself go to despair. Sure, life wasn't easy and soon the flaws in the group started to surface, creating quite a few problems. In any case, the excellent work done has saved us from moments of depression, from pacifism, from the aches and pains of age and from many other psychological and physical problems that have emerged as the days go by. If we're still here after all this, there must be a reason. In Stranded: Alien Dawn you survive, but you also thrive In Stranded: Alien Dawn, there are good aliens and some that aren't If you haven't figured it out, Stranded: Alien Dawn is a single-player management survival that focuses heavily on the emergent narrative created by its game systems. In a broad sense it looks a lot towards Dwarf Fortress, even without touching its complexity, but also towards real-time strategy and life simulation  la The Sims, even though each system is contextualized to the scenario. At the beginning of each game you have to choose the planet to play on, the type of outpost you want to build, the resources available and the identity of the survivors who will form our group of four or more people, accepting the automatic random selection made from the game, or directly choosing who to bring by first examining their characteristics to better weigh if they can be useful to us or not. The scenarios deserve a separate word because they are very different from each other. In one you have to build a real military outpost, in another a commercial one with the aim of accumulating enough money to buy the entire planet. The balloon can be used to search for resources over long distances It must be said that we all preferred the standard scenario, the one whose main objective is to stay alive, because it is in many ways more interesting and open than the others, which aim more at group specialization. But let's get right back to our unfortunate heroes. Every survivor is more versed in certain activities than others. For example, you can choose someone who is a kind of master in combat, or a scientist capable of observing the surrounding environment faster, or even a skilled craftsman. With time and use the skills improve, but it's best to leave it alone at first. Of course there are flaws and during the game problems may emerge related, for example, to the ease with which one of the abovev experienced depression, or lack of adequate recreational activities. Each character trait of a character can create different and in their own way interesting game situations. Too bad that the ability to create custom survivors is completely missing. Be that as it may, once our team is formed, it's time to crash it with your spaceship, then start looking around. Decorate the grave To die yes, but in a well-appointed environment Stranded: Alien Dawn is a game that thrives on a continuous crescendo in the collection of resources, which goes hand in hand with the increase in the aggressiveness of the local fauna. At the beginning we have to collect material from the carcass of our spaceship, in the meantime we have to look around to see where the most interesting resources are, to be taken immediately or at a later time, that is, when the right technologies with which to use them will be available. There are so many things to do and the game leaves us quite free to proceed as we wish, a freedom that increases as the hours go by, that is, when the phase of finding means of subsistence has been overcome and adequate resources are available. When you realize that you can use everything, it is also the moment in which the gameplay opens up to the choices of the player, who must start designing his base taking into due consideration the productive, recreational and defensive aspects. In this sense, the possibilities offered by the title of Haemimont Games are really many and it doesn't even make too much sense to list them all. Did we already tell you that in Stranded: Alien Dawn you can make many different types of bases? The only problem is to get familiar with the interface, not exactly immediate in some moments overloaded as it is by dozens of functions for each activity, with the micromanagement that turns out to be decidedly deep and satisfying in the long run. So you not only have to choose what to build, but also assign priorities to individuals based on their skills, establish relaxation shifts so they don't go crazy, manage their requests so they don't make them do the jobs they hate the most and so on . With technological development, other aspects to manage also take over, such as the passage of the electric line, or the addressing of the collected resources. On paper you can do everything with a couple of clicks, but there is no doubt that at the beginning you can be a little dazed. Fortunately there is a rich tutorial that explains the basics of the game, so as not to get lost in the face of the first difficulty. Until the end Farming is essential if you are to survive The livable situations in Stranded: Alien Dawn are really many, as well as the dangers to face, which are not limited to the aforementioned aliens, but also to sudden and destructive hurricanes, diseases to be treated, conflicts between the characters themselves and the omnipresent lack of materials. To counterbalance there are more relaxed moments, such as weddings or darts competitions or the pleasant behaviors that can arise within the group. In some cases, particularly in combat, it is possible to take direct control of the characters, bringing the experience closer to that of a real-time strategy game, albeit with many more limitations. Be that as it may, in the end you have so many turrets and defensive means that it almost feels like playing tower defense. This all works really well, like the fact that the scenarios have an end. Of course, you can build as much as you want, but at some point you will have to develop the final technologies that will allow you to successfully end the game, such as interstellar communicators useful for calling for help. Staggering too long is not recommended, because the hostile activities of the aliens are becoming more and more intense and dangerous, ending up killing many of the survivors... unless you have selected the pacifist mode in which all the aliens become harmless and you can build in peace. The problems of Stranded: Alien Dawn The characters are all different, too bad they are not customizable Everything perfect, then? Actually Stranded: Alien Dawn has some problems. Meanwhile, it does not favor exploration much, in the sense that the possibility of producing resources independently after having studied them and having prepared the necessary structures, makes it unnecessary to wander around and you can concentrate on the area that has been occupied. Given the sizable size of the procedurally generated maps on offer in the game, we would have liked some incentive to explore. Also from a technical point of view we would have expected something slightly better. In this sense Stranded: Alien Dawn makes its mark, but visually it is too anonymous and standardized to haveand something to say. It works and doesn't require a NASA PC to run, but that's about it. The same goes for the music, made up of simple ambient pieces that soon come to us. Too bad, because if these aspects of the game had been cared for more, it would have really been an absolute masterpiece. As it stands it's just a great game. That's not a small thing these days.", "date": "2023-04-29", "grade": "8.5"}
