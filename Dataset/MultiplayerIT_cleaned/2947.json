In fact, we are talking about the authors of two excellent titles such as Oxenfree and Afterparty, this time grappling with the sci-fi atmospheres of a story set in space, characterized by a much more essential graphic style than usual. However, the mechanics to which the team of Californian development has accustomed us, with gameplay reduced to a minimum, which acts as a mere accessory to allow us to proceed in the plot and get to know the funny characters who populate it, while aboard our spaceship we fly from station to station to complete a complex mission how unexpected. History As mentioned, the great protagonist of Next Stop Nowhere is the story, or rather the screenplay: the dialogues between the characters are brilliant, the situations put into play are fresh and fun, and a system of choices allows us to somehow influence the course of events. The protagonist of the adventure, a corpulent space courier named Beckett, runs into the charming former bounty hunter Serra by chance and decides to help her when the latter finds herself being hunted by the galactic rangers. trouble, ending up on the wanted list, and no one knows where he went. Eager to help our new friend, even though suddenly catapulted into this situation, we will try to follow the boy's tracks and get in touch with his old friends, risking however becoming criminals ourselves. All in the context of a campaign that will accompany us for something like four hours: a slightly shorter duration than the team's previous titles, but still sufficient. Gameplay Substantially functional to the plot, the gameplay of the new Night School Studio title does not offer particular challenges or complex mechanics, rather limiting itself to accompanying us on the adventure and providing us with some pastimes to kill boredom. The list includes the tasks to be performed inside Beckett's spaceship, managed by a nice artificial intelligence, a series of very simple environmental puzzles and the direct control of the spaceship in certain sequences, when for example you find yourself being chased or you have to avoid the dangerous obstacles of an asteroid field. It is possible to play using touch controls or a Bluetooth controller, but surprisingly the second option is the best one here too. In fact, touching the screen manages the character indirectly, showing him the places to move, while with the joypad he can be moved directly using the analog stick and act on the main buttons when a possible interaction or narrative choice appears. fulfill. Technical realization The graphic style of Next Stop Nowhere appears much more essential and cartoonish compared to the aforementioned Oxenfree and Afterparty, with an almost low poly approach to the characters and settings, although certain visual solutions (see the connotation of the dialogues) refer to the previous projects of the team. In any case, the style is immediately very pleasant and almost winks at The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, which obviously represents a plus for fans of the Nintendo series. The audio sector, in any case, is not less: the soundtrack is essential and is limited to being heard on some occasions, but we really liked the dialogues in English (subtitled in Italian), they are interpreted really well and help to create a bond with the protagonists of the story. Moreover, they are played in a cheeky and rapid way, without weighing down game sessions that could perhaps take place on the move.", "date": "2020-08-21", "grade": "8.0"}
