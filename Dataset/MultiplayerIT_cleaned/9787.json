Soon reality bends before his eyes, distorting space and practically creating a passage to a different place, where the guards and nurses are replaced by creepy and evil creatures. An interesting incipit for the new Renegade Kid product, which repeatedly mentions the best Silent Hill episodes and tries in particular to put the player within a similar context, in a sick atmosphere that hides lies and truths under a carpet made of death. Doctors say they locked us up after we brutally murdered our wife, but is that the truth? And are the voices crowding our heads just another way to confuse us? We will find out through five long chapters, set not only in the aforementioned asylum but also outside, in a desperate race to save the only thing that still binds us to this world: the family. Senile dementia The first Dementium certainly stood out for the genre it belongs to (it's not an everyday thing to see a survival horror for Nintendo DS), for the efficiency of the graphics engine and for a series of ideas concerning the use of light in dark environments. Among the weak points of the game were a less than perfect direction (therefore was reached too soon, without first building the necessary atmosphere) and a less than convincing monster design. Find the full review here. For this sequel, the developers have made great strides, primarily from the point of view of the plot and the direction. William, the character we control, resorts to the distortion of reality to get out of his cell and find an escape route from the asylum, given that just like in Silent Hill the two parallel environments are delimited by different margins: if on one side there are doors locked with a key, for example, on the other we find simple planks nailed together, which can be destroyed with a few hammer blows. The transition from one dimension to another is handled skilfully, in a crescendo which, as in the most classic horror films, starts from an assumption of normality and then flows into the absurd. The voices of our mysterious antagonist, spoken entirely in Italian (and the dubbing appears well done, with a good level of interpretation), sometimes guide us towards the objective of the moment or in any case encourage us to accept a specific challenge. In this regard, right from the start there is a clear improvement in the design of the monsters, which while not being ~scary~ (evidently this requires much more complex polygonal models than those a DS can handle) manage to play their role in convincing manner, with a fair variety and precise attack and movement patterns, which you need to memorize in order to successfully carry out your offensive. The best of both worlds William moves to two different planes of reality, but always finds threats waiting for him. To defend himself he can use the various weapons collected around: from the knife to the hammer, from the pistol to the rifle. The control system hasn't changed since Dementium: The Ward, and still works quite well: the d-pad moves the character on the four axes, the stylus on the touch screen controls his view (and therefore also the aiming reticle) while the left back button activates the equipped weapon. This is a widely tested configuration on Nintendo DS, which proves to be effective but which in the long run tends to tire the hand holding the console a lot, also and above all due to the simultaneous use of the d-pad and the back button. If the controls have not changed, the same cannot be said of the completely revolutionized graphic interface: the vital energy of the character is represented on the touch screen by a bar instead of a heart diagram, in which place we find a convenient map of area, which shows us the places we have already visited, the save points and any doors waiting to be opened. The two icons on the right side of the screen are used to crouch and jump, with the latter action which can also be performed via a double tap with the stylus. Inventory management has been changed but remains simple and intuitive, with the most important items always at hand. Moving on to a purely technical discourse, the excellent graphics engine of the first episode confirms with Dementium II all its power and versatility, guaranteeing sixty frames per second without uncertainties even during the most complicated situations. As already mentioned, an excellent job has been done as regards concernor the creation of the monsters, and also the scenarios boast a good design and a good level of detail.", "date": "2010-09-24", "grade": "7.8"}
