There are those who have not digested well this God of War-style recovery of one of the most loved brands in the history of video games, and those who have instead let themselves be enchanted by its new story and its incredible atmospheres. De gustibus non disputandum est, of course, but it would be unfair to deny the Spanish developer the courage and skill with which he managed to reinvigorate a Castlevania that in recent years hadn't said much, relegated to punctual portable apparitions trying to return to glories of that unforgettable Symphony of the Night of '97, without ever fully succeeding. The problem with Mirror of Fate, perhaps, is precisely this: for the first appearance of the brand on Nintendo 3DS, Mercury Steam attempted a courageous combination between the gameplay of Lords of Shadow and the structure of Koji Igarashi's Castlevania, the notorious ~metroidvania ~. During the review we have explored its strengths and weaknesses, and now we are back to playing the HD port developed for home consoles as an appetizer to the official sequel which will be released in a few months. A mere commercial operation, or is there more? Generations compared There are two ways to play Mirror of Fate HD: the first consists in simply buying it as a digital download on PlayStation Network or Xbox Live, stand alone; alternatively, a Mirror of Fate HD download code is included in the Castlevania: Lords of Shadow Collection package, which also includes the first Castlevania: Lords of Shadow and its two DLCs, Reverie and Resurrection, as well as a playable demo of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2. It is a prestigious package with a very low price, which opens the doors to the upcoming sequel. The decision to include Mirror of Fate HD in the compilation shouldn't seem strange: the game developed by Mercury Steam for Nintendo 3DS is not a mere spin-off, but a crucial chapter in the Lords of Shadow saga and the real prequel to the second episode. A few months ago we would have told you to skip this paragraph, in case you have not yet played the first Lords of Shadow, but due to the media bombardment carried out by advertising and trailers by now even the stones should know that at the end of that adventure it was precisely the protagonist, the heroic and tormented Gabriel Belmont, who transformed into Dracula. In Mirror of Fate HD, therefore, we take control of Simon Belmont, a young warrior eager to avenge the deaths of his parents Trevor and Sypha, killed by the forces of Dracula. The pretext takes us directly to the dark lord's castle, where we will come across a sort of spirit guide and a mysterious ~guardian angel~ who helps us behind the scenes. The first act of the story is not very interesting, but the plot is divided into three chapters, each characterized by a different protagonist: the second act sees us control Alucard, the good vampire that Mercury Steam has managed to integrate without falling into fanservice vulgar, and the third puts us in the shoes of Trevor Belmont, Simon's father, in a sort of complicated flashback. The thread of destiny that binds these three heroes is decidedly particular, and unfortunately the screenplay, characterized by sporadic cel-shaded kinematics that look like cartoon sequences with a rather singular appearance, cannot handle its complexity, offering a hasty and final resolution few answers to the questions raised during the exploration of the castle. In short, Mirror of Fate HD takes us directly to Lords of Shadow 2, where Alucard and Dracula will face off once again for much higher stakes than simple revenge. A port recommended for those who have not played the Nintendo 3DS version and are waiting for Lords of Shadow 2 Playstation 3 trophies There are twenty Trophies in Mirror of Fate HD, divided into 19 bronze trophies and a single silver trophy. Most are unlocked simply by progressing through the adventure, but some could give you a hard time, such as the one that requires killing a thousand enemies or the silver trophy obtainable by finishing the game on maximum difficulty and without help. Porting of Destiny We were saying that Mercury Steam has attempted the hybrid path, projecting the combat system designed for Lords of Shadow into a metroidvania-like structure, in turn strongly inspired by action adventures such as God of War. The idea works, but not quite. The combat system actually does its job, and offers the player a wide variety of combos that mix jumps, direct attacks and area attacks: just two or three keys are enough toperform the various attacks, jumping and on the ground, which are unlocked by accumulating experience and leveling up by defeating enemies or recovering some more or less well hidden objects. The part that works less is the level design, a pale imitation of Igarashi's metroidvania which offers a minimum of backtracking stuck in an absolutely linear progression. In Dracula's castle there is a lot to do, mind you: jumping, climbing, acquiring new powers and weapons, defeating many different enemies and bosses... all the ambaradan. The problem, if anything, is that the fights tend to be too similar to each other and punctuated by various ~quick time events~, fortunately fewer than in the Nintendo 3DS version, and the action is only occasionally alternated with sometimes ingenious environmental puzzles but often too simple. The pace is fluctuating, the optional weapons and spells are almost never used, and even the differences between the three heroes are absolutely minimal: some animation changes, yes, but Simon, Alucard and Trevor fight in exactly the same way, they use the same weapon - the whip - and enjoy essentially the same abilities. In short, one has the feeling of playing the same character from start to finish. The fluctuating level design is framed, fortunately, by a technical sector that was already remarkable on Nintendo 3DS and that on PlayStation 3 is embellished with significant improvements, such as for example the speed of loading of the various areas, much faster if compared to expectations sometimes exhausting with the Nintendo laptop in hand. The inconsistent frame rate is just a distant memory and the game now flows much more smoothly and pleasantly; moreover, the transition to high resolution has limited the aliasing present in the portable version of the big N, allowing us to fully enjoy the inspiration of the Mercury Steam guys, in which they were able to make an otherwise interesting and engaging setting quite obvious thanks to clever framing games and a commendable attention to detail and the general atmosphere. However, it must be remembered that Mirror of Fate HD was designed for Nintendo 3DS, so it is normal to be faced with a modest polygon count and qualitatively fluctuating textures. In any case, Mirror of Fate HD is a very pleasant visual spectacle, supported by a high quality soundtrack and sporadic but sufficient dubbing.", "date": "2013-11-07", "grade": "7.5"}
