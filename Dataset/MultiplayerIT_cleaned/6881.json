Read the article to find out more). We were amazed by a well thought out interface, very modern in appearance, but still in keeping with the fantasy setting. We were also struck by how, while almost entirely marrying the Civilization model, it managed to offer fresh gameplay by focusing more on some elements and leaving others more on the surface. In fact, to describe the work of AMPLITUDE Studios, published in the final version after several months of Early Access on Steam, it is enough to talk about a Civilization with more combat, more exploration and less city management. A fight scene We start by setting the classic parameters for generating the map, i.e. the conformation of the emerged areas, the size of the world, the climate and so on. In addition to the competition, there are options dedicated to the management of the morphology of the territory, to determine the greater or lesser irregularity of the coasts and the height of the individual hexagonal boxes. Let's explain this last aspect. We are normally used to maps in which some squares are passable by units, perhaps with bonuses and maluses to movements, with the use of boats and so on, while others are not. In Endless Legend each square has its own height and, in addition to slowing down or blocking a unit, it can also influence its exploration. For example, it may happen that canyons have formed that allow you to move only in two directions, or some boxes may be placed so low as to prevent you from reaching them directly. We will talk in another paragraph about how the morphology of the territory influences combat, in the meantime let's limit ourselves to noting that it makes exploration more varied and the map more beautiful, as can be easily verified from the images accompanying the article. Endless Legend is an excellent 4X strategy game, which we reviewed one turn at a time Morphology Choosing the faction and generating a map, we need to find the place to found our first city. This is a very important decision, because, unlike in other titles, the margins for improvement of a city founded on a territory with few resources are really scarce. Let's say that it can happen, not even too rarely, that we have to restart the game because we have landed in the driest territory of the globe, with little food, little money and little production of raw materials for buildings and troops. A piece of the map seen from above In such cases, a few turns are enough to understand the progress of the game. If you don't see quick ways out, it's better to start over, because the first few turns are crucial to start assembling an army of basic troops to start exploring and conquering the villages scattered around the map. Calculate that the game world is divided into regions and that only one city can be built in each region. Being able to produce settlers after many turns, without first having reclaimed the territory to build on, means risking seeing them slaughtered by roaming enemy hordes, with more time wasted. Unfortunately, having to look for a good start in order to move forward is a bit of a limitation, especially in multiplayer, where bad luck can translate into a desperate game. 4X gameplay In short, we founded a city and put the first buildings and troops into production. The map is very beautiful, even just to look at We have also started the first technological research, choosing it not from a sequential tree diagram, but from a radial one, which allows us to study all the technologies of the eras reached (the eras following the first are unlocked for every certain number of technologies discovered). It's time to explore! We move our troops and find abandoned ruins. Entering it we receive sand (the game currency) and the first quest. We need to find four more ruins. Turns pass, and as we continue the treasure hunt, we raid more ruins and cross paths with some indigenous tribes (each region has its own). Not having developed the knowledge of local languages, which would allow us to reach agreements in the form of side quests to be carried out or actual corruption, we can only fight each other. And here comes the best and most innovative feature of Endless Legend, that is, the one that clearly distinguishes it from the competition. Endless Legend completely in Italian There is also a completely Italian version of Endless Legend, translated by Adventure Productions and available in a retail edition. You can purchase it hassle-free from Multiplayer.com, at an additional pricelower reading than the digital editions. The combat system AMPLITUDE Studios has chosen a path of its own on the fights, taking some risks, but overall doing an excellent job. In Endless Legend, when two or more armies face each other, the individual troops of which they are composed are arranged on the battlefield, derived from the morphology of the areas on which they are located, and the clash immediately begins. First the player must decide whether to pursue an aggressive tactic, defensive or stand completely still. At the same time he must place units on the map. So you have to choose the target of each unit, taking into consideration a number of factors of paramount importance. For example, the height of the squares can create advantageous positions for long-range units, such as archers, which will be more difficult to reach and will have less impediments to hitting. In some cases it is necessary to avoid the crowding of troops, because the enemies are equipped with area attacks. In others you have to play on the slowness of your opponents, even if they are very powerful, if you don't want to be swept away by a couple of well-aimed blows. Those beasts are strong but very slow Obviously, the further you progress in the game, the more technologies are developed that allow you to unlock more capable units, sometimes equipped with special powers such as wings that allow them to fly, or armor that makes them very resistant and so on. The conduct of the fights is automatic, in the sense that the player limits himself to directing his army, which still maintains a certain margin of autonomy. For example, a troop that finds itself with a target killed by others will autonomously choose the alternative to hit. The system, more complex than the automatic one of a Civilization, but much more agile than that of an Age of Wonders, soon proves to be a major strength of the entire production. Unlike in other 4Xs, in Endless Legend the fights do not tire, except when the imbalance of the forces in the field is evident (in these cases, however, automatic resolution can be used). The imbalances reported in the trial, which we mentioned at the beginning of the article, have disappeared and now all units have their usefulness. Many factors influence the outcome of a battle, such as the level of the troops and the hero or the latter's equipment, which can be improved by unlocking technologies and finding resources. In short, we are sure that true strategic enthusiasts will find it at least interesting to experiment with, and maybe they will end up falling in love with it.", "date": "2014-10-01", "grade": "8.5"}
