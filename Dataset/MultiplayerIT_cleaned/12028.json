{"name": "Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tony-hawks-downhill-jam-recensione-2.html", "text": "Route change It would be an understatement to say that with Downhill Jam the developers of Activision wanted to make Tony Hawk's series easier and more accessible. In fact, reality is not reduced to a reasoning of this type: the game was designed for Wii, moreover in the early stages of life of the new Nintendo console, with the peculiarities of the Wii-mote still to be discovered. And so Downhill Jam presented a control system dependent on the player's movements, but had to compromise to do so, greatly reducing the complexity of the acrobatic maneuvers as well as the overall difficulty of the racing. All of this was not rethought on the occasion of the release of the PS2 version, and so we are faced with a chapter in the series that is very... accessible, simplified and suitable for younger players as well as those approaching the product for the first time activision. Suffice it to say that to perform even the most complex tricks, all you need is a simple push of a button while in the air, with a few simple combinations of the left analog stick. The game ~Simplicity~ seems to be the watchword also with regard to the variety of game modes, which are limited to single ~career~ or online multiplayer. Once you have selected a character from those available (the only real one is Tony Hawk, the others have been created for the occasion), you go through a quick tutorial and then launch yourself onto the track through a series of different types of events, with different objectives depending on the occasion. Generally, the aim is to finish first, earning experience points useful for unlocking subsequent courses, making the character ~grow~ and obtaining new skateboards (each characterized by specific characteristics) as well as new clothes. The developers have seen fit to ~break up~ the tracks, allowing us to see only a part of them and mixing all these segments in the various races to give the illusion of a much larger number of tracks. And the system works quite well, in the sense that you enter the mechanics of scoring and leveling up, so much so that the first few games manage to excite you more than anything else for the ease with which you ring first positions and with which you unlock the extras. Technical realization As anticipated, the PS2 version of Downhill Jam does not present significant differences compared to what was seen on the Wii. The graphics engine manages to guarantee good speed and moments of great fluidity, which unfortunately are sometimes lost when the situation becomes more intricate. In reality, the fluid movement of the polygons is due mostly to the lack of a high level of detail, and so the locations appear quite rich in content but decidedly poor in detail, giving a certain ~raw~ flavor to the sector. The filmed sequences do not help, which in this case are extremely repetitive (you always see the same things, roughly) and poor in quality. As for the sound, we have the usual sequence of signed songs that never hurt but are less valid than what has already been seen in previous episodes of the series. And a good quality Italian dubbing, well acted and which certainly represents an added value to be taken into consideration. Comment We are faced with a controversial product, which on the one hand is more accessible to an audience of younger players and ~casual gamers~, on the other hand loses the facets and complexity achieved by the Tony Hawk's series in many years of experimentation . Experimentation sometimes successful and sometimes not, but always aimed at obtaining a more refined and spectacular product, things that Downhill Jam certainly does not pretend to be. Technically discreet and equipped with the now inevitable online multiplayer mode, the new Activision title will probably disappoint those who expected a new step forward for the series. Pros: Nice and well-made characters Immediate Quite long-lived Cons: Too simple compared to previous episodes Graphics not always up to par Repetitive It's been a while now since the release of the latest installment in the Tony Hawk's series, which was part of the Wii launch lineup. In that capacity, the game presented a control system based on motion detection, making full use of the capabilities of the Wii-mote to obtain an experience that was at least original. Now the same title has been converted for PlayStation2, without any major technical changes but with a decidedly more classic and conventional control system.", "date": "2007-09-06", "grade": null}
