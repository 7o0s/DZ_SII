{"name": "Il buio uccide", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/108497-closure-il-buio-uccide.html", "text": "Psychoanalysis should be interested in the indie video game scene. Obsession with spiders, fetishes, excrement, murders, suicides, asylums, children locked up in a basement are recurring themes in these works that oscillate between the graceful and the gloomy. Either they are very colorful and frivolous games or they are dark and distressing. And darkness often plays a key role. In the case of Closure it becomes an integral part of the brilliant gameplay tested by Eyebrow Interactive on Newgrounds, later developed for the Playstation Network and finally landed on PC. Despite the artistic cut of the drawings, it is in fact the creativity of the gameplay that won Closure the Grand Prize of the Indie Game Challenge 2012. Let's see why. There are three worlds with 24 levels in each and ten extra levels. Enough to haunt you for a long time. The idea is simple: dark portions of the screen are blank. If we step on it we fall and if the fall is such that we leave the screen, the game ends and the level starts again. To open a path we have to light the way by manipulating spotlights, luminous globes and automatic mechanisms. It doesn't matter if there's a platform in one place, it has to be visible for it to exist - better to tell the parents who turn on the light in front of their young children to demonstrate that where they imagined a monster there is only a wardrobe. The purpose of this ingenious play of lights is to reach the exit door, sometimes carrying the key with you to open the lock, sometimes activating luminous blossoms, depending on the world we are in. Simple, isn't it? And also intriguing. If a wall blocks the path, it is sufficient to leave a light point nearby to illuminate only the lower portion of the wall, so we can jump on it and use it as a support base. Even water ceases to be real if we deprive it of a source of light. There is something reminiscent of quantum physics here, the world doesn't exist if nobody asks it about it. Complicated to explain but easy to master once you play. And now that you know all about the basics, follow along and we'll shed light on the rest as well. Photons and neurons Closure requires rigorous planning. Improvising is useless, because a wrong passage or a distraction - such as pressing the jump button instead of the action button - is enough to see a key or a globe of light, or the character himself, fall into oblivion. And then off with the R key (reset) to start over. Once understood, the levels are short, but the very nature of the game generates fatal inaccuracies that feed the cycle of frustration. It's not drama, just a lack of cleanliness that a puzzle game shouldn't indulge in. If you ask a player to give his all in finding a solution to a problem, then you have to give him perfect tools to verify if his hypothesis is valid or not. Punishing him repeatedly for inaccuracies in the structure is incorrect. That said, Closure does its best to lighten the load. All three main worlds are accessible immediately and at least for the first and second it is easy to burn five or six levels in a row without worries. Then things get difficult, but the game prepares us step by step for each new complication. Let's be clear: there are times when it is necessary to squeeze the neurons, and few will finish the game collecting all the hidden moths in the meantime, but each complication is preceded by a couple of preparatory levels. So when the difficulty curve becomes steep, we can always say that we got there step by step. On the other hand, the reward is highly desirable: who doesn't want to feel intelligent? And Closure makes us feel like damn geniuses every time we win a challenge. The art of getting by Between surges in self-esteem, wonder at the original manipulation of the world and some obvious flaws, it's impossible to ignore the contribution that music and drawings give to Closure's success. Although the dazzling underlying idea is already pure art in itself, the personality of the game owes a lot to the sparse and cold illustrations, accompanied by soundtracks between noir and the dark, a happy union of elements that spreads a veil of mystery over closures. Also because the three characters that our ragnesco protagonist impersonates don't weave any noteworthy narrative. In fact, it is good to get involved in the atmosphere of the game without asking yourself too many questions. It is also impressive how much of the time we spend in the dark, while only rare flashes of light give us a complete and sudden view of the backgrounds. However, it is the whole that leaves its mark, rather than the individual elements. In fact, the drawings have a style already seen and do not offer new interpretationsof the circus, of the dark girl grappling with a hostile nature or, in the case of the first character, of the mechanical universe typical of many video games (don't ask us what it is exactly, we only know that the guy in question is wearing a miner's helmet and wanders between scaffolding and bolts and then escapes by helicopter). Only the music that suddenly slows down and distorts when we go underwater gets a noteworthy effect that makes us remember his presence, otherwise relegated to a carpet of notes in the background of the game. Gameplay, music and designs therefore support each other and overall overcome the individual shortcomings, which are just youth flaws. Let's give Eyebrow Interactive time and they will certainly be able to make the leap in quality to compete with the big ones. In the meantime, don't miss this game, if you want to be captivated by a brilliant puzzle game that will keep your mind busy for many hours even while you are doing other things.", "date": "2012-09-20", "grade": "7.9"}
