{"name": "Fur Fighters: Viggo's Revenge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fur-fighters-viggos-revenge.html", "text": "And here you enter the scene The game presents itself as a mixture of action, platform and shooter, but has some peculiarities that distinguish it from the crowd, including the stark contrast between the violence present in the game and the way it is represented on the screen. Let's see them in more detail. Once you have chosen your alter ego from the six available pets, you will begin with an (optional) mini training course held by a funny ghost walrus and a zebra who is an expert in fighting techniques. This first level will help you become familiar with the controls and to assimilate the main feature of the game, which is the possibility of impersonating each of the six Fur Fighters. In some points of the game areas you will find teleporters that will allow you to take control of the teddy bear depicted on the teleporter itself, allowing you to take advantage of the new characteristics and abilities of each character. At this point it seems right to me to get to know the six protagonists starting with the dog Rufus, the tough guy in the situation; then there is Juliette, the martial arts expert kitten able to climb some walls (marked with cat footprints), followed by Bungalow the kangaroo able to reach high platforms with his leaps and Rico, a kind of penguin able to move underwater; finally there are Chang, a raccoon who can slip into the tightest spaces and Tweek, a fire-breathing ferry capable of gliding by means of its small wings. The game mechanic continually makes use of the possibility of ~switching~ between the various characters and choosing the right member of the team proves to be essential if you want to get to the end. And yes, in addition to shooting enemies using one of the twenty weapons available (some of them really curious like the cow launcher!) and jumping onto some platforms, you will also have to figure out which character is the most suitable for overcoming certain situations: in fact, the game that each puppy should only be released by its parent. In truth, I would have liked more freedom of action since the game has no alternative routes to get to your destination. However the levels are well designed and the puzzles complicated to the right point; for example in the first level there will be a pelican that will not allow you to use a fundamental lift to access the following areas. How to do? Just take control of the cat and climb on the clock hands by moving them; at this point the pelican will believe that the end of his turn has arrived and will go away, freeing the passage. Puzzles of this type are quite frequent in the game but I don't want to reveal more so as not to spoil the surprise. There is no shortage of variety and the desire to move forward will never leave you, add enemies with a minimum of A.I. which allows them to hide and try to dodge shots (although they will usually come at you with guns blazing) and you'll get an idea of what the game has to offer. And if you are tired of playing alone you can challenge three other friends in multiplayer mode, a very fun blasting section in which to fragga the other players as in the more classic FPS (If you've seen Quake 3 you know what I'm talking about) in some specially designed arenas. So far I've only been able to test the two-player mode, and it turned out to be satisfying despite the inevitable loss of detail to keep the frame rate constant. I don't think that in four the situation can get worse. Longevity is ensured by the thirty levels divided into six worlds and by the numerous subgames that you will find scattered here and there. Technician's corner On a technical level Fur Fighters defends himself quite well. The particular style adopted for the characters and backdrops immediately catches the eye, with the former represented in 2D-like form through the use of the increasingly appreciated ~cell shading~ and the latter characterized by the particular chromatic choice that makes everything look like a sort of cardboard interactive animated. In truth, there is a fairly limited use of polygons (perhaps a legacy of the Dreamcast version, more stingy with polygons than the PS2), and also textures that are not excellently made (in truth, some would not ~look out of place~ on PSone!). For the rest, the fluidity is good and there are no major defects such as pop-up or excessive fogging. The animations of the various characters are hilarious, but those of the enemies are no less, even if the variety leaves something to be desired. The cutscenes aren't great as they're made with the same engine as the game but they help immerse the player in the story and often provide clues to the game. same discbear on special effects, well done but with ups and downs; We particularly appreciate the smoke from the rockets used by the puppies when they are released and the padding that comes out of the enemies instead of blood when they are hit. Different story for water, normally rendered very well, but very ugly in one case: I opened the door of a room full of water and the result was a mass of semi-transparent triangles! Of course we're not talking about MGS2 (but have you seen the scene of the ship's flooding?) but they could have done better by correcting, given that there were also some bugs present here and there and the management of the camera not always up to the situation. The music and special effects are normal and do not disturb the gaming sessions. It's the end? Summing up, it is a more than decent game, with some fun gimmicks and a remarkable longevity (which never hurts) helped by the multiplayer mode that will keep you glued to the screen for quite a while (at least until the release of Gran Turismo 3 !). In short, it's not a masterpiece but I enjoy it and I don't see why you can't do it too! Pros: Looks really spot on! Fun alone much more in company! Cons: Not great graphics Camera handling A few bugs too many How nice to be children again! What good times those of childhood playing all day with your beloved toys, without problems and, above all, without reviews to complete. I remember that one of my favorite toys was my teddy bear, a companion in a thousand adventures in the green fields of my imagination. Someone will be thinking that perhaps the time has come for a visit to the psychiatrist, but they will change their mind because I'm about to tell you about a game whose protagonists are the nice little animals, friends of all children. Sequel to the previous episode intended for the unfortunate Sega console (the Dreamcast), ~Fur Fighters: Viggo's revenge~ will let you enter the colorful world of plush puppets but, wait a moment, we are in a video game and therefore it is a must that there is the usual bad guy (in this case a huge white cat named Viggo) who wants to become the absolute master of the world. The big cat in question has all the puppies kidnapped to prevent the Fur Fighters from putting a spanner in his works but, he has miscalculated as the team of six soft toys, led by the dog Rufus, decides to take action to remedy his misdeeds.", "date": "2001-06-21", "grade": null}
