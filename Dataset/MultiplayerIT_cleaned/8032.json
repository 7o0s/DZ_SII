Continuing in its multi-platform expansion maneuver, the game in question has now also reached smartphones and tablets equipped with iOS and Android, at a price destined to appeal to many; the legitimate question, however, is how the conversion work was performed, since rarely titles born for controls via physical keys have been able to fully convince once transported on a touch screen. Finger or stylus? For the most details regarding the gameplay and background of the game, we refer you to our previous reviews of the Nintendo DS and Xbox 360 and PS3 versions. Very briefly therefore, we limit ourselves to recalling that Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes is certainly not a typical title among those linked to the Might & Magic universe, of which on the contrary it essentially only shares the setting in the lands of Ashan. On the contrary, a very colorful graphic style with a look similar to that of comics or television cartoons is accompanied by a rather bland and banal narration, not particularly incisive or engaging. Its function is essentially as a glue to justify and keep the fights together, which represent the real fulcrum of the game. The latter are represented precisely by a puzzle game in which the player's line-up, made up of about twenty units, directly opposes that of the opponent controlled by the cpu; the underlying mechanics, obviously quite complex and whose perfect mastery passes through various tutorial phases as well as numerous practice sessions, in practice rests on the basic concept of bringing together (almost always) three units of the same color to allow you to perform an attack - if aligned vertically - or create a defense - if horizontally -. The management of the available shifts and movements is one of the cornerstones of the game, as is the ability to understand and anticipate the opponent's moves and make the most of the different qualities of one's troops. The conversion in question was not made by Capybara itself, but entrusted to the unknown Scottish team Tag Games, specialized in original and adaptation works on mobile platforms. In reality, the work carried out cannot be said to be perfect, indeed for certain elements the adaptation to the touch screen appears even listless and superficial, making some passages rather frustrating. In fact, often and willingly the lack of precision in detecting the inputs incorrectly translates the will of the player; it is not uncommon for your character to take the wrong path while moving around the map, and even more often it is necessary to repeat the tap on the interactive elements (especially the chests) numerous times to be able to obtain the desired result. Similarly, during fights it can happen to make the wrong move, and the absence of an undo function can general frustration especially in the most difficult battles. If, thanks to the larger screen size, the situation on the iPad is all in all acceptable, it is much more annoying on a smartphone where the precision required would require a stylus, and does not lend itself to the use of the fingers. The fact that this is not a game born on these platforms does not mitigate the belief that much better could have been done, and the hope is that these errors will be corrected in future updates. More generally, crashes and various bugs should also be reported, further confirming the need for a good cleaning up of this version 1.1. In addition to the main campaign, which among other things enjoys the appreciable cloud sync function on iOS to synchronize saves between different devices, this version also offers a handful of secondary modes: in addition to the single battle, there is in fact the possibility of giving life in multiplayer battles both locally via pass and play, and online asynchronously.", "date": "2013-01-30", "grade": "8.0"}
