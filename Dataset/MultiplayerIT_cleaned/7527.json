If you don't want to have any revelations about the plot or anything else, convince yourself to buy it and come back to reading here only after playing it thoroughly. Freedom is also an illusion To fully understand The Stanley Parable you have to go back to 2007, the year of publication of BioShock by Irrational Games. Levine managed to demonstrate with a truly brilliant idea what the role of the user is in a video game, completely overturning the critical perspective on the subject. After years spent discussing the gamer as an active agent of fruition, whose role for some would have been even creative (who remembers the rivers of ink spent on the ~gamer director~?) Doctor Yi Suchong's ~Would You Kindly~ was enough to blow up the dam and show the ephemeral nature of the choices in the videogame fabric, their ontological inconsistency, as well as their being completely illusory, because they are always foreseen in the program. As a creator, the gamer has in fact been demoted to the role of a donkey who just needs to put a carrot in front of his nose to make him go where he wants. Every now and then you allow him to eat one, without ever bringing him to satiety, and then place another one in front of him and make him walk a little longer, until he reaches his planned destination. After BioShock the theme of the nature of choices within video games has been revived numerous times and has become the subject of works of great importance and value, such as the exceptional Spec Ops: The Line, where it was used to dissect the shooter genre military, staging more the psychology of the average gamer who voraciously devours them, than of the characters represented. But no one had ever attempted the path taken by the authors of The Stanley Parable. Can a video game effectively reflect on itself? The masterpiece The Stanley Parable says yes What is The Stanley Parable? At the beginning of the game we only know that Stanley is in his office, in front of the computer monitor he has been working on for years. But there is something strange, because suddenly it is not receiving any more orders. Poor Stanley, for the first time in his life, is forced to lift his head from his seat and look around. Discovered alone, he will have to explore the offices of the company he works for to find out what happened to his colleagues. Accompanying him there is only a cumbersome narrative voice, which describes his situation with pique and professionalism and tells him from time to time how to behave. Life is never what it seems The gameplay is of an almost disarming simplicity, given that Stanley can only walk and look around, occasionally interacting with buttons, levers or similar objects (think Dear Esther and you're on horseback). However, everything takes a different turn right from the first crossroads. Stanley finds himself in front of two doors and must choose or, better, the gamer must choose for him, whether to go through the one on the left, and continue the regular flow of the story, as the narrator asks, or go right to see what change by breaking the rules. It is from this moment that The Stanley Parable reveals its cards and shows itself for what it is: the accomplished staging of the ~theory of choices~ set out in the previous paragraph. Soon the player is forced to understand that no matter how hard it may be to decide, within the game there is no right choice to make and you can only follow a series of pre-established paths, which often lead to unsettling and unexpected situations. Each crossroads leads to the unveiling of a piece of the puzzle, without ever showing it in its entirety, a puzzle that tries to define the very nature of video games. There are no right choices or wrong choices and no rebellion is possible, except the refusal of the game, ie returning to the desktop, as thematized in one of the paths (but isn't that also an ephemeral choice?). The player has only to take note of the world that has been created for him, perhaps exploring it in all its facets, but in fact undergoing it without really being able to do anything to change it. Meta-game Is the system a bit confused? In a similar context, the protagonist's search for truth takes on a very special, almost paradoxical meaning, because the main interpretation is not to be found so much in what is being told, but in the relationship between the player and what happens, i.e. in the continuous attempt of the video game to relate to the third character in the field, i.e. the gamer himself, forcibly pulling him into the representation. To do this the narran voiceyou/developer addresses not so much Stanley as such, but the gamer as the one who controls Stanley, effectively preventing him from any form of identification and favoring complete estrangement. The entire work therefore becomes a continuous dialogue between an impalpable but immanent entity (the developer) and the user, using an extra-diegetic character (the narrator) as a channel who speaks to the only virtual agent active in the game world, i.e. Stanley. If desired, it is a bit what happened in Hideo Kojima's first Metal Gear Solid, when the player was called to change the joypad door to regain control of Snake, so as to be able to defeat the boss Psycho Mantis, i.e. when Hideo's game Kojima revealed his nature in the most blatant way ever seen. Let us briefly explain the Would you kindly? Pay attention: this box contains advances on the plot of the first BioShock. Handle with Care. In the early stages of the first BioShock, the protagonist Jack was motivated to act by the kind requests of Frank Fontaine, definable as a kind of quest giver, which always began with the same formula: ~Would you kindly?~ As the plot progresses, it is revealed that that phrase is actually an activation code created by Dr. Yi Suchong to control Jack's actions. It serves to use it as a weapon against Andrew Ryan, the father of Rapture (and Jack), the sunken city in which the story is set. Of course, the matter is not that simple. At the moment of discovery, the player, i.e. the one who really controls Jack's actions, is forced to realize that he has exactly followed Fontaine's orders, without being able to discuss them in any way and without anyone forcing him to do so. The problem is that not doing so would have meant leaving the game, that is, refusing entry into videogame fiction. The player thus found himself, against his will, to be a puppet in the hands of the game designer. The inevitable beauty There are no real choices in video games Perhaps, wanting to find a weakness in The Stanley Parable, one could speak of the excessive didacticism with which some themes are addressed, to the point of clearly perceiving the partly legitimate fear of the authors of not being fully understood in their message. In a certain sense it lacks subtlety, even if it must be said that the subject matter is really complex and such a direct attempt has never been made to stage it within a video game. So some explanatory excesses of writing are largely justified and can be accepted without too much drama (we don't feel like penalizing him for this). For the rest, you remain, dear gamers, and your desire to get involved in a title like this. Give it a try, because you might really experience it as a revelation, capable of overturning your point of view on what we assume to be one of your favorite hobbies. The Stanley Parable is a fundamental building block for understanding modern video game theories and for understanding the nature of video game action. Why? First of all because he does it from inside a video game. This is not a trivial matter, given that every language can be considered truly evolved when it develops the means of expression to reflect on itself. Also because it shows how videogame language can be used effectively to create highly reflective works, without having to feel like the silly cousin of literature, cinema, theater and all the other arts. This too, if you allow, is a merit that should be underlined.", "date": "2013-10-31", "grade": "9.5"}
