{"name": "Haunting Ground", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/haunting-ground.html", "text": "Still a castle? The latest production of Captive Communications, created by the team responsible for the Clock Tower series, confirms in many respects the desire to remain extremely faithful to tradition, starting with the initial menus that are almost indistinguishable from other games of the genre, complete with the same font for the on-screen text that fans of the genre won't struggle to recognize. Even the plot certainly does not shine for originality; in this case the player is called to take control of Fiona Belli, a beautiful and defenseless girl who, after a car accident that cost the life of her parents, wakes up a prisoner inside a huge and gloomy gothic castle. Deja vu? In reality it is a feeling that pervades much of the experience through Haunting Ground, but it would not be correct to reject the Capcom creature solely on the basis of a lack of originality. Also because, at least, the programmers have decided to avoid gameplay seasoned with shotguns, rocket launchers, exploding brains and bloodthirsty zombies. The protagonist of Haunting Ground is in fact a common girl (certainly not for the physical aspect), with no experience in the use of weapons or in combat. At the same time, the manor in which she is segregated is populated by creatures that have nothing to do with the living dead; obviously however, the hostile intentions towards Fiona are far from hidden. For example, the first being we meet answers to the name of Debilitas, or a huge, deformed and horrible retarded man (another stereotype, but amen) who seems to want only to crush Fiona's busty body in his arms. The rest of the characters destined to cross the path of the protagonist will maintain a disturbing feeling while presenting less creepy or even attractive features, as in the case of the maid Daniella; however, don't expect to face hordes of opponents with every change of shot. On the contrary, Haunting Ground is based more on tension and insecurity, dilating the encounters with the few enemies to the maximum in an attempt to make them authentically distressing. I didn't bring any aspirin We were talking about Fiona's impossibility to attack or in any case directly confront her opponents. Precisely on this aspect rotates one of the most characteristic aspects of Haunting Ground; in fact, unlike most of the Survival Horrors, in the Capcom production in question being faced with a threat means turning on your heel, starting to run and finding a hiding place as soon as possible in which to wait for things to calm down. The roots from Clock Tower are therefore evident, but in this case everything is amplified by the need to keep the protagonist's panic under control. By making tense situations, such as chases, persist for too long, the beautiful Fiona will begin to be seized by increasingly greater agitation up to real panic attacks, graphically represented by a disturbance of the image and colors on the screen, as well as by the possibility from seeing it fall to the ground, from not being able to access the inventory screen or even from momentarily losing control of it. Within such a bleak and discouraging picture, the only positive aspect must be sought in the fact that at least Fiona is not alone in her adventure. After a few minutes of play, the protagonist actually gets to know Howie, a splendid wolf dog with an intelligence that is certainly higher than the norm and destined from that moment on to be a permanent couple with the protagonist. The programmers have evidently done some careful research and painstaking work in an attempt to make the dog's behavior as believable as possible, and the result is actually quite good. The movements and animations are appreciable, and its behavior does not bring to mind that of an automaton but of a real animal capable of understanding or not the orders of the ~mistress~. Yes, because Howie's support is not only accessory, but on the contrary fundamental in solving many puzzles as well as to save Fiona from the most thorny situations by attacking enemies. Through the right analog stick it is in fact possible to give simple commands to Howie, and also praise or scold him depending on whether he has followed the orders correctly or not. Down! From a technical point of view, Haunting Ground, while certainly not making a miracle cry, is a well-made, well-finished and appreciable title in practically every aspect, with the exception of the cuts between one animation and another which are a little too clear-cut. The control system follows the dictates of the genre, introducIn addition to managing the dog, I also have the ability to lower or jerk backwards. Nothing striking, and honestly after so many years of honorable career of this type of interface it's hard not to find more than a few flaws. But this is certainly not the main flaw of the Capcom production, which suffers rather from a bland game pace, from an unstimulating progression in the adventure, dotted with puzzles seen and reviewed, and above all debased by a really excessive backtracking that forces you to go through from end to end the castle. This is obviously a gimmick aimed at increasing the number of hours necessary to complete the adventure, but which if abused as in this case does nothing but water down the experience and frustrate the player. A real pity, because Haunting Ground is by no means a product to be rejected in the round in the face of undoubtedly valid characteristics capable of giving it its own personality. But the end result is far from what it could have been. Comment Haunting Ground is a classic ~pre-Resident Evil 4~ action adventure, characterized by an extremely tested gameplay but which can still count numerous admirers today. The Capcom production also adds a series of interesting features, which manage on several occasions to remove the feeling of deja-vu and at the same time give the title its own personality. But in contrast to these qualities, flaws that are difficult to overlook soon emerge, above all a progression of the story at times soporific and greatly penalized by exaggerated backtracking. A title therefore to be recommended to those who are not yet satisfied with this type of video game, but which could hardly enter the heart of those who have long been bored with the ~children~ of Resident Evil. Pros: Some interesting features Run-in and valid gameplay Technically more than good Cons: Discounted plot and not at all original puzzles Unbearable backtracking Sometimes soporific rhythm Try counting the children of Resident Evil. No, we're not just talking about the numerous sequels to the successful series made in Capcom, but more generally about all those games that have shared the same game mechanics, perhaps with small variations on the theme. Too many, right? In fact, the action / adventure genre was undoubtedly one of the most inflated in recent years, saturating a market that then saw its natural and inevitable healthy turning point in Resident Evil 4. Nonetheless, there are still many lovers of the ~old-fashioned~ genre, and they are probably the same people who have not fully appreciated the revolution decided by Capcom for the fourth episode of its survival horror. Haunting Ground is dedicated to all these people.", "date": "2005-05-13", "grade": null}
