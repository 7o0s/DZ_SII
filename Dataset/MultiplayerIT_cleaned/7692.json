Yet the policeman Anton Jakob Zellner is the hero of The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief, at least to the point where, as the developers promise, we will see the story from another point of view. Maybe as early as the next episode. But for the moment it is Zellner who travels from Zurich to Cairo, first on board the legendary Orient Express and then on a cruise ship. The new adventure of the creators of The Book of Unwritten Tales therefore opens with a long journey, leaving behind the fairy-tale atmospheres to involve us in the complex mechanisms of yellow. Zellner himself is a voracious reader of mysteries, especially those signed by an elderly writer, Lady Clarissa Westmacott, who travels right on board the Orient Express, also bound for Cairo. With the blessing of Agatha Christie, evoked by these two striking quotations, Zellner has two important missions to accomplish. The first is to help the famous Interpol inspector Nicolas Legrand defend a jewel known as the Eye of the Sphinx, en route to Cairo for an exhibition, and the second, related to the first, is to prove one's worth by getting the favor of the inspector, who at first doesn't take Zellner and his investigative aspirations seriously at all. But stubborn as he is and gifted with deductive powers matched only by his polite ways, Zellner is ready to face any difficulty. And he will have several ahead of him, starting with the return of Raven, the gentleman thief who everyone believed died at the hands of Legrand, and who instead seems to have returned to the scene. Shortly before this trip, in fact, someone wearing the same mask as Raven had stolen the twin jewel of the one headed for Cairo from the British Museum in London. That is why everyone fears that he is now on the trail of the precious other. On the other hand, the black feather that he left as a signature at the crime scene seems to confirm that it is Raven. But the modus operandi does not match. This thief is ruthless and has no qualms about killing. And the picture gets complicated with the events that disrupt Zellner's journey, grappling with an increasingly complex mystery with ambiguous contours. A difficult story to tell therefore, which the developers of KING Art Games distill with wisdom, and which raises new questions with each answer. There is great passion for mysteries and narrative expertise behind this The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief. So buy the ticket and get on board: the journey still holds many surprises. The Raven: Eye of the Sphinx successfully inaugurates an adventure trilogy that promises very well Allow a question? Before embarking for Cairo, and against the advice of Inspector Legrand, the stubborn Zellner makes a revealing gesture. In secret from everyone, he takes the heart medicines he always carries with him and throws them into the sea. Medicines are the symbol of a destiny that others have chosen for him, that of a kind policeman who can only deal with the trifles of everyday life. Throwing them at his peril (the risk of choosing his own path in spite of everything) Zellner makes a crucial choice with respect to his own inner conflict, and proves to be profoundly human. KING Art Games has thus created a character that can last well beyond the space of a trilogy and we hope he knows how to use him properly, perhaps letting us know something more about his past, for example why he is not married. But it is above all in the interactions between Zellner and the other characters that we discover his character and, by contrast or affinity, that of his interlocutors. The most important is undoubtedly Inspector Legrand: staid, inflexible and detached in appearance, but gnawed inside by a doubt that undermines his facade security. In fact, the inspector owes his fame to the killing of the thief known as Raven, but now that this seems to be back on the scene, Legrand feels like an impostor, and is therefore obsessed with the idea of catching him. In short, he made it a personal matter. He and Zellner almost never agree, particularly on the presumed return of the thief, and their encounters/clashes become exciting duels of wit and strength of personality. On the other hand, the dialogues are at the center of The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief and occupy a good 70% of the game time. There are many characters on board the Orient Express that Zellner will then find on the cruise ship bound for Cairo and still more will be added in the second phase of the journey. We will therefore have more than one opportunity to get to know them, put them to the test, discover their stories and above all suspect themro when a twist messes up the cards on the table. The cast is varied and sketched with skill, in fact, a few exchanges are enough for us to get an idea of the person in front of us. There is a reticent archaeologist, the beauty of the moment, rich and on the run from her father, a dandy violinist, a ship captain who travels the world of Italian origin, the woman with the child accompanying the aforementioned Lady Westmacott and others who we leave you the pleasure of discovering. Each of them has a lot to tell, and even if during the dialogues we will have to do nothing but run out of options, the sound of a pencil scribbling in Zellner's notebook every time they provide us with useful clues communicates an exciting sense of progress in the investigation. The question of the puzzles remains, which will leave some players unhappy. The puzzles in The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief are in fact very simple for an inexperienced player, let alone a seasoned adventurer, although they never end up being banal. On the other hand, they must be seen as evidence of common sense and resourcefulness for Zellner rather than challenges to the player's intelligence, and for this reason they fit effortlessly into the flow of events. Another advantage is that they never betray the verisimilitude of the story. In fact, we will see Zellner perform all the necessary actions without magical shortcuts. So if he has to use a heavy object he lifts it and then puts it away at the end of the action. In short, don't expect him to slip the classic stick with an attached hook into his pocket. The only consolation for the most demanding players is the scoring system that rewards those who do not resort to the hint system or the button that highlights sensitive points. Little thing, we recognize it, but better than nothing. On the other hand, each solved puzzle involves a concrete step forward in the story and this is good, because once you start playing, it is very difficult to break away. If you've noticed, there are more and more adventures with a strong and compelling story that don't leave much room for solving complicated puzzles, so as not to dilute the pace of the narrative. The direction remains firmly in the hands of the developers and the player becomes a spectator collaborator, personally involved but not dominant. They are choices that may or may not like them, and they don't always work, but when they offer the pleasure of getting lost in the dense plot of a well-crafted mystery full of twists and turns, as in the case of The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief, the he final experience is worth the sacrifice of the challenge. A vibrant yellow You may have noticed that The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief was made by KING Art Games with three-dimensional characters and backgrounds. This choice works well during dialogue and allows the camera to be in the right position every time for dramatic effect. Characters and environment also communicate a strong sense of solidity, but suffer from the lack of a recognizable artistic direction, especially as regards the scenarios. At the moment the hand-painted backdrops of the two-dimensional adventures remain the most exciting. This does not mean that they have been neglected here, on the contrary. The environments are detailed and full of carefully chosen objects. Legrand's laboratory and the baroness's cabin for example are very convincing, but also the archaeologist's compartment on the train and the ship's hold differ from the many generic places seen in too many adventures. The light and colors on the ship make us imagine the wind blowing on the deck bringing with it the taste of salt. All that's missing is that extra touch that makes you want to stop and admire the screen. Another problem is the feeling of claustrophobia on board the train and below deck on the ship. This is not so much due to the nature of the means as to the fact that we are denied access to most of the common areas. A few more screens would have solved the annoying feeling of bumping into the invisible barriers raised by the developers. The characters, on the other hand, although they are fairly animated, have faces devoid of the emotion that the excellent dubbing conveys. On this last point there is no denying, it is rare to hear so many successful interpretations of characters of different ages and social status. However, we warn you that voices and subtitles are currently in English, even in the Zodiac edition, although it is likely that, at least they, will soon release a patch with Italian subtitles. If the choice of 3D is atypical for an adventure, the classic point and click interface seems obvious, albeit simplified as befits a modern game. However, what is not good are the small technical problems that we hope not to inconter more in the next two chapters. Sometimes Zellner struggles to find the already set path to an object and we have to watch it as it settles awkwardly. It also happened that it crashed forcing us to quit the game. On one occasion even the saves seemed to have been lost, although after a few reloads they popped up again. It has happened that some objects become active with a second delay and the pointer does not change shape to indicate that it is possible to continue when it touches the edge of the screen. Nothing dramatic, but they are subtleties that detract from an otherwise excellent production. Even the cutscenes feel rushed compared to the quality of the actual game and certainly not up to par with the excellent orchestral music. The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief was not intended to be split into three releases and it can be seen from the sudden ending that leaves you breathless but takes too much by surprise. In any case, an eight-hour episode is more than we expected and on several occasions we thought it was over when it still had long sections of gameplay. But what matters most is that it lays the foundations for a compelling story, with multifaceted characters who still have a lot to say and above all a protagonist capable of holding up the part even in the long run. At this point we are curious to know what the developers mean when they say that we will experience history from both perspectives and above all to find out what else awaits us once we arrive in Cairo. Unless something else happens first. The sum of the parts In the original intentions of the developers The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief was to be released all at once and not in three parts. For this reason the judgment is still partial. Only when we have played the entire adventure will we be able to give it a rating that will apply to all three chapters overall.", "date": "2013-08-02", "grade": "7.9"}
