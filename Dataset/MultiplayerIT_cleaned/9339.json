No, it's not a quote from Fallout, but the motto of an entire genre: that of RTS. Before starting to play, we read a history book to find out some details about the Korean War, a conflict that is rarely talked about and that video games have never used as a scenario. We therefore give credit to the developers of Theater of War 3: Korea for choosing an original setting, abandoning the highly exploited World War II. Started the game, we decide to dedicate ourselves to the tutorial that... crashes making us go back to the desktop. Let's start well! We reboot, retry the tutorial, but nothing. Let's go back to seeing the desktop again. Luckily, being an RTS, we know how to play (we've known since Dune 2), so we try to start one of the two default campaigns (US vs Korea), forget about the custom campaign builder and, without too much trouble, we manage to master the interface in no time - or so we thought. Honestly, the first impression is disappointing. The graphics engine is that of Theater of War 2 and doesn't seem to have improved one iota, despite the fact that two years have passed. However, we will return to the technical aspect later. For now let's focus on the game. As tradition of the series wants, the developers have focused on realism in the reconstruction of the units and the dynamics of the battlefield. The game is divided into two sections, like Total War and, by now, many other similar games: there is the strategic map where to move the troops and there are the battlefields where you have to fight. The general map is divided into territories. If you move troops into vacant territory, there is no need to fight to capture it. We go out into the field Speaking of the battles, we won't mention the numerous times that the game crashed because otherwise we'd give it a three and go drink grappa to forget. However, be aware that on some systems Theater of War 3 can prove to be very unstable, if not downright unplayable. But let's talk about the action, the real heart of the game. At first it's just an impression, but after a few hours of fighting it's not possible to ignore one of the major flaws: the men who make up the armies in the field have neck problems. It's obvious, because if everyone didn't feel dizzy it would be difficult to understand how they manage to get lost all the time, even when crossing a bridge. If losing one or two troops of a battalion may not represent a big problem, even if it is a bit funny to see lone soldiers crossing the maps extremely late compared to their companions, when it is the tanks that are going in circles the question becomes serious. Taking pity on the behavior of his men, he ends up ordering very short journeys, in order to avoid seeing them set off on a tangent, evidently looking for a leap of faith to make to cross a river or to enter some building, disgusted by roads and open doors. The Theater of War series The Theater of War series consists of three chapters, including the one you are reading the review of. Several expansions were also released for the second episode. Let's briefly review the history of the brand. Theater of War (2006) Set during the Second World War, the first Theater of War is probably the best chapter of the series, with five campaigns to play. Theater of War 2: Africa 1943 (2009) The setting is still the Second World War, but this second chapter has been much criticized for its brevity: three campaigns, for a total of fifteen missions, some of which have to be replayed on the same maps. Theater of War 2: Kursk 1943 (2009) Kursk 1943 is a stand alone expansion of Africa 1943. It offers two campaigns with a total of eighteen missions. Lasts longer than the base game. Theater of War 2: Centaur (2009) Centauro is an expansion to Theater of War 2: Africa 1943 which adds two campaigns. It focuses on the Italian Centauro division which operated in Tunisia. But the strategy? That of buggy path finding is a big problem which, in our opinion, leads to another rather sinking one: the strategy is missing. Probably, aware of the difficulty in finding the way for AI, the developers have designed large and rather empty maps, where there is little to study and much to hope for. Winning is a matter of figuring out where your opposing troops are coming from, so you don't get surrounded. The pace of the action is slow and isn't compensated by the need to make choices or set up a more complex strategy than advancing with caution. In some cases there are variations, but these are rare moments and of little importance in the game economy. Not even coversto talk about it and, as if that weren't enough, the maps are few. In general, there is a certain lack of content. As we said above, the graphics engine is that of 2009 and does not offer any marvels to admire. As in Theater of War 2, here too you have to zoom the shot to observe the three-dimensional models, an action which, however, will be performed only a few times because the units are better managed from the general vision. If desired, it is possible to enhance the completeness of the database of weapons and units, but it is not enough to promote the game.", "date": "2011-04-20", "grade": "5.5"}
