{"name": "Chi vuol essere miliardario?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/chi-vuol-essere-miliardario_a.html", "text": "Shall we light it? The game allows a maximum of four players to face the climb to the billion lire in 3 modes: the classic one of the ~fastest finger~, in team play (in which the players will take turns in giving the answers) and all against all (in which everyone in turn will give an answer and whoever takes home the most money will win). The more observant may be wondering: ~How did they achieve the ~fastest finger~ mode, given that we don't have as many individual stations as in the transmission? And in fact, each player will have to choose his own key on the keyboard and after which some combinations of particular elements to put in order.These combinations will alternate and when you think you have seen the right one you will have to press your key: whoever presses it first wins. Aid In your search for ultimate knowledge, sooner or later a question may come your way that you won't be able to answer (and this will always happen to the first few questions!) and as in the transmission, here too you will have the three aids available: the 50-50, the phone call to home and the help of the public. Leaving aside the 50-50, what most arouses our curiosity is the realization of the last two. As regards the call home, Gerry will call a complete stranger (don't be frightened, it is clearly a recorded call: each question evidently has one already recorded depending on the number of answers present that can be given) which according to the his knowledge will provide you with his answer. As in reality, the poor unfortunate person could answer correctly or make a mistake, or he could even surrender to his ignorance, leaving you with an exhaustive ~I don't know, sorry!~. As regards the help of the (virtual) public, from what it seemed to me, I suppose that in relation to the ease of the question there is a random function which distributes the votes depending on the question. For example, if the question is one of the first ones, the public will almost never be wrong: so every now and then it can happen that the public knows the answers to questions (which happen to be the first ones) which are objectively very ~niche~. If you really don't make it, you can always leave the game with the money you have earned. Conclusions Let's face it, CVEM is a very entertaining game: the questions are many and approved by the commission responsible for the quiz (although I have come across a ~bugged~ question in which, according to the game, the frog's cry would be the meow) and therefore of the same difficulty as the broadcast questions. CVEM is a game capable of bringing everyone together, from children to the elderly members of the family and its maximum is clearly in the company. In fact, my university friends and I really enjoyed playing this game a lot (before taking an exam of course). If there are defects, they are very few and you really have to nitpick to find them... a defect could be that of the exchange currency considered: a few days before the entry into force of the EURO, the premiums in lire are now decidedly obsolete. Another flaw is the fact that after quite a few games some questions (especially the first ones) could come back to life. Also after you get into the game, Gerry Scotti's (repetitive) comments will become extremely boring, but unfortunately there is no way to skip them. Who Wants to be a Billionaire? All of you are surely familiar with the transmission of the same name, which is the quiz that has most managed to captivate us in this period thanks to its apparent simplicity. The game inspired by it finally arrives in Italy from the Hothouse! The game is therefore the direct official ~conversion~ from television to the gaming platform and in fact thanks to the various sound effects, the ~themed~ graphics and the effective sound commentary by Gerry Scotti now anyone can experience the same tension and emotion firsthand that the lucky participants will have tried.", "date": "2001-12-26", "grade": null}
