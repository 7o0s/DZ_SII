The intent of the game is to offer ~interactive practice~ in real-life language situations and to improve the player's language understanding and communication skills. Practice English thus offers a whole series of dictation, comprehension, pronunciation and vocabulary exercises, organized not only according to increasing difficulty but also according to a timetable. Here the progress in the tests that the player will have wanted to take periodically will be recorded, and which he will be able to consult in the form of graphs. A ~daily progress~ concept that Practice English, continuing in the wake of the previous English Training, clearly borrows from Brain Training, precursor of Nintend's nouvelle vague of ~intellectual non-game~, which has now become a real series. The heart of the game, the ~meat and potatoes~, is represented by the dictations. After having listened to texts or dialogues illustrated on the upper screen, the player will have to reproduce them faithfully by writing on the lower touch screen, having previously chosen, from the options page, whether or not to immediately enjoy a translation of the sentence into his own language, whether to have a host of empty boxes to guess the amount of letters that make up the sentences, and so on. Other times the player will be asked to guess the meaning of the dialogues, and to correctly answer some questions concerning the subject of the discussions. Each time a dictation is passed, with an evaluation that varies according to speed, hesitation in writing and any cues required, the same dialogue will be available for review in the Exercises section. From here it will be possible to listen and review everything, access the lexicon and transcribe it, evaluate the pronunciation by reciting the parts of the dialogues in turn and listening to one's own voice again in comparison with the original ones. A further section is that of mini-games and pastimes, all unlockable by progressing in the main sections. The latter include simple language-themed games, songs, tongue twisters, and offer a decidedly welcome breath of variety, capable of breaking the continuous cycle of exercises. Practice English is a valid and fun tool for practicing the English language, provided that one is already able to deal with elementary dialogues. The material involved is a lot and well thought out, but the great potential is partially nullified by a still not excellent handwriting recognition routine and by a decidedly insufficient voice recognition. All this leads to recognizing the ~technological~ courage of games of this kind and the difficulties to be faced in the mined territory of voice recognition and writing, but also somewhat to reconsider the general scope of similar operations. The Practice English exercises are useful and refresh your pronunciation by embellishing your vocabulary and providing opportunities to sharpen your ear (apart from stammering which achieve excellent marks), but everything should be considered as a nice support training for a very different type of dive in the language. Playing it is fun and learning, but one also soon realizes something that is obvious and worth emphasizing: language is a phenomenon that must be entrusted to real practice and human interaction, and that it is not possible to reduce to recognition routines however fine or hopelessly deterministic the brain of a program. Pros A valuable extra tool for vocabulary, comprehension and pronunciation Tons of spoken examples in English Exercises, progress calendar, mini-games, tongue twisters, songs... Cons Not to be considered without having a smattering of English already Recognition some handwriting can be annoying Speech recognition is very poor ...romanes eunt domum? Above all, the in-depth analysis of vocabulary and listening comprehension activities will undoubtedly benefit beginners, while even the most expert speakers could find bread for their teeth in being able to faithfully and on the fly transcribe, without errors and without suggestions, the dialogues at the most challenging levels. Not to mention some nice mini-games that offer local and particularistic variants of English which, in the game, is foreign to the demanding US chants and settles on a reassuring Anglo-Saxon imprint, with occasional turns into quasi-Cockney dialect. However, not all donuts come with a hole. The technology behind speech and handwriting recognition, so crucial to successhe interaction and the much sought-after combination of fun and learning still has a long way to go. Unrecognized handwriting, despite the possibility of customizing it, is a continuous reason for slowing down the enjoyment, and risks transforming the experience from Practice English to ~Practise writing~. Speech recognition, a great idea full of applications, is then practically useless, because the recognition routines are completely insufficient to distinguish, let alone judge on the basis of the correctness of pronunciation parameter, a complex phonological and timbral phenomenon such as the spoken language. The program appears to condemn or enthuse about the player's utterances in a predictably gratuitous and unwarranted manner. And not only that: it's possible and even ~easier~ to recite random sentences or stutter nonsense verses to receive excellent pronunciation scores. The player, then, absolutely cannot trust the game's judgment to improve speech, and is obviously compelled by common sense to trust his ear and the comparison between examples and his recorded voice (which is very useful anyway). Edutainment Nation or Touch! generation? Halfway between a game and a utility for learning languages, Practice English therefore belongs to a way of understanding electronic entertainment that only a console like the Nintendo DS has so far managed to successfully impose on the market: the videogame as a medium to learn while having fun. A concept capable of rightly making every player shiver, evoking images of aesthetically sweetening video games, batteries of ~educational~ trial and error electronics, sugary and Flandersian pedagogues who discovered controller apologists for the purposes of education and the common good. Luckily for him (and ours), Practice English does not belong to this cloying vein. Even the latest incarnation of the Touch! Generation is quite entertaining and well thought out. Provided you know at least a little English from the start, Practice English is definitely capable of improving the player's language skills without breaking too much, and they can always come in handy in life, for more challenging voice chat deathmatches or even , who knows, to better appreciate an industry and a videogame culture that has always been and above all English-speaking. Practice English! For everyday English is available for Nintendo DS. Learning English with only the use of an electronic program is not yet possible (fortunately), but all those who already have a smattering of the language will find in Practice English a valid tool to practice and improve. With a rich series of dictation, listening, pronunciation and vocabulary exercises, Practice English for Nintendo DS is a valuable extra tool to keep next to the lamp, take with you on the train or use to train your ear for the English language in the dead times of the day.", "date": "2007-12-06", "grade": null}
