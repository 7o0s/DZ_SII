This is a bit the story of Yo-Kai Watch Blasters for Nintendo 3DS, a console that just doesn't want to shut down in silence despite the presence of Nitendo Switch on the market for the past year and a half. Do you remember the Blasters game featured in Yo-Kai Watch 2 Psychospectres and Fleshy Souls? Here, Level-5 thought it well that it could stand on its own legs, and as always the company has proven to be right. We returned to the world of Yo-Kai to beat up the giant bullies of the neighborhood in the company of Jibanyan: here's how it went. The plot: the dream terror arrives! We know what you're wondering: where should the Yo-Kai Watch Blasters adventure be placed? Before or after Yo-Kai Watch 2? The truth is that the title is a real spin-off, which can ideally be placed after the conclusion of the second chapter of the series: to enjoy it alone or in the company of some friends it is useful to know something about the world of Yo-Kai, but if you are those who discovered these seemingly Pokmon-like (but actually very different) little monsters just a few days ago will be fine too. Yo-Kai Watch Blasters is accessible to all players, connoisseurs of the franchise or not: as always, among other things, we are left behind compared to Japan, because the episode was already published there in 2015, all that remains is to make it enough waiting for the localization of Yo-Kai Watch 3 as well. There is no place for humans in the Yo-Kai Watch Blasters spin-off: the undisputed protagonists are Jibanyan and his unlikely sprite friends, committed to defending the world. In fact, the very dangerous Dream Terror has been unleashed, during which the evil Yo-Kai run around with arrogance beating up the smaller specimens, an intolerable attitude for the paladins of justice. Too bad that the latter, apart from their good will, are also incorrigibly lazy and wimpy, and so the Jibanyan gang is known in the neighborhood for being also a group of good-for-nothings. But things are destined to change quickly when Sergeant Kuadro proclaims himself leader of the group, and by inviting a series of collaborators to the base of Jibanyan and Secretary Nevina decides to redeem the name of the company: the Yo-Kai Blasters will no longer have to run away from face danger but regroup and fight bravely. Easier said than done of course, at least on a narrative level; because as far as gameplay Yo-Kai Watch Blasters works great. Gameplay: Lots of action and a pinch of RPG Yo-Kai Watch Blasters is a very different title from the ~numbered~ episodes of the series, where the RPG component is predominant and the soul of the production is very close to that of Pokmon. With Blasters, however, we found ourselves grappling with a very immediate, linear and accessible action game: the perfect production for a younger audience, but still able to elicit a smile and give the right satisfaction to more adults. The player's task is to manage a squad made up of a certain number of Yo-Kai, making them run around in micro-levels and fighting against the bad spirits possessed by dream terror: don't think, however, of the turn-based (and random) fights of the series Yo-Kai, but rather a real beat 'em up, fast and pressing. Each Yo-kai has three moves that can be performed immediately, with variable power, and the best way to take down smaller enemies is simply to act first and quickly, at least in the initial game chapters where healing items are at the limits of excess and the health of enemies tends to low. Of course, things get complicated in the following episodes but the level of difficulty never reaches problematic heights, and in most cases not even able to seriously worry a player who is at least minimally attentive to what he is doing. Of course, the colossal bosses represented by the leaders of the evil Yo-Kai require a bit of strategy, and it is here that the RPG soul of the series peeps out again: the Yo-Kai belong to different tribes and are divided into seven types, each of which more or less effective in battles against the others. Furthermore, the sprites possess unique abilities, belong to a specific class (offensive, defensive, healing and ranger), can level up with Oni orbs collected in levels, and upgraded with the right equipment made with a basic crafting system.after. A lot of irons in the fire that significantly enhances the replayability and variety factors, and it's not even over here because some peculiarities already typical of the canonical chapters of the series return, such as the medals for the Yo-Kai collection, the ~game trophies~ as an incentive to explore all the possibilities, and much more. The Multiplayer: an extra gear Yo-Kai Watch Blasters game sessions oscillate between the preparation phase in our heroes' refuge and the action on the field in the actual levels. The refuge, as well as the secret base of the Yo-Kai, is designed as a multi-storey building where each of them offers specific possibilities: there is the gym where you can spend the Oni collected in battle to level up the spirits, there is the area where you can rearrange, exchange and modify teammates, the shop where you can buy useful tools, the laboratory where you can create equipment, and so on. On the penultimate floor, Sergeant Kuadro awaits - always vigilant and impassive - to assign us increasingly complex missions: eliminate a certain number of enemies within the time limit, save the Yo-Kai, challenge powerful bosses, find objects scattered everywhere. Although Yo-Kai Watch Blasters is completely usable and a lot of fun alone, its offer makes much more sense in the company of a friend: up to three acquaintances can accompany us on our adventures strictly in local multiplayer mode, perhaps giving us a hand against the bosses more difficult (if there is any need), thus reviving the pace of the game. And it is always remarkable how Level-5 productions squeeze the Nintendo 3DS hardware to the max: even in the most agitated situations with lots of friends we have not noticed that a couple of sporadic slowdowns, in the face of a noteworthy and pleasant graphic detail . And if the more than 400 Yo-Kai to collect and use in battle shouldn't be enough stimulus, know that it is possible to unlock a bonus in Yo-Kai Watch Blasters if you have already played on the same Nintendo 3DS system a title between Psychic Spectres, Bony Spirits and Fleshy Souls, making Komajiro S, Jibanyan S, and Komasan S respectively available for your party.", "date": "2018-09-04", "grade": "7.8"}
