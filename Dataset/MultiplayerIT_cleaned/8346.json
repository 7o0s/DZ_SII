{"name": "Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/108007-dark-souls-anime-nere.html", "text": "Dark Souls was one of the most interesting and engaging games of its generation, and undoubtedly a masterpiece of its genre. Complex, deep, an esoteric fantasy enriched by a narrative style that has made every corner of the setting, bosses and characters encountered along the way a coherent whole with a fascinating plot, well connected and explained in detail more by the communities of enthusiasts than by the game itself. This introduction is nothing more than a dutiful tribute to the title that at the end of 2011 brought the legacy of Demon's Souls (exclusive to PlayStation 3) multiplatform, thus expanding a saga unofficially defined as a spiritual continuation of King's Field, the first role-playing game to appear on PlayStation , back in 1994, and initiator of a highly difficult ~sword and shield~ gameplay that made the guys from From Software known to the world. Talked about, discussed, feared, Dark Souls was both a critical and commercial success and having only been released on consoles there was not long to wait to witness the popular insurrection of the heterogeneous world of PC gamers, who with petitions and press releases have requested publisher Namco Bandai to convert the title. Money, as we know, is like grapes: the more you eat, the more you want, and Namco didn't have to be asked. A troubled birth At the ides of April 2012 the over 90,000 subscribers of the petition will have rejoiced reading the official announcement by Namco Bandai of this Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition, just a pity that not even a month before the producer Masanori Takeuchi, aware of the situation, had commented how everything was in the hands of the publisher and there was nothing ready, or at least defined. Bronze face or emblem of sincerity? Obviously, we will never know for sure, but in cases like these, the facts speak for themselves and their echo certainly shifts the balance to the second hypothesis. To make the atmosphere even more paradoxical is the confirmation that the DLC included in this edition will only be available for consoles from the end of October, therefore even two months after the release of the PC version. From Software therefore seems to have chosen the PC as the privileged destination of their commitment and their inventiveness, a pity not of their competence. The problems encountered in the conversion phase by the team have not been hidden, which just a few weeks after its release, between humility and shyness, confirmed that the native resolution of the game will be 1024*720, without improvements to the textures and with the number of frames locked to a maximum limit of thirty. Very discouraging premises. Passion and moderation are two factors that often collide, and it is not easy to find an objective way to explain what a PC user should expect, and expect, from this edition. After all, as already mentioned, Dark Souls is a product that largely stands on its own legs even months after its release, but not for the purely technical sector, mind you. The graphics engine of From Software reinforces what was already shown at the time with Demon's Souls: a good number of polygons of the characters, enemies and environments, with animations that, thanks also to static movement patterns and blur effects studied at the table, mask more or less skillfully a fluidity that is just enough to guarantee the right playability (and sometimes not even that), with a good draw distance to draw backgrounds and landscapes with very evocative color ranges. Unfortunately, on a technical level, the Prepare to Die Edition resumes when seen on consoles, but does not evolve it one iota. Although it is possible to define the resolution in upscaling to 1080p with motion blur and anti-aliasing that can be activated through the settings, all this appears solely and exclusively as a sort of huge house of cards ready to collapse. Yes, because comparing PC and console the result is absolutely identical: resolution, textures, animations, drastic drops in framerate in some areas, frame buffer. Fog and illuminations are also unchanged, as are some weapon collision bugs. The only point slightly in favor of the PC version concerns the contrast of the blacks, a little more accentuated and therefore more enjoyable. Even at the level of controls, the use of a pad is strongly recommended since the technicalities of movement cannot necessarily adapt to using a mouse and keyboard. This conversion therefore reflects the very definition of the term, without adding or removing: it seems in all respects to play the console version, the objectives are even present since the game rests its online on the Games for Windows LIVE platform. Prepare to mod! Moving away from facicriticizes them, one might wonder which of these are minuses. It's true, in a game like Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition a sixty-frame stream would perhaps have made it alien to its slow and very technical game structure. Furthermore, a general graphic embellishment work would perhaps have overshadowed the emphasis placed on the artistic and environmental side of the product. A greater number of animation frames would have made the fights different and collision points that were too defined would probably have distorted some of the fights. Maybe, or maybe not. Of course, you couldn't ask a team to jump through hoops that in a few months had to roll up their sleeves, convert an immense title and add additional content, but you can't even overlook the visible graphic old age, in the presence of well-known bugs and slowdowns that in some areas (Citt Infame and Abyss of the Abyss above all) appear truly intolerable and anachronistic, especially on PCs that are much more performing than current consoles. It seems like a joke that a passionate modder named Durante, foreseeing all this in advance and working on internal variables of the game registers, has released a very light patch that removes the resolution block and guarantees a substantial improvement to the aesthetics of the game , allowing you to enjoy otherwise invisible details. More time and more attention to detail would undoubtedly have benefited a conversion that underlines how often forced release times are harmful and doubly counterproductive, both from the tangible point of view of those who will buy this edition for the first time and for those who will replay it for the first time. second and you will see that everything is identical to what has already been seen, with an inevitable whiplash of the fans who demanded, especially in the qualitative and quantitative content of the DLC, a little more respect for one of the cult titles of the generation. Old news A very important section of this edition is the inclusion of additional content Artorias of the Abyss, which according to the developers promises new areas, new bosses, new weapons, spells and an entire section dedicated to PvP. A package that can only be unlocked at a very advanced point in the game, undoubtedly full of great expectations since it is currently exclusive to PC and will only be sold on consoles at the end of October for 14.90, a certainly not indifferent price. Given the care that From Software has taken to package each area, environment and room of Dark Souls, it was obvious to expect a DLC with lots to do, all new areas full of corners to explore in detail and charismatic bosses with which to battle. Unfortunately, this additional content is not a little disappointing, and let's be clear, there is nothing wrong or out of place. There are four new areas, four bosses, a dedicated arena for fighting other players, and new spells. A task apparently performed to perfection. However, if we stop for a moment, especially after having come from dozens of hours of exploration through the many environments inside Lordran, and analyze what this new Oolacile offers, there are very few points that shine. It almost seems that From Software has packaged this DLC listlessly. Each section has an irremediable aftertaste of already seen, with completely recycled environments and elements from other areas seen in the main quest, and this can only weigh negatively on an overall judgment. Even the contents of the package take up what was seen with the Limited Edition sold on console release, taking up contents already proposed at the time (soundtrack, artwork) and embellishing them with a poster and some postcards. Considering, almost a year later, the price at which the Prepare to Die Edition is sold (49.90 euros) and the little work done, we are certainly not faced with peaks of offer excellence. Two steps to Oolacile You don't have to be a hardcore enthusiast to notice how the new environments easily follow what was seen in the primary quest. The Garden of the Sanctuary as well as the Bosco Reale have a floral and forest appeal widely appreciated in the Radiceoscura Garden, with structures, trees and bridges that, however, follow the constructions and styles already explored. The same goes for the County of Oolacile (undoubtedly the most beautiful section) very pleasant artistically and in terms of sound, but necessarily full of dirty medieval elements which, although characterized and made unique by an architecture inclined to mark the sinking into darkness, refer to what has already been seen in the Borgo dei Undead and more generally in the upper section of Lordran, failing to unleash who knows what emotions also due to a basic level design and eventoo son of a binary structure. The final section in the Abyss is dark but short, badly programmed, with very heavy drops in frame rates and without the sense of oppression that it should be, with sparse environments and without personality. Lost in the mists of the past and engulfed in darkness due to a botched summoning rite, the poor county of Oolacile is on the verge of the abyss, but it is alienating, given the situation, to see so little variety of enemies on the screen. Except for the bosses, the enemies that populate this content are few and lacking in depth, poorly characterized humanoid forms that entrust a visibly lowered difficulty to simple combat patterns. The fights with the bosses are as always well packaged, even if for the level with which the content will be unlocked it will not be difficult to beat most of them, while for the rest all you need is a little determination. It would have been wonderful to spend words to explain the functioning of the PvP arena, a pity that despite the wait inside it, no adventurer has ever been found with whom to fight. Perhaps the short time of availability of the game on the market and perhaps the fact that the point is quite advanced will have shifted the possibility of meeting someone downwards but, without challenging the statistics, it is clear that there are technical shortcomings with the matchmaking code , divided into 1vs1 duel, 2vs2 team and 4vs4 deathmatch. A nice opportunity for comparison, pity that, to stay on topic, there was not a soul.", "date": "2012-09-03", "grade": "7.5"}
