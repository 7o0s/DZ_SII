{"name": "Smash Court Tennis 3 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/smash-court-tennis-3-recensione.html", "text": "Pro Tour The fulcrum on which the main experience in SCT3 revolves is obviously the Pro Tour mode. Similar to the ~career mode~ of the rival Virtua Tennis, this one is characterized by greater completeness especially as regards the customization of the tennis player who will be guided by the gamer, both physically and technically. In some ways, in fact, the Namco title is somewhat reminiscent of an RPG, and a bit of a football manager. The user is called upon to create an athlete from scratch by deciding on his name, surname, gender, nationality, height, weight, style of play and appearance in general, and to guide him in his climb to the top of the world rankings, starting from the anonymity of the first tournaments venues up to Wembley. Through the various challenges, including training, the tennis player will acquire experience points that will increase his technical level. Each parameter available to the virtual athlete can in fact be improved, we would say ~upgradable~, and therefore it will be up to the player to establish which characteristics it is appropriate or not to enhance and increase. There are many possibilities for choosing and intervening on the athlete's technical elements: these range from power play to footwork, from enhancing the type of shot (forehand, backhand, etc.) to learning one of the many new moves. As further confirmation of the completeness of this modality and of its similarities also with some aspects of football managers, we note the possibility of attracting sponsors through matches and convincing performances and of stipulating advantageous contracts with them for the supply of first choice accessories, such as rackets, designer uniforms, etc. Or put two other players under contract to be able to participate in men's, women's or mixed doubles tournaments and consequently climb the respective world rankings. The match The control of the tennis player is rather immediate. The virtual athlete responds well and quickly to the commands given to him: with the R1 key he sprints, with the circle and square keys he performs two types of powerful shots, with X he performs a slice while with the triangle a lob. Of course, depending on the duration of pressing the keys or the player's position on the field at the time of the shot, his personal technical skills and the direction inflicted on the shot, the ~conclusions~ will vary in power or type. The gameplay on balance therefore turns out to be a little less immediate than Virtua Tennis 3, with less spectacular and more studied matches, without running at breakneck speed from one side of the field to the other. For these reasons, the first impact for the ~average~ video gamer (understood as a non-fan of this sport, but a simple sympathizer) can be negative towards the Namco title, especially if used to the more arcade style of Virtua Tennis. But if you go beyond this initial phase and start playing with commitment, the satisfactions and sense of fulfillment for a certain realism do not take long to emerge. As unfortunately some flaws. Oh yes, because SCT3 is certainly not free from defects. First of all, perhaps the most serious, the AI of the athletes managed by the CPU, certainly not the best. Let's be clear, it's not that our opponents on the field are imbeciles, however they will often act clumsily, with illogical actions (instead of hitting back a ball that arrives in their direction while remaining still, for example, they first move to one side as if the shot was about to change trajectory only to then retrace their steps, where they were a moment before, to return the shot). Graphically Namco-Bandai offers us a valid title. The polygonal models of the athletes are well done, quite realistic and detailed, as well as the various contour elements and the playing fields, and the animations. The audio, on the other hand, has some flaws: some sounds out of sync with what happens in the field, little varied effects and a rather anonymous soundtrack. Comment We hypothesized it during the preview, now we are sure of it: Smash Court Tennis 3 is a complete, long-lasting tennis simulation with a good career mode (Pro). Even better than that game that is Virtua Tennis, which however has chosen other ways for its gameplay. But be careful: only as a simulation. If, on the other hand, we judge the Namco title in general, taking various aspects into consideration, then the discourse changes quite a bit and in favor of the Sega title. In any case, albeit with some flaws, we believe that every fan of this sport who owns the Sony ~portable~, eager to try their hand at a ~different~ title from the arcades, should give us a little thought. Pros: Good simulation level. Pro mode excellent. Great longevity and multiplayer mode. Cons: AI opponents to tweak. A bit tricky for newbies. Audio compartment not free from defects. It's overof water under the bridge since that distant 1996, when a tennis title with a strong arcade imprint entitled Smash Court Tennis saw the light on the old, dear Playstation. With ~anime-deformed~ style graphics, the Namco game aimed to entertain young and old with its immediate and fun style. In the years to come, however, also in compliance with the often changing tastes of videogamers, and the willingness on the part of the developers to evolve their work, the Japanese softo gave a gradual but significant change to the series that has probably reached its peak with the last episode appearing on PS2, which in fact marked the definitive transition to a more simulation style of play. Smash Court Tennis 3, the first chapter to land on PSP, exclusively, the latest in chronological order of the saga, aims to confirm the new trend, offering the user an ever higher and more realistic level of challenge. The first thing that immediately catches the eye as soon as the main menu of the game appears, once the UMD has been inserted and loaded, is the considerable amount of modes available. From the classic single match (16 really existing athletes available and 14 stadiums divided between concrete, grass and clay fields), to the canonical, for the genre, Pro Tour mode (which we will analyze in a specific separate paragraph), passing through the Arcade-style tournament, there are so many game options and challenges to try your hand at. Without forgetting the training area (made up of 20 lessons), that of the mini-games (three ironic variants of the ~single-match~ called respectively Tennis Pac-Man, Tennis Galaga and Tennis Bomba) and the multiplayer (via Wi-Fi connection and using a single copy of the game), modalities which in themselves give an added value to the title and a certain variety and longevity.", "date": "2007-08-07", "grade": null}
