He invented his first board game at the tender age of six, and since then his creative vein has never stopped: so far two hundred of his boardgames have been published, which have sold millions of copies all over the world. Dr. Knizia recently partnered with publishers to develop video games for PC, Xbox 360 and Nintendo DS. Dr. Reiner Knizia: L'Allenamente has just been released for the dual-screen portable console, or rather a collection of ~brain~ minigames with which we will be able to keep the brain in training. The similarities with Brain Training catch the eye, but these are only superficial elements: the two products are fundamentally different, and in the specific case of L'Allenamente we will not have available schemes to measure our progress or even to translate them into an estimate of our brain age. We will simply have to try our hand at a series of different applications, following a ~reward~ path that will allow us, little by little, to unlock all sixteen cities on the map (plus the four hidden ones...). The puzzles are not presented as they are, but related to a particular aspect of the city. Around the world The start screen of the game gives us the possibility to try our hand at the ~Around the world~, start a random game or access the puzzle archive. You can also use the download function to send a puzzle demo to a friend. The ~World Tour~ is the main mode: Dr. Knizia will show us a world map on which the most important cities are highlighted: some are available immediately, the others must be unlocked. Each city corresponds to a puzzle: by successfully completing the first level, we'll earn coins and be able to spend them to unlock the next levels, up to five for each minigame. From one level to another, the differences are considerable: the tests become more and more difficult and substantial, requiring an ever greater commitment. The puzzles are not presented as they are, but related to a particular aspect of the city. In London we will have to solve a series of equations to remedy a problem with the stock exchange computers, and to do so we will have a table with the four operations available, to add to the sequences of numbers to make them correct. In Paris, the Louvre's anti-theft system will have to be restored, so we will have to deal with light switches: if we press one, the adjacent ones will change color, until the pallet is all the same shade. In Moscow we will have to verify the effectiveness of the memory tests invented for the Secret Services, therefore turn over the cards on a table one at a time, finding the same pairs to eliminate them in the shortest possible time. In Mumbai, transport will be the master, in fact we will have to monitor the movements of the trains and mark the number of differences between apparently equal carriages. As mentioned, the total of puzzles amounts to twenty, each for five levels of difficulty: respectable numbers, too bad that not all minigames are fun in the same way... Technical realization As with any product of its kind, L'Allenamente doesn't rely on spectacular graphics to amaze players. However, the differences compared to Brain Training are many and significant: while Dr. Kawashima showed up with an essential and functional cosmetic for the action, Dr. Knizia makes the effort to provide a specific ~scenario~ for each minigame. In short, we will always have his big face in front of us, ready to give us advice or to spur us on when things go wrong: not that it's a pretty sight, but always better than a white background. As far as the sound sector is concerned, we are faced with something really, really essential: little music, very simple, composed solely with the aim of not disturbing. The control system is based solely on the touch screen and the stylus: having only to ~tap~, it always behaves very well. Comment By now the ~brain trainers~ are a consolidated reality, and especially on Nintendo DS they are destined to multiply again and again. From this point of view, Dr. Reiner Knizia: L'Allenamente is only the latest product in an ever-growing vein, but comes in a simpler and less serious guise than titles such as Brain Training. In fact, there are no comparative tables or measurements of the intellectual faculties; just a series of more or less fun puzzles, to try when we feel like it. We must also consider that the product is offered at an attractive price, therefore it presents itself as a very ~second choice~.interesting, to be taken into consideration if we already have a ~brain trainer~ and would like to try something lighter and more carefree. Pros A good number of puzzles Simple and immediate Affordable price Cons Average quality of the minigames not excellent The proposed puzzles are far from original Not very long-lived", "date": "2008-06-23", "grade": null}
