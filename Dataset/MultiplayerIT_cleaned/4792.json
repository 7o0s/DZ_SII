In the review there are small spoilers of Breath of the Wild, none related to the story.Nick Kyrgios, talented and turbulent tennis player from Canberra, born in 1995, informed us with a nightly tweet that he had completed, after great suffering, the Test of the Sword of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. This gives us at least three interesting pieces of information. The first, the least important for you, is that Kyrgios' priorities - given that Wimbledon starts today - are at least revisable. The second is that The Legend of Zelda is once again famous among young people, and this is a great merit of the last episode, a merit that will probably soon be corroborated by the numbers, given that Breath of the Wild is seriously candidate to become the chapter of the best-selling saga ever (with four million placed at the end of March, the record of eight million for Twilight Princess seems easily achievable). The third piece of information, perhaps the least foreseeable before the release of the work, is that completing a The Legend of Zelda is once again a source of pride. For those who have known the saga in the recent three-dimensional iterations it will be difficult to believe, but up to the Nintendo 64 (including) The Legend of Zelda was famous for being challenging: both for the duration and for the challenge proposed by the adventure. We recall an Edge editorial that remarked on this aspect, anno domini 2006, just before the arrival of Twilight Princess: the hope of the editors was that the saga's accommodating turn could be limited to The Wind Waker. As we all know, that was not the case; from 2002 onwards each chapter has been rather simple, with the apex touched by Skyward Sword, whose challenge was due more to the difficulty of the puzzles than to that of the fights, which were often walking puzzles themselves. Well, Breath of the Wild has reversed the trend without nuances: it is the most difficult and challenging three-dimensional The Legend of Zelda, and this despite the relative simplicity of its puzzles. This first DLC, the Legendary Trials, is aimed at emphasizing this component. It costs 19.99 Euros, can be purchased on both Nintendo Switch and Wii U, and is inseparable from the future Christmas update, The Ballad of Champions. The Trial of the Sword We had already talked about whether or not this The Legend Zelda could make use of additional content here, months ago, before they were announced. In short: the basic adventure is rich and complete, the world large and wonderfully articulated, so it would have been a waste not to use it to deepen the gaming experience. If the Christmas DLC promises to be the most substantial, even The Legendary Trials proved to be more substantial than expected. Let's start with two relatively simple but very useful elements: the Hero's Path and the Teleportation Amulet. With the first feature, which can be activated from the map, you can relive Link's journey live (up to a maximum of two hundred hours), with the ability to increase and decelerate the pace of the video. In addition to being revealing in terms of mnemonic - you will probably discover that you are dead more than you remember - it is useful for understanding where you haven't set foot: in this way you will be able to see unusual corners of the map, but above all you will have a clear idea of where to look for the remaining seeds Korogu. The Amulet, on the other hand, once obtained (and it is not hidden in a properly peaceful place) allows you to create an arbitrary point where to make Link appear, whose teleports so far were limited to Shrines and Towers. It can be used at will, but not in more than one area at the same time. In addition to the Amulet there are other objects, almost all inherited from previous chapters of the series, to track down. Around Hyrule there are documents - whose approximate location is indicated in the menu - which suggest the rumored position of the relic, which must then be looked for and, believe us, it is often not a walk. In short, if you were thinking of spending 19.99 Euros and finding Majora's Mask directly in the inventory, you will be disappointed: every object must be traced and found. Of all the relics, the most interesting and useful is certainly the Korogu Mask which, near a seed, emits a wail and starts to jingle: we advise you not to discount the idea of searching for these objects a priori, because they often lead to the discovery valuable portions of the map not used in the main quest. However, the most stimulating introduction of the DLC is the Trial of the Sword, designed specifically - but not exclusively - for those who have already finished the main adventure. It is a mission in which Link takes only his hearts and his stamina with him: he is - temporarily - deprived of all inventoryharvest. The test is structured along the lines of others seen in the past in the series, with a sequence of rooms to be crossed one after the other, which are unlocked only after killing all the enemies who preside over them. Unlike the previous ones, this challenge has an articulated game design, which takes full advantage of the possibilities offered by the Breath of the Wild engine: you have to deal with enemies, but also - and in some cases above all - with the surrounding environment . Thunder, lightning, lava, ice, wind. The Test is divided into three brackets (initial, central and final phase), which constitute a sort of checkpoint, because every time you die you start again from the beginning of one of the three phases. It is a challenge that tests both your spirit of survival and your skills in battle, and you will hardly be able to complete it without mastering both: the last rooms are really demanding, and it is unlikely that you will be able to overcome them without knowing how to repel with the shield the Guardian lasers. Also for this reason it is rather difficult to hypothesize a duration: let's say that, doing everything perfectly, the Test lasts about an hour (which means that, probably, it will require at least four). For the record, we died in the last room of stage three, surrounded by a horde of mounted Bokoblins (and more). The master mode Unlike the elements just covered, Master Mode is not necessarily aimed at those who have already completed/started the game. This is because it is not applicable to the existing save file: all this means that, if you dreamed of throwing yourself against the golden Lynels with your hyper-equipped and developed Link, well, forget it. In Master Mode you have to restart the game (in a separate file, which does not overwrite the original) so it is aimed both at those who want to relive it by cursing a little more, and at those who have not started it yet and love a high level of challenge. The most challenging part of Breath of the Wild is represented - roughly - by the first thirty/forty hours of the game, after which you are usually equipped enough not to have to worry too much about the monsters that infest Hyrule, with the exception of the Guardians and Lynel. Here, rather than making the portion of the game commonly called endgame more difficult, the Master mode makes the initial and central section even more impervious, effectively prolonging its duration. The result is an adventure that is more unbalanced and less harmonious in development, but much more demanding. In addition to having only two save slots (one automatic and one manual), an element that does not allow ~cheating~ and returning to a more serene / favorable moment of the game, Master Mode eliminates ~basic~ enemies from the game. To speak of the most common, there are no more red Bokoblins, replaced en masse by blue ones (and so on for all the others), which implies a really, really difficult initial path. That wasn't enough, in this particular declination of the adventure the enemies - all enemies - tend to recover energy over time, and at a short distance from the attack: if you hit a Bokoblin and stop attacking him for five/six seconds (because there another one or because it rolled somewhere), he will have already regained some of his life points. If it is slightly easier to find powerful weapons from the beginning, the equipment only slightly compensates for the difference in level of the enemies: it is irritating to go from a file in which you take down a Guardian without taking damage, to another in which you are massacred by a handful of blue Bokoblins. To make it all the more cruel, devastating enemies have been placed here and there in previously free or peaceful points: for example there is a bold zebra-striped Lynel who grazes two meters from the Temple of Time. A mode that is not for everyone, and which forces you to restart the game, but which certainly succeeds in its intent: completing Breath of the Wild in this way is really difficult, the first hours of the adventure are nightmarish.", "date": "2017-07-03", "grade": "8.0"}
