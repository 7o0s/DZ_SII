{"name": "Starship Unlimited - Divided Galaxies", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/starship-unlimited-divided-galaxies.html", "text": "A Civilization in outer space The idea behind it starts from the typical setting of turn-based strategy games a la Civilization (just bringing this video game monument closer to the title I'm dealing with makes me sick). The game immediately starts with one foot in the grave and shows huge gaps right from the very first frame of the presentation, linked above all to a form that we could gallantly define as ~retro~ not to say decidedly out and outdated. The rendering of the objects really leaves something to be desired, and if I didn't have the calendar right under my eyes to remind me that the current year is 2003, I'd believe I was in 1995. The risk of bordering on the most absolute videogame obscenity comes back to the surface as soon as we get there allowed a very first approach to the actual game. The first screen is the one relating to the choice of race and the appearance of the spaceships in the fleet. In a potpourri of tragedies regarding lack of originality and total lack of refinement in the creation of the interface, we notice immediately, and with extreme ease, that this product is already setting its feet on the downhill road that will lead it to get lost in the bottom of some dusty drawer. The simplicity of the whole proposed is of a disarming naivety and seems to come directly from the dark spaces of the old PC games born to run under MS-DOS (and to tell you this I can't hide the cold shiver that runs down my spine). Having made the acquaintance with the races that populate the galaxy, we are finally approaching the early stages of the real game. Our home planet features a couple of large cities highlighted on it by simple colored icons. This means that after all we can consider ourselves lucky, being able to start from an averagely evolved planet. The ~tools~ bar located at the top of the screen has a series of buttons through which it is possible to access the various game functions. Explore, research and conquer The game itself has no big news (if not). We have a structure based on the hybridization of turn-based games with real-time games, in which time passes more or less slowly as the months and years go by. However, each of our actions will be calculated in advance in terms of completion time from the statistics provided by the game. The object of the game is to bring the entire galaxy under your rule. Starting from a single planet with just a scout spaceship that can be used for the first explorations, we will be asked to proceed with a real colonization of the surrounding celestial bodies. This will involve, as with all games of this genre, having to search for places rich in raw materials that can be exploited to one's benefit and meeting other more or less friendly civilizations, with whom to share not only some commercial exchanges, but also more complex diplomatic operations. In the most classic of traditions you will be asked to proceed with the research and development of new technologies useful for continuing your rise to power. However, the control system for all these parameters is a bit too dispersive and unclear. However, our range is very large and includes an entire randomly generated computer galaxy. In this we will find numerous solar systems with their planets. The colonization of the aforementioned will lead to the creation of a veritable network of possessions which will have to be managed with care and parsimony. A sudden decline in the economy could bring even the most attentive gambler to their knees at any moment. Once the first network of planets has expanded, it will be very useful to plan the jobs assigned to the various units, so as not to lose control of the situation. In fact, the vastness of the map will be such that it will not be possible to check all the acquired planets at a glance. Each unit must be assembled piece by piece before being launched. To do this, a separate search will be required for each individual component. Which for the undersigned represents one of the few peculiarities of the title. Although the game presents a certain variety in the composition of planets and races to control, there are rarely particularly exciting situations. It all ends up being reduced to a simple search for planets compatible with one's needs and in an attempt to defend oneself from enemy pitfalls. Fights have unit control issues and low engagement. One gets the feeling that everything happens too quickly and that the outcome of the battle cannot be controlled. Furthermore, the dispersive structure of the Gioco, due to the excessive size of the map and the difficulties of rapid navigation of the aforementioned mean that control of all the other operations in progress is easily lost during a fight. In this sense, a totally turn-based setting would have facilitated full control of the common operations. Summing up From the point of view of the technical realization, as already highlighted above, we certainly cannot cite any virtuosity. Instead, we are forced to note a very little effort in the search for something that can be defined as new, or at least already outdated for many years. Not even artificial intelligence is able to give depth to this product. At the beginning of the article I dared to compare this title to a cult like Civilization (and Sid Meiers doesn't want to), in fact, from a certain point of view there are different points in common between these two games. Setting aside, both focus on the exploration of the territory, the research and development of technologies, the crossing of different eras; in the case of Civilization however, although the graphics and the soundtrack are certainly not exuberant, the game concept and the form in which it is proposed make the title worthy of being able to access the Olympus of the best games of recent years. The same cannot be said of Straship Unlimited which can barely claim to compete with the first Civilization (the one from ten years ago, to be clear). We therefore close this merciless analysis of the game by asking ourselves what space in the videogame market a product of this kind can occupy and hoping not to have to criticize the future works of this software house so heavily. Pros: Auto-generated galaxies guarantee a minimum of longevity Fair for fans of old school strategy An acceptable compromise between turn-based and real-time strategy Cons: It's backward Not very original Playing Starship Unlimited you have the clear feeling of being in the '80s 90 In the field of video game enthusiasts there are those who believe that sometimes the apparent simplicity of a game can hide the ability to amuse and amaze, perhaps with an out of the ordinary and rather original idea. When I crossed Starship Unlimited  Divided Galaxies I was thinking about this. I immediately changed my mind. And this is bad.", "date": "2003-08-05", "grade": null}
