{"name": "RAGE 2: L'Avvento dei Fantasmi", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rage-2-avvento-fantasmi-recensione.html", "text": "The review of RAGE 2: The Advent of the Ghosts: the first expansion for the shooter produced by Bethesda undoubtedly has the merit of reminding us how solid is the gunplay developed by Avalanche Studios with the important supervision of id Software, but also what problems have prevented the game from taking off in its entirety. Back in the role of the Walker ranger, we just need to go to one of the cities available in the large open world that we know well to receive an urgent request for help from a female voice. In short, it seems that someone is in trouble and we cannot back down, but once we get to the long stretch to provide assistance, the only thing we find is an ark with the usual load of injectable nanotrites to obtain new skills. This time, however, things don't go as we expected and we find ourselves hanging upside down, facing a female warrior, Iris, who wants to pursue the evolution of the human race by eliminating the weak and turning everyone else into rangers. To achieve this, she has put herself at the head of a faction of disturbing and mysterious warriors, the Ghosts, who have among their talents the ability to move in a lightning-fast manner and great physical resistance. Transported against our will to the Uncultivated City, an island located southeast of the original map and boasting the size of a region, we will have to deal with this new threat, fortunately supported by a group of people who would like to free the area from enemy presence. Structure and missions Just like in the RAGE 2 campaign, in which a certain number of tasks had to be completed for three different allies in order to complete the story and obtain all the available skills and upgrades, in The Advent of the Ghosts we will meet Keenan Ford : once the character is freed, we will unlock a new hub that can be visited, located inside an old metro station. There we will be able to interact not only with Ford for access to the five main missions of the new story, but also with various other NPCs: some of them will ask us to complete tasks, making them appear on the map; others will be available to sell us items, materials and ammunition. In terms of novelties, the expansion introduces a new weapon (the Feltrite Laser), a new ability (the Void) and a new vehicle (the Ghost motorcycle): elements that they add just a dash of variety to the original formula, but in no way revolutionize it. Ultimately, what the new missions offer is the possibility to spend some more time having fun shooting enemies, in this case more tough and elusive than ever, while exploring a setting that has the appearance of a decayed metropolis, between collapsed buildings and destroyed highways. We will be able to travel aboard the trusty Phoenix or use any of the unlocked vehicles, including the Icarus gyrocopter: it is a flying vehicle that offers comfortable air travel to various destinations, making us the movements much faster but going to belittle the standard driving sections in an exaggerated way, which should have been one of the flagships of the experience. When you experience the comfort of the Icarus it is difficult to go back to gripping a steering wheel, but in the case of the Advent of the Ghosts there is not much to lose: along the road there are the classic positions manned by enemies, in this case Ghosts, therefore from this point of view there are no news worthy of note. The same secondary tasks revolve around the conquest of outposts and the elimination of all the opponents present, while the main missions appear a little more articulated and are divided into different phases even quite challenging. Of course, the final battle with Iris is resolved in a somewhat simplistic way: perhaps something more could have been done in this sense. It took us about five hours to complete the expansion: a respectable duration, considering that we have not brought completed all the side quests (which inevitably increase the longevity of the experience) and that the package is sold at a price of only 14.98 euros. Gameplay, enemies and technical realization As mentioned at the beginning, RAGE 2 has extremely solid, fun and highly satisfying gunplay. The weapons are well characterized and shooting is a pleasure, alternating bullets with special ranger skills which significantly increase the strategic rate of the clashes, offering us a whole series of extra opportunities. From this point of view The Advent of the Ghosts does not change the cards on the table, except for the introduction of necats much tougher than usual, characterized by a disturbing clear complexion but in any case divided into different types. In fact, they range from soldiers with shotguns and helmets to fully armored units, to be ~disassembled~ piece by piece; from warriors armed with blades that deflect blows to the most brutal and animal variants, which attack in packs by throwing dangerous incendiary bombs. Getting the better of large groups of opponents requires the use of all the resources we have, from energy recharges to the Overdrive, constantly moving to avoid becoming a static target. There are therefore some exciting battles, but as mentioned it is more the idea of being able to try your hand again with the gameplay of RAGE 2, after finishing the short original campaign, which makes you look at the expansion with great interest. From the point of view technical the Uncultivated City offers some interesting ideas, but not that much: the outposts are too similar and we have noticed a worrying amount of glitches (in particular enemies sprouting from the walls) that we hope will be fixed with a patch. Otherwise, on PC the game performs well and it is possible to use an automatic scaler to stick to 60 frames per second at 2160p while setting all effects and details to maximum. The Italian dubbing confirms the strengths and weaknesses of the basic experience, alternating more or less convincing interpretations in the context of a well-made sound sector. In conclusion The Advent of the Ghosts brings back the excellent shooter mechanics of RAGE 2 in a new map, manned by a faction of enemies that are much tougher and more mangy than those we faced in the original campaign.The scenario of the City Uncultivated doesn't have much to say and the use of the Icarus continues to simplify moving from one point to another excessively, but the firefights can be exciting (apart from the bosses) and the amount of main and secondary missions available appears more than adequate in relation to the duration of the expansion.", "date": "2019-09-26", "grade": null}
