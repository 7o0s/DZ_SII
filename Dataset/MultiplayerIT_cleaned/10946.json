{"name": "Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fire-emblem-shadow-dragon-recensione.html", "text": "In the West Marth, protagonist of Shadow Dragon, is known more as one of the fighters available in Super Smash Bros. Melee (Game Cube) than as the heroic prince involved in the events of the very first Fire Emblem, a strategy by Nintendo and Intelligent System produced for NES (indeed, Famicom) the beauty of eighteen years ago. The series, in fact, has always been rather niche both before and after its debut outside Japan, which took place years ago with the second episode produced for the Game Boy Advance (the first was in fact beautifully skipped, due to the narrative connections to the events of the prequels on the NES). Since then, however, even those who do not understand Japanese have had the opportunity to fully enjoy the exceptional quality of these strategic RPGs, confirmed over the last few years by the versions also produced for Game Cube and Wii. An evolution or a stance? Much water has passed since the first episode that inspired this remake, and the series has undergone small but substantial changes over the course of twenty years, which have brought it to the levels of excellence for which it is now famous, confirmed in this Nintendo DS version. The plot has remained the same: the protagonist takes on the role of Marth, a fleeing prince intent on winning the war to reconquer his kingdom, who will have to deal with supernatural threats and powerful armies relying on his small army, assembled almost by chance during his wanderings. The story develops through textual dialogues between the artwork of the various characters, and maintains a good pace that pushes the player to progress in a campaign that offers rather interesting characters and unpredictable twists. If the narration has remained the same, although updated to today's standards both in terms of texts and rhythm, the game has instead undergone some changes both with respect to the original and with respect to the tested and rather static formula of the latest editions. The excellent ~Chinese pen~ system is back, linking units and their weapons, establishing the general direction of the clashes: swords have an advantage over axes, axes break spears, spears instead are more powerful than swords; in this trinity are installed the variables of the spells cast by the wizards, of the archers or of the flying units such as the knights of the Pegasus or of the dragons. In short, the player must field the most suitable units for the occasion by carefully evaluating their movements on the map during his turn, in order to prevent and counter the enemy's turn. The mechanism is incredibly elementary and yet, after all these years, it continues to function excellently and despite its simplicity it allows the execution of multiple tactics: and from a strategic point of view, Fire Emblem is still the series that does not forgive mistakes, which can cost the life of our units which, once deceased, will remain only a memory for the rest of the game, unless you want to reload the game. This typical feature of the series has always been praised for the inherent challenge of keeping all the characters alive until the end, but also heavily criticized for the frustration of having to start over long missions just to not repeat that stupid positioning mistake made at the boss on duty. Well, Shadow Dragon alleviates this problem by proposing, for the first time, save points scattered throughout the mission maps. On the other hand, however, it will not infrequently happen that you have to sacrifice a member of the army in order, for example, to be able to escape from enemy troops: that character will inevitably die. To balance this questionable choice, Shadow Dragon even allows you to change the classes of the various units via a simple menu between one mission and another: overabundance of knights in your army? Need more wizards for the next mission? No problem: choose one of your knights and transform him into a wizard, keeping the same level and the same stats. The change can take place at any time without limits of any kind, and if we add to this the possibility of evolving the classes of some characters, it is clear how much an already excellent and tested mechanism has been perfected and refreshed. Fire Emblem and the Nintendo DS The passage of hardware has led Intelligent System to painstaking work to update the now outdated cosmetics of the portable series, whose strong point was mainly the splendid animations of the sprites during the clashes: these have maintained the same very high quality and the There is excellent fluidity, while the sprites have undergone a slight transformation, being now rendered and, therefore, slightly more realistics. Accustomed to the cartoony style of the series, this choice initially leaves us a bit dumbfounded but it takes a few minutes to get used to it and appreciate its apparent three-dimensionality. The backgrounds of the various fights are also very well kept, as well as the large maps, much more detailed and varied than in the past. The dual screens of the Nintendo DS also allowed for the action field to be positioned on the bottom, where you can control your troops and navigate the menus with both the touch-screen and the D-Pad, while the top screen displays the map. geographical location of the area in which the mission is set or the pages with the statistics relating to the selected unit. In reality, the use of the main feature of the Nintendo DS is limited to these simple - and almost obvious - details; a separate matter instead for online-gaming, for example, which in Fire Emblem is quite accurate and allows you to clash online with the customized teams of other players: a very simple and basic but undoubtedly welcome mode. The package could not fail to include the canonical, excellent soundtrack: from the initial classic tune of the series, introduced by a long fanfare that alone already excites the passionate player of the series, to the music that forms the background to the clashes or to the more dramatic narrative sequences , the entire musical repertoire of Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon is very accurate, even if certainly not unforgettable. Comment Shadow Dragon does not add anything new to the saga, but maintains the canonical, very solid gameplay that has distinguished it for more than a decade. The simple features of the touch-screen and the double screen are perfectly integrated into a classic mechanics that does not feel the weight of the years, and which will be able to charm, even thanks to a fantasy adventure without enormous pretensions and an excellent technical sector, all lovers of type. Fans of the series will find it essential, all those who do not appreciate turn-based strategy will not change their mind.Pro A gameplay that never feels the weight of the years Technically excellent Discreet support for Nintendo DS features Against At times extremely difficult It does not propose any real novelty for the series", "date": "2008-12-30", "grade": null}
