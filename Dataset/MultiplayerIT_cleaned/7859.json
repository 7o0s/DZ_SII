{"name": "Una ragione per vivere", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/118043-the-cat-lady-una-ragione-per-vivere.html", "text": "Susan Ashworth is a woman in her forties who lives alone with three stray cats, silent friends who she invites to her run-down apartment by playing a melody on the piano. But Susan is also a lonely woman in the deepest sense of the word. Depression builds inside her and taints her thoughts. And one day he can't take it anymore: he swallows an excessive dose of sleeping pills and kills himself. But the narrative voice that we hear from the beginning of the game is his, so something must have gone wrong. In fact, after eating pills, he wakes up in an open field during the day. Here The Cat Lady leaves the commands to the player and it is understandable the bewilderment that one feels and that lasts for at least an hour, as we wander in this dream world among macabre discoveries, crows that guide us and sudden changes of scenery, up to the 'fateful encounter with an old woman who appears to be death itself and who introduces herself as Queen of Maggots (queen of worms), but who will only reveal her true identity at the end of the game. It doesn't matter at the moment though, what matters is that Susan will not be granted the privilege of dying. Indeed, he will become immortal and will have to come back to life to kill five maniacs, or parasites, as the old woman calls them. Kill them to save innocent lives and maybe discover a reason to live. Thus begins a poignant and chilling journey for Susan at the same time. Over the course of the seven chapters that make up the adventure, he will witness atrocious crimes, discover misery and depravity, but also the warmth of trust and the fortitude of human beings. Together with Susan we will visit a dark and surreal world seen through the eyes of a suffering woman. There will be occasions for a liberating laugh and others to be moved. The independent developer Remigiusz Michalski, former author of Downfall, signs a controversial and courageous work together with Harvester Games. A non-linear story, full of nuances and quotations, which sometimes takes off to then find the thread and suddenly put together the elements it has sown. We won't go into detail because there is too much to tell and you have to enjoy the trip if you feel like it. Perhaps it suffices to say that David Lynch might like a game like this, both for the way it's narrated and for the bizarre and disturbing visual choices. When one least expects it, The Cat Lady plays low blows that leave you dazed for a few seconds. If there's one video game author who has managed to enter the depths of an intelligent and disturbed character's mind and then come back to tell us what he saw, it's Michalski, and The Cat Lady is his masterpiece. Death angel Back from death or coma, hard to tell since we wake up in a hospital bed, life doesn't seem all that much better than it did in the afterlife. And the player always has the doubt that everything is filtered from Susan's depressed mind, even if the five parasites are real and dangerous. Monsters with human features, despicable, maniacal beings, disturbed beyond all remedy, people worthy of Saw - the puzzler. They are Susan's target, at least in appearance, because the story is much more intricate and multifaceted. Fortunately Michalski holds the reins of the narrative very well and always gets us back on track after every detour. Susan drifts but the script of the game is solid and, with great aesthetic sense and subtle irony, she lets us experience the evolution of the protagonist from a patient in a protected ward to avenger with gas mask without ever missing beats. Over the course of the game Susan will become a true heroine and will discover within herself a strength that she thought she had lost forever. On the other hand, it is difficult to remain apathetic when faced with the wickedness of parasites. Sure, sure: we're not animals, we believe above all in the justice of the courts, and Susan too is of the same opinion. In fact, in one case he calls the police. Unfortunately the agent, in full obtuse bureaucrat style, ends up asking her first where she lives, to verify that it's really her on the phone, and then passes her the Animal Protection, since Susan reports of people who eat cats. In such cases the word passes to the shotgun, pace of the law. Put like this, The Cat Lady looks like an action game, while in reality it's a narrative adventure that reduces the control system to a minimum so as not to slow down the unfolding of the story. To play you only use the arrow keys and the space bar. Susan walks either to the right or to the left and if she passes in front of an object with which she can interact, the indication appears on the screen. There is an inventory but items cannot be combined with each other. The system is perfect for keeping the player's interest aliveeven if it is not very comfortable. On the other hand, it is appreciable how the author has managed to create brilliant puzzles, never too difficult, because once again the narrative flow must not stop, but full of inspiration and always placed in context. However, there is no lack of variations: in a chapter of the game there is a small satisfaction bar to fill and towards the end we will play with a second character, Mitzi, a wonderful and multifaceted supporting actor, to whom we can give simple orders or ask for advice. Each scenario is different and fulfilling, full of mystery and surprising events and we never found ourselves stuck wandering around not knowing what to do or victims of boredom. The Cat Lady mostly talks about depression as a disease, but it does so without depressing. Yes, it draws on dark and morbid shades but lets those timid rays filter into Susan's life, which will then become a shining sun. Because in the end, when we get to the last act, it turns out that The Cat Lady is actually a video game about hope. Keep out of reach of children The stiff, jerky animations and unfriendly interface might throw you off balance, at least at first. But just that way of controlling Susan helps create tension and fear. The various chapters are full of scenarios to explore, sometimes even twenty screens, all very detailed and never repetitive. The drawings, mostly in black and white, have an undeniable artistic quality. The author is determined to throw us off guard every time and you can never tell if after a moment of calm he isn't about to pop someone's head off. Sometimes dreams seem real, other times reality seems like just a dream. Michal Michalski's music is the perfect bridge to carry us from one mood to another or reinforce the twilight moods of the game. Even the effects do their part well, like the horrible voice of the dead woman in front of the mirrors. But it is above all the voice actresses of Susan and Mitzi, Lynsey Frost and Brittany Williams who breathe soul into the characters with their interpretation. On the other hand, the bond between Susan and Mitzi is the turning point of the story and will make all the difference in Susan's devastated life. The rest of the cast does its part but with negligible performances. Overall, compact and coherent, The Cat Lady is a superlative psychological horror, which we are not afraid to nominate among the best games of the year. Like The Walking Dead this is also a narrative adventure, so you must be ready to let yourself be carried away by its pace. There are subtle narrative crossroads well hidden in the dialogues and a small chance to choose Susan's values and some nuances of her state of mind, but mostly we are in the author's hands. The theme of depression is a tough one for everyone and here we go even further. We talk about disability, illness, isolation. Many prefer to turn away and not think about it. So meditate if this is the genre of game for you, because The Cat Lady is not a title for everyone. And it is right that it is reserved for an audience of adults. But however everyone thinks, the result is the same: The Cat Lady is one of the best horror adventures ever.
