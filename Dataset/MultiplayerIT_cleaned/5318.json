{"name": "Non  il solito solitario", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/173387-solitairica-non-il-solito-solitario.html", "text": "If many gamers know the rules of Solitaire, the credit (or the fault) goes above all to Microsoft, which back in 1990 chose to include the digital version of the famous card game in Windows 3.0. Since then, millions of users have filled more or less brief moments of their day by dealing spades, clubs, hearts and diamonds, making what was originally thought of as a method to calm people intimidated by the complexity of the operating system with a graphics. A lot of water has passed under the bridge since then, yet for many, Solitaire still has a certain charm that is difficult to explain: riding this sentiment, the small independent Canadian team Righteous Hammer Games has chosen to create a new version of the pastime in question, developing from that starting point a sort of RPG complete with plot, enemies and magical powers. Solitairica is an original and fascinating title, ideal for filling the empty moments of the day Draw a spell Solitairica, this is the name of the product in question, now arrives on mobile platforms after making its debut at the end of last May on Steam. Thanks to a very simple interface and an essential game system, the title has not suffered at all from the transition to the touch screen, on the contrary finding an environment that is probably more congenial to its mechanics. The fact is that Solitairica is set in the kingdom of Myriodd, where an evil emperor Stuck has stolen all hearts: the protagonist's task is to impersonate the last remaining hero, and consequently the last hope to be able to restore serenity among the inhabitants of that place. This is clearly a simple pretext, good only to justify the succession of 18 enemies who will have to face before reaching the final battle. Each of them brings with it a series of cards divided into piles: the aim of the game is to eliminate them all from the table, one at a time, and this is possible if the card in one's deck is of the value immediately higher or lower than those exposed by the opponent . If this ~combination~ does not take place, it is necessary to draw another one, which however coincides with the passage of the turn to the enemy, who will be able to launch attacks intended to undermine the energy reserve of his own hero. Once it runs out, it's game over. The cards have no suits, but are divided into 4 elements: eliminating one collects some of the power of that specific element, thus allowing you to use one of the available powers. This is certainly the most interesting aspect of Solitairica, since the developers have made an effort to create a whole series of options capable of literally transforming the balance of the game, thus enriching the gameplay with considerable thickness and variety. The powers can be bought in a shop using the virtual currency collected during the games (don't worry, there is no in app purchase), but their use must be weighed and well managed since only a limited number of those at one's disposal can actually be taken into battle. The same goes for objects, which are also to be obtained in the shop, and which however represent permanent modifiers capable of providing a whole series of useful bonuses. Solitairica therefore proves to be immediately engaging thanks to the excellent balance between extreme accessibility (it takes very little to understand the basic mechanics) accompanied however by a certain degree of depth that allows you to make each game interesting and different from the previous one. In a mix of different elements of this genre, there is also a splash of roguelike, given that defeat forces you to start from the beginning by totally losing the equipment and powers collected up to that moment. The only thing you keep are special points thanks to which you can upgrade your deck or unlock those of additional characters that differ in the spells available. Net of the inevitable long-term repetitiveness and the variable of luck that can generate some frustration, Solitairica is therefore a very pleasant experience especially if enjoyed in small doses, which is why it is perfectly at ease in the mobile sphere. Finally, as a further advantage, it should be noted the colorful graphics, extremely pleasant, and enriched by a very spot-on cartoon style.", "date": "2016-09-03", "grade": "8.0"}
