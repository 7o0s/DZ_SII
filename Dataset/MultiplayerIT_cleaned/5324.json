For this reason, the approach to The Legend of Skyfish can be twofold: on the one hand there is the great interest in a title that actually seems to pay homage to one of the videogame pillars in excellent ways, on the other hand one could take the idea badly and accuse Crescent Moon Games of self-confidence. To better evaluate the game, therefore, it is necessary to forget any comparison that inevitably emerges when looking at the graphics but also the mechanics of The Legend of Skyfish, because bringing up the Nintendo masterpiece for the SNES would also be unfair for a title that obviously has other aims and a completely different type of production behind it. Once this is done, the positive aspects of the game emerge, which presents itself as an action adventure based on a nice and largely well-functioning idea, enriched by a first-rate graphic sector. In practice, it is a sort of mix between the characteristics of Zelda and those of Umihara Kawase, with a protagonist called Little Red Hook (Ametto Rosso in Italian) and decidedly similar to Little Red Riding Hood, only that she is armed with a fishing rod with which is able to attack enemies and interact with the elements of the scenario, usable above all as a sort of grappling hook with which to quickly launch from one part of the scenario to another, move objects or bring enemies closer to obtain advantages in combat. The basic idea is therefore quite original and the technical realization manages to support it adequately, putting together a title that is pleasant to experience and to watch on touch screens. We're a long way from Zelda's level design heights, of course, but The Legend of Skyfish is still able to guarantee hours of top-notch entertainment on mobile platforms. From legend to legend, Skyfish pays homage to Zelda with a fun and entertaining mobile platform game Legendary fish To put an end to the terrible dominion of the sea creatures of Skyfish on earth, the protagonist must cross several levels detached from each other, arranged on numerous islands characterized by various different settings. It is therefore not a single explorable open world but the good old subdivision into progressive levels, where the difficulty increases in conjunction with the arrival of stronger enemies and more complex puzzles. The control system is entrusted to the classic virtual pad on the screen, a solution that carries with it the usual intrinsic defects but which in this case are also rather mitigated by a good response to commands, as well as the possibility of using an MFI controller. The basic structure involves the destruction of various totems within each world and then the boss fight, with enemies to eliminate and puzzles to solve, usually related to the activation of switches, the need to avoid traps and move elements of the scenario. Occasionally one comes across chests (here's Zelda again) containing power-ups to be applied to the equipment of the protagonist, who can in this way modify the characteristics of her dress (increasing energy and defense) and of the barrel, with the possibility of expanding the attack damage and the characteristics of the hook, which acts as a grappling hook. The equipment can be modified according to the elements unlocked at the beginning of each level, which allows different approaches in terms of attack and movement depending on the power-ups used, which also modify the appearance of Ametto Rosso. The mechanics of the game are well studied and it is clear that behind the game there is a structured project on the part of the developers, even if the level design never reaches great peaks and the dynamics remain practically unchanged for large stretches, beyond of the purely aesthetic changes introduced by the various explorable worlds. In this regard, the design of The Legend of Skyfish is truly commendable, with charming hand-drawn graphics with a fairytale taste that fits perfectly with the overall atmosphere.", "date": "2016-08-31", "grade": "8.2"}
