A couple of months after the third collection, here instead we have to further investigate this arrival of the first titles on PlayStation 4. It would be nice to be able to say that everything went in the right direction, but unfortunately there are many problems and most of them derive from a probably hasty conversion. One cannot fail to praise the choice to finally bring the whole saga to the Olympus of sixty frames per second, but the flaws generated by this choice must be put on the plate. Nothing irrecoverable, indeed Square Enix has already run for cover with a double patch and with further updates announced for the next few days, but we are called to judge and this always brings burdens, as well as honors. Let's analyze the two collections separately with the titles that compose them. Kingdom Hearts returns once again to PlayStation, now with a stunning 60 frames per second Playstation 4 trophies As for the trophy collection, this edition of Kingdom Hearts will put all hunters to the test. The four playable titles inside all have about fifty trophies to collect, divided into the classic bronze, silver, gold and the coveted platinum. The overall duration of the hunt will hardly settle under two hundred hours of play, assuming you are already quite accustomed to the series and that the critical mode is not totally insurmountable. Kingdom Hearts HD I.5 Remix The first collection present in the full-bodied package arrived on the Sony flagship, does not differ from its PlayStation 3 version in terms of content. Inside you will find the first chapter, with all the extras and adjustments of the Final Mix version, initially released only in Japan and arrived to us thanks to the first remastered. Alongside it, the port of the HD version of Kingdom Hearts RE: Chain of Memories, a title that, precisely because of its hybrid nature, was less affected by the problems we are going to analyze. To complete the package there will be a series of films, accompanied by some simple documents, which go to create the Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days film. Let's start from the latter, which like its counterpart that we will see later for the second collection, tends to remain totally unchanged compared to a few years ago. Even the cutscenes, a weak point of the main titles in terms of cleaning and compression, seem not to have suffered too much from the porting carried out. It is therefore difficult to find something to complain about this extra of the collection, which is none other than a long filmed interlude lasting about three hours. It is one of the most discussed and exciting plot sections that the saga has given us and it would be a shame to lose it in view of the conclusion that we hope will arrive soon. As for the other two, totally playable in what are visually the best versions that can be found on the market, the matter is substantially different. As we mentioned before, what makes this conversion incredibly tasty for all players is the possibility to experience the entire saga at 60 frames per second. This is an epochal leap for Kingdom Hearts, a title that only achieved this goal in the recent Kingdom Hearts II.8 Final Chapter Prologue. Where everything seems to be a daydream, with finally remastered menus and screen cleaning that makes you cry out for a miracle, it is precisely the doubling of the frames that creates the biggest problems. If in Chain of Memories this is perceived less, given its proximity to card games, in the Final Mix version of the first chapter it is difficult not to notice a certain lack of balance in the experience. It's as if Square Enix had forgotten to test the title after boosting it, with the result that the explosion of colors on the screen soon turns into a series of curses for some bosses that are too fast; or because of Sora's attacks that are generated at twice the speed and are unmanageable. These sensations are difficult to test in the first hours of the game, when the gameplay is not yet able to create the frenzy that is experienced in particular clashes such as those of the Dark Fortress, or the return to the Destiny Islands. All this is seasoned with a compression of the cutscenes (these remained at 30 frames per second) which mortally lowers their brightness and adds a ~dirty~ effect which is honestly a stab in the heart. Assaid before, it is a work which, following a series of patches, will be completely resolved and will leave you with the best collection you can expect, but which currently cannot be ignored in the final judgment of the title arrived on market. Kingdom Hearts HD II.5 Remix As for the second collection present in the package, this one sees within it the versions, always Final Mix, of Kingdom Hearts II and Birth by Sleep, combined with the films of Kingdom Hearts RE: Coded. By dismissing the latter as made for the equivalent of the first collection, we are faced with a series of films and documents which, together, form the canvas of one of the least successful titles in the saga. Initially released for Nintendo DS and presented as a title that would have filled the gap between Kingdom Hearts II and the subsequent third chapter, it turned out instead to be a set of recycles and reshuffles of the old plots, relegating the fulcrum of the horizontal plot to the final bars only. However, the two most popular chapters of the series take care of filling this void. Kingdom Hearts II, a direct sequel to the first chapter and a game capable of leaving its mark on an entire generation of gamers, joins what is still considered by many to be the best title in the saga. Birth by Sleep, initially released as an exclusive for the glorious PlayStation Portable, still represents the spearhead of a saga that has reached full narrative and gameplay maturity over the years. The two titles, in their new versions at sixty frames per second, are a feast for the eyes. The now native 1080p resolution and the total disappearance of aliasing make it a pair of titles that are also and above all advisable for fans of the series who know them by heart. Net of cutscenes that are always out of step with the times and with serious compression problems, the two titles are undoubtedly in their best incarnation. If the whole is joined by loads that are close to non-existent, the picture is as beautiful as it is completed. Unfortunately, not even these two works are exempt from the problems of the other collection. The lack of balance in the gameplay generates a series of clashes that make you shiver. Those who are not an expert on the saga could even find themselves taken aback by supersonic bosses and a camera that is sometimes almost too reactive. What makes the most noise is the fact that some sections, such as the very famous battle of the thousand Heartless, are populated by a disproportionate series of enemies that move at a substantially lower frame rate, generating an almost ridiculous screen effect. As with the first chapter, these problems are not encountered a lot in the early stages of the adventures, but explode when the clashes take on the frenzy of more advanced battles. We highly trust Square Enix to fix all these problems, but to think that they themselves have only been faced with the truth after user reports generates a rather bitter smile.", "date": "2017-04-01", "grade": "8.0"}
