This is the review of the third chapter, but the vote applies to the series as a whole. If you have not played the previous two chapters you will find in the text references to the plot that perhaps you would like to avoid knowing. Therefore if you want to get an idea of the game we advise you to read only the final box and the reviews of chapters one and two. A Murder of Ravens raises the story after the central part, disappointing compared to the excellent opening chapter, but fails underneath different aspects, leaving the impression that there were scheduling problems in the KING Art Games offices. What started out as a meticulously studied yellow has evolved into a game to be closed quickly by limiting the damage. An opportunity only half wasted, because The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief is still a decent adventure that boasts an articulated plot and a cast of exciting characters. Unfortunately, however, it fails to exploit its potential to the end. A striking example is the absence of Zellner as a player character in this last chapter. We already missed him after the few scenes of the central episode and now we have confirmation that he was the real star of the game. In addition to Adil therefore, of which we have already made acquaintance, we now take the commands of Alex, his fiance. Both are pleasant and intriguing when they use the prejudices of others against them to disguise their plans, but they are no match for Zellner, who brought a breath of fresh air to the crowded salon of handsome and handsome heroes. The butler Inch, on the other hand, is still an excellent antagonist, wicked to the right point and excellently characterized by his voice actor. However understandable his motivations are, the means chosen make him a pathetic and dangerous man. So it would have been nice if he had even more power, while instead he ends up being duped in a somewhat gross way. In addition to Zellner's absence, we were sad to see how much the potential represented by the rest of the characters has been lost, which in the end prove to be little more than extras. In this episode, which compared to the previous chapter gives space to dialogues, we discover better the personality of the violinist, the novelist and above all the German doctor who had tried to kill Zellner. Each of them reveals lights and shadows that we had not suspected and, just when we wanted to know more, they leave the scene without completing their narrative arc, with the exception of Dr. Gebhardt, whose story crosses that of Itch. It's not correct to give so much space to the archaeologist and the child's mother aboard the train and the ship in the previous episodes and then abandon them like this, without even a nod just when the time has come to draw conclusions. And even more so if this happens with a key character like Inspector Legrand. On closer inspection, however, all this is due to a very specific stylistic choice. In fact, the second half of the game is told from Adil's point of view, so it turns simultaneously with the events experienced earlier as Zellner and consequently does not advance the story. The feeling therefore is that a large piece is missing before the grand finale. And in fact the conclusion falls like a boulder from the sky rather than inserting itself as the decisive, inevitable but unpredictable piece of a well-constructed plan. But now let's take a step back and go back to the ship: that's where we left Adil and Alex, his beautiful American girlfriend, and that's where the narrative of A Murder of Ravens begins. A Murder of Ravens closes the adventure with dignity, but far from the joyous vitality of the first act Another story We have already mentioned that the entire third chapter is narrated from Adil's point of view. The idea of having us personally carry out the actions that take place behind the scenes in the thrillers is excellent but, in the case of Legacy of a Master Thief, where everything takes place in confined spaces, it forces us to go through settings already visited from scratch in Zellner's shoes . If we add those of the second to those of the third chapter, we see that more than half of the game takes place in places we have already been. We also already know what the result of our actions will be. There is always the pleasure of discovering how the thief actually managed to trick us with such elegance, but we must admit that the solutions, once discovered, lose the charm and aura of magic they had when seen through Zellner's eyes. In the case of the display case kept inside the museum, it seems that the carelessness of those who had to think about safety made the theft possible.age of the jewel than Adil's skill. In any case there is a positive side and that is that until the end we do not know what the true identity of the Crow is, and whether or not Adil and Alex will succeed in their parallel plans. The interweaving of the plot and the ambiguity of the dialogues therefore compensate at least in part for the lack of that pleasant excitement we felt when the trip to Switzerland began. The question of the puzzles remains which, as is fitting now that the story reaches its climax, become more ingenious than the previous ones, even if they remain on mild levels for anyone with a minimum of experience. Even in this case, however, we note the general haste that characterized the second half of the adventure and in fact some puzzles are poorly designed, such as the one that allows us to endlessly sneak into the museum and add Adil's name to the guest list. They may seem like little things but these are precisely the details that break the illusion of verisimilitude that King Art Games had managed to create so well during the first few hours of the game. To listen aloud What has never failed in the course of the game, from the first to the third chapter, is the very high quality of the acting and the music. The voice actors' interpretation brings out the nuances hidden between the lines of dialogue and every conversation is always a pleasure to listen to. That's why we felt so much about the lack of interaction between the characters throughout the second chapter. Fortunately, things improve in the finale and we can deal with characters like Inch or the ship's doctor, who finally have the opportunity to stage their dramatic depth. Unfortunately, from a technical point of view, small annoyances such as the difficulty of the protagonist in finding the path and sensitive points positioned inaccurately arise again. Even the scenarios alternate in quality and, with the exception of the attic of the museum and the interior of the ship, suffer from an excessive lack of detail. Especially outside the museum, one has the sensation of being on those film sets where everything is fake, even the houses. The characters however retain their sense of solidity and are once again carefully animated. Trying to retrace the gaming experience from the beginning we see an adventure that promises very well and offers at least three or four hours out of ten of engaging investigations with an unusual and likeable character. Then you lose and water down the experience until the last chapter which, between ups and downs, sums up and at least tries to bring attention to the best elements of the game.", "date": "2013-10-10", "grade": "7.0"}
