{"name": "Rainbow Six 3", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rainbow-six-3_a.html", "text": "Go Zulu! Given the complexity of managing a special team like the Rainbow Six, the orders given will have to be perfectly coordinated. Thus, in some cases we will be able to give an instruction to the team and leave it in a sort of ~standby~, waiting to give the order to act (with the voice command ~go zulu!~ if you use the headset). If a room has more than one entrance, with the right coordination it will be much easier to break in from multiple sides at once, to surround the enemy. Lethal. I open, flash and clean... Although the missions in which the members of the Rainbow Six take part are the result of the imagination of Tom Clancy and the other screenwriters, the references to the real world are so clear-cut as to make the player's involvement very high. As part of the Special Counter-Terrorism Team, we will often hear about OPEC, organized terrorist groups, international organizations and much more. All framed in the very near future, almost with the aim of proposing a possible international scenario for the years to come. Disturbing, no doubt. Even before proceeding to the actual development, behind this game there is a great work of drafting the background in which our chosen soldiers must move, and a maniacal care in adapting what Tom Clancy wrote on the screen. If you want to have a more precise idea of the stories you are going to experience, you can only do one thing: take your hands off the joypad and start reading one of the books by this talented writer, then you can take command of the team much more naturally. Ubisoft has done a great job in reverse engineering the Xbox version released several months ago, obtaining excellent results, despite the marked technical differences between the two consoles. Friends call me Dead Meat... Graphically one can only be positively impressed: apart from some inevitable resizing in the level of detail in the polygonal models and in the definition of the textures, we are facing a conversion of the highest level. Above all, the management of the lights is remarkable, which in such a game are of fundamental importance, from the lamps to the lit fireplaces. The sound component is also of sure impact, starting with the dialogues and dubbing of the introductory sequences of each level, but also for the in-game voices of our fellow soldiers. A worthy side dish also the music creates the right atmosphere, always proving to be well suited to the various situations, ranging from subdued pieces during stealth actions to very engaging pieces in moments of greater excitement. Although the actions, the possibilities of movement and in general the management of the team is very complete and detailed, the Dual Shock performs very well, making it extremely intuitive to manage a team of four people, starting with our character. What is certain is that the use of headphones is highly recommended, to fully automate the operations of all the components of the Rainbow Six but also to really feel at the center of the action, on the front line. Compared to the copy tested on the occasion of the preview, Ubisoft has worked on the code by filing, at least in part, the imperfections found, especially with regard to artificial intelligence and overall the level of difficulty. So now even the ~recruit~ level becomes a good training ground for those unfamiliar with tactical shooters, which is combined with a constant growth in the level of difficulty of the objectives to be completed. If all this already makes Rainbow Six an excellent game for the single player, all that surrounds the main adventure should not be forgotten, and we assure you that it is no small thing. Starting with the new cooperative mode for two players, taking advantage of the horizontal split-screen: interesting and original, even if the reduced view due to the cut screen can sometimes penalize the success of the action. What arouses greater interest, however, is the multiplayer via the internet, with which to manage a team of four people in one of the maps specifically designed for deathmatches, some of which are new compared to the Xbox version. Here you will really feel the need to communicate through the headset, and it will not be easy to maintain the right coordination between the components, but with the right practice, after a few failures, the challenges against other flesh-and-blood opponents will become very exciting. You will only have to arm yourself with a lot of patience, and choose the remote members of your group well, on pain of easy defeat if you fail to manage the dialogue carefullyamong people. Easier said that done. Comment I think the verdict is very clear: Rainbow Six is a candidate to be a title that will arouse great attention in the community of players, both for those who will play it within their own four walls and for those who will experience the pleasure of forming a team to give life to the challenges on the network. Strengthened by a remarkable technical realization and the many additions in the transition from Xbox to PS2, it will also be appreciated by those who have already had the opportunity to play it on the Microsoft console. And the well-calibrated difficulty level could also be a good incentive for limitless frag lovers to try a strategic title. Pros: Excellent technical realization Many game modes and extras Well calibrated difficulty Cons: AI sometimes not up to par Multiplayer online a bit chaotic After a ~pad in hand~ preview that allowed us to understand the strengths and weaknesses of this Ubisoft port from Xbox to PS2, the definitive version of Rainbow Six has all the premises to become a top title among tactical shooters. While clashing with other great titles, the creation resulting from the novels of Tom Clancy can face the comparison head-on.", "date": "2004-03-31", "grade": null}
