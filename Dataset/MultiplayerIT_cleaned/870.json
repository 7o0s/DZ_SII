{"name": "Medal of Honor European Assault", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/medal-of-honor-european-assault.html", "text": "There is an unwritten rule that has been common to most video games for years: the initial phase must be the best the game can offer. If the beginning amazes the rest of the game is appreciated accordingly and perhaps many small errors magically ~disappear~ from view. Medal Of Honor European Assault does everything to go against this rule. The first mission and the first impact make us fear the worst, then luckily Honor, medals and glory. The Medal Of Honor series has always stood out for an average high quality and for a satisfying and optimal balance between the realistic side and the playful side. This European Assault tries to twist this balance a bit. The result is somewhat perplexing at first. The mistakes are many. To make it more ~playful~ some ugly graphic icons have been introduced to indicate the presence of ammunition and medkits. A green cross that levitates above a medical kit in the middle of a battlefield certainly doesn't help to identify oneself Another distortion are the resurrection kits argh!- which act as extra lives. These were created to make long  though not to the prequel levels  less frustrating missions where you can't save until you've reached the end. Finally there is an ~adrenaline~ bar which allows, once loaded, to activate a mode with infinite ammunition and a slowdown of enemies. Useless and definitely out of place. We also tried to change the pace of the game. The first two episodes on consoles were more reflective and based on long stakeouts and slow ambushes albeit with some jolts every now and then. The stratagem found to make the action a little faster is quite subtle. In practice, both the medical bottles and the ammunition left by the enemies disappear -argh!- after some time. This forces fast recovery runs hoping to have adequately cleared the area before the dive out of cover. Before having become familiar with this procedure, he will curse quite a bit after once again running out of ammunition in full mission. Yes, because the programmers have left very few fixed ammunition! We combine everything with a couple of initial levels with quite dubious graphics, atmosphere and gameplay and the circle is closed, but The indiscreet charm of destruction. To make the game more realistic, the focus was on less visible sectors but still important in the long run. The ~cover~ system behind walls, windows, trees, etc. it has been perfected and made more intuitive and precise. Now you can also lie down as well as crouch down and this gives you unprecedented solutions for finding adequate shelter. Staying covered is even more essential than in the previous chapters even if the ~one shot, one kill~ against the player is rarer. Enemy AI has improved exponentially. They shoot at the right moment, lurk, hide, move to avoid being hit by the sniper rifle, throw grenades, move consistently in groups, etc. All very nice albeit with some typical errors - enemies that appear out of nowhere or animated in an unfortunate way for example - but very rare. What I don't like is that the enemies never reload, so much so that a soldier with a ridiculous machine gun is enough to get the same effect as a stationary machine gun. The linearity of the levels has been hidden well enough. They seem broader and give the possibility of being approached quite differently, but in the end that's the way to go. The pre-packaged situations are reduced and better hidden even if sometimes the game ~must~ make certain things happen. Certainly the whole game does not offer anything new by drawing heavily both from the prequels and from the other exponents of its genre. What is certain is that most of the time everything was packaged very well. The atmosphere in the missions following the first two begins to be felt, the tension grows and the curses against that determined ~coward~ - but much more obscene and heavy words are used! - who tried to kill us explode with violence. We have fun, and a lot too. We are in hand a game with many small defects but satisfying, with all the errors of the genre, but damn pleasant. Let's say that EA -understood as Electronic Arts- has learned to build a mannered title and sometimes maybe a little flat, but which does its dirty job: entertain. I see explosions, I hear gunshots Just as there are many and varied things to do, the graphics sector is solid and pleasant. The settings are very different from each other and, albeit within certain limits, original. The fact that the game is spread over several fronts has allowed the creation of French villages, African deserts, Russian cities, makesctories, country villages, cemeteries, churches and more. We go from the sands of the desert to the snow. All made with an engine rightly full of details and some pleasant lighting effects. Good enemy animations. Perhaps the slightly blurry and indetailed textures and an excessive ~plasticity~ of the visual aspect that was not there in the previous episodes - more devoted to realism - leave a little dumbfounded. Finally, the sound is on excellent levels, especially as regards the effects. They are so accurate and well mixed with the excellent dubbing that the beautiful music almost annoys when it starts, but it is a matter of a moment to realize the good work of underlining they have done. All three for you. Absolute novelty of the series is the presence of some men to command. In each mission we can direct three characters managed by the CPU. Even if you can only tell them the position to reach and clean up, they allow if well managed to offer an additional aspect to the game. Their presence to tell the truth is almost never influential for the successful completion of the mission and sometimes they seem completely superfluous. It must be said that a discreet AI, which allows them to make quite realistic and coherent movements, and a minimal ~attachment~ effect give the player the idea of not being alone. Absurdly in their stupidity and at times uselessness they make the player feel even more present in a real battle and not a solitary Rambo. A feature just mentioned that will need more attention in the future. And among others... Another novelty of EA is the presence of certain enemies - mostly Nazi hierarchs - to be eliminated during the course of the missions. Various objectives are assigned during the game through the exploration of every single inch of the level and mathematically towards the end the order is given to assassinate a shady figure faster and more resistant than the others. The addition is not a burden, but it's nice to look for some slightly different tactics to face these characters, even if most of the time you can hardly even see their faces! Comment and vote Certainly not a perfect game this Medal Of Honor. It contains all the typical errors of its kind plus other unpublished ones found by the developers. But it is undoubtedly well done, well made and well built. Here, maybe built is just the right word understood in the negative. It lacks a soul. But does it matter? It's fun and solid. The proposed situations are very varied, all pleasant and captivating. It never falls into the banal despite being a collage of things already seen and this is a great quality. The technical sector is at good levels. The graphics are pleasant and functional, always fluid and with some interesting gems  the play of light in one of the churches present is very pleasing to the eye. The sound is as usual on excellent levels. Fans of the series after enduring the changes described can only be fascinated by this very pleasant title. What is certain is that this Medal Of Honor will not make war shooters appreciated by those who really do not digest them.
