{"name": "Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ghost-in-the-shell-stand-alone-complex.html", "text": "The Ghost in the Machine Drawing on the plot of the recently produced TV series, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex sees Major Kusanagi and his companions engaged in an investigation concerning the trafficking of secret technologies, which will lead to large-scale implications of the various Japanese ministries. Halfway between Metal Gear Solid and Tomb Raider, you'll wander through levels with different features to achieve precise objectives each time (activation of a switch, interception of a character, elimination of an opponent and etc). The characters you can control are Motoko Kusanagi and Bato, who alternate depending on the mission: the first is more suitable for infiltrations, the second is ideal for open-faced offensives. Once a particular opponent is knocked out, its codes can be copied to enable hacking against its kind. The Ghost in the Machine To get the better of your opponents, you can use firearms (machine guns of various kinds, rifles, pistols but also rocket launchers) and additional accessories (normal and electromagnetic mines, throwing knives...), or rely on your bare hands in sequences that they recall the clashes seen in the Matrix trilogy due to the ~slow-motion~ effect that is applied when the decisive blow is delivered. Everything is managed in this way: with the L1 back key you use the equipped firearm, with the L2 key you use the accessories or martial arts. You have to collect firearms, mines and everything else along the various stages, perhaps taking them away from a defeated enemy. Each firearm has a limited number of bullets, which can be restored by picking up the same type of weapon again and which allows us to evaluate from time to time whether it is better to pick up a different weapon or keep the one with an almost empty magazine. The aiming system is manual and is revealed through a viewfinder that is always in sight, which turns red when the target is within shooting range. The thing changes in the case of sniper rifles, equipped with two levels of magnification and a greater probability of resolving conflicts with a single shot (to the head, of course). Game structure If the objectives of each mission are almost always made clear by the briefings, by the radio interventions (rather frequent, which form the backbone of the plot and the subplots) and, in particular, by some indicators on the screen, the situation for regarding their achievement. Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex is a game with an extremely interesting plot, perfectly in line with Shirow's original intentions (that is, to create scenarios full of conspiracies, political machinations and exaggerated technologies), hilarious in some dialogues (between Bato and his armored sidekick), and turns out to be quite full-bodied as you progress. However, at the beginning it is decidedly difficult, in particular due to the particular control system, which sees the fundamental actions assigned to the back keys instead of those of the pad. The sensitivity of these keys is not exceptional, and you have to get used to the movements of the character, as well as to expect a large series of deaths due to pressing the wrong button at a crucial moment. Fortunately, the controls are fully customizable, so you don't necessarily have to go through a period of ~study~ before becoming familiar with the actions available to you. Once you understand the mechanics of movement and the logic of the ~puzzles~, the game takes off: you will find yourself in the middle of frenetic action, with enemies firing from all directions to hit you and you alternating between the use of firearms and powerful kicks. Direct offensives are strongly discouraged in GITS: Stand Alone Complex, so going head-on into a small army will result in a quick rout. But moving from one cover to another, taking down the targets one by one and in different ways, will still give you excellent results and great satisfaction. To all this is added the possibility of carrying out ~hacking~ with the aim of controlling enemies: once a particular opponent has been knocked out, it is possible to copy the codes to enable hacking against his fellows. At that moment you will be able to see the position of all enemies of that type in the area, and try to check those marked with a blue color triangle. As soon as you are close enough, you have to press the X key and start a procedure that involves overcoming a variable number of blocks (depending on the stage: the further you go, the more difficult it becomes), by interlocking rotating gears that sometimes they go at impossible speeds. Perform the hacking often proves to be a difficult practice, but in some cases it really makes your life easier: as an enemy, you can wipe out his companions by hitting them from behind, almost completely cleaning up the area. Technical impressions The making of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex is top notch. The characters have been designed using a large number of polygons and high quality textures, which makes them extremely faithful to the equivalents seen in the anime. And they move very well, showing off animations that are not very varied but of a certain quality. The design of the stages is up to the situation, with the usual ups and downs but with a satisfactory level of detail, undermined only by the sporadic presence of defects in the polygonal construction. Each level is introduced by a briefing and an animated sequence, and the workmanship of the latter is always excellent. The speech relating to the sound sector is different, a little subdued: the voices in English are passable, while the music is often completely out of place. The game has Italian subtitles, but unfortunately something is inevitably lost when radio communications occur in the middle of a mission: either you read the texts on the screen or you avoid enemy fire. An option for deathmatches for two or four players has been added to the main game mode, which however does not add anything to the final value of the product. Comment Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex is an excellent action game and perfectly recreates the atmosphere of the series from which it is taken, even adding a pinch of mystery within a very articulated and interesting plot, which unfolds little by little . The ~substance~ of the game is not at the level of the best exponents of the genre on PS2, but it is still a good level product, which can guarantee several hours of entertainment and which represents an excellent choice both for those who know the opera of Shirow, both for those who are completely unaware of it (and can take advantage of the opportunity to remedy). Pros: Excellent graphics Equipped with a certain depth Engaging plot Cons: Difficult control system, at the beginning Subdued sound compartment Year 2029: computers dominate every aspect of daily life, and artificial intelligences are now equipped with self-awareness. Some cyborgs equipped with the so-called ~ghost~, or the synthetic replica of a human soul, represent the last frontier for military applications and, in particular, for the secret services. Major Motoko Kusanagi, commander of Section 9, is the living example of what such an automaton is: a charming woman who thinks like a real person, assisted in her work by another cyborg, Bato (perhaps more ~sensitive  of her, actually), and by human agents. The reason why cyborgs perform Section 9's missions is obvious: they have superhuman abilities in terms of physical strength, agility, reflexes and endurance. In addition, they can connect to the electronic brain of their enemies, in some cases, to be able to command them from a distance. [C] Hitting enemies with your bare hands certainly saves you bullets... ...and gives life to very spectacular sequences! Split screen deathmatches do not revolutionize the playful possibilities of Stand Alone Complex. [/C]", "date": "2005-07-11", "grade": null}
