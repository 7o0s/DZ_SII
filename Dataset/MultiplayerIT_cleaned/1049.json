{"name": "Donkey Kong: King of Swing", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/donkey-kong-king-of-swing-2.html", "text": "Swinga that passes you King of Swing presents itself as a curious hybrid between platform and puzzle game, relying on an absolutely unconventional play structure: essentially, the user has the task of commanding the famous Nintendo gorilla within a series of levels from predominantly vertical extension, all simply relying on Donkey Kong's ability to hang and swing (the ~swing~ that gives the game its title, precisely) on special supports visible on the screen. In short, a sort of extreme free climbing. The holds necessary for the ascent are clearly identifiable as colored balls, which can be arranged in single units or arrayed in series, forming real climbing walls. On a practical level, however, the user's action is expressed using almost exclusively the back keys of the Game Boy Advance: pressing L or R therefore causes Donkey Kong to move left or right on land, while a solicitation simultaneous pressing of both buttons allows the gorilla to make a vertical jump useful for reaching the first available grips. Once in flight, it is necessary to use the back buttons again to hold on to the supports within reach of the arms (the left or the right, relative to the button pressed) of the furry protagonist: in doing so, our gorilla will rotate around the point of support, ready to hover towards the direction dictated by the release of the dedicated backbone. The climbs of King of Swing are therefore made up of rapid passages from one hold to another, with the user having to have a good game in correctly directing the gorilla towards the desired goal, always paying attention to the timing necessary to grab a support at the moment Right. Easier to assimilate than to describe, the gameplay of King of Swing, however, is not reduced to the mere ascent towards the end of the level, but also has various elements capable of hindering the player in his endeavor. Calm and cool The various stages are in fact dotted with enemies, barrels and impediments of various kinds, which must be promptly eliminated in order to continue: this is made possible by the loaded attack supplied by Donkey Kong, which can be carried out following a simultaneous pressure of L and R a couple of seconds long. The bananas could not be missing, which in King of Swing are scattered within the game scenarios and which must be meticulously collected by the user, in order to be able to spend them during the action to recover part of the lost energy (key B ) or to gain invincibility and increased momentum power for a short time (A button). This is essentially what King of Swing has to offer: and although the Nintendo product appears to be fairly fun and varied at first (thanks to a whole series of variations on the theme present within the levels, such as levers to pull or stones to throw always exploiting the oscillatory motion of Donkey Kong), soon one begins to glimpse its great limits. King of Swing is in fact the victim of an often terribly irritating level design: too much contact with an enemy (frequently caused by the ineffectiveness of the gorilla's attack), a badly calibrated jump or a fraction of a second delay in grabbing to a support they are enough to force the user to have to repeat an entire climb all over again, with the deleterious results that it is possible to imagine. Moreover, the game tends to get boring sooner than it should, due to an original gameplay, but which probably lacks a sufficient charge of dynamism. King of Swing is also a decidedly short title in its main mode, flanked exclusively by a series of certainly not extraordinary mini-games. The general underlying flatness of the Nintendo product is also reflected in its technical realization: graphically, King of Swing shows off an average cosmetics, overall rather poor in details but still functional to the type of game. The menus and above all the stage map, horrible from every point of view, are an exception. Finally, on the sound front, the classic series of ~nintendo~ effects and a rather repetitive musical accompaniment should be noted, which certainly does not help the user to get rid of the irritation caused by the design of different game stages. Comment Donkey Kong: King of Swing is a title with discrete premises, which however is irreparably ruined by a level design that is too often unbalanced and irritating and by a general underlying flatness of the game action, which would have needed some more elements to be more stimulating. However, the product Nintendo cannot be considered a failure on all fronts, on the contrary: the basic idea is original, some found within the internships are really intelligent and the title in general can be a pleasant pastime for some. But the poor longevity and the tendency to become boring and repetitive certainly don't make King of Swing one of the best exploits of the gorilla with the tie. Pros: Original basic idea Initially pleasant and fun Cons: Poorly calibrated level design Short and not very intense Generally rather flat Recently the protagonist of several titles for Gamecube and Game Boy Advance, the good old Donkey Kong seems to have taken a liking to lend his cumbersome image almost exclusively to products with decidedly atypical concepts. With Donkey Konga (and the next Jungle Beat) taking advantage of the picturesque Bonga peripheral, the ape proved on Gamecube that he is able to combine originality with quality: now, a very similar challenge is presented to him in the portable field , just with this Donkey Kong: King of Swing.", "date": "2005-02-04", "grade": null}
