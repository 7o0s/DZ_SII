{"name": "Tappa che ti passa!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/69130-lets-tap-tappa-che-ti-passa.html", "text": "In the last few months we have been able to get to know the ideas of some developers about the control system in games with motion detection. There are those who support the use of a controller such as the Wii-mote or the Magic Wand, while those who completely eliminate the physicality by adopting a solution made up of sensors and video cameras. Certainly no one expected to be able to use a cardboard box to play, though! And this is exactly it the innovation brought by Let's Tap, the new SEGA title for Wii: inputs are transmitted to the Wii-mote indirectly, through the vibrations we produce. The controller must be placed horizontally on a box, with the A button facing downwards, and to play we simply have to tap our fingers on the cardboard, modulating the intensity of the shots according to the action we want to perform. This is undoubtedly an extraordinary intuition, but does the game manage to support it properly? Beat hard! Let's Tap is presented as a collection of five very different minigames, however united by the same control system. The first on the list is the ~Marathon~, a race that can be accessed by up to four players (equipped with as many Wii-motes and cardboard boxes) but which can also be played single-player by facing the CPU. In a two-dimensional context, our little man simply has to run and reach the finish line at the end of the stage before his opponents. In order for it to move quickly, we need to ~tap~ just as quickly and be careful to the intensity of the hits: clapping harder results in a jump, useful in many situations but counterproductive if our goal is simply to go fast. There are sixteen internships in all, they are proposed in sequence and gradually become more complex: traps, chasms, trampolines and so on appear. To overcome the more elaborate routes unscathed, it is necessary to practice and memorize each area, but attention to the intensity of the shots remains fundamental. It is undoubtedly the most representative minigame of Let's Tap, as well as the most multifaceted one. To play well you have to understand the mechanism and avoid panicking when you fall behind: one harder blow and you end up falling into a trap. The levels are very different from each other, new pitfalls are always proposed and the final result is really fun, especially in multiplayer with friends. The second minigame, ~Keep the tempo~, follows the various rhythm games we are used to and sees us tapping on the box when the bars of the song arrive on the screen. Following the rhythm allows us to get perfect shots (although the graphics are a bit deceptive), while we need to dose the strength of the shots by going through three levels of intensity (light, medium, heavy) which are visually represented by as many colors. Also in this case there are sixteen stages available, each with a different piece of music and more and more complex. Comparison with other exponents of the ~rhythmic~ genre is mandatory, and unfortunately ~Tieni il tempo~ comes out battered due to its excessive simplicity and essential aspect. Furthermore, being playable only in single, it does not benefit from the undoubted advantages of multiplayer in terms of fun. Blocks, spaceships and images ~Silent blocks~ is a clone of Jenga (or ~Torremoto~, to put it in Italian) in which we find ourselves removing pieces from towers formed by stacked discs. We have to tap to stop the indicator and select the disc of interest, tap again to determine the direction in which we will ~pull~ the piece and then hit several times with precision to remove it from the tower without it collapsing. The game does not have a stage structure, but can be played ~without limits~ or in ~alchemist~ mode: in the first case you necessarily play as a group, and the person who misses first (causing the tower to collapse) loses; in the second case, you play alone and everything becomes a bit like a block puzzle game, with those of the same color that are eliminated if put together in groups of three. Although deeper than the previous minigame, ~Silent Blocks~ also suffers from the excessive simplicity of the concept and despite the multiplayer mode it does not offer very long-lasting entertainment. The situation improves with ~Space bubble~, a minigame with great potential: we are in a real horizontal scrolling shoot and run, with the difference that there are no enemies to attack us but only fixed obstacles to avoid or eliminate. To move our character, in an exclusively two-dimensional context, we have to ~tap~ and take into account the force of gravity that pulls usdown every time. It almost feels like playing one of those ~water games~ where the buttons send jets of air into the water. In this case, hitting harder allows us to fire missiles, and there are various power-ups. The action turns out to be quite funny right from the start, even if extremely repetitive. Moving taking into account inertia and dosing the strength of the blows is challenging and engaging, but the obstacles to be faced are more or less always the same and there does not seem to be a real progression. Finally, ~Illustrator~ is not a real minigame but an interactive screensaver, available in various ~fantasies~: fireworks, paint, river, cylinder and ink. It is possible to create sequences by alternating light, medium and strong strokes, obtaining different visual results. Looking for the perfect box Let's Tap is sold together with the SEGA ~official box~, but clearly it is possible to play using any cardboard box. We can adjust the intensity of the hits from the options screen and use a different box, more or less rigid, to get an experience tailored to us. Technical realization ~Casual games~ generally don't focus on spectacular graphics, rather they look for functionality or at least style. In this sense, Let's Tap carries out its work in an honest but not extraordinary way, indeed in some cases it reaches points of disarming simplicity. Mode screensavers ~Illustrator~ are the most beautiful thing to see, while among the minigames the cutest and most complex is undoubtedly the ~Marathon~, with its wireframe graphics and ~psychedelic~ flavor. The characters are essential, they even seem to come out of a road sign, but they boast varied and good quality animations. The rest is decidedly inferior: the solutions adopted for the ~rhythmic~ minigame are really simplistic, and the same can be said for ~Silent Blocks~ and ~Space Bubble~, which present elementary polygonal models. The sound accompaniment instead boasts a certain personality, and between reminiscences of the 80s and synthetic music it can be listened to with great pleasure.", "date": "2009-07-23", "grade": "7.0"}
