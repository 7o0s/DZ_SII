From a return of a relic of the past like Frogger, therefore, it was difficult to expect great things, but as we see in the review of Frogger and the Rumbling Ruins, in this case the project was decidedly spot on. We are very far from the original concept and could not be otherwise, considering that the old Frogger almost belongs to the prehistory of video games, having been released in 1981, and nowadays it would be difficult to find meaning in a revival of what was in all respects a pioneering but very simple videogame experimentation. However, there is still something of that spirit even in this interesting update, which can be found above all in the general idea of moving the frog on a plane and the need to avoid dangers through evasive maneuvers. The difference is that, in this case, it is more about moving the surrounding environment (or at least parts of it) to create a safe path, rather than moving the frog directly with perfect timing, but somehow a common root can be found in the core mechanics of the puzzle. Again, the aim of the game is to reach the conclusion of the levels trying to cross a path that is as free of obstacles as possible, possibly also reaching diamonds to collect and frogs to save, which act as secondary objectives. All of this is inserted within a curious Indiana Jones-style setting, because apparently, in the meantime, our heroic frog of videogame origins has become a sort of explorer-archaeologist, so as not to miss anything. Cross-platform gameplay and mobile scenarios Frogger and the Rumbling Ruins, one of the first levels in the ruins The adventurous frog finds herself grappling with a rather daring mission: to explore the ruins of the ancient civilization of the Anurans, discovering its mysteries and possibly collecting its treasures, at the same time also saving as many sacrificial frogs from their ominous fate. The protagonist amphibian can only move on stable ground, making minimal jumps and therefore with the need to move one floor at a time. Considering that he finds himself maneuvering through intricate labyrinthine ruins, the only possibility of reaching the finish line of each level (and possibly also collecting the secondary objectives) is to move some mobile platforms in order to create possible paths, according to the skills of movement of the protagonist. The gameplay of the puzzle is therefore based on identifying which pieces of scenery can be moved and studying their possible movements, possibly exploiting their joints to build paths that can take us to our destination, also collecting the largest possible amount of bonuses and frogs to save. It is clear that such a game is all based on level design and, from this point of view, the work done by Konami is truly remarkable: the scenarios, built in 3D and freely observable from all angles, have beautiful geometric structures with of a pleasant characterization in pre-Columbian archaeological style, but above all they are structured in such a way as to present intelligent challenges, with a good difficulty curve. Frogger and the Rumbling Ruins, a screenshot from the game After an initial phase of learning the mechanics, Frogger and the Rumbling Ruins progressively introduces various obstacles, enemies and traps at a good pace, thus keeping the attention focused for a rather long period of time. In the long run, the news inevitably decreases and a certain physiological fatigue takes over the action, which is inevitable in the course of 100 levels, but in the meantime it can be said that the game has largely achieved its goal.", "date": "2022-06-16", "grade": "7.8"}
