{"name": "E.T.- Op. Icebreak", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/et-op-icebreak.html", "text": "An interesting mix of genres I believe that the last real modern fighter simulator was Microprose's Falcon F4, on the other hand the new market trends show how companies focus more on less simulation titles, with the clear intention of embracing the widest possible audience. RAGE, which took over the EF project, has tried to focus attention on an aspect that is no less important and which is related to the longevity of a simulator, we are usually used to playing single missions or campaigns (the best ones are dynamic) , but the characters are almost never explored, nor do we go to the bottom of the events that form the background to the game, with the danger that then the missions are all a bit the same and therefore consequential there is the risk of lowering the level of interest in the game. What to do? It's simple to provide the game with a strong tactical/adventure connotation that makes EF Typhoon unique, but let's see in detail what it is. A new Strike Commander I don't know how many of you remember an old game called Strike Commander by Orgin, however EF Typhoon is the ideal sequel to that old game, where we played mercenaries from the skies who lend their service to the highest bidder, the background is totally different in EF Typhoon, because here the scenario is warlike and sees Iceland at the center of a Soviet invasion manoeuvre, what the two titles have in common and that in both of us we manage a team of pilots. At the beginning of the game we have to choose the six members of our team from a vast array of pilots, each with very specific characteristics, such as physical and psychological resistance, leadership and the possibility of working in a group, obviously with characteristics directly related to the flight. Once our team is formed, the game begins and it seems like we are watching a seamless film, where events happen in sequence and we witness their evolution by taking part in them. The interface is very simple and intuitive and it is possible to give commands to our pilots with a couple of clicks, we also have available the information of a television channel that updates us on the evolution of the story. Graphics and physical model At the time EF made a miracle cry, this does not happen with this title of RAGE, even if the level stands at excellent levels, as indeed the images that complete this article demonstrate. I really liked the progressive and localized damage that the device suffers, moreover the rain effect is rendered very well, but in general the textures are quite poor, and the polygonal models are not exceptional, the consequence of this is that however the game runs smoothly even on machines not belonging to the latest generation. The physical model is sufficient, certainly we are not dealing with a programming masterpiece, but it is not an arcade game either, what left me a little perplexed is the level of the AI of the enemies which has not proved to be very competitive, vice versa the Our Wingmen, who receive their orders from the tried and tested menu system, always carry out their tasks with diligence and precision. As I said before, we command a team and therefore we cannot take care of everyone at the same time, for this reason we can choose whether to fly a plane directly or leave the task exclusively to one of our men, furthermore a convenient interface system signals us if it happens something and therefore, at that point, we can decide whether to intervene directly or leave it to the AI. Conclusions Eurofighter Typhoon is a good game and represents an excellent compromise between a simulator, an arcade and a management, moreover this Add On, which includes a new scenario, does nothing but increase its value. The only real risk that the RAGE title runs, which is common to all games that attempt to bring together multiple genres and that in an attempt to satisfy everyone, in reality, does not satisfy anyone. I also remind you that the game will be released in our country, completely localized in Italian (with the exception of speech) in the next few days. Furthermore, despite being an Add-On, it does not require the old title, but is completely independent. From EF-2000 to Eurofighter Typhoon Upgrading a PC for a gamer is an event that is usually linked to the release of a game that deserves our attention so much, that it pushes us to a further outlay of money in order to be able to take full advantage of its features, for me one of these titles was the legendary EF 2000 by DiD (we're talking about 1995, a time when 3D graphics accelerators didn't exist yet), one of the best flight simulators ever made for PCs which, for the fewwho can't remember, the game had a staggering 640x480 resolution at the time. Since then, a lot of bits have passed through our CPUs, but I've always been attached to that simulator and so imagine my curiosity in seeing the definitive version of Operation Icebreak delivered to my home, the long-awaited Add-On of Eurofighter Typhoon, which represents the new chapter of this successful saga and which follows the publication of the successful titles based on the F 22 (Air Dominance Fighter and its Add-on Total Air War) by a few years.", "date": "2002-06-09", "grade": null}
