{"name": "Ritorno alle origini del Mana", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/171053-adventures-of-mana-ritorno-alle-origini-del-mana.html", "text": "Twenty-five years have passed since the release of the first Seiken Densetsu, or that Final Fantasy Adventure known in our part as Mystic Quest and today re-proposed under a new guise, with the title Adventures of Mana. However, what was the progenitor of the Mana series was born as a spin-off of Final Fantasy which, taking full inspiration from The Legend of Zelda, also represented Square Soft's first attempt to introduce action mechanics in its RPG series peak. However, the two universes ended up separating more and more, so much so that Mystic Quest itself was revived for the Game Boy Advance in 2003, with the title Sword of Mana and with a story in many parts different from the original. With this new remake, however, Square Enix has decided to take a step back, re-proposing one of the most exciting adventures experienced by players of the time in a more modern version. Adventures of Mana is a good remake for fans of the series, even if it's not without its flaws Knight for a day Unlike Sword of Mana, which had largely distorted the source material, Adventures of Mana avoids the temptation of unnecessary detours. The story of the hero, who must save the world from the evil Dark Lord, and of the heroine guardian of the magical Mana tree returns to be experienced from a single point of view. There is therefore no double campaign, but don't worry: it's a good thing that the line of Sword of Mana is not followed, which had proved to be more verbose and less engaging than the original. With its concise dialogues and with characters capable of getting into the good graces of the player with very few lines, Adventures of Mana in fact proposes a simple story, but no less compelling. The twists are not lacking and trigger a series of events that reach a climax in the final, which can still be counted among the saddest and most melancholy in the history of video games. But if the plot has been carefully safeguarded, the same cannot be said for the gameplay, which, fortunately, has undergone substantial changes. Combat system and interface are thus taken directly from Sword of Mana, which from this point of view had introduced some interesting innovations. The clashes are still in real time and managed with the press of a button for physical attacks and one for magical ones, but each weapon also has a special attack, different depending on the type and which depends on a special bar with refill at time. The arsenal does not differ only in terms of attack power, but offers specific bonuses (for example, the recovery of health points) and is indispensable in solving environmental puzzles. Exploration is a central element and the player is never accompanied by the hand: to continue you have to activate your brain, understand which tools you need and, sometimes, go around in circles to get to the bottom of some unclear clues . It will also often happen that you have to retrace your steps several times before you can advance. It is precisely this aspect, together with the combat system, that feels the weight of age the most: the objects dropped by the monsters are in fact far too important and in some circumstances it is necessary to repeatedly return to the same areas hoping for the right loot; the clashes themselves are all too simple, even against the bosses, due to a really lacking artificial intelligence, which does not even spare the allies. From time to time, in fact, some characters accompany the protagonist and on request each offer a different support skill. These can prove to be very useful, unlike their contribution in battle. PSVita trophies Adventures of Mana has 37 trophies, including platinum. There are 24 hidden ones and they can be easily unlocked by continuing the adventure; the others are secondary objectives, linked for example to reaching level 99 for the protagonist and obtaining the various types of objects. The road to platinum is so full of aimless grinds, as the game can be completed in up to seven hours, with the character level 45-50. Finally, we recommend collecting items related to exploration and loot before embarking on the final phase, given that once you reach the last dungeon it is impossible to go back (and there is no post-game). New foundations for the future? As mentioned above, Adventures of Mana's interface is also a direct legacy of the previous Game Boy Advance remake. Inventory management then passes through a ring menu, assisted by three quick keys, essential for quickly switching from one weapon to another while exploring the dungeons. From the menu you can then access weapons, armor, objects and spellssimilar, but here are also visible the statistics of the character, which increases at each level according to a division into four classes: warrior, monk, wizard and sage. Each class allows you to favor one statistic over the others, but basically the most important attribute remains strength, precisely by virtue of the underlying simplicity of the clashes. However there is an annoyance element, which makes the management of health points problematic, in the early stages of the game and beyond: the appearance of monsters when moving from one area to another. From this point of view, the work of the development team was in fact rather lacking: the world map (which is actually a planisphere) is in fact made up of many squares, which represent the different areas. Switching from one area to another requires a short load that not only breaks the pace of the game, but brings the monsters to the screen with a slight delay compared to the hero. Here then is that you can die simply because of a fortuitous collision with a giant pig that suddenly appeared. We would then have preferred to be able to choose to deactivate the touch keys, which bring a mobile HUD that is a little too intrusive and which compromises the view. Apart from that, the new 3D graphics, with the ~chibi~ style characters, didn't disappoint us at all and allowed for a better differentiation of the monsters on the map. Finally, the beautiful soundtrack is present both in the original version and in the rearranged version by Kenji Ito himself, or the composer who had also edited the music of Mystic Quest. The Italian translation is missing as expected: given the not excessive amount of text, perhaps Square Enix could have made a little more effort.", "date": "2016-07-11", "grade": "8.0"}
