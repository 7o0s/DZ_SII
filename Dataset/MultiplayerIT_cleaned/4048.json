It has contributed greatly to the affirmation of that which can now be defined as a real mobile declination of the JRPG, which has essentially become canonized on some of its basic characteristics: these are games focused above all on the development of the characters and on combat, which present a mostly linear story, practically devoid of free exploration and with quests that develop as a succession of pre-set clashes on sliding scenarios, usually ending with boss fights capable of spreading large amounts of loot. As a setting, it recalls the Valkyrie Profile series by Square Enix, from which it perhaps also drew inspiration both for the mechanics and the action influences and for the graphic style adopted, even if many characteristics, starting from the complex management of the party, present themselves decidedly different. In short, if you have played any of the recently released mobile JRPGs, you certainly have in mind the basic structure of these products, which in fact Brave Frontier has helped to crystallize in this form, just to give an idea of the importance of the series. Brave Frontier: The Last Summoner is a sort of spin-off of the series, being rather disconnected from the first two chapters, introducing new characters and a different story. Just the narrative component, to tell the truth, seems somewhat lame in its particular staging: the protagonist Brook and the various supporting actors find themselves involved in a war between humans and gods, which however is presented as a sort of collection of memories belonging to other characters. The idea is undoubtedly original, but the story struggles to find a certain narrative cohesion presented in this way, although it is undoubtedly a secondary element in the mechanics of Brave Frontier: The Last Summoner. Endless battles Detailing all the elements of Brave Frontier: The Last Summoner would end up turning this article into a long list of options, so we try to compact the information as much as possible. We find ourselves leading a party of five characters in various dungeons with progressive battles, each consisting of five waves of enemies and usually a final boss fight. A peculiar feature of the game is its widening the perspective in some cases to include clashes between entire armies, which does not change the basic setting of the clash but makes everything decidedly spectacular. There are a wide variety of game modes (story, harvest and various quests) which, however, are only variations on the main theme: the quests always develop in the same way described above, but depending on the mode they undergo some changes in the assortment of the party, in the type of enemies to be encountered and above all in the rewards that are obtained at the end of the fights, the latter necessary for the development of the characters. The combat system is particular and set on an interface that makes perfect use of the touch screen, another feature that demonstrates how this declination of the JRPG has undergone a mutation to better adapt to these platforms. Through simple vertical swipes it is possible to scroll through the various attack and defense options for all five fighters, touching the characters activates the actions of the individuals while scrolling horizontally it is possible to perform the selected moves all together. When this mechanic is combined with the Brave Bursts, or the special attacks that can be performed together by the various characters, we witness decidedly spectacular scenes, which push us to continuously improve the statistics of the fighters to see the increasingly destructive effects in battle. The multiplayer modes present in Brave Frontier: The Last Summoner partially come out of the standard setting, with the Arena in PvP and the Raids presenting a multiplayer PvE, both rather limited compared to the standard features of an MMO but which can still lead to interesting variations on the basic theme of the game. An important space in the structure of the game is occupied by the management and growth of the characters, as befits an RPG of this type, moreover going to fit into the complex system of in-game currencies present. New characters are acquired as a reward at the end of the fights or through the inevitable gacha mechanic, upon request for a payment in orbs. The latter representthe main currency in Brave Frontier: The Last Summoner, which can also be purchased with real money: in general, orbs are used to summon characters or recharge one's energy, given that the latter is consumed every time we take part in the quests in the various modes, regenerating by one point every approximately 4 minutes. In short, we are faced with the classic mechanics of a free-to-play, not too nagging but which still makes itself felt as you progress through the game. The other two ~coins~ are karma and gold, mostly used to upgrade characters or make them evolve through fusion. It is a well-established structure in the mobile sector, but which can rightly make those who do not appreciate the drifts of free-to-play turn up their noses: here the problem of compulsive buying is not so much linked to recharging energy, which is quite balanced, but rather the willingness to unlock new characters and improve them without relying on game rewards.", "date": "2018-09-26", "grade": "7.2"}
