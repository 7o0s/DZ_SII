{"name": "Scorn", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/scorn-recensione.html", "text": "A journey into horror: if we had to choose four words to describe Ebb Software's horror adventure, these would be them. Much has been said about the influences of H.R. Giger on the design of Scorn, but during the game's short campaign, other names also came to mind: from Clive Barker and the frightening cenobites of Hellraiser to David Cronenberg and the deformed flesh of Videodrome. Visually the work created by the Serbian team it is gruesome, both for what is shown and for the sounds, mostly laments, that accompany the story and express a narrative that needs no words, which develops through our desperate deeds and our search for an improbable salvation against the backdrop of an alien world, desolate and monstrous. Really interesting assumptions, sure, but do you match a solid project in every aspect? We tell you about it in the Scorn review. History Scorn, a torture machine We have just said it: the story of Scorn does not use dialogues or documents, it simply arises as the embodiment of a desperate path, which is consumed among the disturbing corridors of an enormous structure with alien appearances. The character we control is a man who wakes up in this mysterious place without understanding exactly how he ended up there, nor how long ago. What moves him is the faint hope that somewhere there is a way out, that it still exists a normal world to return to or in any case that it is possible to escape from the horror and creepiness that cling to every inch of the scenario in which it is found. The narration is purely visual and by choosing to move more or less quickly we will be able to give it a different rhythm, even if in general the duration of the game is around six hours. A not particularly exciting figure compared to the selling price, but we imagine that in the end that is a bit of a symbolic figure: on the one hand because for productions of this type different rules apply and we tend to consider more the intensity of the experience that not the actual game time; on the other hand because Scorn will be available at no additional cost to Xbox Game Pass subscribers from its release and it is obvious that the vast majority of users will try it this way. Gameplay Scorn, a sequence that remains impressed On the gameplay side, Scorn basically stands as a first-person adventure that gives a nod to survival horror. For most of the introductory phase we do not meet enemies or come into possession of weapons, yet it is precisely the first few hours that are the most traumatic, we are naturally referring to that pathetic form of life once human that we will have to carry around on a cart and who will not fail to beg us with his eyes and moans as we are about to sacrifice it in an excruciating way to be able to move forward. The puzzles are the fulcrum of the progression: in the huge structure that forms the backdrop to the campaign there are mechanisms, cages , slippery elevators and terminals, a mixture of biological tissue and metal, with which to interact by painfully grafting an appendage on the left hand and trying from time to time to understand what needs to be done to solve yet another puzzle, with the complexity of the scenario increasing gradually and is in itself an element of challenge. Scorn, the biological device for recharging health From this point of view, Ebb Software's approach is more or less ruthless like the world in which Scorn is set: there are no indicators or information, we will have to figure out what to do and how to do it ourselves, which switches can be activated and which ones cannot but above all why. At first we will feel lost just like the protagonist of the game, lost inside what appears to be a labyrinth made up of tunnels and rooms that are all more or less similar, but the structure of watertight compartments will help us get an idea of each single map. Then there are the fights, which however turn out to be the least successful part of the experience. We will gradually be provided with more powerful offensive tools, from a ~plunger~ with very slow reloading to a rifle that adapts the dispersion of fire to distance; from a devastating ~hat trick~ to a grenade launcher. We will be able to scrape up ammunition only at certain deposits and only in very limited numbers, while the pathetic creatures (three or four types, plus a single boss) that roam within the locations will be able to inflict huge damage on us and often determine our death. Scorn, a look at the architectures We had some problems with checkpoints, which in a central phase of the campaign forced us to repeat a dis section several timescretely long because we were left with little vital energy and few bullets: a nightmare situation, from which the game didn't seem to want to take us away, and which can give life to very unlucky rescues in which we proceed between trials and errors in an attempt to overcome certain sequences without the ability to withstand even a single blow. Even the possible health recharge is in fact managed sparingly, obviously without abandoning the horror and horror and indeed giving us a sort of starfish to ~squeeze~ if necessary to recover a some energy. Would it have been better to manage everything with an automatic recovery once in safety? Definitely, and we add: perhaps it would have been better not to include the fights at all, which immediately turn out to be wooden and approximate. Technical realization Scorn, one of the puzzles that we will find ourselves solving If the intention of the developers of Scorn was to create a more visual experience, of great impact, creepy like few others in the videogame field, it can certainly be said that they have succeeded. Virtually every single graphic element of the game conveys horror and uneasiness: the bars that look like vertebrae because they are actually vertebrae, the pathetic creatures that we will meet along the way, the monstrous parasite that at a certain point will chase us to cling (literally) to our guts, and so on. From this point of view the enemies are a bit of a disappointment, neither fish nor fowl, but the scenarios take care of keeping the level high, with their claustrophobic architectures but also the desperate desolation of empty and open spaces; and especially the ~cathedral~ seen in the final stages of the campaign, with its perverse bas-reliefs that seem to tell the story of how the world was turned into hell and the plague that eventually assimilated everyone. Scorn, the options screen on PC We played Scorn on PC and, although in terms of effects the game doesn't bring anything surprising into play, rather falling back on an old-gen conception of assets (the choice not to bring the title to Xbox One is surprising), the good known reliability of the Unreal Engine 4 guaranteed stable 60 fps on our configuration even at real 4K and with all the quality presets set to maximum, without presenting any uncertainties. Finally, a few words on the sound, which is very essential in terms of accompaniment musical, almost absent, but does an excellent job in terms of design and effects between screams, moans and noises that will contribute to making our stay in the mysterious game scenario a nightmare experience.", "date": "2022-10-14", "grade": "7.5"}
