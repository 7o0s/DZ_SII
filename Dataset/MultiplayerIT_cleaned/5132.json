Although not exactly unique, the Rocky epic remains one of the most fascinating cinematic themes, timeless thanks to its universality. It is about man's resistance to the difficulties of life, the blows that life can strike and that can knock down, but not break down, the fighter with a strong and big soul like Rocky Balboa's. In fact there is not much of this within the new Tapinator videogame title: despite the unequal fight, the blows taken and the final revenge are substantially the fundamental elements of the ~balboana~ epic, the new Rocky develops in a completely different direction, proposing a sort of management focused on the creation, management and development of their wrestlers within a gym. Our task is therefore to train new and potential champions capable of climbing the world rankings and possibly completing historical fights against opponents with a mythological flavor. Since we are still talking about Rocky, the license emerges with the presence of various characters belonging to the film series, who can appear during the game depending on how the gym is managed. Rocky, Apollo, Clubber and Drago therefore emerge by continuing in the game as aspiring champions and thus giving the characterization to this game, which to tell the truth seems able to sustain itself even without a license of this caliber, having chosen to only partially exploit the possibilities offered by the associated brand. In short, on the one hand we have to congratulate Tapinator for the courage in proposing a management software instead of a trivial action without too much history, on the other one thinks that a license like Rocky can be exploited better with a more spectacular, epic and narrative. Forty years old and not feeling it: Rocky leaves the gym in this mobile title It does not hurt! The decision to propose a game equipped with this particular structure, instead of simply staging a series of fights in a ring with some sketchy combat system, does Tapinator credit for having wanted to exploit the high-sounding license with a game idea non-trivial and also quite structured. There are several things to do in this Rocky: the basic element is the progression of your fighter up to the limelight, with the possibility of progressively encountering increasingly stronger opponents including the legendary Apllo Creed, Clubber Lang and Ivan Drago. The encounters take place through a particular fighting system called ~Time Tap Fighting~, which mixes puzzle elements with others almost in a rhythm game style, forcing players to rub their finger or touch the sections of a self-propelled bar placed below the window in where the boxing match takes place. By carrying out the moves with the right sequence and in the correct timing, blows and parries are settled until the victory of the battle. Boxing matches take place through online multiplayer, so for the most part they are PvP fights, but a good part of the time must also be spent training in the gym, where we find Mickey Goldmill himself helping the boxers to increase the stats of strength, intelligence, dexterity, endurance and technique. The progression in the clashes allows the fighters to level up and obtain various rewards including new boxers, resources and various bonuses that increase the possibilities for upgrading their team. Being a free-to-play, there are obviously micro-transactions that allow you to buy virtual currency with real money. With this it is possible to buy new boxers or upgrade existing ones in a very simple and fast way and this obviously opens the way to the classic pay-to-win mechanics, and since it is essentially a PvP game it is an element that is rather annoying, also because in the normal progression one eventually collides in moments of blockage in which it becomes rather long and tedious to continue without going through the disbursement of money.", "date": "2016-12-13", "grade": "7.0"}
