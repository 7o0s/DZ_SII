{"name": "Brain Juice", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/brain-juice.html", "text": "The gist of the speech Brain Juice broadly follows the path traced by Nintendo, offering a product consisting of 12 mini-games that can be progressively unlocked as you improve by following a daily workout. In fact, the game requires the user to undergo, after each play session, a test that evaluates his progress, so that new tests can be made available in the event of a positive outcome. Unlike Brain Training, however, the title Digital Chocolate uses electricity to define the capabilities of the brain and some images of animals to inform the player about his speed in completing a minigame. Minigames that are divided into three categories: math, visualization and memory. Some are very similar to those proposed by the Nintendo title, such as those that require you to perform simple mathematical operations in the mind in the shortest possible time or those in which you need to identify a certain type of figure within a set. However, others are quite original and decidedly convincing and do not struggle to stand out for their quality and fun factor. The gist of the speech First we find a game in which you have to reconstruct the path of a line on a grid after observing a brief example; then a test that requires the completion of some mathematical formulas by inserting the correct operation sign must be indicated; finally, a minigame deserves a last mention where you see figures of men, women and children entering and exiting an elevator and in which you have to identify the final number of each type of person. However, each individual session is defined by a time limit (visible via an indicator at the top of the screen) which is reloaded following a series of correct answers. Like any self-respecting product of the genre, Brain Juice also offers its beautiful section dedicated to every possible graph or statistic regarding the player's progress, which can be viewed both in general terms and on the merits of each individual minigame. All framed by a cosmetics obviously more functional than elaborate, but still pleasant: the soft shades of the colors and the presence of a nice light bulb-shaped tutor accompany the user in his training path without smudging or particular defects. The sound, on the other hand, is justified: the few music and the minimalist effects go absolutely hand in hand with the spirit of the product. Game tested on Nokia 6630 Comment Brain Juice is a nice exponent of a genre, that of ~brain-trainers~, which perhaps finds its most suitable dimension on the mobile phone: in fact, what better tool for a product that requires a brief but daily use? In light of this fact, the Digital Chocolate title has learned the Brain Training lesson well by proposing several alternative mini-games to the Nintendo ones and in some ways even more successful. A clean and complete graphic interface and a never annoying sound complete the picture of a good level product, definitely recommended for those looking for simple and fast puzzles. Pros Good selection of minigames Clean and functional graphics Lots of graphs and stats Cons Very similar to Brain Training Long repetitive Released a few months ago for Nintendo DS and received by a good success with audiences and critics, Brain Training was the forerunner of what can in all respects be considered a real genre, that of brain-training games: titles made up of a series of small intelligence tests to be performed daily for the -supposed- good of one's gray matter. The Nintendo product was in fact immediately taken as a source of inspiration by other software houses who wanted to put their theories on neurological fitness into practice. Among these there is also Digital Chocolate, which with its Brain Juice intends to make the brains of the enormous mass of cell phone owners work.", "date": "2006-10-19", "grade": null}
