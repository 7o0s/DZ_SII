{"name": "Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/brothers-in-arms-hells-highway-recensione.html", "text": "The maturity of an FPS The first real feature of Hell's Highway is therefore this, the cinematic look of the game lies not only in the explosions and in the realism of the clashes, but in the deep narrative part that serves as a solid basis for the events that the player has to face. A mature game to all intents and purposes, not only for the choreographic bullet time dismemberments after precise throws of grenades or headshots, but for the precise choice by the developers to go beyond the simple concept of a shooter. The story is not only that of the unfortunate Market Garden operation, but also and above all that of the men who lived it, American soldiers or Dutch partisans. Hence the atrocities committed by Krauts enter the world of video games, such as the girl forcibly dragged into a barn, who we will then find hanged from the ceiling of the same immediately afterwards. A big step forward, both compared to the already good previous chapters of the series, but above all to the moving dioramas of Call of Duty. There are several novelties in this third chapter of BiA. First of all, we move from the verdant hills of Normandy to the urban scenarios of a bombed-out Holland. Market Garden was in fact a daring operation in which 3 divisions of paratroopers, launched behind enemy lines, should have conquered and held some bridges, which obviously did not happen, thanks to the counterattacks of the German panzer divisions. The city scenario, full of shelters and more generally many places to hide and set up ambushes, has favored the introduction of two new squads, the one with the Browning machine gun, ideal for suppressive fire, and the one equipped with a bazooka, lethal for snipers posted on bell towers, riflemen behind sandbags and of course tanks. The first is the basis for the game mechanics of Brothers in Arms, which is to have enemies keep their heads down and then enfilade them on the side. The second, on the other hand, is necessary to overcome those points in which the circumvention work is not easily practicable. So here is that the scenario falls apart under the blows of the bazooka, with the due limitations however, given that not everything is destructible, but only the pre-established parts, i.e. those where it is expected that the player can hit the target with the shoulder rocket launcher or with a hand grenade. It's not Red Faction, in short, you can't look for a different way than the one indicated by the level design to achieve your goal. Above all, however, the introduction of a Rainbow Six-style cover system stands out which, once activated (via the L1 key) switches the view behind Baker, thus making it easier to move indoors but above all to give orders to platoon mates. However, it is not possible to shoot blindly by raising the rifle above your head, which the Krauts do instead, so you are forced to expose yourself to enemy fire for lightening shots, with the further limitation that in this situation the view from the viewfinder. The Hell's Highway book On the occasion of the launch of the third chapter of the Matthew Baker saga, Multiplayer.it Edizioni has published the official novel Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway, by John Antal, retired US Army colonel, author of several essays on military doctrine and for some years appreciated military consultant. This book will catapult us into September 1944, as in the video game just released, in the midst of World War II, against the backdrop of the Allied operations that were to lead to the liberation of Holland. The safety of an MG If from the point of view of the gameplay, of the tactics inherent in the game, this choice is spot on, in fact greatly facilitating making the correct decisions with (relative) calm without having to resort too much to the map, from the point of view of the controls there is a some background woodiness. Pressing, and fortunately not holding down, L1 to enter and exit cover is rather cumbersome, and when you are under fire and want to make a quick sprint between one cover and another, everything becomes decidedly cumbersome, with the risk to get stuck somewhere, stuck by a camera that sometimes doesn't respond promptly to the player's requests. Not that this problem destabilizes the enjoyment of the game, just a little practice is enough to go further, but being a new and welcome feature, sorry that it doesn't always work perfectly. The final feeling, after an extensive test, is that big steps forward have been made compared to the first chapters of the series. A certain basic repetitiveness seems to have been avoided, not so much for the inclusion of a sniping section or one on boardof a Sherman Firefly, as for the excellent general level design, which alternates open spaces with moments indoors in factories or ruined buildings, where it is not uncommon to advance alone or in pairs, and then only later return to command your own men. It's all much more fun, less frustrating, monotonous and faster, tactical management is all there, but the impression is that the pace is generally more sustained, decisions are taken more quickly, and thanks to Browning coverage ( when available), assaults are easier to carry out, as long as you don't launch headlong without waiting for the suppression of enemy fire. The safety of an MG By choosing the first level of difficulty, it is also possible to seek a certain personal glory, by abandoning work in concert with one's companions, to have them intervene only on occasions when solitary bypassing is not possible. In this case the bazooka team will have an all too easy life to take out fortified positions, provided that it is able to position it, given that many times the three men have proved reluctant to take position to fire. Obviously, by choosing the next level of difficulty, the lone wolf option becomes highly discouraged, in favor of the right coordination of actions. The only thing that remains unchanged is the artificial intelligence of the enemies, excellent in cover, decidedly poor in the few outflanking maneuvers or when the soldiers in green-grey remain impaled despite machine guns exploding a couple of meters from them. The behavior of their teammates instead, except for the sporadic cases in which they block for no reason despite the orders given, is quite good and reactive, even if to tell the truth in some situations they have chosen the longest and most dangerous way to move from one cover and the other, ending up shot like thrushes. More generally it is better to avoid very long journeys blindly from one part of the map to the other, guiding them step by step is the winning solution. As for multiplayer, up to 32 players can compete in Team deathmatch mode, where each player plays a soldier. This solution betrays the team spirit of the title in favor of an easier, more immediate and chaotic game. Lights and shadows in Holland On the technical side, the use of Unreal Engine 3.0 amazes with a very vast visual horizon, and excellent special effects, in particular those of light, to shore up sunny days, with frequent use of HDR and those in which a persistent rain or the darkness illuminated by the burning buildings, limit the view of the soldiers. Honorable mention also for the effects related to explosions and those that simulate dirt on the screen. The textures applied to the models of the protagonists and to the reproductions of the environments stop a step further down. The first ones reproduce the faces and the colors, the folds and the dirt of the camouflages of the time with good fidelity and detail, while the second ones have not benefited from the same graphic cleaning obtained in the realization of the soldiers. Not that they are poor, but there is a certain qualitative difference between the elements on the screen. The animations are certainly positive, with the soldiers running, crouching and reloading their weapons in a realistic and very fluid way, and in the same way, applause goes to the ragdoll applied after the pyrotechnic explosions, which shatters the bodies, with so much of limbs and smashed heads that stain the battlefield red. In short, a graphic sector that does not surprise for detail, shaders and bumb mapping in profusion, but which instead stands up and works perfectly thanks to the total overall effect, which returns a credibe and lively reproduction of Holland under German occupation . Comment Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway is certainly an excellent game, a worthy successor to the two previous installments of the series. The new team weapons amplify the possibilities offered to the player, making the Gearbox title even more fun and frenetic, without however distorting the tactical and reasoned component of the game. The icing on the cake, more than the renewed graphic sector, however, is the narrative and cinematographic attitude of this third iteration, which makes Hell's Highway a decidedly mature product, not so much for what it shows, however raw and brutal, but for how it shows it, uncompromisingly recounting the brutality of war. The only perplexities concern a multiplayer sector that partially betrays the tactical and cooperative spirit of the game, a fluctuating artificial intelligence, and an initially difficult and somewhat cumbersome control method.
