{"name": "Shattered Union - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/shattered-union-recensione.html", "text": "The grass is always greener on the other side Now that we know under which banner to serve what is left of old North America, we have before us three opportunities to put to good use the game turn granted to each faction: an alternative is to do nothing and observe our bank account go up for the income of the territories, while alternatively we can repair any damaged units, buy new means of destruction or clash for the control of an enemy area adjacent to ours, which sooner or later you will have to do, before they are the neighbors to want to graze in your garden. Already now another choice imposes itself, because faced with the imminent conflict it is necessary to decide which war resources to allocate to the attack and which ones to leave at home in the event that in the next round someone wants to target us, since the troops engaged in the conflict they cannot be placed immediately in defense of the area from which they come. As you can see, simplicity is a factor that immediately catches the eye, as there is no long background or fine diversionary maneuvers; choose your toy soldiers and send them to the front, simple isn't it? On the other hand, the game scenario destined for real carnage is already less linear, which looks like a large map full of hills, woods, snow-capped peaks and of course large urban complexes, all seen from the perspective that a player intent on deploying the own pieces on a model reconstructed on a table, with the addition, however, of a grid made of hexagonal-based boxes to organize movements. The grass is always greener on the other side We have finally entered the heart of Shattered Union and we already anticipate that there isn't much to say, without a negative note, since it remains faithful to the spirit of simple and essential turn-based strategy, without however letting go of total minimalism. The war sector is in fact not essential, being able to count on an air division made up of helicopters, bombers, fighter jets and other steel birds, while among the land vehicles there are light and heavy tanks, wheeled vehicles and various elements to defense operations against air raids. There is also no shortage of infantry troops, with engineers, special teams and stormtroopers for a total of about fifty units that you can place manually or automatically on the map. In one case or another your goal is clear, you will have to conquer a certain score by occupying urban areas and to do this you will have to be able to ensure that one of your units remains within the metropolitan area for at least one turn. If, on the other hand, your territory has been attacked by a neighboring ~rogue~ faction, it will be your strict duty for honor and for the flag to prevent the enemy from pocketing the points necessary to send you back across the border. Coming to the raw clash there are not many options, it is mostly a question of calculating the range of the weapons, the firepower in relation to the various targets and the possible presence of particular terrains, such as woods or hills which could slow down the movements. It is always possible to call air support into action during your turn to bomb a precise target, or to assign certain special abilities to units that become available during the game. Initially it is only a damage or defense bonus that you can give to a certain unit, or a special request for friendly fire on a chosen area, but over time and with the increase in resources you will be able to afford the infamous hydrogen bomb . If this is all then, and indeed there is very little to add, what does Shattered Union really offer? Cross-platform Shattered Union will reach the shelves on PC and Xbox, moving to different considerations for the two platforms. While on the one hand the PC offers a keyboard, mouse and a solid background of titles to deal with, the Microsoft console market is far from such a crowding of strategic games. For console users it can therefore be a good opportunity to experience an uncommon genre and it will certainly make the happiness of those who were waiting for Xbox to offer this type of game. On the other hand, however, the large number of menus and options makes the joypad not very functional for the actions it has to perform, forcing the user to make an extra effort to master the commands. Once this obstacle has been overcome, there are no major differences between the two versions, not even in terms of graphics, which, precisely because of the few pretensions, make a greater figure on the black car. The only difficulty for console users may be to find an adequate number of challenge opponentsgive on the net, a problem that PC owners will hardly encounter. Every day the same war Shattered Union should offer a simple but not without depth action while in reality it turns out to be a middle ground that does not fully convince. There are many icons and menus to perform simple actions and before moving with agility you will have to do some practice, unless you are seasoned veterans of the genre. In particular, the zoom is calibrated on only two dimensions which make consultation of the playing area very impractical. In fact, to be able to fight you will have to zoom in close because otherwise it is almost impossible to distinguish the units on the field, but at the same time having to always widen the view in order to have a clear knowledge of the playing area, which otherwise remains obscured from view. This translates into a constant transition from one view to another that certainly could have been avoided to give greater fluidity to the action. From a strategic point of view, the A.I. enemy offers a demanding challenge and fortunately the peculiarities of the individual units enable them to recreate numerous game situations, where a single command group, if established in the urban complex, can stand up to the assault of three crawlers, so that the mechanics it turns out to be simple but not simplistic. Unfortunately, however, Shattered Union remains an engaging product but not without defects that make themselves felt. It is in fact too repetitive and it takes very little to get tired of the succession of goals that are always the same. In any case, the high number of elements does not translate into a sufficient variety of situations, since there is no trace of a research management system for new means and also the political interaction between the federations is completely absent, as is the narration which does not move in the slightest from the initial assumptions, leaving the player with an infinite series of turns in which to attack or be attacked. Every day the same war There could be support means for the transport of infantry, but above all a naval fleet with which to besiege the centers on the coast or simply move the crawlers quickly from one part of the map to another. It lacks the spark of originality that can turn a simple concept into thrilling and engaging gameplay, but it remains a solid system that makes what it offers work well. The graphic aspect is certainly not a phantasmagoria of colors and effects, remaining on the contrary at an average level as regards the scenario and the war units, while the interfaces are frankly more suitable for a board game than a digital video game. Therefore, there is a lack of involvement and atmosphere, also due to the flatness to which the game system is reduced in the geo-political map, but it offers clashes without too many distractions, which after the first hours necessary to understand how to play a turn-based strategy game, can offer not little satisfaction, especially at a high level of difficulty. A final mention should be made for the game on the net, which however does not require the presence of more than two players and no additional options. Surely those who lose their heads for this kind of game will have new hours to spend in front of the screen, while more casual users will have their good opportunity to test themselves without too much effort. Final comment It is not easy to judge Shattered Union, because it is certainly not the definitive title that fans are waiting for, but it still brings into play interesting elements that place it as the current spokesperson for turn-based strategy. The different factions to choose from and the many units available with their distinctive characteristics are a good incentive for immediate action but full of necessary considerations from a strategic point of view. Unfortunately certain elements remain only hinted at, such as the political situation, which is completely left aside in favor of actual clashes, which, however engaging, undoubtedly tend to repeat themselves. A greater presence of support means and a section for international diplomacy and research would perhaps have enriched the dish too much for a title that wants to remain lean and immediate, but at the same time they would have made it less sparse. Ultimately if this is a genre that you already know and appreciate you will not be disappointed by Sahttered Union, otherwise you could still consider it an accessible title with which to approach the large family of strategic. Pros Immediate and easy to manage Simple but not trivial Numerous units to choose from... Cons ...but not enough to complete the choice Absent political scene Tends to repeat itself without innovations The failure ofAmerican dream Shattered Union seeks its way in the not too crowded world of turn-based strategy games, a genre certainly stingy with converts but so alluring in its simplicity that it ends up keeping even the most distracted player in front of the screen. We will see how true this is for the product signed by 2K and developed by PopTop after watching the meager presentation video which should enable us to understand why the United States of America has become a full-scale Risk table. It all begins with the sinister appearance of President Adams who in 2008 (yes we are in the middle of fictional history), decides to introduce martial law. Years go by and CNN's short press releases update us on the development of the crisis, which reaches its peak with the explosion of a nuclear device in Washington D.C., providing the fateful straw that will overflow the camel, from whose remnants will be born seven confederations of been at war with each other. For the record we mention in no particular order these factions involved in the most catastrophic civil war of the new millennium starting from the Great Plains Federation, which is joined by the New England Alliance, the Confederacy(the), the Republic of Texas, the Pacifica, the California Commonwealth and the ever-present European Union. Naturally, each faction boasts some of its own strengths which can range from the availability of fuel, the amount of wealth or the presence of a large army, plus some special abilities granted only to one's own side, such as the possibility of hiding among the vegetation for example . Whatever your choice, the dividend does not change, the war to reconquer the United States has just begun!", "date": "2005-11-22", "grade": null}
