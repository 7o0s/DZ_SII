{"name": "Stella Arcana: Eternal Stars", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/stella-arcana-eternal-stars-la-recensione.html", "text": "The arrival of the MMORPG on mobile platforms could have seemed like an impossible dream until a while ago and in fact the genre had to adapt and bend a little to different uses, but in the end it found its place on the market. now being able to count on a real codified sub-genre with lots of interesting variations on the theme, as demonstrated by this review of Stella Arcana: Eternal Stars. Deriving mostly from an oriental matrix, there are consolidated characteristics that are also found in this game by LinrenGame, which fits in the groove marked by other similar games but also tries to distinguish itself for some peculiar characteristics: on the one hand we therefore have the usual quest mechanism and character progression (with their due particularities) and the classic anime-style characterization of many MMORPGs, on the other hand there is a certain movement in game situations, which try to propose something varied and keep high the interest on every single quest, even if the total flattening due to the presence of auto-play is always around the corner. The story is the classic one: in ancient times a benevolent deity sacrificed herself to defend the ~world of light~ in which the protagonists live from the forces of darkness, transforming herself into various constellations. Over time, the ancient legends and traditions have lost strength and been forgotten, weakening the seals that bind evil, paving the way for the return of Chaos and its dark forces. The protagonists must therefore restore strength to the 12 constellations of Baldur, the god of light, in order to restore the world's defenses against darkness. Nothing original from the point of view of the story, but the narrative takes place through a series of episodes and quests that denote a certain vivacity, still making the setting and the characters interesting, although they are always stereotypes. We are a bit near Tales of Wind as a glance, while the general structure of the MMORPG remains anchored to the classic Lineage 2: Revolution. However, the distinctive elements are found in the development of the quests and in some peculiarities of the management of the characters, only that everything risks losing meaning in the midst of the general automation derived from auto-play, which we therefore advise against activating, at least as regards the first stages and the most interesting missions. Of heroes, beasts and various situations Basically, Stella Arcana is a full-fledged MMORPG, therefore it is a question of completing various quests in sequence between missions belonging to the main story and many other secondary ones, but all - at least for a good first part - are rather well structured and interesting. As already mentioned, it is always possible to activate the auto-play and passively watch the fully automated actions, but this clearly takes away a good part of the pleasure and is only advisable for dedicating yourself to extreme grinding. There are also raids and dungeons to be played in single or multiplayer, as well as PvP battles in arenas with different game modes and a wide range of alternative activities, in order to fill all the possible options that are required in a modern game of this type. Beyond the real missions we can dedicate ourselves to fishing, gathering materials, crafting, housing and also to the cultivation and various activities for the care of the Sprites, which are pet-type creatures to be conquered and raised in the style of Pokmon. In short, as befits a modern mobile MMORPG, Stella Arcana tries to respond to every need and bring together the different trends that have arisen in recent years within this genre of games in the portable and non-portable sphere. These too are more or less consolidated and well-known activities, but they manage to blend into a rather organic whole and continuously provide alternative game elements to enrich the gameplay. What is striking, however, is the dynamism and variety of the quests, which often offer new game situations and almost adventure-like elements, with particular contextual interactions depending on the situation to intersperse the fights. The combat system is typical of the sub-genre, with real-time action, direct movement of the protagonist and a series of special abilities to activate which however each require cooldowns to be respected in order to be used. In practice, exactly what is expected from a game of this kind without introducing anything particularly innovative but with a system that is functional and, if necessary, is easily bypassed by the AI with autoplay. As always, the gameplay element that carries the most weight to thethe long one is the management of the character, which is suitably rich and complex. There are six different classes from which to choose your specialization, which can also be changed once you reach level 50, each characterized by specific skills but similar to the classic warrior, mage, healer, ranged or melee fighter and intermediate solutions. During the game, a wide range of further customizations take place that allow you to change the protagonist's appearance and statistics, applying equipment and using various runes and stones capable of applying further powers. Added to this is the possibility of having pets and mounts that can in turn be modified, further expanding the modifications to be implemented. This whole system is associated with the free-to-play nature of Stella Arcana, so playing at high levels and above all in competition with other players it becomes necessary to spend something to increase the statistics. There is also the inevitable gacha system, in this case linked to the conquest of mercenaries who can be used as battle companions by playing alone, so as to be able to count on a party as powerful as possible (based on the rarity of the characters).", "date": "2021-01-28", "grade": "7.4"}
