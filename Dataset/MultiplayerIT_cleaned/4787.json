The incipit of Futurama: Worlds of Tomorrow is as simple as it is bizarre: under the influence of the Hypnotoad, the Professor accidentally opens a dimensional passage that tears the very fabric of the universe, sucking living beings into a sort of limbo. Faced with a fragmented scenario, our goal will therefore be to rebuild the city of New New York from scratch by drawing on the classic mechanics of the casual simulation genre, mostly made up of waiting times and missions to complete. The interface will take care of always providing us with new things to do, listing the active quests on the left side, while the buildings that generate money and other currencies will have to be checked often to manually reap the benefits. Business as usual, then? Almost. The future that wasn't there While on the one hand Futurama: Worlds of Tomorrow asks us to follow the instructions of the various supporting actors and place a series of buildings on the map, expanding the perimeter of the city as soon as possible, just like in any other city builder for mobile devices, from other the title of TinyCo entertains us by catapulting us into a series of space missions with a progressively higher degree of difficulty. Having selected the crew among the characters available up to that point, we will therefore be able to choose a quest and proceed with the exploration of a specific space sector, collecting the elements necessary to level up and unlock new steps in terms of history, but above all by comparing ourselves with two types of challenges: the first is a sort of multiple choice quiz, the second are strategic fights graphically represented with a retro style. In this context, Fry and his friends must select an opponent and hit him, trying to get the timing right so that the attack becomes critical and resorting to spectacular special moves as soon as the relative indicator is full. At first the clashes are really trivial, but after a few hours the challenge becomes more interesting and the characters involved in the battles also increase. Of course, it certainly cannot be said that the introduction of this particular feature is enough to smooth the edges of a decidedly already seen and banal experience, but at least it helps to pass the time waiting for our robots to build yet another necessary building to recruit a new character to the crew. The strength of Futurama: Worlds of Tomorrow should in fact be the plot, written by Matt Groening and David Cohen, but this aspect of the game does not take off also due to a hasty and approximate Italian translation. The beautiful graphics remain, the atmospheres perfectly in line with the episodes of the series and an inevitably rich structure, although the freemium mechanisms make themselves felt all too soon.", "date": "2017-07-05", "grade": "6.0"}
