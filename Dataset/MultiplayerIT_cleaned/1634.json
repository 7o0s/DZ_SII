{"name": "GTA Vice City", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gta-vice-city_a.html", "text": "About mods and skins Undoubtedly the possibility of modifying the game with add-ons, mods and skins has particularly impressed the people of GTA3 loyalists, who were able to enrich the title thanks to the more or less skilful work of self-styled groups of modders scattered around the network. These additions to the original game guarantee not only greater longevity, but also a considerable level of customization and enhancement (think of Counter Strike, the historic Half Life mod that extended the life of the title for years in terms of public attention) . Many believe that it should be a duty of the software houses to provide a decent assistance service to the modding community as very often, if well funded and supported, these organizations are able to create greater interest around the title. However, this type of consideration seems to remain alien to Rockstar's policy which, as with the previous title, limited itself to integrating the game with only a system for managing skins and playlists (moreover so rich as to not present particular reasons for modification by of the player). However, this has not stopped the very aggressive modders scattered throughout the globe, who are already in turmoil. In the communities that in the past dealt with the modding of GTA3 there is already talk of imminent arrivals capable of revolutionizing the new Vice City. For all you enthusiasts, the eternally valid maxim of the essay is valid: STAY TUNED! The return of Mr. Vercetti... twenty years ago. Here we are, Tommy Vercetti is back to doing damage, once again we will be able to take on the role of the self-styled gangster all guns and engines! We are in the 80s and the place where we are, Vice City, is the quintessence of vice and corruption. Beautiful women sunbathe on the beach while drug dealers sell drugs like cotton candy on street corners; cheap starlets flaunt their talents by showing off skintight bathing suits stuffed with every good thing to old pimps all with ~gold chains and chest hair~ (a textbook stereotype). In shady clubs dominated by neon lights and lap-dancing girls, despicable figures plot and elaborate deadly strategies to eliminate their opponents. It is well known that Tommy Vercetti has never been a shin of a saint and it is perhaps for this reason that our adventure begins right in the middle of a drug exchange ... you know, one of those typical shady deals that you have seen a million times in tv but which for our anti-hero are the daily bread. There is always a black suitcase in the middle and someone who, with a vague Sicilian accent, asks for clarifications on the payment methods. The return of Mr. Vercetti... twenty years ago. The fact is that everything is ready, there's the briefcase (stuffed), there's the Sicilian and there's the usual million-dollars-in-twenty-used-pieces. Everything seems to go smoothly when the inevitable sign that someone hates us becomes clearly evident... and the raid is triggered. A quick shootout, some healthy rolling on the ground (all reconstructed with splendid craftsmanship worthy of a Martin Scorsese) and four or five dead left on the dusty ground. The action becomes frenetic but our man manages to daringly save himself by getting into the car of his friend Kenny Rosenberg, a lawyer of dubious fame. It is practically useless to add that when in Vice City you try to get rid of an opponent it is good to complete the job so as not to be forced to defend yourself from more than justified vengeful reprisals. Tommy is certainly no less and it will be in this climate that we will make our entry into the world of Vice City. As you may have guessed Vice City is a prequel to the GTA3 story, and while Tommy is still a small fry we will see him make his way through this unforgiving world. Relentless as ever we will help Vercetti put the city on fire! GTA VIce City features an exceptional story board, of a level never reached in previous editions. Those who have played GTA3 will have noticed that Tommy was certainly not the talkative type; if this is the idea you have about ours then you'll have to change your mind... in Vice City Tommy takes the lion's share and won't spare colorful comments to his opponents. From the rest, the plot is quite evolved and full of details, seasoned in such a way as to result in a pleasant encounter between Miami Vice and Scarface. The characters that surround the story are very well outlined and characterized with skillful mastery. This thing significantly increases the degree of involvement of the game which draws strong inspiration from the aforementioned films. I mean... just take a look at a plate of supporting characters for cfind out what I'm talking about: a mix between the villains of stursky & hutch, Tony Manero and the protagonists of the 80s pulp movies (pulp... very pulp...!). It is worth reminding newbies that the story in GTA can be continuously enriched by unexpected or sudden (and very crazy) head shots due to the flexibility of the protagonist. While the main characters will enrich the game sessions with their requests, you can digress and get away from the thread of the story even for whole hours, doing more or less dirty jobs in order to grab a few more dollars. On the streets of Vice City Attempting an exhaustive mapping of the gameplay of Vice City would require superhuman time and effort: this is one of those cases in which the map coincides with the territory: only by playing, exploring, getting lost in Vice City can you discover the vastness of situations, of possibilities, of viable roads available to the player. The first impact could give the idea of few real innovations compared to GTAIII: certainly there will not be any real upheaval for this reason that in any case it is not a real sequel. Vice City is practically a cover of the previous title, a remix played with typical eighties instruments. The core is always the same: attempting to climb the local criminal pyramid, from simple gangsters ready for any dirty work that is required of us to bigwigs of the local underworld. But here is one of the most important news of Vice City: in the continuation of the game, as Vercetti becomes more important, the player will be able to take possession of some properties to manage the activities within them: Tommy will therefore become the owner of night clubs, bars, hotels, discos. In order to finish the game you will have to practically buy all of Vice City piece by piece and get rich from the most diverse activities. In fact it is a further step towards that ~city simulation~ towards which the GTA series seems to tend, giving a subtle management patina to the title. The other ways to earn money range from the activity of vigilante, taxi driver, firefighter, nurse and the new possibility of home delivery of pizzas. In general, the goodies, the surprises, the sub-games have even increased compared to the already numerous of the third episode. Just as the vehicles to drive have increased, from luxury cars to hilarious motorcycles and vespas, ending up with motorboats and helicopters. The difficulty is well calibrated even if it often touches peaks of authentic frustration, aggravated by the impossibility of saving during the mission. The control system, however good, inevitably leads to gripping a joypad given that the combination of keyboard and mouse can, in the long run, be annoying and not very comfortable (in the sequences on foot the mouse and keyboard are used, in the car the keyboard alone forcing sudden grip changes): the three-dimensional GTAs were designed for the Playstation pad and should be played with it. GTA VS Mafia It is impossible to play a game like Vice City without making any reference to the few related titles on the market today. Perhaps the most noteworthy is Mafia, the award-winning action game, the protagonist of last winter which owes a lot to GTA for its playful model and obvious similarities. However, what still distinguishes the two titles is the approach to realism which, although it is taken seriously in GTA, remains the prerogative of Mafia, a title, undoubtedly, with feet on the ground. GTA relies heavily on exasperated spectacularity and on the action of a B-series police show, until obtaining such an explosive mix that it undoubtedly remains unmatched in the current videogame panorama. Mafia obviously cannot miss the comparison with the cornerstones of genre cinematography such as ~The Godfather~ or ~The goodfellas~. In any case, GTA's exasperated freedom of action is not matched by a title like Mafia which strongly penalizes nonsense behavior and free shootings, generally punished with crazy police chases that will inevitably put an end to your thirst for blood. So you just have to choose which of the two approaches to homicidal madness belong more to your videogame ego. On the test bench. Here we are at the ~technical~ corner, an aspect of the game to which it is always good to make some juicy reference. After so much ~blah blah~ let's take a closer look at the offer of this title in terms of performance and, obviously, innovations. Let it be clear immediately chand, despite the apparent similarity, the innovations that separate Vice City from GTA3 are remarkable. First of all, the introduction of 32-bit textures must be considered which notoriously guarantee a considerable leap in quality in terms of detail and color (all for the benefit of realism), a choice obviously linked to the desire of Rockstar to enhance the visual rendering of the game. Visibility has been clearly improved and the limit of the horizon has been removed, so to speak, beyond which it is not possible to enjoy the details of the city. But if the graphic aspect has undoubtedly been optimized and refined, the classic clipping problems (which are very rare) could compromise actions carefully prepared for a long time. It happened to me a couple of times, during my game sessions, to run into bizarre fences that pierced my bodywork preventing me from escaping, or to not be able to escape from the burning car (Editor's note: a burning car usually explodes in 5-6 seconds causing horrible carnage) because it literally got stuck inside the sheet metal of the front hood (a nightmarish experience). After all, this is the price you pay in a game in which a vehicle, made up of more than a dozen independent parts, shatters with each uprooted light pole (in this regard, I suggest my latest idea, which consists in go backwards before Tommy manages to close the doors and hit another car: in this way you will get a mutilated car, an excellent solution for sultry days). Another small note should be made towards the smudges of some particularly jagged textures (see, for example, palm fronds) which, seen from some angles, leave something to be desired. As regards the creation of the models of the characters, there is a lack of realism in the movements of the characters, very evident especially in the introductory films to the missions; the modeling of some of the female characters (too similar to mannequins) is absolutely disappointing, one for all: the colonel's daughter. But it is the plays of light that dominate the breathtaking panorama of Vice city: the succession of day and night gives the city a magical aura, with breathtaking sunsets and sunrises and unmissable plays of light. You may find this crazy, but in GTA: Vice City it can be fun just to travel along the seafront on a modest (but spectacular) 50cc scooter (Vespa type) and enjoy the magnificent panorama. A separate chapter should be opened for the audio of the game which is definitely Oscar-worthy. To better analyze the case let's start from the mere technical improvements to reach the soundtrack (from urlooo!!!). The introduction of EAX 3.0 will ensure a truly remarkable level of audio immersion unmatched in titles of the genre, I guarantee you will literally feel surrounded by the city! As for the sound track I can say that it would be worth spending the money just to have it on a cd to listen to in the car. Impossible not to notice it and even more impossible to do without it Vice City offers an entire 80s repertoire made up of highly original songs with an exclusive engaging power: in short, can you imagine a getaway in the car with flat feet on your heels and ~video killed the radio stars~ blaring from your car stereo?! The 9 different radio stations will keep you company with 90 different songs, undoubtedly something never seen before! Finally, a final comment goes to the localization and presentation of the product. Vice City is dubbed (excellently) in English and subtitled faithfully in Italian. The inevitable imperfection, however, is rigorously presented at each end of the film, when the scene, fading, is enriched by a last comment from Tommy, strictly not dubbed! And here the legitimate question arises: but it cost so much to underline even those three seconds (crazy!)?!?! But every little thing in this sense is covered by the excellent packaging that never fails to delight the buyer's eye. In addition to the two CDs, the paperback box set contains the inevitable manual (written as a tourist guide to Vice City), a stupendous, extremely useful map of the city and a nice sticker (which already stands out on the side of my case :-)) A double comment. To conclude this article written together, it seemed right to us to make a double comment at the end. Ubik: Let's be clear: Vice City isn't perfect. Many defects could be found: none, however, such as to affect such a fun and politically incorrect ~playground~. Because this is GTA and it is also in its new incarnation. Let's face it: GTA or both loves", "date": "2003-06-05", "grade": null}
