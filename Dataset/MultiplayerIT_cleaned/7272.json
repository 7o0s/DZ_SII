We can therefore offer only a partial comment, since we will have to wait for the release of the fifth and final episode to evaluate the work. If you have never heard of The Walking Dead video game, we advise you to read the review of the first episode of the second season. Finally, if you are one of those who can not tolerate even the slightest revelation of the plot of a story, skip the review and read directly to the final commentary. The first episode of the new season was painful as a kick in the eye. Nature, brutal and unfair, has not spared an eleven-year-old girl, forced to fight like a desperate one to survive adversity. And this is the kind of main conflict that we experienced in the previous season: the world has gone mad and we have returned to the law of the jungle, what can we do to not regress to the state of savages? The second episode is something completely different, and it anticipates it in the opening scene, showing us another leg to be cut which thankfully is spared by the hand holding the saw. No splatter this round. Only a psychological situation to manage between an adult on the verge of death and a child who has become a teenager ahead of time. This first conversation also anticipates all the work that the writers will develop during the episode and perhaps the entire season. Indeed, Clementine is not strong, she cannot defend anyone, much less be a leader. She can only try to make her way in an adult world unable to see her need to remain a child for a little while longer. They ask her for opinions, comfort, loyalty pacts; he even has to vouch for his group, despite being the same one who until a few days before had locked her in a shack, alone and with a mortal wound. We therefore see it grow before our eyes, develop its own identity; this gives us A House Divided: the chance to decide who Clementine is or will be. The balance hangs on the emotional side, with lots of dialogues and intimate situations in which we are called to express ourselves. We don't have to make decisions as leaders and on the other hand when we are facing a turning point it is clearly seen that the narrative backbone is immutable. Instead we sow crumbs that create an unpredictable underground path, punctuated by that ~X will remember that~. We don't know how or when he will remember it, but we feel that our words have had weight. And this is already enough to make a smile or a grimace appear on the face of Clementine and the player. A crowd of characters weaves a highly flammable narrative tapestry in A House Divided Zombies are the least of the problems A House Divided is the glue between the past and present of The Walking Dead. The second part of the game opens with a surprise that suddenly takes us back to the times of the first season and there is also room for a mention of 400 Days, the controversial DLC that acted as an interlude between the first and second seasons. Of all the episodes of The Walking Dead this is also the most complex. There are tons of characters on the scene and the narrative pace is very slow, to allow the writers to show us what the polarities are between the two protagonist groups of the story and within the same groups. Between these polarities Clementine must always take a stand and it is significant that only with Sarah, the real girl in the series, can she allow herself a moment of innocence, like when she explains that the gun is just an object, without however being able to explain what it means. He would repeat the words he heard from an adult he trusted. Real adults, on the other hand, don't seem capable of dealing with Clementine, displaced by this creature who would like to see her fragility recognized and who at the same time is capable of repelling a zombie attack by handling firearms. And speaking of zombies we must say that never before has the apocalyptic setting been perceived as normal, everyday. No one, least of all the player, is surprised that occasionally it is necessary to break the head of a walking dead. Action scenes are always justified by the events of the story and therefore show the natural consequence of unfortunate choices made by the characters. The centerpiece of the episode, however, is the entrance into the scene of Carver, the true villain of The Walking Dead. First as a stranger in a familiar situation, perhaps one of the most successful moments of the episode, and finally as an explicit threat. As things turn out, it looks like we'll get to know Carver and his crew betterpo, hoping that everything is not resolved in the abused reversal whereby those who seem good actually eat children while the bad ones turn out to be misunderstood souls. In fact, the real challenge for the screenwriters begins now: after having exploited almost all the narrative devices made available by Kirkman's setting, they will have to prove themselves capable of presenting new and stimulating situations. In a world where everything rots, that's not an easy goal.", "date": "2014-03-06", "grade": "7.5"}
