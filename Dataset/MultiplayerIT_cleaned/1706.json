{"name": "Grandia Xtreme", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/grandia-xtreme_a.html", "text": "A look at the plot... Moving on to the actual review, I want to start by talking about the fundamental aspect of a jrpg: the Plot. Every self-respecting RPG must necessarily have a complex story, full of twists, well narrated, engaging and exciting. Unfortunately, the plot of G.X does not boast of any of these qualities! Evann is a young ranger, the ability dictated by his class is that of being able to exploit any type of elemental force that flows within the world. This singular ability made him indispensable in an operation set up by the army to restore the natural order of the world, which had recently been altered by an unknown force. Evann, having proved deaf to the army's requests, is forcibly taken from his home and taken to the barracks. At first our protagonist shows himself uninterested in the requests of the army, but in the end he is captured by the events and inevitably finds himself mixed up in the military project; this is where our adventures begin... At this point the story will unfold in a very banal and predictable way, the only interesting thing are the funny dialogues that give a little color to a totally black and white plot. Unfortunately this is not enough to ensure that the interest in this game does not die down after a few hours. The role of the story is only to surround a game structure focused almost exclusively on dungeons and battles, but it is precisely here that this RPG shows us all its splendour. ...And to the battle system The Grandia series is fortunate to be able to boast, as I have already said before, of the best battle system ever to appear on an RPG after that of Valkyrie Profile: it will give you the possibility to have full control over your characters and to be able to always adopt strategies different. The only small problem is due to the high difficulty you will encounter the first few times you play. In fact, it will prove to be rather difficult to manage and understand at the beginning, but don't worry, since after having done a little practice you will happily see the simplicity and intuitiveness of the commands, as well as the vast choice of actions, thanks to the which you can plan your favorite strategy without any difficulty. The commands available in battle are: Combo Attack (two simple hits with the possessed weapon), Critical Attack (a violent blow that gives the possibility to cancel the opponent's attack), Magics (which we will talk about later), Moves ( which we will talk about later), Objects (use of objects in battle), Escape (the possibility of running away), Defend (the possibility of defending yourself in battle by moving the character or resisting the attack) and finally Tactics (makes you change the strategy of battle if you decide to have your characters managed by the CPU). At the bottom right of the battle screen there is a circle that serves to show the waiting and attack turns of the various characters. Being very complicated to explain well how it works without seeing it, just know that this bar shows you the time necessary to give the command to your character and the time necessary for the command to be completed. Although it might seem trivial described in this way, in reality it is not at all: in fact, with the appropriate attacks, you can cancel or delay the actions of your opponents and vice versa. Furthermore, each action has a different execution time and it will be up to you to decide whether to use a fast move or a slower one. The battles are therefore very strategic, especially those against the most difficult bosses. Here's an example: Your opponent is casting a spell. It will take a certain amount of time before you can launch it and in the meantime your character has reached the input area of a command on the circle. At this point you have to decide what action to take. You can perform another spell (preferably one with a short activation time so that it can be cast before your opponent's), perform a critical attack that could completely cancel the monster's magical attack or, if the spell is about to be thrown (this can be seen from the bar) and therefore you do not have time to make any moves, you can use the defend command to limit the damage. I bet you are now more confused than before, but don't worry, it's extremely easy once you read the instruction manual and practice a little. I will not tire of saying that the possible actions are many and that the strategies that can be adopted are even more so, above all in this Battle System the battlefield is totally in 3D, which means that if, for example, the enemy is too far away, you will have to run close to him to be able to hit him. Now let's move on to the description of Moves and Spells: the former are special shots, usable in combat, which each character learns as he increases in level; the latter instead, as you can well imagine, are very simple spells that are based on different elemental types (fire, water, wind, etc.). While the moves are learned automatically, the spells are not: you will have to find special magical eggs (mana eggs) which give the character who wears them the spells inherent to the category to which the egg belongs (e.g. the aqua egg, which has 3 preset spells: when you equip the egg to a character, he will be able to use those 3 spells). To obtain ever more powerful eggs, and consequently higher level spells, you will have to fuse different types of eggs together; this mechanism gives the player the opportunity to try his hand and have fun creating new and powerful ones, increasing the versatility of each character since he will be able to use any type of magic you create. As a further increase in the potential of your heroes there is the option to attribute particular skills that will give alternative abilities, such as greater attack power against flying monsters, the possibility of dropping more money from monsters, or increasing the parameters of attack, defense etc. The exploratory phase basically has an advantage and a defect: the advantage is that the encounters will not be random, but you will have the possibility to see the enemies and dodge them (very difficult given the high number): the defect however is that you can only save by returning to cities with teleporters, which moreover are placed at a long distance from the final bosses. So get ready for a very challenging game, characterized by a large number of tough enemies and the limited possibility of saving and recovering energy. The setting and the technical part Being Grandia Xtreme a title based almost exclusively on action, it lacks a very poor plot and characterization. All this also greatly affects the setting, which is inevitably disappointing. There are only two cities, one that will be your base (where you can buy items, combine mana eggs, sleep and save), the other is a simple city where you can't do anything except talk to someone. The game map is almost non-existent, and will only be used to select some of the dungeons that you will have to visit. The only noteworthy thing is the structure of the dungeons (fortunately since you will spend 90% of the time here), beautiful in architecture and style, and complex in shape. The graphic part is also noteworthy, the textures are very beautiful and improved compared to those of Grandia2, even the movies, which are not many anyway, are impeccably made. As for the graphics of the battles, it is also very valuable, totally in 3d, boasts excellent light effects, fluid movements of the characters and almost non-existent slowdowns. There are some problems with the management of the cameras, which will often confuse your ideas, making you vulnerable to enemy assaults. The sound leaves much to be desired, the sound effects are nothing special, the battle voices are of very low quality, the music is monotonous and tiring apart from some that stand out among the mediocrity of the others. Though lacking a long story and dialogue, G.X. need many hours to be completed from 30 to 40, at the end you will be able to access a 100-storey superdungeon, which will keep you busy for several more hours. Final comment A very unconvincing title this Grandia X, not worthy of the name it bears. Objectively, the game is weak in those aspects that should be the backbone of RPGs (plot and setting), while instead it is strong in the fundamental aspect of an action game (gameplay). Not that the gameplay is useless in an RPG, for heaven's sake, but even if the playability is excellent, turn-based combat gets tired very easily if there is no thick plot and good characterization to support them. However, the last decision is up to you as always: if you play RPGs for the plot, forget it completely, if instead what interests you are only exploration and fighting, then this could be the game for you. Pros: Fabulous gameplay Complex but rewarding battle system Cons:Non-existent plot Poorly maintained setting Too monotonous Whenever we talk about role-playing games, it is almost inevitable that our mind is ~honored~ by the name Final Fantasy. The most famous series in the world is now the icon of the jrpg, the point of reference for every videogame roleplayer, the name that inevitably defines a particular genre. All this success, the continuous talk almost exclusively of FF, as well as a slow evolutionary growth that this series has had after the seventh chapter, may have tired some enthusiasts. Fortunately, the competition to the now highly praised Final Fantasy is very strong, and boasts titles of excellent quality. The Suikoden and Tales of Destiny series are examples of this, but the one we will be talking about in this review is obviously Grandia. The first Grandia, which appeared on Saturn for the first time and then converted for Psx, was one of the first RPGs that somewhat upset the way of thinking dictated by the Final Fantasy standard. An innovative, dynamic and complete battle system to say the least, together with an exceptional character design, were the factors that made it successful (I'm obviously speaking only of the enthusiasts, given that Grandia has always remained a niche title). After several years, the sequel, Grandia 2, appears on Dreamcast (and later on ps2 and pc), slightly worse than its predecessor, but still a great title. Grandia Xtreme is the new chapter in the series, available only in the American and Japanese versions (nothing is known of a possible pal conversion), which has finally reached our greedy hands for the inevitable and dutiful analysis.", "date": "2003-03-27", "grade": null}
