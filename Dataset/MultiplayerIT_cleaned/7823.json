{"name": "Fast & Freemium", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/118906-fast-furious-6-il-gioco-fast-freemium.html", "text": "You will certainly remember the success story of CSR Racing, a freemium driving game that started quietly on the App Store yet capable of making the development team collect figures equal to twelve million dollars ... a month. A clear demonstration of how the model most hated by gamers and most loved by publishers actually works and generates scary revenues when the product spreads enough and the mechanics really push users to dip into their wallets to buy that coveted upgrade which will finally allow him to win an otherwise too tough race. It is clear that such cases are watched carefully by the developer community, and that is why the guys at Kabam have decided to create something even more ambitious, if you will, by winning the license for the film ~Fast & Furious 6~ and making it a tie-in for iOS and Android devices precisely following the mechanics of CSR Racing. The experience that is delivered to us, once the free download of Fast & Furious 6: The Game, is therefore that of a sui generis racer, in which we do not actually control the car inside a track, but we only adjust the parameters such as the start, the gear change, any NOS and, in this specific case, the entry and exit of the drift in races that are based on drifting. Greater variety than the NaturalMotion title, therefore, but completely identical foundations, given the presence of a ~tank~ that limits the number of consecutive events in which we can participate (and which can be filled or expanded using the game's ~premium~ currency , gold bars), which is filled by taking forced breaks, and a particular focus on upgrading the car, which is the only thing that will allow us to win as the challenges become more complex. To win tomorrow The first thing that strikes you about Fast & Furious 6: The Game is undoubtedly the technical realization. The graphics are in fact really excellent, better than that of the aforementioned CSR Racing (and even better than that of Fast & Furious: Showdown for HD consoles, to be honest), full of details, reflection effects on the bodies, polygonal models really top and an incredibly fluid and stable frame rate even on non-latest generation terminals. It is clear that the developers have managed to obtain these results thanks to the ~binary~ structure, which makes what will occur on the screen predictable and does not allow for meanings or direct visual control, but that the visual impact is extraordinary is beyond doubt. On the gameplay front, the differences compared to the reference title can be counted on the fingers of one hand, but after all the intention was precisely to package a clone and hope that the clamor of the license would attract a large number of users willing not only to download it but also to spend some money through IAP. Let us therefore immediately clarify this aspect: although it is important to be able to proceed expeditiously and with fewer limits, real money is not necessarily spent in Fast & Furious 6: The Game, given that you always have the opportunity to try your hand at already completed races (at least those that follow the plot, with various faces known to fans of the film saga playing leading roles) to collect dollars (the less valuable currency than ingots) and use them to buy new upgrades, thus making the car faster and/or more performing in drift. The upgrade system is very varied and it is also possible to customize the car by changing its paintwork, adding spoilers, mounting different rims and applying vinyl, but it must be admitted that the impact of the individual components is not what we would expect and therefore progress is they do very slowly. An uphill road, ultimately. Even with all the limitations of the freemium model, Fast & Furious 6: The Game is done damn well.", "date": "2013-05-23", "grade": "7.4"}
