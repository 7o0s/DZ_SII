{"name": "Dead Cells: Fatal Falls", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dead-cells-fatal-falls-la-recensione.html", "text": "It's already been three years since Motion Twin officially launched Dead Cells on the market, a roguelike that didn't struggle to make itself known and, in a short time, became one of the most popular independent games for the genre. The credit for all this success undoubtedly goes to the intrinsic qualities of the title but also and above all to the constant support from the developers, who in 36 months and more have never stopped adding new areas, bosses, weapons and balances to this now immense product. Despite this, in this period of time, moreover, players have never been asked to shell out a single additional euro, compared to the approximately 25 euros in the initial list, with the exception of a single occasion in 2020 given by the arrival of the Bad Seed DLC , however sold at a negligible price when compared to the value of the offer. Over the years the skills of the artistic team have grown dramatically and with them the visual quality of Dead Cells has also improved, the graphic effects and the majestic settings, capable of ranging from the narrow recesses of the prison dungeons, up to wide open spaces where nature and magic have taken over, also giving the eye those decidedly welcome and expected extra details. Today we find ourselves in the situation of being able to talk about it again on these pages thanks to the arrival on all platforms of Fatal Falls, the third official DLC that appeared a few hours ago on the various digital stores. So time to pick up the title and evaluate it also by virtue of the new entries on the market: here is the review of Dead Cells: Fatal Falls. The usual great gameplay A truly beautiful game is recognized immediately and when a title like this, after three years, is still fresh, precise and visually incisive it is because we are faced with a real cornerstone. In fact, it doesn't matter how much time has passed since the last time you picked up a pad and started swinging in the dark world of Dead Cells, it only takes a few moments to find yourself at ease again, as if that pad didn't you have ever set aside. The fluid movements and animations, the jumps that seem almost perfectly magnetized towards the furthest ledges, give an experience that is never frustrating although, over time, the difficulty has not decreased despite the many changes to the game dynamics. Fatal Falls then wants to re-propose the same experience had with the previous DLC, a set of levels and enemies that are never extraneous to the production but rather an integral part of an ecosystem that is still sublime today. However, the new theme does not focus on raw combat and turns the gameplay on the most extreme platform, with the opponents engaged in an attempt to make you fall into the void rather than beheading you cleanly as in the past. The contents are inserted in the mid-late game and will not be available on the first run, this gives time to get used to the game again and avoid crashing into a wall when the new monsters arrive, with their unique patterns and their tricky abilities to avoid . Motion Twin has updated almost all the connections in the existing levels to allow new and old players to reach the first of the new areas, Fractured Shrines, quite easily, being able to pass both from the first area introduced with Bad Seed, facing Mama Tick, and arriving there through the Black Bridge in case you want, for some strange reason, to buy only this DLC and skip the previous one. Once in the new area, a real hell awaits you, given that perfectly timed parries and dodges will no longer be enough to save your skin. The enemies clearly intend to throw a spoke in your wheels as you desperately try to jump from one platform to another as already mentioned and to these are added moving platforms unable to support the weight of your alter ego for long and spinning axes carefully placed to require your commitment even in the apparently easiest jumps. Then there are traps scattered on the floor with logs ready to overwhelm us but which you can also use to throw your opponents off the platforms, thus earning some new achievements. At the end of the level, however, the nasty surprise: to access the next biome you must have worn a special outfit that can be recovered in the level, forcibly requiring a second run. Not bad, of course, given the cyclical nature with which Dead Cells games are started and a nuisance among other things that can be avoided by intelligently exploiting the dislocation of your head, a unique feature for this content that opens up interesting future options from the point of view of possessionsion of enemies. Tough enemies and advanced weapons Opponents show up with a healthy amount of health, and the snakemen will give you a hard time with their ranged strike and quick teleportation. However, the biggest difficulty comes from the stone giants placed to protect the most valuable treasures, beasts with an abnormal attack range and capable of killing you with a single blow in the unfortunate event you are playing with a large number of active Cells. If Fractured Shrine tends to play with light and yellowish colors, Undying Shores will instead drag you into a darker region where undead and spirits are the order of the day, ready to drag you into the presence of the only new boss added for the opportunity: a rather anonymous scarecrow in appearance but who will be able to really give you a hard time, being one of the most complex boss fights seen in the updates by virtue of his great mobility. There is also a whole series of new weapons and powers that expand the already rich range of Dead Cells options, mostly magical weapons and driven by their own life capable of autonomously attacking enemies while you move rapidly around the screen or bo with which to send the shots back to the sender, plus a new companion that adds to the already highly appreciated owl and mushroom. Motion Twin has decided to go big to relaunch the game and starting today the title will be playable completely free for an entire week on the Nintendo E-shop (in case you have an online subscription) while a discount of 50% on all other consoles, don't miss out!", "date": "2021-01-26", "grade": "9.0"}
