The EKO Software title did not struggle to be talked about at the end of last year for its mixture of survival, role-playing and action genres seasoned with the derivatives of that zombie setting that has filled the media pages too recently. It is therefore not strange that 505 Games also brings How to Survive to Wii U; what amazes is the timing. The desire to wait a bit to set up a development of controls that try to do justice to the Gamepad passes, the desire to monetize as much as possible on much more capillary digital stores than the eShop by allocating a redesigned version for the hardware to the latter . After having tested the new applications on the Nintendo flagship by hand, the conclusion reached on this port can be expressed with a moderate enthusiasm, but clearly lower than what was already proposed in October 2013. Good use of the second screen of the Gamepad unfortunately merges with some design shortcomings that EKO Software has almost hastily chosen to adopt, which inevitably weigh on the overall experience. Let's see in order the strengths and weaknesses of this conversion. The port of How to Survive to Wii U alternates good implementation of controls with unexpected flaws Realm screen When analyzing a zombie game on Wii U, one immediately thinks of Zombie U. Presented as a launch title, the Ubisoft product set the bar of ideas one step above average, thanks to real-time design gimmicks that they returned with dignity the condition of always being hunted by the undead horde. Solving puzzles, using objects, menus, quick time events, all inserted in an unobstructed game flow and therefore rewarding in its small way. We already knew from previous iterations that How to Survive had its own style of merging pausing the game action with the use of consumables only in-game, and EKO Software - thanks to the Gamepad's dual screen support - was good at melt the two sides of the medals. How to Survive integrates the screen in a manner appropriate to the end, guaranteeing menus and maps that can be consulted at any time, even during the general break, to allow us to arrange the inventory and check direction and objectives; to use the objects instead it will necessarily be necessary to be in the game, thus guaranteeing a certain continuity to the action. Mind you, we are not talking about a feature that moves masses of commentators; simply, having a second window where you can check the status, rucksack grid, map, statistics and everything you can consult in real time makes the Gamepad a good exploration accessory. Something not applicable with fluency on the remaining consoles, for this reason considered almost an obligation towards Wii U, which has the ideal tools to allow a true survival game, also based on asynchronous control speed of the bag of objects and consumables; we are pleased that the team has come to the same conclusions. Of course, it must be said that after 8 months of waiting it was at least right to expect a little uniqueness and characterization compared to the other iterations. The now ubiquitous off-screen play support closes the parenthesis, which allows you to play the title entirely on the Gamepad, a function that ideally brings the single-screen mechanics closer to the counterparts on competing hardware. Couch-zombie Nintendo has always represented a stronghold of living room gaming, just that kind of old-fashioned gaming, on the same sofa, with that sociality far from earphones and VoIP. We don't know and will never know if it was Nintendo that clamored for the elimination of online co-op: the only certain thing, however, is how absolutely incredible this choice adopted by EKO is to tolerate in mid-2014, then calculating the little technical weight on the plate and the fact that this possibility is present on every previous iteration. So forget about playing How to Survive with remote friends: you'll have to call them at home and share their progress with the GamePad and Pro Controller. A purist could rejoice in the thing, praising a vintage approach and dreaming of afternoons of zombie devastation to spend in the company of a friend, but frankly it is more a screen of obvious development limits than anything else. Mario Kart 8 demonstrated that online infrastructure is not a problem for Wii U, so the only question left is why PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, at the end of 2013, already had this feature on day-one and Wii U , to date, does not have it. We add that the title, however pleasant, would greatly enjoy such a service, invirtue of a completely fairly low and sometimes repetitive time that goes very well with an online relationship with other players. Another side on which the team could have worked much more is certainly the aesthetic one: textures, animations, a few bugs here and there. Calculating an already technically poor title, the advances compared to the old gen consoles are practically imperceptible, which is disappointing for hardware that mounts GPUs of advanced generations compared to the old flagships and which makes one turn up one's nose at the full price requested.", "date": "2014-06-24", "grade": "7.0"}
