Read this way it might even seem like a positive thing, or that the end credits could arrive even before tackling the adventure, were it not that you are on the ~wrong~ side, therefore of evil, more precisely in those of a particularly devoted offspring to your parent. Laegrinna will try to do everything to find the twelve pieces of the relic that will allow her to break the spell and free the demonic parent. To make it, he will need all the help he can get from other components of an unlikely ~crew~, which may seem anything but evil creatures ... and instead they are, and a lot. We start with Velguirie, the first addition - which will be discussed specifically later - and then Allura, Reina and Millennia: each of them has some curious abilities, linked to a certain type of attack and the use of specific traps. From a graphic point of view, we don't notice a great attention to detail, both for the textures and for the polygonal modeling reduced to the minimum terms: technical characteristics that already creaked quite a lot on PlayStation 3, but which on next gen are still noticeable more in the negative. The animations manage to be of a crazy woodiness, yet the ~bouncing~ of the busty protagonists' breasts is reproduced with maniacal care, a sign that the developers have obviously focused on that aspect. Deception IV: The Nightmare Princess goes little further than the sensual looks of its protagonists We are the bad guys Speaking of gameplay, it is more than necessary to underline, for those who do not know what this title looks like, how one should approach each game of Deception IV: The Nightmare Princess. Let's start with the choice of costume, which is essential for having the right style in battle, even if initially only one will be available and the others will be unlocked as you progress along the adventure. Once you don the correct attire - they are all designed to leave nothing to the imagination, fear not - you will find yourself in a castle of dubious architectural taste and devoid of any frills or furniture. Some soldiers, attracted by the legend of some evil witches, decide to enter the ~haunted house~ to kill us. It is of course an army of warriors, but as a courtesy to them you will encounter a few at a time, in waves. After reading a copious panegyric of written text, which serves as a narrative background and an attempt to add depth to the experience, one finally enters the battle. In each room you can pause, observe it from above looking at it with the classic grids and choose where to place your traps. The logic with which you choose them will necessarily follow two strategies: the first linked to the objective to be achieved, the second to the type of enemy you are facing. Some opponents, in fact, are completely immune to certain weapons and for this you will have to select them and study their weak point. However, it is essential to turn the various areas of the mansion that will gradually unlock, so as to understand in which room there is a ready-made trap, such as falling organ pipes, sharp arrows, disturbing statues capable of discharging powerful lightning and so on . Deception IV: The Nightmare Princess had appeared in the ~Blood Ties~ version about a year ago and the version that also arrives on PlayStation 4 today does not overturn the basic rules, but adds some ingredients to the original formula, mixing everything with such irreverent irony . One of the introductions of this version that will have operational implications in the resolution of some quests, as well as a different behavior in the approach to opponents, is the inclusion of a new she-devil called Velguirie. This has the ability to launch attacks against enemies, which will greatly affect the ability to move in the game areas. In fact, where normally one escapes, letting a soldier land on a ~hot~ area in which to trigger deadly dangers, in this case the player will force things, being able to actually attack. Also on the modality front we find two very pleasant additions, especially for the completionists and for those who want to increase the time on this title: ~Quest mode~ and ~Deception Studio~. Playstation 4 trophies The total number of trophies to collect is 35, including platinum of course. The six gold trophies represent the real challenge - for the others, just play the various modes calmly and you will collect everything - especially since they ask you to maintain a high rank in the more advanced quests.And. Nothing impossible, however. There is work to be done In the large number of items that make up the menu, we start from the ~Quest~ mode which adds a hundred puzzles to the offer, all to be solved in the role of the beautiful Velguirie. This full-bodied mode allows you to achieve certain set objectives, but also to make a field test of your skills, as a sort of advanced tutorial, so as to become familiar with some specific mechanics as well as obtain benefits with the release of new traps. By playing the classic campaign mode, however, we will relive the chapters of the first version of the game through the castle and the three sub-missions that make up each episode. Deception IV: The Nightmare Princess doesn't present itself with too much difficulty, mainly due to a really badly programmed artificial intelligence. The ~Deception Studio~ is another novelty of this version: within the level you can create personalized challenges and situations, setting any parameter as you like, but above all you can record videos and watch replays. In fact, you can create a character starting from scratch: type of weapons, strength and cultural background; for everything there is an advanced editing system. It's nothing but fanservice at the highest level, but there are plenty of purists who will be able to indulge themselves with the craziest combo sets. The ~free battle~ is the possibility of acting in sandbox style, reshuffling the cards of pre-existing characters and situations. The fear that players will not be able to overcome some tactical difficulties has forced the development team to create an external ~tutorial~, although the campaign and the ~Quest~ mode are also well documented and with no learning curve steep. It is important to remember that the speech is only and exclusively in Japanese, while of the five languages available for subtitles, there is no Italian, so English will almost necessarily have to be chosen. The British idiom is not complex, on the contrary it is used in an elementary way, but considering that a large part of the story is narrated, with rather substantial dialogues, the linguistic limit could ~castrate~ the experience of some users. Certainly the ~hall of fame~, called ~Museum~, in which all the player's exploits are recorded: from the points acquired to the list of enemies killed - it is even indicated how they lost their lives - and the various details on the characters themselves.", "date": "2015-07-16", "grade": "6.0"}
