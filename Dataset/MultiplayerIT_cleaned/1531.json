{"name": "Conflict: Desert Storm II", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/conflict-desert-storm-ii-2.html", "text": "The enemy at the gates Conflict: Desert Storm II is presented as a third-person shooter in which the player is called upon to manage a special team of four elements, each characterized by specific abilities and different types of weapons and equipment. The first approach with the small handful of soldiers protagonists of the game occurs during the training mode, freely selectable from the menu. Here, in full American boot camp style, the classic screaming sergeant explains to the user the basic functions of the control system (actually not very precise and accurate) and some elementary survival techniques within a war scenario. Unfortunately, despite the energetic advice of the sergeant mentioned above, the training mode does not prove to be particularly suitable for properly preparing the player (especially the one who has not had the opportunity to try the prequel, or worse, is at his first experience with such a title) to face the real action on the battlefield, paving the way for a possible initial frustration caused by too superficial knowledge of the game mechanics. Instruction booklet and patience in hand, however, even the most inexperienced user shouldn't encounter huge problems in entering the playful perspective of Conflict: Desert Storm II. Which, incidentally, is a not particularly realistic tactical-based squad shooter, and indeed rather inclined to lead to a more markedly arcade direction. The player can take control of each of the four team members at any time, while the remaining three rely on discrete AI routines and follow the orders given by the soldier controlled by the user to the letter (open/stop fire, follow the leader, hold the position and reach a certain destination). Four is better than one The various missions that make up the Campaign mode are characterized by a massive presence of enemy forces, an element that discourages an overly aggressive approach: in short, solitary actions a la Rambo are inevitably destined to end up with game over. Instead, it is necessary to exploit the potential of the members of your team properly, also making use of the different items of equipment available (numerically increased compared to the prequel). Just to give an example, a useful strategy to get rid of an enemy tank can be to cover the advance of one of your men with smoke grenades, allowing him to position himself behind the armored vehicle and launch a rocket at his weak point . One of the most positive aspects of Conflict: Desert Storm II is precisely the flexibility of the game scheme, which allows the user to act in the way he deems most appropriate, adopting the most diverse tactics. Unfortunately, one's plans, however meticulously planned, do not always succeed, often due to flaws in the AI of one's teammates: it is not uncommon to see one of our men who has been entrusted with the task of maintaining the position succumb under enemy fire without them lifting a finger. And it gets even more annoying knowing that the death of even a single soldier leads to the failure of the mission, forcing the player to repeat significant portions of the mission, given the not always optimal positioning of the checkpoints. But despite these shortcomings, however relevant, Conflict: Desert Storm II still remains an enjoyable title, also made pleasing to the eye by discreet cosmetics. With the exception of some rather woody animations, not too defined textures and a not exactly stellar frame rate, the graphic sector of the Pivotal title performs its duty very well, holding up even the split screen of the fun co-operative mode more than decently. Comment Conflict: Desert Storm II is certainly a better title than the mediocre prequel, but which nevertheless fails to reach particularly high quality levels due to a series of gaps in terms of game structure and technical implementation. The control system isn't always precise, the AI routines of your teammates and enemies aren't particularly brilliant and the game can be excessively frustrating at times due to questionable technical choices. Frame rate not always constant and a cosmetic characterized by significant ups and downs are the flaws of a compartor graphic all in all, however discreet. That said, Conflict: Desert Storm II nevertheless remains a pleasant product, whose strengths are mainly made up of a good level design, a flexible game plan and the presence of a fun co-operative mode. A title therefore advisable to lovers of the genre, a little less to all the others. Pros: Good level design Balanced mix of strategy and action Fun co-operative modes Cons: AI not always up to par Control system not very precise Can be frustrating When you say tie it to your finger. Not happy with having brought the Gulf War back to the screens with the mediocre Conflict: Desert Storm, the English developers of Pivotal Games return to the crime scene with a sequel of the same name. Iraq again, Saddam Hussein again, Gulf War again, tactical-based squad shooter again. But infinitely better than the previous one, to hear the not exactly disinterested declarations of the game coders. Now let's see if, in the midst of these classic ~shots~ there is also a fund of truth ...", "date": "2003-10-06", "grade": null}
