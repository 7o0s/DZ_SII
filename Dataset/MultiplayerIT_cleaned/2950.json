The game begins by telling us about their current status as forgotten heroes, who ended up performing tasks that have nothing to do with the ones that made them famous. Naturally, it doesn't take long that Pimple, Rash and Zitz (the three Battletoads) decide to seek redemption by throwing themselves headlong into a new adventure, thus ending up running into an old acquaintance of theirs, the Dark Queen, the boss of the first Battletoads (here in a completely different guise), and managing to antagonize an entire alien race (actually more than one, but let's not quibble). In between there are brawls, daring escapes aboard an alien used as a sled, space fights, existential crises and lots and lots of arcade action, with constant references to the eighties and nineties, and with a particular taste for the paradoxical, which seems wink at some cornerstones of modern animation such as Futurama, Rick and Morty and Final Space, just to name a few titles. everything is told with cartoon-style graphics that are excellently drawn and animated (too bad for the not very high quality dubbing), whose style remains uniform both in the filmed sequences and in the game phases, despite the use of different techniques to underline better the various moments. On paper Battletoads is a Final Fight-style scrolling fighting game, as was the original chapter developed by RARE and published on a multitude of systems. It was the year 1991 and the goal of the English studio was to create a game and characters that competed with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, given their enormous success in arcades and on home systems. Thus was born a hybrid that combined fighting game sections with platform parts, probably precisely to recall the two main genres of the most famous Ninja Turtles games. In hindsight we can say that the Battletoads series was short and not exactly exceptional. In particular, the first chapter for the NES, strangely the most successful, was plagued by an insane difficulty, which forced the developers to overhaul the game mechanics and level design in the port phase. Despite this, there is no doubt that RARE's frogs still have many fans, so much so that requests to dedicate a new game to them have been very frequent over the years, at least until the subject of this review was actually announced. The fighting game In reality, considering the new Battletoads only as a scrolling fighting game is an understatement, how wrong. The game consists of four acts (it takes about four hours to finish it the first time) for a total of twenty-five phases, of which only eight belong to the Double Dragon and associates genre. The other sections are a kaleidoscope of mini games including platforming levels, skill games, interactive cutscenes, endless runner sections and even bullet hell stages. And this is where the biggest problem of the game comes in, which however requires a long premise to be understood. The beat 'em up sequences are excellently done, making you want to have more. The combo system works beautifully and the possibility of being able to jump from one character to another during the action (if you play alone), gives a great variety, which never makes you feel tired of grinding punches against enemies. Grips and weapons are missing, but on the other hand the frogs have a tongue that can be used to grab enemies and objects scattered throughout the levels (especially collectibles, which are used to raise scores and unlock achievements), as well as to grab some ledges and change plane. Our amphibious heroes can also spit out chewing gum that blocks enemies for short moments and which are used to solve some small puzzles, usually related to the aforementioned collectibles. Speaking of puzzles, depending on the level there are different ones: from having to overcome obstacle courses to unlock electronic locks, to having to recreate circuits to get electricity to a specific point. In general, the feedback of the shots has been studied in an excellent way to give greater weight to the more powerful ones and less to the rapid attacks. It's also a great way to better characterize the characters, who differ precisely in speed, agility and physical prowess, characteristics that are reflected in their fighting techniques. Even the special shots, spectacular transformations, give great satisfaction, especially when usedyou in combo with other attacks. Depending on how many hits you manage to chain and the spectacularity of the combos, you receive a score in each fight. Opponents change from level to level and reflect the scenario you are in. For example, in a map of the second act we will face alien lumberjacks capable of throwing very powerful axes, while in other situations we will have to deal with electric creatures who can give us the shock through liquids. There are also bosses - four in total, all with their own specific attack patterns. They're not insurmountable, but they offer a good challenge, especially the final one. Wanting to make a comparison with a very recent title, we are on the Streets of Rage 4 side with regard to the general care of these sections and the exaltation that one feels in piling up enemies. What better compliment? Unfortunately, the developers decided that at a certain point in the adventure the fighting game phases had to be made practically disappear, to make room for other genres, probably in pursuit of an uncontrolled citation of the entire franchise, which however proves to be harmful in the long run distance. If in the first and second acts the presence of alternative sections does not annoy, because it acts as a counterpoint to the main ones, in the third act the fighting game Battletoads is set aside completely, to return very timidly in the fourth and final act, with moreover, a not exactly exceptional fight and a well-made final boss battle, but fought in a level without depth of movement (the characters can only move left and right, jumping when necessary) and in a scenario that is anything but spectacular . The truth is that when you start to anticipate the wonders of the last levels, with new enemies to beat with a blow and some gigantic bosses to defeat, you find yourself disappointed to note that those levels practically do not exist. Sure, you can replay the previous ones by increasing the difficulty, but the feeling that something is missing is really strong, especially when you play cooperatively and are deprived of the best gameplay. Too many mini games And the other sections? Here the matter gets complicated because they are almost all of good quality, but none really excels. Furthermore, the same argument made for the fighting game sections applies to them: when they start to be able to say something more, it is also the moment in which they stop appearing. Let's take the pure platform phases found in the third act: the first is very simple and overall very flat. The second starts to look better with more complicated obstacles and a more structured level design, while the third is the best, with logical puzzles based on the pressure of levers and self-propelled platforms, a more labyrinthine construction of the map than the others. Too bad that at this point the experience is truncated without too much concern. The same can be said for the bullet hell stages: they range from the first section, very simple and uninteresting in its underlying calmness, up to the third, which offers the greatest challenge and makes it more possible thanks to its greater difficulty, which it allowed the designers to show the key elements of the genre, but it becomes an end in itself when you realize that it doesn't last very long and doesn't have a sequel. Taken by themselves these phases would be considered as pleasant pastimes, but when one realizes that for alien reasons the developers have made them the supporting elements of an entire act, then the jarring becomes too strong to be ignored. The same goes for the 3D obstacle course sections, which reference the Turbo Tunnel level from the NES version of the first Battletoad - enjoyable, but why not delve into them instead of leaving them with the stigma of a mini game? Mind you: we are not talking about a bad title as a whole, but only one that inspires absurd anger in its lack of a strong identity that supports the gameplay to the end. What it has to offer is so much, but it seems too fragmented and inconclusive. If the developers had focused more on the beat'em-up sections, we would have had one of the best exponents of the genre of modern times in our hands. As it stands, however, it's just a compilation of well-crafted half-games.", "date": "2020-08-20", "grade": "7.5"}
