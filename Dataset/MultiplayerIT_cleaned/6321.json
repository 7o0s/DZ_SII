Auriea Harvey and Michal Samyn are among the few to have elaborated real poetics in a playful form, since their first title, Endless Forest, which concedes little or nothing to the gamer understood in the traditional and conservative sense. The risk, of which they have always been aware, is the inevitable misunderstanding. After the cryptic Bientt l't and the epidermal Luxuria Superbia, Sunset marks the return to a narrative that is only apparently more canonical: Angela Burnes is a waitress who works for a certain Gabriel Ortega, a very rich art lover with mysterious affairs. Angela's job consists of going one hour a week to Ortega's opulent apartment, whom she has never met in person, to carry out various tasks, which from time to time are written on a post-it. Each task requires time which is subtracted from the hour available. In the remaining time Angela can roam around the apartment and explore it. Every day there are new things to see, new works of art on display that complement the rich furnishings of the house, new books left around and, sometimes, new rooms left open with secrets inside or, simply, pieces of life Ortega. It soon becomes clear that there is nothing compulsory to do, not even the jobs marked on the post-it. Right from the start, against the background of this strange long-distance story, made up of coded messages and love for art, a military dictatorship is revealed which is destroying the country, the imaginary state of Anchuria. What will happen from the moment you set foot in the apartment until the end of the game will be partly inevitable, partly the result of the choices made, some of which are only apparently secondary. Will the Tale of Tales have succeeded with Sunset in producing a new videogame artwork? Multifaceted story After Sunset, several questions remain in mind regarding the nature of what has been experienced. It is not an easy title, although it offers a level of usability that is certainly more accessible than other works by Tale of Tales. The difficulty of understanding lies entirely in the multiple nature of what is narrated, that is, in the different levels of possible reading, which greatly alter the perception of the story if investigated as they deserve. As already mentioned, the player is basically called to perform a series of actions in the same environment, Ortega's apartment, but it soon turns out that he is playing another role in a more complex picture. In this the Tale of Tales have been true masters, managing to stage a strong story full of contrasts without ever showing other characters than Angela, who makes decisions throughout the adventure in complete autonomy, changing the features of the apartment and some narrative aspects in a natural and elaborate way, if observed in perspective. Sunset therefore tells of a country under a military dictatorship, of a relationship between two individuals who do not know each other which however becomes increasingly intense, in which reciprocal feelings are expressed not in bodily presence, but in the recognition of the actions performed. It is a story of love, hate, contempt, understanding, affection, with even unexpected erotic implications. It is also the story of the passion for art and for what it truly represents in the culture of a people, to the point that among the first acts of the dictatorship there is precisely the attempt to destroy all the works contrary to the regime (an ignorant people is more fragmented, therefore more controllable). But Sunset is also the metaphor of the world of video games, with the barbaric occupation of the scene by oppressive giants who have tried to wipe out all forms of diversity, and with the claim that a brutal representation can compensate for all the other nuances of life Human. Angela The weeks go by and we end up bonding deeply with Angela, getting to know her better than other video game protagonists with whom we spend hours with getting nothing but grunts and a few jokes. We see it in all the reflections of the apartment, we hear it in the replies that can be given to some messages left around by Ortega, we suffer for her when she shows concern for the fate of her brother, engaged in resistance against the regime, we worry when some external agent intervenes to disturb the peace of the apartment, where silence reigns or at most the songs played on vinyl records left in the rooms by the landlord. Although you never go out, the outside is always present. For Sunset, as for few other video games, the soundtrack is worth contemplating, used to describe the outside world,that is, to let historical events enter a closed, muffled, ideal place, perfect for emotional escape, a typical attitude of the average western man in the face of tragedies; detached from a reality that tries to break in throughout the adventure. So as we go about our chores we can hear the sound of helicopters flying across the skies or bullets being fired by factions in battle. The music reminds us where we are, helping us to get into the feelings of the story, while the radio propagates the evolution of the war. If desired, we can observe the profiles of the buildings in front of the apartment with a telescope, the only way to get closer to them. Sometimes it is Angela herself who describes events that would otherwise be closed to us. Indirect dictatorship The description of the imaginary dictator Miraflores' takeover of power will remind many of Augusto Pinochet's Chilean coup. The comedy parts are very similar, with the other world powers, even the democratic ones, collaborating with the dictator to establish their economic status quo, indifferent to the destruction and crimes against humanity committed by his mediocre madness. Even the years correspond, given that Sunset takes place between 1972 and 1973 and the coup d'tat in which Chilean president Salvador Allende was ousted took place precisely on September 11, 1973. Reporting this closeness between the events narrated in Sunset and the Chilean revolution is not secondary. Video games usually exploit historical facts as a mere context to give vent to some shootings, without delving into the tragic dynamics. How many WWII shooters or other titles have been released? How many of these have minimally touched the complexity of the events that occurred in those years? Here, Sunset manages to make the weight of oppression and social instability of a coup d'tat feel without ever having the player leave an apartment. The gameplay, with all its facets, instills a deep melancholy despite being made only of indirect stories. We are probably dealing with one of the most adult video games ever made, a work of art in the purest sense of the term that continually thinks about the limits of its representation, without ever allowing room for rhetorical drifts and without falling into captions typical of those who address certain topics with little awareness of them. If you want it is another way to define a masterpiece.", "date": "2015-05-21", "grade": "9.0"}
