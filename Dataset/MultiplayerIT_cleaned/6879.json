However, the latest to try to capture the magic of this sport is Matchpoint - Tennis Championship, published by Kalypso Media and developed by Torus Games. But let's see in detail how much and if it convinced us in the review of Matchpoint - Tennis Championship. Matchpoint - Tennis Championship: long answer The heart of the playful experience of a tennis game is the feeling on the courts. It is essential for those preparing to develop these titles to hit three key points: the sensory response of the exchanges and the ball, the differentiation of the rebound with respect to the pitch and the responsiveness of the tennis player to the player's commands. We therefore based our analysis of the gameplay on these three aspects. Starting from the first point, it is clear how Matchpoint shows a wink to the exponents of the aforementioned genre. The ball and shot pointing system does not distort the genre of belonging and adapts to what has already been seen in other iterations. Even in terms of feeling, we are dealing with a tried and tested system that enthusiasts will have no difficulty finding again in a short time. Basically you hit the ball by pressing one of the 4 keys assigned to the shots (flat, top spin, lob and drop) by managing its strength (key pressing time) and direction (pointing with the analog stick). The exchanges are intense and in many cases even fun, the only problem is the AI, but we will talk about this later. Continuing to examine the three key aspects, the second is certainly a sore point. To date it is difficult to understand how, beyond production and budget limits, it is not possible to concentrate on the bounce of the ball. The big difference between playing surfaces is what allows real tennis players to be more or less suited to a type of terrain (Nadal the master of clay, Federer or Murray of grass, and so on). To date, this detail is only mentioned in video game productions dedicated to tennis and we don't understand why. Whether you play on clay or hard, it won't make much difference in Matchpoint and that's a shame. The third and final point is also not convincing in Matchpoint - Tennis Championship. Unfortunately, the game is marred by a series of technical problems, such as animations, AI and a very precarious general stability which also affect the responsiveness of some actions in game. In some cases this has generated a frustration not due to our mistakes which, in experiences that have simulative ambitions, must be totally absent. Graphics and Technique Matchpoint - Tennis Championship: cross backhand We have underlined how the technical component is an obvious problem of Matchpoint - Tennis Championship. Unfortunately the game AI from Torus Games is not acceptable. The guys on the development team have focused their efforts on customizing the style of play of the tennis players (few of them are licensed, to be honest), taking the AI to an incomprehensible extreme. Not only do the protagonists have obvious gaps in animation and ~rail racing~, but it is often impossible for those who play to influence the game with their own decisions. The possibility made available to the player to perform offensive and defensive ~volleys~ (there would also be a discussion about this choice) is in fact useless and impossible to implement. Matchpoint - Tennis Championship will allow the player to go to the net only and exclusively if the opponent allows it by ~calling~ the player with a drop shot otherwise it will be impossible to get close to the top of the court. Even on a graphic level, the game certainly does not show peaks of excellence, on the contrary. Both the models of the players, the public and the fields are unfortunately far below the standard level of a production similar to that offered by Torus Games. With great surprise, there is a lot of difference between the faces of the tennis players in the menus (definitely beautiful to look at) and the models in play (incredibly different in workmanship). The biggest doubt then remains on the choice to avoid a diversification of the athletes' physiques which varies only between men and women, but which does not change between the different tennis players of the same gender. Mode Matchpoint - Tennis Championship: character creation The last aspect to analyze is the play offer proposed by Matchpoint. The Torus Games title offers practice and training, online and offline quick matches and a career mode. Beyond this ultima however, there is little and nothing concretely satisfactory. In prince mode you will take on the role of a rookie player (created by you) who will have to climb to the top of the MTC ranking (ATP ed) to become the number 1 tennis player in the world. In addition to the paucity of this offer, the problem we have encountered is that of an excessive shortage of licenses. Not only is the designer clothing sparse, but the total absence of official tournaments is total. The lack of depth in terms of choices and solutions proposed during the game time frame in the career is unjustifiable, as is the absence of the double.
