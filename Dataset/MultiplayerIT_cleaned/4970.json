{"name": "Beat Cop", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/181495-beat-cop-poliziotti-sbirri.html", "text": "Beat Cop is a game that teaches us how tough the life of a neighborhood cop can be, especially if the area you have to manage is a piece of land where Mafia and ghetto gangs wage war, if petty criminals make their living it's tough on traders, people are uncivilized, the boss yells at you because you have to pay at least ten fines and you have alimony to pay to your ex-wife, who's tired of always seeing you at work. But since we can't choose the table on which we play our game, at least we can decide how to play it. Maybe instead of issuing that fine we turn a blind eye and pocket some money, maybe instead of arresting that mobster we let him go to ask for a favor later, maybe we nip low-level crime while the big shots line our pockets, or we decide to do the hard and pure, people will appreciate it, but there is always the risk of dying of lead poisoning within days of retirement. Beat Cop is an interesting adventure that reminds us that life is made up of choices Fines and old ladies Beat Cop is a cross between an adventure and a management game. On the one hand there will be the story of the protagonist, an agent accused of a crime he did not commit who must make a name for himself and try to figure out who framed him, on the other there will be the daily management of all the tasks related to the stretch of road we will have to patrol. Being set in the 80s, the game exploits all the genre clichs of Lethal Weapon-style buddy cop movies: an always pissed off boss, unpleasant colleagues, machismo, street slang and stuffs everything with pop quotes of all kinds (in a building all the tenants have the names of the protagonists of Aliens), to the delight of those who know how to appreciate these details. But under its ironic and postmodern exterior, Beat Cop hides a decidedly more interesting heart that will reveal itself over time. Being able to fulfill all the required tasks is sometimes difficult, even if the game could have been much more punishing, to get to the end of the day in the best possible situation we will have to continually choose between selfishness and altruism, between helping others or ourselves, between the easy and the more difficult one. Minute after minute, choice after choice, Beat Cop tells us about the difficulties we experience every day, tells us that opportunities don't wait for you, that life is hard and that each of us faces a lot of small and big ~quests~ every day. ~ that the rest of the world ignores. With all the emphasis placed on our decisions and their consequences Beat Cop feels like an expanded version of Paper Please in which the variables multiply and branch to an effect that will at times leave us extremely confused and intimidated. So many things to do, so little time. One hand washes the other Another interesting aspect of Beat Cop is undoubtedly its social critique of a job, that of neighborhood policeman, which should be done with extreme care and which instead is brutalized by metrics that have little to do with keeping the situation under control . An example of this situation is mandatory fines. Every day our boss will assign us a minimum ceiling of fines to be enforced under certain conditions, for example fines for no parking or for wheel wear, but if we don't succeed we will not only be treated very badly, but we will also lose money. This has two repercussions on our work, the first is that we end up concentrating only on the fines and maybe we don't chase the thief who has just snatched an old lady, the second is that if we don't find enough no-parking cars we will be tempted by the idea of fine someone who has done nothing. Sometimes it will go well, sometimes it will go badly and we will be caught. The same criterion applies to attempts at corruption: the system is based on metrics that we cannot know and which simulate the randomness of life. There are those who steal for years without ever being discovered and those who end up in the spotlight at the first mistake, it will be up to us to choose whether to walk the razor's edge and maybe save some money or not. Then there are all those tasks that you don't want to do but have to complete to avoid messes, like looking after the boss's grandmother, who has Alzheimer's and will force you to gorge yourself on donuts, while maybe a girl gets mugged in the alley below. And of course whose fault is it if things go wrong? Always and only yours. - fines + malt From the point of view of game mechanics, Beat Cop is a fairly simple title, but with some touches of class. The simplest thing we will be able to do is to check every car on the street to see if the parking meter has expired, over time we will also be able to check the baroad, check the license plate and lights. The funniest thing in this case is realizing that we almost always tend to check the worst cars instead of the rich ones, because it is more likely that they have something wrong, or that after a while our desire to be inflexible it will inevitably be modified by routine or need. Since there are so many things to do, we will have a notebook on which short and long-term tasks will be automatically assigned and which will gradually be crossed out. To move and talk to people, just click on the sidewalk, on the door of a shop or on the person we want to consult. If we want we can also run, but only for a short period of time. Obviously there are handcuffs, to arrest any fugitives, and a gun, which you will use very, very rarely. Each day will end at 5pm, plus or minus minute, after which each of our decisions will be summed up in a screen that will show how much credit we've earned against the various factions, how much money we've put in our pockets and then off we go, towards another day as a cop trying to survive. There are so many variables involved that, if anxiety hasn't eaten away, you will always find a great reason to try playing it again, if only to know what happens when playing according to the various angles of your moral compass. But if until now we've been good cops, the time has come to be bad, because unfortunately all this beautiful system sometimes doesn't hold up due to bugs and code inaccuracies that are decidedly unpleasant. There are times when you'll be asked to arrest a guy but the description won't match, other times you'll only be able to make two decisions when you have two decisions, and too often you'll be penalized for getting an assignment right at the end of the day when you don't have time. to finish it. Once we completed every possible task for the day, yet they took money from us saying it wasn't like that. Furthermore, it seemed to us that the story, after a fairly strong start, lost its strength and dragged on for too long: the result is that, in certain moments, Beat Cop is trivially boring, but we don't know if it is a desired feeling or not .", "date": "2017-03-29", "grade": "7.5"}
