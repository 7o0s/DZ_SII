The game, developed by SEGA in collaboration with audio software kings Crypton Future Media, is a concentration of Japanese clichs in a single cartridge for Nintendo 3DS. First of all, it is a very particular genre, a balanced mix between a rhythm game and a management game, which is all the rage in the country of the rising sun and in general throughout Asia. The key element (or elements) of the production are its young and pretty singers, dressed in improbable looks and with a ~Harajuku style~ taste, who want to become stars of the Jpop world and to do this learn to dance, sing and do choreography like the perfect young Japanese Raffaella Carr. What could be more nerdy, if you also add that the style is super deformed and that there are a lot of super kawaii (ie cute and cuddly) collectibles? Sing, dance and choreograph with a very young jpop idol? With Hatsune Miku you can! The androids will bury us Let's start with the premises. Hatsune Miku, even before being a video game, is the most famous and important mascot of the company Crypton Future Media, a Japanese software house specialized in creating audio programs for television, radio, PC and much more. A colossus with more than 25% market share, well known globally. But we don't care about this, because she's also a girl protagonist of various video games, among other things voted by the public as one of the ~most wanted~ DLC characters in Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and in Sonic & All Star Racing, as well as Persona 4 Golden for PlayStation Vita. Hatsune Miku is one of the leading virtual idols in the world, but what is it about? It all starts with a vocal synthesizer program created by Yamaha and called Vocaloid, which in just a few years has evolved to the point of generating hundreds of increasingly refined, detailed and close to reality non-human voices. It is estimated that there are more than 100,000 Hatsune Miku songs around, some of which have made it straight into the Japanese top ten. The Crypton mascot has important collaborations in his curriculum such as the one with Louis Vuitton, Pharrell Williams and Lady Gaga. All this to make you understand who you are dealing with: not a simple manga-style character but a real music star. The name of the title for Nintendo 3DS is that of the alter ego designed to give voice to the synthesizer, and is the combination of Hatsu (Before / o), Ne (sound) and Miku (future), which can be translated precisely as ~ First voice of the future~. The voice was obtained by sampling the very famous one of Saki Fujita, a well-known Japanese voice actress. The 3D effect Hatsune Miku is a game where we can control the character in a three-dimensional environment, moving it as we please and following its movements. Our virtual heroine is stationed in environments that vary from her home to the recording studio, passing through the stage of a concert, so the three-dimensional effect of the Nintendo 3DS screen is decidedly underused and only serves to make the already well-kept graphics more pleasant of the SEGA game. Playing in 3D or 2D (on Nintendo 2DS, for example), does not in the least affect the value of the product itself. Many things to do Hatsune Miku includes 48 tracks, favorites and fan-voted songs that can be experienced with different playing styles. Modes include both 'Touch' and 'Button' modes, each featuring multiple difficulty levels and a large number of customization options. With the first we only use the touch of the stylus on the screen, performing beats in time, small movements and taps on the display; with the second we limit ourselves to correctly pressing the sequence of keys that appears during the execution of the song. We sing (and dance) to the tune of the famous ~World is Mine~ and ~Electric Love~ with styles ranging from dance to pop, passing through the chip music that was so popular just a few years ago. It is not necessary to explain how a rhythm game works, just think of the famous Guitar Hero, Rockband or similar in which the player is asked to press a series of keys in rhythm, following a virtual score on the screen that gradually scrolls with the song. Hatsune Miku is no exception in this sense, resulting in a good game, without too many differences from the cornerstones of the genre. We have noticed, however, what we believe is a serious structural flaw: our on-screen ~action~ is often completely unrelated to the rhythm of the song or melody, resulting almost independent of the music. The pressing of the key keys does not follow the rhythm, in several cases. It is not a constant defect of the game in general but of some songsoni: sometimes this lack is noticeable in a very marked way, others it is only noticeable in fits and starts or not at all. Editing is one of Hatsune Miku's key functions. For each track you can change the choreography, the sounds, the objects and even the texts, in some cases. Harajuku style Among the best things about Hatsune Miku is definitely the graphics. The characters are impeccably modeled and full of effects, transparencies and reflections. The places where the dances and songs take place are just as nice and full of details, which are even better noticed with the 3D effect even if, as explained in the appropriate paragraph, its use is really limited and not very useful for the purposes of the game. The super deformed style helps to give it a ~kawaii~ effect that pervades Hatsune Miku from the first to the last menu. As in any self-respecting simulation, great value has been placed on customizations and the purchase / unlocking of collectibles or wearables. You can change your clothes or change your home, concert location and playlist to sing in public. Within the latter there is also the possibility of adding comments to the videos to be shared with other players via StreetPass and SpotPass. You can create ballets from scratch and manage your image through collectibles to unlock. The songs themselves are partially editable, by changing the lyrics or adding and cutting associated choreography. The game is completely in English, a factor that could mess up the plans of those who don't know the language, limiting its usability a lot as Hatsune Miku is not a simple music game but a real idol simulator. In the SEGA title there are a myriad of things to do such as going out, shopping, going to auditions, composing songs, dancing, looking after your wardrobe and house. You can also go to the arcade and throw yourself headlong into a modified and adapted version for the occasion of the historic Puyo Puyo, a Puzzle game in the style of Columns or Tetris that arrived officially in the West for the first time (they had come out galore, but only in Japan and USA). Puyo Puyo 39, as it is called, is to all intents and purposes a highly enjoyable game within a game that can also be played in multiplayer. It can be, if not used sparingly, much more addictive than the game that hosts it.", "date": "2015-09-07", "grade": "7.8"}
