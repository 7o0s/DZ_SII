{"name": "Nightshade", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nightshade.html", "text": "Mission Start The combat system, the real core of the game, is basically the same as its predecessor. The main difference compared to Shinobi lies in the possibility of fighting without the need to constantly ~feed~ Akujiki and without the risk of having one's energy decrease due to the whims of the cursed blade. This allows, between one enemy and another, to look for bonuses and hidden items for the game levels. The combo system called Tate is also found in Kunoichi. Once an enemy is killed, a countdown will start within which it will be necessary to shoot down another target, which will restart the counter from zero; if you manage to link all the enemies on the screen, a Tate is created, a real gratification for the player's efforts. The use of these combinations is not merely spectacular, as knocking down an enemy during a Tate is decidedly faster than facing him individually, and during the advanced stages of the game, where even an insignificant portion of energy proves to be fundamental, execute the Tate is indispensable. Hibana's acrobatic skills have made it possible to move the battlefield from the ground to the sky: all the game mechanics, in fact, are based on the consecutive execution of jump, double jump and dash. Once the target has been reached and shot down, it is possible to repeat the operation without landing. With this mechanism, therefore, ~air routes~ are created thanks to which it is possible to reach previously inaccessible points, and it is ~simpler~ to carry out articulated Tates. The main attacks available to the kunoichi are sword strokes (both from a distance and melee), the use of shurikens and combinations of kicks, another consistent innovation compared to the predecessor, essential for breaking down the defenses of the toughest opponents. A whole new series of moves is associated with the kick, including the aerial kick, an ~automatic search~ flying kick, and a blow that allows you to throw the enemy into the air and then hit him on the fly, throwing him to the ground and generating a shockwave capable of destroying the defenses of the opponents around. Hibana has new ninjutsu techniques, particular elemental spells that require ninjutsu scrolls, especially useful in battles with the end-of-level bosses. With Ka'en you cause a huge explosion around your character, which does massive damage to all nearby opponents; Raijin is an electric shield that makes you momentarily invincible and allows a faster Stealth Dash; finally Fga hits enemies from a distance with blades of air. Finally there is the Stealth Attack, a special attack to be performed once the appropriate bar is filled, which creates residual images of Hibana that will simultaneously hit the locked target. The levels that will frame Hibana's adventures are mostly linear. All enemies in the area in which you are located are shot down until access to the next area is unlocked, a process to be repeated until the boss fight. Every now and then an open scheme is proposed, conceptually similar to the arenas, where you can eliminate all the monstrous creatures that will be generated. Some levels take place on moving structures, such as planes or trucks, which certainly benefits from the variety of scenarios. Hibana... proceed with your mission Graphically Nightshade is to say the least hit and miss. It is clear that the goal of the Sega programmers was to keep a framerate nailed to 60 frames per second. And undoubtedly they have succeeded, given the fluidity and speed that the game maintains even in very busy levels. However, this has cost a lot in terms of graphic definition of backdrops and characters. Especially the former are heavily affected by it: even if in some cases of original and inspired concept, the scenarios are always sparse and rather dull. Little complex polygonal structures are covered by mediocre textures, with a level of detail very often below the sufficiency. The main character, the kunoichi Hibana, is very well modeled and superbly animated: her evolutions, complete with light beams behind her (which take the place of Shinobi's scarf) are a pleasure for the eyes. The enemies, on the other hand, are much less cared for than the protagonist, especially the monstrous creatures, while the humanoid ones defend themselves better. The same goes for the end-of-level bosses. The special and particle effects are also mediocre, such as monster explosions and the execution of special techniques. The Full Motion Video of the interlude between alevel and the other and the game and selection menus. The sound sector certainly does not stand out for excellence. Average sound effects perform their task sufficiently, while the music, some also taken from old episodes, are certainly not memorable. Different speech for the dubbing (totally in English in the tested version), with flat acting and without great expressiveness. In terms of game modes and replayability, Nightshade is rather satisfactory. In addition to the Story Mode there are the Time Attack, the Survival and a mode with missions to unlock called, originally, Mission mode. It is also possible to replay already completed levels separately, view a gallery of artwork and cutscenes and, by collecting particular items during Story Mode, buy extras such as new costumes for the protagonist. There are also other tasty goodies to unlock that I prefer not to reveal to leave the surprise to those who try to try their hand at this difficult undertaking. The conversion is good, with a 50/60Hz selector and texts translated into Italian. Today's just not my day The main problem of Nightshade is the excessive difficulty, which most of the time leads to frustrating, even at a simple ~Normal~ level. While in the first levels the game flows smoothly and pleasantly, already from the sixth scheme one has the feeling of being faced with an insurmountable obstacle. The difficulty is due both to the structure of the schemes and to the presence of some flaws in the game design. First, the save system: the game automatically saves at some crucial checkpoints (usually mid-level and before the final showdown). For the first schemes, an approach of this type may even seem successful, but as you progress through the levels, you discover all the problems that arise from it. Restarting a section from the beginning for a crash is extremely frustrating, especially if the crash itself is caused by mistakes that you don't own. Among these errors, the animation for the Tate combos must be mentioned. As described above, the Nannies are indispensable and each time they recall an animation that shows the execution of the opponents. The problem lies in the change of shot of these animations, which break the rhythm of the game perhaps during a crucial jump: it is certainly a spectacular solution, but the impossibility of understanding where Hibana is landing is often the cause of the continuous falls. The camera also struggles to follow the evolutions and shots of the kunoichi, and requires a continuous pressure of R3 if you want to have the slightest idea of where to direct your attacks. Comment Nightshade is a dynamic and very fast action game and, for the first few levels, it also manages to entertain. However, excessive difficulty compromises the gaming experience, and could discourage less patient and experienced players. Compared to its predecessor, it adds some elements that vary the mechanics pleasantly, so I would recommend it to those who enjoyed Shinobi and are ready for the new challenge and for those who are not easily discouraged by too high a level of difficulty. Pros: Fast and spectacular Well-studied combat system Fun for the first levels Cons: Excessive difficulty Inaccurate camera Graphically poor scenarios Behind this decidedly anonymous title is none other than Kunoichi, a sequel to the Shinobi episode released for Playstation2 last year, a title that raised more than one criticism among the nostalgics of the original saga. The formula remains essentially the same: a ruthless lone ninja and many enemies trained to be sliced in the most spectacular way possible. In Nightshade we will take on the role of Hibana, a cynical and obedient kunoichi (female version of ~shinobi~) who is part of the Shinobi Agency. The plot revolves once again around Akujiki, a cursed blade capable of absorbing the souls of defeated enemies, shattered during the first episode; the various fragments, scattered around the city, have given life to monstrous creatures called Hellspawn, which it will be our task to eliminate. There is also a group of rebel ninja led by Jimushi, Hibana's former master, interested in recovering the pieces of Akujiki on behalf of the Nakatomi Corporate. Our kunoichi will therefore be called both to stop the invasion of monsters and to recover the cursed blade, defeating the clan of mercenary ninja.", "date": "2004-03-23", "grade": null}
