{"name": "Lume", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/100210-lume-le-luci-della-centrale-elettrica.html", "text": "In Lume's introduction we see a nice old man who suddenly finds himself without electricity. His completely isolated house is powered by a system based exclusively on renewable energy sources, therefore solar panels and wind turbines, but apparently something has gone out of place and the light has gone out. The next day his young niece, Lume, goes to visit him but can't find anyone and the house is mysteriously dark and silent. The girl is well aware of her grandfather's passion for inventions and puzzles, so she knows that to enter the house and restore the electricity she will have to pass a certain number of tests. Originally released on Steam in 2010, Lume debuts on the App Store and therefore offers iOS device owners its load of atmosphere, its peculiar graphic style and its puzzles in what arises, however, only as the beginning of a story much longer and more significant. If you intend to buy the game you must bear in mind that it doesn't last more than an hour (depending on how long it takes to solve the puzzles) and that therefore, from the point of view of the price / content ratio, it is not the best deal present on the Apple digital platform. The touch control system refers to the original one and therefore allows us to move and interact with the scenario by touching certain points on the screen, but the reactivity of the touches has nothing to do with that of the mouse, with the small size of the display ( on iPhone) which help to create potential misunderstandings. If you don't realize that in front of you there is a device that Lume has to come into contact with, in fact, you could spend a lot of time trying to figure out what to do to continue in the adventure, and it would not be a question of a nice situation. Glamorous or overrated? Lume's incipit is of great impact and above all its aesthetics cannot fail to strike, presenting itself as a sort of stop motion cartoon that makes extensive use of filmed sequences integrated directly into the graphics. In short, the experience immediately appears very particular and different from the usual, even if the lack of sensitivity and precision of the touch controls does not help to quickly enter the spirit of adventure and to understand the nature of the product developed by State of Play. Without wanting to anticipate too much, it can be said that the puzzles to solve in the game can be counted almost on the fingers of one hand: the combination of a padlock, an electrical circuit to connect, three keys to choose based on their shape, codes to decipher to put a panel back in place and so on. These are not always very understandable puzzles, in some cases it is a bit difficult to understand where the designers who created them are going with this, but above all it is easy to lose some interaction along the way because at first we didn't think it could be done. There is no help beyond the clues that we find in the mysterious house, perhaps the simple arrangement of some photos can indicate the numbers of a code but, in fact, there is no way to find out except through some attempts. Furthermore, the game is completely in English (unlike what is indicated on the product page on the App Store) and this could further discourage some people. Precisely because of its peculiarities and the lack of facilities, solving the puzzles produces a great feeling of satisfaction, but at the same time completing all the puzzles and attending the epilogue can only leave a lot of bad taste in the mouth for expectations that are irreparably disregarded.", "date": "2012-03-14", "grade": "6.8"}
