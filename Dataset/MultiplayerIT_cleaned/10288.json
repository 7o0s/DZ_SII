Apparently it looks like a first person shooter, but the similarities stop at the position of the subjective camera. In the role of a deceased ended up in a non-place (the ~Void~ of the title) populated by strange creatures whose eternal perpetuation is at risk, we will have to go hunting for... colors. Don't think the worst right away. Colors serve practically everything and are the basis of possible interactions in the game world. For example, one of the main goals to be pursued is to create gardens of colors to ensure survival. To do this you have to get close to the trees, ~smear~ them with a color to make them come to life and, after a cycle in the Void, go back to reap the fruits of your work. The more color you spread on the tree, the more you can collect later. But how are colors modulated? Simple, you collect them (from trees, grass or fireflies) and in the so-called Camera Obscura you channel them into one of the character's hearts (he can have a maximum of twenty-one) drawing them from the Lympha bar (the memory of the colors collected), to finally have them transformed into usable shades that end up in the palette on the left of the screen. The void Colors also have other functions. For example, they are used to fight against the predators that roam the rooms of the Sisters, mystical female entities that populate the Void and guide the actions of the protagonist. To do this you have to smear the enemies and, in more advanced battles, use glyphs to carry out more complicated attacks or to defend yourself. Each glyph is drawn on the screen by consuming colors. Again, the more color you apply, the more powerful the effect will be. If what was illustrated above were not enough, the colors also have other functions, such as that of allowing communication with the Sisters and Keepers (the guardians of the Sisters) or that of obtaining the favors of the former by filling their hearts. Does it seem complicated to you? It's not over yet. The Void is divided into rooms that must be reached by tracing different paths. Unlike when you are in the rooms, in the Void time passes by alternating the cycles that allow the reproduction of color (and fauna) in the rooms. Unfortunately, time also consumes the vital color of the protagonist, which must be restored in the Camera Obscura. Therefore, the passage of time is necessary for the player to be able to accumulate color, but it is also harmful because it can cause his death. Full As you may have understood The Void is a much more multifaceted video game than the average. So much complexity is enriched by a basic philosophical vision that guides the player's moves and puts them into question several times, both in terms of game mechanics and the actual plot, developing it in an unexpected way. The Ice-Pick Lodge guys, already authors of the controversial and fascinating Pathologic, can undoubtedly be counted among those few who try to push the videogame medium beyond the threshold of the technological toy. Obviously The Void is not for everyone and requires, especially at the beginning, the willingness to deal with a product with an original gameplay which bases its charm on representation rather than action and which asks the player to make often problematic choices, to lead him to one of thirteen different endings.", "date": "2009-12-28", "grade": "8.0"}
