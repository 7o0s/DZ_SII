{"name": "Resident Evil", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/resident-evil-5.html", "text": "Sometimes they come back Eagerly I insert the first disk into the small and plasticky GC but, before pressing the power button, I recreate the right atmosphere for the ~scary~ game: alone in my room with the door closed with the light off and total darkness. Now I can start the experience hoping to experience the same sensations that the title of the same name gave me years ago on the PSX. Satisfied? Calm down guys. We get there slowly. I start with the ~New Game~, set the difficult level by choosing Chris (the boy) and begin my adventure (or my ~nightmare~ as the Italian subtitles suggest). I'm inside. An FMV presentation, which to define as high-quality seems simplistic, explains the plot that by now only three or four in the world do not know: we are in Raccoon City, a town where some scientific and biotechnological research laboratories belonging to a secret society are hidden (Umbrella Inc.). The latter periodically sends its reports to the authorities but over time these become increasingly vague and rare up to the point of total absence. Here, for reconnaissance reasons, a special rescue team (S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team) is sent to the site, made up of two men who mysteriously disappear in the same place. Here another team (the Alpha) comes into play which, finding itself in difficulty in the Raccoon Forrest against some angry Dobermans, fortunately manages to take shelter in an abandoned mansion (albeit with one man less: Joseph). The survivors, namely Chris, Jill and Wesker (Berry is not found), will then agree on what to do to look for both other survivors and a way out of that terror that they never expected. After this beautiful intro, the real game begins. A horror/adventure that has every appearance of being an experience that leaves its mark (not the wounds caused by zombies, don't worry NdJ). A creepy mansion! RE is a horror adventure based on both the first Alone in the dark and the George A. Romero film Night of the Living Dead. Even Shinji Mikami, producer of Capcom, has admitted it. However, in the game you drive a character (in this case Chris or Jill) within various locations seasoned with a massive dose of zombies, ~rabid~ dogs, monsters and puzzles. Everything is seen from the player's eyes through a third-person view that follows the action like a cinematic camera. The supporting structure of the entire product is found precisely in these elements. In fact, we proceed along the journey to discover numerous puzzles to solve, beasts to ~fraggare~ up to the usual clash with the final monster. But all this is not enough to describe the particularity of this experience. In fact, another fundamental element must also be taken into consideration: the atmosphere. As we well know, this cannot be missing in a horror game and with ~RE~ you can be sure that there will be sudden accelerations of your heartbeats... The GC joypad is well suited to command the action thanks to its particular anatomy. First of all, for the character to walk, you can use both the analog stick and the directional cross (even if the first is preferable), while the keys used in action are only three; a fourth and a fifth are used to access the status and the map (which you will have to earn). The control of the virtual ego with regard to movements has remained unchanged compared to the Pso version; so to walk forward you need to press up whatever your position on screen. Those who have never played the Capcom series will have some slight difficulties but only for the first five/ten minutes of the game. As you well know and as in every self-respecting episode of ~RE~, even here jumping is taboo (except in some small cases) as well as punches, kicks and stuff like that. The only way to get rid of the creatures wandering around the house (zombies for example) is to shoot them in the head (in one shot) or in the body (but half a pistol magazine is wasted for each one) or use the white weapon , which is a measly dagger that doesn't seem to have any effect on the health of the zombies. A novelty is the inclusion of some defensive weapons that can be used during the attack of the ~inhabitants~ of the house. These are eg. daggers that can be stuck in an undead's skull, grenades, etc. depending on whether you play with the boy or with the girl. It is also necessary to remember the arsenal of weapons that you will find yourself manipulating which includes Fragnale, Beretta 92 FS, Python, flamethrower, grenade thrower etc. with some small surprises that will become available only after completing the game in a certain way. But that's another story. The only thing that the Capcom programmers could have avoided is the usual and ~great~ return of the much-hated trunks that are used to store the character's objects. In fact, the latter has limited space in the rucksack on his back (six spaces for Chris in difficult mode and eight for Jill) making it necessary to go back and forth around the house in search of the aforementioned containers to leave some objects at the moment janitors and retrieve others . But that's part of the game (although in the next ~Bio Hazard 0~ they will be eliminated). It's a nightmare! The technical work carried out by Capcom stands at very high quality levels. Seeing RE is like watching a movie. The only difference is that here is the ~sacred power~ of the joypad that will make you immediately immerse yourself in the terrible nightmare of Raccoon City. As in all the episodes (except in ~Code: Veronica~) we find pre-rendered backdrops that marry with polygonal characters. But here the situation is different: while on the Psx the difference between real-time models and the pre-calculated ones is too marked on the Gamecube, the mixture of these two graphic solutions is happy and tasty in our eyes. In short, the Nintendo console wanted to get its teeth out and it succeeded by demonstrating its power to the whole world. The characters are equipped with a very high number of polygons which allows you to distinguish not only the blinks but also the different facial expressions. Even the folds of the clothes have not been left to chance and the textures deserve a special mention (which have an out of the ordinary sharpness and perfectly fitting colors). And what about the play of light and shadow? Absolutely realistic! Especially in some rooms (where the light is dynamic thanks to thunder, moving lamps, etc.) the perfect distortion or variation of the shadow of the characters is very remarkable. Even the movements are realistic and never wooden. Finally eliminated the skidding effect on the ground which is clearly visible on the old chapters when changes of direction are made with the weapon aimed. And the foundations? you ask (rightly so). These appear the most realistic ever seen in a video game (except in very rare cases). Gloomy, lugubrious, marked by suffering, by bloodshed, imbued with pain and mystery. Beautiful! They are so ~real~ that they seem alive and manage to drag you entirely into the game action. I assure you that taking your hands off the Nintendo joypad during a game of ~RE~ is the prerogative of a select few ... The only small flaw is found on some collisions between polygons or between character and backdrop, which have some smudges (but it is little stuff). But do we want to talk about sound? Certain. The music, which has changed since the first chapter, is few but excellent and contributes excellently to creating the atmosphere that permeates the horror universe. Sound effects like gunshots, footsteps, bellowing, shouting etc. they are of excellent workmanship (sometimes mysterious noises cause small ~heart attacks~); and also the dubbing (in English with Italian subtitles) is quite accurate. But Captive Communications has never disappointed us from this point of view, deserving of another round of applause as a quality (and quantity too) software house. When will I wake up? Often the weak point of this kind of production is found in the short duration of the experience. This ~RE~ has only a small part of this problem as it takes from six to eight and a half hours to complete the game with a single character (depending on who you choose). If we then consider two alternative endings for Chris and as many for Jill by doing the calculations we have about twenty-five hours of dispassionate entertainment. Any doubt must be eliminated about the equality between this episode and the one for Psx. In fact, on the GC it seems to be faced with a new game due to the amount of new features included both in terms of the number of rooms and for some tricks that change, even if slightly, the game structure. So even those who have consumed the old first chapter will find this new version extremely engaging also because it has a much higher difficulty. Seeing is believing. The only point connecting the old Psx product with the same one on GC seems to be the mansion and storyline. You'll find out the rest for yourself... In conclusion, this ~Resident Evil~ revisitedand cubed it amazes anyone both technically and for some additional goodies. It is a must buy for anyone who owns the Nintendo cube whether or not they have played the classic episode. This, guys, is more of an experience than a simple playful product that will violently take you in its grip to release you only when you suddenly wake up. A ~must buy~. Pros: Technically excellent. Creepy atmosphere. After waiting finally in our homes. Cons: Finishing it four times can be monotonous. Unfortunately it has an end. The wait is over It took six months to localize the Japanese version of Resident Evil for the Gamecube on the planet of the rustling euro (March 22nd to September 23rd). And, since there were no gamer insurrections in the aforementioned period, it must be admitted that Europeans are a patient people. After a short and due applause it would be better to start with the article (or someone fires me NdJ). Gentlemen! We have in our hands the ultra pumped remake of the legendary masterpiece ~Resident Evil~ released several years ago on the gray Psone. And the most shocking thing is the fact that the whole series is now a Gamecube exclusive. But let's get into the heart of the game to better understand what is hidden in the 2 mini-DVDs contained in the package...", "date": "2002-10-14", "grade": null}
