{"name": "Micromachines", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/micromachines.html", "text": "Fasten your micro-belts Years go by, consoles change, but the substance of some games always remains the same. In fact, this new version of MicroMachines faithfully follows the path taken by the previous chapters of the series, proposing a game mechanic based on races with a markedly arcade setting, set through ~artisanal~ circuits obtained from the most unthinkable places, all seen from a rigorously micro perspective. So don't be surprised to race on a sunny beach, zigzagging between umbrellas and deck chairs, or among the insects and plants of a small pond. Obviously, the classic ~bird's eye~ view cannot be missing, a real characteristic element of the series since the time of its debut. The handover from Codemasters to Infogrames Sheffield House was therefore rather painless, and this MicroMachines quietly represents a worthy 128-bit evolution of the series, however some small lightness prevents the title from fully convincing. The biggest problem is represented by the management of the camera which, positioned too close to the playing area, consequently makes it difficult to orientate once you leave (or kicked out, a rather common fact during a game of MicroMachines) from the area framed; moreover, the limited field of vision will force you to have to repeat the most convoluted tracks several times, in order to memorize the position of the most demanding curves to set them correctly. To all this must be added a somewhat nervous and imprecise control system, which will require a few running-in games to be fully mastered. Still speaking of the control system, the decision not to implement the ingenious pad ~sharing~ system already seen in MicroMachines V3 for PsOne appears at least questionable: in practice it was possible to play in four with the presence of only two pads, with two players they used the normal directional pad, while the rest used the cross arrangement of the button panel to control the car. It sounds complicated, but in reality it was extremely intuitive and the result was devastating, with matches that ended up turning into a furious war at the last push: now all this is no longer possible, and to play in four players at the same time there is no other choice than get a multitap. Tiny little polygons The previous episodes of the series have certainly not gone down in history for extraordinary technical merits, yet this new chapter for Ps2 manages to be decidedly pleasant from this point of view. The graphic sector, in particular, turns out to be quite convincing, presenting tracks full of details and animations, embellished with textures with a remarkable chromatic variety and high cleanliness, able to give the whole a comic look absolutely in keeping with the game genre. Ladders and flickering finally seem like a faded memory of the past, while the graphics engine easily manages to guarantee 50 FPS without apparent difficulty. The sound is also well done, by virtue of a decidedly cheerful and catchy musical accompaniment, and by very varied and amusing effects, especially as regards the vocal characterization of each driver (located in Italian). Longevity is a factor closely linked to your availability for multiplayer challenges: as already mentioned, a few friends are enough to make the game practically infinite, able to monopolize the attention of the challengers in a frenzy of races to the last laugh; not that the single-player mode is uninteresting, on the contrary, however, once all the competitions in which to try their hand are exhausted, there are very few incentives for replayability. In any case, the effort of the programmers in trying to diversify the game modes as much as possible (which in addition to the classic single race and tournament include the hilarious Bomb Tag and MicroMachines) is to be appreciated, even if one has the clear feeling that the number of tracks , while remaining sufficiently high, has significantly decreased compared to the famous abundance of previous incarnations. Comment This evolution of MicroMachines on the new generation consoles effectively reproduces all the features that have made the series famous over the years: frenetic, varied and exhilarating in multiplayer, it will not fail to captivate and amuse you with challenges to the death, however some obvious lightness , above all the management of the camera which is far from perfect, prevent it from breaking through and conwin fully. Recommended for fans of the series, or for those looking for a title capable of giving hours and hours of intense multiplayer fun. Pros: Technically sound Devastating in multiplayer Many modes to indulge yourself with Cons: In single-player it doesn't last long Camera too close Lack of pad sharing system for multiplayer MicroMachines is part of that small series of historical franchises, which anyone who has a minimum of familiarity with the gaming environment has certainly had the opportunity to try at least once. Evolved over the years through a multitude of platforms (from NES to PSX), it has always enjoyed enormous success, above all thanks to its incredible multiplayer mode: it was enough to arm yourself with a few friends and the afternoons would fly away between the most absurd challenges (and consequent insults and teasing). All this without taking anything away from a single-player mode that is still very fun and extremely long-lived. After a rather long period of silence, the saga has finally decided to make the big leap on the new generation consoles, landing on mother Sony's black monolith, however no longer by Codemasters, but passing into the hands of Infogrames Sheffield House: let's find out together if the result lives up to the previous chapters.", "date": "2003-01-14", "grade": null}
