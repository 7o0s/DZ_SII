The title, developed by the IllFonic team, is fully part of the Predator franchise, which already has a large number of multimedia products of its own, naturally including the famous and homonymous films: now it is enriched with a new production that is undoubtedly interesting and in at least some respects original, but also (you will be able to read it a little later) overall disappointing. And unfortunately it was to be expected, since the IllFonic guys are the same as that Friday the 13th: The Game, which certainly wasn't named game of the year. The underlying philosophy is the same as then, the asymmetrical online multiplayer, which among other things fits perfectly with the narrative context: but then what did not work? The contents Predator: Hunting Grounds is offered as an exclusively online title, and needs an internet connection and a PlayStation Plus subscription even simply to be started: keep this in mind when purchasing. In fact, this is not a single player video game, or in any case aimed at narrating an adventure in the universe of the franchise: it is an online game that can be enjoyed with or without friends, but preferably with a close-knit team to be fully enjoyed (and to avoid queues of matchmaking). From the point of view of content, the meager initial game menu immediately sets the record straight: you can start a new game with random companions and enemies, or a private match (by invitation from the friends list). You can customize your alter ego, both from the point of view of the marines and that of the Predator: male and female for both the human and alien species, hair color for the military, characteristics of the Yautja mask, and many other details that they have an exclusively aesthetic function (and which you will probably not even notice during the games). But it can be done, and it's a good thing: without aesthetic customization, the pretext for the lootboxes would also disappear. And here is also the prize box menu, in fact: with the credits unlocked after each game, the player buys these gray chests and gets random rewards, of various types and with fluctuating rarity. We managed to unlock a couple of cosmetic changes for the Predator and a handful for the marines, nothing too interesting or varied; and then also a weapon skin and a modification for a light machine gun. From the characters menu, however, it is also possible to modify the advantages: additional weapons for equipment, passive skills of various types (for example a larger magazine), and everything you might expect in a title that remains summarily a copy and paste of what the market has better or similar to offer. From the point of view of customization, skins, characters and lootboxes of course: because on the gameplay side, fortunately, something is saved. The gameplay: let's play with the military Predator: Hunting Grounds allows you to play as the military or the very bad alien who will have to kill them in every way before they complete their mission, in fixed teams of four human players against the Predator. When starting the new game, the game will ask you who you prefer to play: and at least at the beginning you will select the military, because matchmaking takes less time (the situation could change in the future, of course). Analyzing the gameplay carefully, we note that the game objectives of the quintessential American soldiers are very simple: do random things on a random map against random enemies and then return to base aboard a helicopter. We're not kidding, very often it really proceeds in a completely random way, following the indicators on the screen. Within a sufficiently large but certainly not as varied or memorable or interesting game map, the team of four players must perform some truly obvious actions. They can go from fighting drug trafficking by eliminating hidden doses, to breaking the eggs in the basket of arms dealers, and still picking up this or that precious object and bringing it home to the good guys. All of this by moving from point A to point B on the map, and always keeping the enemies controlled by artificial intelligence at bay: other soldiers, all the same, who wouldn't be able to hit you even if you were standing half a meter away from them, unarmed and dressed in red. AI is one of Predator: Hunting Grounds' big problems (not the only one) that alonelets the player's interest wane very quickly. Fortunately, the alien then arrives to make the action of the soldiers extremely distressing, provided that the player who controls the Predator knows the fact about him. Playstation 4 trophies Predator: Hunting Grounds has a glittering Platinum Trophy, but obtaining it will require an incredible will of dedication: there are thousands of kills to be accomplished using now the military now the Predator, as well as hundreds of matches to complete with the respect of certain conditions. Considering matchmaking, we advise you to try Platinum only if in the company of a close-knit and willing team. The Predator And here we are at the only real reason that could lead you to choose Predator: Hunting Grounds over the other asymmetric multiplayer on the market: there is the Predator. It's not just a matter of taste or love for the franchise: controlling the alien itself is really fun (or within the limits of all the other flaws of the game, which make it tedious), and in case of skill a quick learning curve on the part of the player that is also rewarding. The gameplay here changes drastically: from the first person shooter to the third person, from frontline action to tactical and reasoned choices, from ranged firearms to gadgets and terrible lethal claws at close range. The Predator is precisely a predator: it jumps on trees, moves quickly, covers long distances in a very short time. In just three shots he can knock out a human player on the team, and also exterminate all the others if they don't arrive immediately equipped with good magazines and a valid strategy. The Predator kills must be confirmed, at which point one of the participants is officially excluded from the match; if he eliminates all four present, the alien wins the game. If after being knocked down the Predator activates its lethal self-destruct and the players choose to cancel it unsuccessfully, the match ends in a draw. Here's one of the balancing issues we mentioned: it's not convenient to stop the self-destruct by trying to score bonus points. Much better to run away and blow up the enemy, thus automatically winning the game. Endless problems Up to this point you might as well re-read everything and say, ~well, it doesn't look like a bad game after all.~ Instead Predator: Hunting Grounds, beyond the fun it could offer in sessions played as the alien, is a really disappointing game. First, and most obviously, from a graphic and technical point of view: quite simply it has the appearance of an incredibly dated, poorly finished, raw and recycled title exploiting assets without restraint. The frame rate is unstable, the aliasing evident, the pop-up effects annoying, the renderings grainy: it can only be postponed if you have a boundless love for the franchise and for the gameplay. But here's the thing: not even the gameplay makes you cry out for a miracle, on the contrary. Playing as the marines has nothing original or fun, even considering a gunplay that leaves the time it finds, practically useless enemies, shelter artificial intelligence and collectibles that all in all are fine where they are. We add joker matchmaking that matches between the player who has just started the title for the first time and the one who has already played 24 games: imagine a good Predator against four players as useful as the AI. Here is a summary of one of the main problems of Predator: Hunting Grounds. The localization in Italian is good, in the texts on the screen and in the dubbing. But the sentences are four crossed, repetitive and banal. And the Predator just roars, when it doesn't fit in with the polygonal models of the trees.", "date": "2020-04-28", "grade": "5.0"}
