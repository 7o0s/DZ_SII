Details that ring an alarm bell as our alter ego gets up from his bed, in the throes of a mysterious amnesia, and searches around the country for some quest that could earn him money. Moving away into the woods or going even further won't be a problem, after all the pretty girl who found him half dead also gave him a magical amulet that can bring him home at any time. And so we venture out in search of giant rats to kill and sell to the local restaurateur (argh!) until we have enough money to buy a dagger and thus be able to access other missions. Meanwhile, the threats become more consistent, the first goblins appear and prove to be quite cunning. Certainly more than us, who have to ~hook~ each opponent by ~touching~ him on the screen (an operation that often works badly and has to be repeated several times) and then try our hand at a sort of dance that alternates slashing and clumsy dodging in the last attempt not to take too much damage while eliminating an enemy. The response to collisions is not very convincing, making the clashes too ~soft~ and depriving us of much of the satisfaction that can come from a victory. Forests that are anything but enchanted Exploration is a central element in Ravensword: The Fallen King, after all we have to go around all the locations to meet opponents, defeat them, level up the character and possibly collect new weapons and objects. The ~fog~ effect that distinguishes almost all scenarios, however, is not helpful and ends up removing much of the charm from the virtual places designed for the occasion. The management of equipment and skills is rather simplistic: although the inventory is organized in such a way as to make the sale of various goods quick and immediate, the weapons and armor are not accompanied by descriptions or numerical values that illustrate their quality , each time imposing a field test. Furthermore, the level-up is completely automatic and we cannot manage to develop one skill rather than another. We must also bear in mind that the numbers that distinguish the game are far from exorbitant as regards weapons and equipment. A comparison with Gameloft's recent Dungeon Hunter, in this sense, is merciless: the action RPG of the French house boasts dozens and dozens of weapons, armor, clothes and objects that can be selected in absolute freedom and assigned to the character. From the point of view of the fights, both titles suffer from the same shortcomings: the attack and defense phases are completely unbalanced, making the clashes too simplistic and lacking in depth. Technically, the product published by Chillingo defends itself well in terms of variety and detail, but suffers from some questionable solutions applied to the general design and animations. The sound sector does its job without acute details, with good quality effects and a musical accompaniment reduced to the bone.
