Apart from the obvious presence of the ~quick game~, there are three decidedly ~substantial~ game options: the Season, the All Star Weekend and the Dynasty. The first sees us engaged in an entire NBA championship, therefore more than eighty games to play. After choosing our team, we will meticulously follow the match calendar and we will be able, if we wish, to attend the other matches or immediately find out the result. Once on the field, we will be able to familiarize ourselves with the control system and with the physics that regulate the movements of the players and the ball: already after a few minutes we will be able to easily set up offensive and defensive maneuvers, characterized however by a certain ~intricacy~ and almost never fluid in the performance. The game boasts a comprehensive options menu, making it possible to change virtually every aspect of matches: duration, realism, presence of injuries and fatigue, and so on. In the latter cases, at some point you will take a look at who is sitting on the bench to make a substitution, and you will notice that the players are divided into categories according to their potential in the various fields: who is good at dunking, who is good at shooting from three, who is distinguished by agility, etc. etc. Your choice, therefore, will reflect how you want to approach the game. The All Star Weekend is the video game transposition of a really existing event, which sees the best players in the NBA compete in competitions of skill to win the prize for best shooter, best spiker and so on. This mode represents an excellent opportunity to have fun controlling the champions, perhaps after spending endless minutes in command of brocchi who don't hit even a two-point shot and have the ball taken away too easily. All this amount of situations proves to be stimulating right from the start, but completing the game represents a great challenge even for basketball fans. The Dynasty of the NBA Finally, Dynasty mode offers more lasting entertainment than the Season, as well as a series of new situations. In fact, you will have to manage, in every respect, an NBA team for years and years, with the aim of bringing it to success thanks to a prudent use of the available resources. You will be supported by some coaches who will take care of improving the team's players both physically and tactically, coaches that you will hire yourself and who in turn will be assisted by talent scouts in charge of finding promising young basketball players. All this amount of situations proves to be stimulating right from the start, but completing the game represents a great challenge even for basketball fans. In fact, there is talk of simulating something like twenty-five years of matches, training sessions, and the transfer market. In short, few will be able to do it: a great passion will be needed, the same one that makes the difference when, the first few times, you take the joypad in hand with NBA Live 2006. Which brings us back to the opening speech: a good title Electronic Arts, this new basketball simulation boasts a number of real modes, players and teams; but it falls into playability and technical realization, which somehow go hand in hand. The technical capabilities of current consoles allow effective and fluid polygonal management, therefore the mediocre frame rate and the frequent slowdowns in the view change of NBA Live 2006 are certainly attributable to a lack of effort in the conversion between one system and another. Although the players reproduce the real counterparts quite faithfully, the movements certainly do not suggest a real basketball game. The realization of the locations is good, even if with ups and downs: the pitch is almost perfect and the audience is animated, but it doesn't shine in terms of fluidity and level of detail. The sound sector deserves a different discussion: apart from the ~signed~ music, in fact, the EA Sports ~stadium effects~ never cease to amaze with their realism and quality, confirming themselves at the highest levels for the genre. Comment NBA Live 2006 certainly has numbers on its side: it has the updated rosters of the NBA teams and three rather content-dense game modes that will delight any basketball fan. However, it is a product characterized by a technical realization not without defects and by a ~woody~ gameplay, therefore it will hardly be able to make inroads among the laymen. Recommended only for basketball lovers. Pros: ~Heavy~ modes Great sound Cons: Mediocre graphics Gameplay almost never smooth Only for enthusiasts Cross-platform NBA Live 2006 is available for GameCube, PS2 and Xbox. The three versions are basically identical, with only very slight differences in the effectiveness of the graphics engine (always insufficient, however) and in the sharpness of some textures. After dessert, fruit. The history of video games teaches that Electronic Arts sports simulations are characterized by some very specific characteristics: often they are not technically well done, just as often they are not very fun to play. Finally, they are developed for all consoles because they guarantee respectable sales in any case. Especially when the other titles for the same system can be counted on the fingers of one hand. NBA Live 2006, evidently developed by a team of programmers who care about tradition, does not deny anything of what has just been written.", "date": "2005-12-13", "grade": null}
