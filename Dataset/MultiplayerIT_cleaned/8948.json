{"name": "L'invasione dei tetramini", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/95325-tetris-linvasione-dei-tetramini.html", "text": "It cannot be said of a lineup, and especially the lineup of a Nintendo portable, that it is complete when the immortal puzzle game created in 1984 by Alexey Pajitnov is not yet part of it, in a still Soviet Russia which for the first time in history it was exporting a sensational videogame success to the hated West. The game formula, which we believe does not need any particular insights, is so simple and engaging that the title could not fail to meet the consensus it has actually met: there is practically no player who has not, at least once in their life, done its a good game of Tetris, and probably likewise there is no player who has not enjoyed it. However, all of this also has a downside: after 27 years and countless versions, does it still make sense to buy yet another reissue? From Russia with love Providing meaning to potential buyers, even more so if exposed over the years to large doses of Tetris, is up to the various software houses and publishers who from time to time undertake the conversion (the issue of Tetris rights is in fact quite intricate since the its arrival in the West, with various companies that hold them in various capacities), and if Nintendo with Tetris DS, probably the most beautiful recent version, had chosen to focus on the factors of quality and ~nostalgia~, this time Tetris Online, assisted by Hudson - what did we tell you about rights? - seems to favor quantity, variation on the theme and the exploitation of stereoscopic 3D. It is obviously, and God forbid, present the real Tetris, naked and raw, both in Marathon mode, with the tetrominoes that descend gradually faster every ten lines eliminated, and in Challenge mode, against opponents led by the CPU ( represented by the most famous Hudson game characters) whose AI becomes more effective every time. However, the first variation already appears in these basic modes: it is in fact possible to choose, in the Challenge, whether to play without or with the Objects, particular bonuses/penalties to be used in one's favor or to the detriment of the competitors, and which are obtained during the game after a performance of some note. Although it is by no means the first time that the Objects have appeared in a title of the series, here there are really many, from the Fog that obscures the game screen and that must literally be blown away, to the Cascade that allows us to fill free spaces of the playing area by tilting the 3DS, up to the Exchange which instead causes our grid to replace that of the opponent, which we will take over: these are elements that profoundly influence the game, and some, such as the Exchange, are able if used well to eliminate a player even when totally free of faults; playing with Objects activated or not leads to two significantly different experiences, and if the variety is still appreciated, the possibility of selecting only a few for a game would have been appreciated, deactivating the more powerful and ~unfair~ ones. We continue with the Fever and Survival modes, which are played on a narrower than normal grid and which are frenetic and fun: in particular, the Objects also come into play in Fever, which however seem to be designed in a more intelligent way. They are more suited to the spirit of the game, and must be unlocked by making high scores from game to game; then some are obtained only thanks to the use of SpotPass and StreetPass. For these reasons, for its fast and frantic nature (a game lasts 60 seconds) very suitable for a portable console and for the fact that it is completely new, the Fever mode is definitely one of the flagships of this Tetris for 3DS, but , as we will see shortly, is not the only one. The 3D effect Surprisingly enough given the genre, Tetris makes great use of 3D. If in normal games the effect is limited to clearly detaching the playing area from the background, in some minigames such as Incastro the 3D is even functional to the gameplay, with the ~wall~ of tetrominoes that inexorably comes towards us. In addition to the massive and scenographic use of the AR modes and the possibility of rotating the grid with the Slide Pad at will, it is also worth mentioning, even if only on the title screen, one of the very few attempts so far to exploit the stereoscopy of the 3DS to give the impression that game elements are actually projecting off the screen. Miis can't dance Let's continue examining the numerous game possibilities offered by the cartridge: it's the turn of the Tetris Party, i.e. a whole series of minigames (according to the game there are nine, but in reality only seven should be considered as the last two are onethe Marathon with the pieces that start at breakneck speed from the beginning, the other the same Marathon with the aim of completing 40 lines in the shortest possible time) Tetris-themed, some of which taken weight from the previous Wii / DS edition , called precisely Tetris Party Deluxe. We mention, among others, Puzzle, in which we will have to use square tetrominoes to reproduce an image proposed by the game or chosen from the photos on the SD Card, Incastro, an intelligent ~shoot 'em up~ form of Tetris that makes excellent use of 3D, and Climber, who sees a little man intent on reaching the top of a circular tower thanks to the tetrominoes that we will place for him along the way. Some of these mini-games are decidedly better designed and more immediate and fun than others, but, in addition to considering the fact that personal tastes and attitudes come into play here, seen from the point of view of ~quantity~ their massive presence cannot than to be considered a positive fact. Next (we're almost at the end, don't worry) comes none other than Augmented Reality; the classic Tetris and the Climber minigame, here called Scala RA, take advantage of the treatment: the scenographic effect is nice, but nothing substantially different from the ~normal~ versions, which you will probably end up preferring due to their greater practicality. In this framework so rich, although not always sparkling in quality, multiplayer cannot be missing, locally and via the Internet, which is also particularly full-bodied especially in the first variant. When the various players (up to eight) engaged in a session each have their own cartridge, they will be able to take advantage of the classic Challenge, the cooperative climber mode and numerous other mini-games; if instead you take advantage of the 3DS Download, the modes are reduced to the three main ones, Marathon, Fever and Challenge. On the Internet, however, you can only challenge your friends or randomly picked players from around the planet, but our results affect your score and a worldwide online ranking. And how is all of this presented to us? In a somewhat fluctuating way, to tell the truth: there are numerous backgrounds, from realistic to psychedelic, but clearly they all leave a bit of the time they find given the game we are facing. Then, on first access, you must choose a Mii from our collection as an avatar and dress him up with various themed clothing items, but from then on he will do nothing but dance like a lunatic, a lunatic with little talent for dancing, however, on the lower screen during the games. Definitely fun, but for the wrong reasons. Finally, on the sound side, the situation is better: there are numerous themes present, including the historic Korobeiniki in different versions, some of which are very beautiful and engaging.", "date": "2011-11-14", "grade": "8.0"}
