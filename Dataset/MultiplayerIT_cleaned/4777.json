For this sequel entitled Drop Wizard Tower, the local software house has allied itself with a big shot of the caliber of Nitrome, capable of guaranteeing the product great visibility and also making it available to the vast public of Android users: as a counterpart, the British producer has evidently required a homologation of the title to the style and commercial formula typical of its catalog, while keeping the main characteristics of the gameplay substantially intact. So let's go and see how the rediscovered wizard Teo behaves in this new adventure of his. Descending to ascend Similar to what happened for the prequel, Drop Wizard Tower even takes the trouble to build a sketch of history to motivate the actions of the protagonist, who finds himself locked up in a tower together with the other sorcerers of the kingdom by a mysterious organization called the Shadow Order: it will be up to the user to help him escape through the over 50 levels into which the prison is divided, using a game system that doesn't even think about distorting the original recipe. In fact, the gameplay of Drop Wizard Tower will be immediately familiar to anyone who has experienced Teo's previous adventure, which this time is accompanied by five other playable characters who can be unlocked by spending the diamonds obtained during the games. The stages develop within a single screen, which houses the platforms on which the protagonist moves and the enemies that must be eliminated to continue to the next stage. The wizard is controlled using only two inputs to order him to turn to the right or to the left, while his motion proceeds automatically: when he falls from one floor and lands on the one below, Teo (or whoever) throws a star that proceeds for short stretch in front of him and which is the only weapon in the player's possession. In fact, hitting a little monster with magic stuns it, allowing the hero on duty to hit it and make it roll along the scenario, generating a sort of avalanche that overwhelms and carries with it all the unfortunate people it meets in its path. Simple on paper, the play structure of Drop Wizard Tower actually requires a certain amount of strategy to be tamed, with enemy patterns and scenario obstacles representing the proverbial variables that can change the cards at any moment. table. Up to this point the situation is almost indistinguishable from that of the prequel, but in reality there are several elements that intervene to give the Neutronized title a slightly different flavor. To begin with, the levels are randomly generated, to the advantage of a progression system closer to the world of roguelikes: you therefore proceed until you run out of lives, after which you are forced to start over or pay a quota of diamonds in order to continue. In this sense, an almost RPG nuance is also interesting, with the protagonist who, by accumulating points, rises in level, an occasion in which he can choose whether to assign a permanent bonus to the speed of movement or to the range of the magic or earn an extra life. In the face of so many things that work well in Drop Wizard Tower, only one did not fully convince us, namely the graphic design adopted by the product: having abandoned the decidedly more personal style of the first chapter, the Neutronized title comes with an old school cosmetics that however it does not denote particularly distinctive traits, getting lost in the chaos of pixel art mobile games that refer to the classics of the past.", "date": "2017-07-14", "grade": "8.2"}
