Wings of Freedom is based on the first season of the Attack on Titan anime, a series that has met with great success (to the point of being able to count on a cinematic reinterpretation) also thanks to its incredible twists and turns. It will be inevitable for us to talk about at least one of these events during the review, so if you haven't seen the cartoon yet, we suggest you do so before possibly approaching the game and/or reading this article. Published last February in Japan, the tie- in by Attack on Titan did not make much effort to leave the Japanese borders and land in Europe, although we had to settle for a western title, A.O.T. Wings of Freedom, evidently adapted to avoid licensing issues. In the same way, the gore that characterizes the anime from which the game is based has been substantially toned down: the blood is visible (although it can also be deactivated if desired), but forget about witnessing the dismemberments of the cartoon and manga. A censorship intervention that in our opinion penalizes the involvement, because creating an action game with competence also means sufficiently motivating the player to fight with enthusiasm against enemies who have no qualms about literally tearing apart his virtual companions. Having closed this little ~fan~ preamble, let's move on to one of the most fascinating aspects of the Koei Tecmo production, namely the plot. Attack on Titan is set in an alternative world strongly inspired by the German Middle Ages, which is evident not only from the names of the characters but also and above all from the architecture that surrounds them. One hundred years before the events narrated in the manga, giants make their appearance, huge and mysterious creatures, whose only interest seems to be to devour people. Their advent almost leads to the extinction of the human race and so, in order to defend the survivors, three enormous concentric circular walls fifty meters high are built, higher than any known giant. However, when a mysterious colossal titan enters the scene and breaks through the first of the three walls, the giants return to massacre the people and eliminate a third of the surviving population in a very short time. It is an event that marks the life of Eren, Mikasa and Armin, three kids who are rescued in extremis and who decide to join the army to avenge the death of their loved ones, becoming expert fighters over the course of five years. . The only way to eliminate the giants is to hit them on the scruff of the neck, the area between the neck and the nape of the head, so the military has developed special equipment for three-dimensional maneuvering, which allows it to grab onto trees or buildings and to launch quickly into the air thanks to a gas propulsion system, combined with a set of interchangeable blades to hit the titans in their weak point. A piece of equipment that seems to produce good results, at least until some different giants start appearing A.O.T. Wings of Freedom takes up the Attack on Titan anime and can be fun and spectacular From anime to game The A.O.T. startup screen Wings of Freedom offers two different possibilities: try your hand at Attack Mode, the story mode, or with Expedition Mode, a large collection of free exploration missions, which we can tackle alone or in online cooperative multiplayer, for a maximum of four participants. Since the game has been available for a while in Japan, there are already users for the co-op and we were therefore able to try this mode, which worked without problems during the tests but can hardly represent, in our opinion, an extra of who knows what weight. In fact, we limit ourselves to doing the same things that are done in single player, without variations on the theme if not the possibility of increasing the degree of challenge to make sense of the group hunt, especially if the players are equipped with a minimum of familiarity with the gameplay mechanics. The latter represent the fulcrum of the single player experience, which unfortunately suffers from the tie-in syndrome for two thirds of its duration. The obligation to remain adherent to the plot of the anime, with a single exception that shows some parallel events, in fact ends up fragmenting the action very often, even more so when the interface feels the obligation to stop us in the middle of a spectacular movement sequence to explain how to carry out a maneuver: a frustrating solution, which fortunately is set aside from a certain point on, when the mechanisms are now well assimilated and no further explanations are needed. The demand is felt stronglyable to move and fight freely, without being subjected to indicators and so on, and the developers in this sense have lost the opportunity to add something new to the plot, so as to also increase the duration of a campaign that probably does not go beyond five or six hours. The only outlet is represented by the exploration missions, which are linked precisely to the Expedition Mode, and which become freely accessible at a certain time, allowing us to face the giants without further distractions. The addition of this mode substantially increases the total duration of the product, composing a fairly rich endgame, which also rewards us by unlocking missions based on events that we will only see in the second season of the anime, but which clearly lacks the narrative scaffolding that you see in normal story mode. The three-dimensional maneuver The protagonists of A.O.T. Wings of Freedom, as mentioned, have equipment that allows them to face the giants and hit them in their weak point, in this case two motorized grappling hooks with a gas thruster and a pair of swords with interchangeable blades. Making the best use of this equipment was of vital importance for the success of the game, and it must be said that Omega Force from this point of view did not disappoint, indeed it even surprised those who did not expect miracles from developers now all too accustomed to the mechanical repetitive musou. At first it is surprising that you have chosen to use the main buttons of the DualShock to carry out all the most important manoeuvres, relegating the target coupling and the execution of the special to the backbones, but then trying the PlayStation Vita version it becomes clear that it is a solution designed to use a practically identical layout on the two consoles (see box for details). And so the Square key is used to fire the grappling hooks, with an automatic release mechanism that allows us to fire them again and again, taking advantage of the heights and angles to create truly spectacular sequences, in which our character passes very fast between the houses while get close to a target. Very interesting is the fact that grappling hooks cannot be used when there are no grips, so forget the Spider-Man effect with cobwebs attached to nothing: where there are no buildings, trees or rocky walls, you will have to proceed on foot or on horseback. The X key is normally used to jump, while if you press it in the air it activates the thruster and allows you to make quick shots that can literally save your life, perhaps dodging the blows of a giant or quickly bringing us back into action when the grappling hook cables enter contact with an obstacle and they release, leaving us to fall to the ground before being able to shoot them again. When we hook a titan, we can harpoon it in one of its joints (knees, elbows or neck) and begin to rotate around it waiting for the right moment to pick up speed and strike the scruff with the blades. The maneuver takes place automatically, with the character sprinting and getting faster as he gets closer to the target; or it can be speeded up by acting on the X button of the shot, a solution that allows you to get the decisive cue in a few meters and hit with the Triangle button. Depending on the power of our equipment, one well-aimed blow may be enough to eliminate a giant and move on to the next target, but it could also take several attempts. Furthermore, hitting the titans in the knees or elbows sometimes allows you to obtain resources that can be used for the crafting of components, which can be carried out between one mission and another on the basis of the money earned. The variants for swords, grappling hooks and the gas device are not very numerous, but they can be improved in various ways or even fortified by fusing objects that we do not use. In short, unlike the chapters of Dynasty Warriors, the gameplay of A.O.T. Wings of Freedom manages to be articulated enough to always guarantee a minimum of variety, in the sense that the fights are not resolved by always pressing the same buttons and always performing the same combos, but you also need to use a pinch of strategy to ensure that the giant on duty turn his back on us and therefore expose himself to our attack. You should also consider the special titans, which must be repeatedly hit in the joints before it is possible to target the scruff of the neck. Scoring eliminations gives great satisfaction, especially after a few hours, when the mechanisms of movement and attack have been well assimilated and you really move with incredible dynamism, without ever touching the ground. Adding further thickness to these phases is the elementconsumption of materials: the gas runs out, the blades lose sharpness and both must be replaced in order to continue fighting. Some NPCs scattered around the map allow you to restock, as well as the corpses of our companions, but woe to replace the equipment when there are titans nearby! The PlayStation Vita version Structurally identical to what is available on PlayStation 4, the PlayStation Vita version of A.O.T. Wings of Freedom is distinguished by a couple of alternative solutions concerning the controls (the map that enlarges and the special that is performed by touching the touch screen in the absence of the secondary backbones), but above all for the technical aspect. Unfortunately the flaws that often characterize the portable editions of the various musou are emphasized by the nature of the game, with less rich and detailed scenarios, but above all a really marked pop-up effect (enemies appear literally a few meters away) and monstrous drops of frame rates that make certain missions barely playable, especially when Eren transforms and destroys some buildings. For these reasons, the vote drops to 6, a very stretched sufficiency. Playstation 4 trophies The forty-three Trophies of A.O.T. Wings of Freedom are obtained by completing the various chapters of the story mode and brilliantly passing the tutorial, but also and above all by dissecting the game in its progression: maximizing weapons, eliminating a certain number of special giants, avoiding their attacks thanks to the focus mode and completing a number of side missions. So? A campaign that is not very long but enriched by a rich endgame and the possibility of unlocking missions that include events from the second season of the anime, together with a fairly multifaceted gameplay, draw the picture of a successful tie-in, which manages to go beyond of expectations and that Attack on Titan fans should no doubt hold in high regard. However, there are some aspects of the game that prevent it from convincingly establishing itself in the action scene. Firstly, when fighting with many giants things get really chaotic, the view tends to go crazy and the glitches are wasted, especially the polygonal interpenetrations. Then when we arrive at the aforementioned endgame, with Eren now capable of transforming on command, although for a few seconds (by activating the special, which otherwise consists of a group attack on the titan on duty), the degree of difficulty plummets downwards and completing exploration missions becomes a very trivial task. Then there are some uncertainties in the artificial intelligence that are highlighted during the (fortunately) few escort missions, with the people we have to protect not moving as they should, and very noticeable slowdowns when fighting in giant form and collapsing some building. This adds to the splintered pace of the campaign, which we mentioned earlier. Beyond the uncertainties of the frame rate during certain situations, the camera that sometimes tends to go crazy, the polygonal interpenetrations and a modest pop-up effect, Omega Force has done an excellent job with the graphics of A.O.T. Wings of Freedom, rendering the spectacular descents well with the three-dimensional maneuvering equipment, reproducing the characters faithfully and working much more than usual on the scenarios, which in this case tend to be repetitive but remain far from the desolation to which episodes of Dynasty Warriors got us used to it. The music taken from the anime is excellent (too bad the theme songs are missing, really splendid), the dialogues in Japanese are excellent: too bad for the localization only in English.", "date": "2016-08-26", "grade": "7.8"}
