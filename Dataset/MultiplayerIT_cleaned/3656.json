{"name": "Observation", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/observation-recensione.html", "text": "The independent studio No Code had already tried to explore the narrative potential of the videogame medium with Stories Untold, reflecting on the concept of point of view within a video game and on the very ways in which a story can be told. Observation, of which you can read the review, although presenting itself in a completely different way, deals with the same underlying theme, entrusting the player with the point of view of S.A.M., the artificial intelligence of a space station adrift in space, on which something has happened of terrible. Unfortunately SAM's memory has been corrupted and, despite being practically omniscient inside the station, he cannot reconstruct the events that led to the current emergency situation (at least not immediately). Dr. Emma Fisher, one of the crew members and our companion for the whole adventure, soon notices it, reactivates SAM in search of explanations and, above all, to try to identify the position of her colleagues. From this simple premise, a story with unexpected implications and a strong philosophical system unfolds, with a shocking ending. We are faced with a profound and meditated reinterpretation of a classic science fiction scenario, also for the world of video games, namely that of accidents in space (just think of Murders in Space, Project Firestart and Dead Space, to name a few), which it also has as its subtext 2001: A Space Odyssey by Stanley Kubrick, from which it takes several ideas, but which is developed in a decidedly different and original way. Gameplay In a sense Observation illustrates its main theme right from the title. SAM's main way of interacting with the game world is through gaze, i.e. the cameras scattered around the space station. Basically, the player has to observe the various environments and interact with the various electronic systems present by aiming them with the shot, whether they are the locks of the doors that divide the modules, laptops with valuable information inside, electrical outlets or sensors of some kind to reactivate. Each object with which you interact requires a systemic connection, which is performed by pressing a simple sequence of keys or, in the event of a block or malfunction, a real forcing, which is performed through diagrams to be inserted on a control grid. These are very simple operations that are repeated several times within the adventure, which serve, for example, to help Emma reach certain modules or to identify the position of the other crew members. The different cameras are accessible from a general map of the station, visible in the SAM operating system, which allows immediate movement between them. In some circumstances we will be asked to take control of some flying spheres that allow us to move freely around the modules and, if necessary, to go outside. SAM itself integrates different software systems, all accessible from its operating system. It will seem paradoxical, but No Code has managed to give a great narrative force to diagnostic systems, corrupted memory data and even voice recognition. From the beginning the player is pushed to consider SAM as a living and sentient creature that is hiding something. The plot makes no secret of the fact that he is the architect of some of the events of the plot, without however giving reasons, thus fueling an ambiguity that keeps the interest alive until the end of the game. And yet for the most part SAM limits himself to reporting to Emma the problems he encounters in the station, to connecting some fragments of memory, perhaps obtained by entering the crew's laptops or by scanning paper documents (they serve various purposes, such as decoding some conversations) or to do Emma's bidding herself, so where does the feeling of guilt that develops the further we get into the story come from? Also in this case the answer comes at the end, but it is evident that without a careful construction of the narration certain dramatic effects would not have been possible. Introduced the virus of doubt since the introduction, the developers have eliminated the risk that the player would take a neutral look, abstracting from the story, i.e. considering his role as merely instrumental. SAM doesn't remember, but he certainly did something and we immediately plunged with him into this search for the lost conscience that gives him an unexpected humanity. In this sense, referring to the Hal-9000 computer of the aforementioned 2001: A Space Odyssey is not ephemeral, even if the conclusions reached by Observation are decidedly different from those of Ku's filmbrick. Considerations If the reflection on how it was built narratively is not taken to the extreme consequences, mechanically Observation appears defective in several parts. For example, the movements of the cameras seem too slow, the controls of the spheres not very precise and the tasks to be performed from time to time too repetitive. Yet how much would he lose with faster cameras or less clumsy spheres? What would the gameplay have turned into if it had put the vices of the average player at the center, sacrificing the dramatic inexorability that weighs on every action of SAM, even the most minute? These are issues that must be addressed and on which precise questions must be asked, because otherwise the risk is that of imagining something as better as something that instead would have ended up only debasing an equally excellent building. A game focused on narration must be able to sacrifice its mechanics to the same, reducing them in intensity and marginalizing them when necessary, in order not to lose meaning and not get lost in the desired. In short, judging a title like Observation requires understanding if the author's vision has been brought to the end in the relationship between player, mechanics and narration, not if the cameras work better or worse than those of other games. The risk is that of superimposing expectations on the final result, presenting everything from an egotistical and disastrous perspective.", "date": "2019-05-24", "grade": "9.0"}
