{"name": "Bolt", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bolt.html", "text": "Just released in Italian cinemas, ~Bolt~ is the latest effort of Walt Disney Animation Studios. The film is completely made in computer graphics and is directed by the same director of ~Mulan~, even if in this case the plot is profoundly different and revolves around a dog-actor who plays a sort of four-legged superhero and convinces himself really have special powers. When his cage is mistakenly sent to New York, Bolt finds himself in unfamiliar surroundings and must rely on the help of some very peculiar friends to get home. The original cast of voice actors can count on high-sounding names, such as John Travolta, Miley Cyrus (the star of ~Hannah Montana~...) and Malcolm McDowell. As usual, the video game based on the film was not long in coming and indeed arrived practically simultaneously, including the mobile reduction managed by the developers of Enorbus Technologies, obviously under the aegis of Disney Mobile. We are basically dealing with a platformer with some action elements: under Bolt's command, we will have to overcome a certain number of stages and pay attention to the enemies, who we can eliminate using a running attack (key 5) or a special move ( key 0) when the relative bar is full. To fill it, it will be necessary to collect all the ~lightning bolts~ found within the locations, jumping from one platform to another and being careful not to fall from too high a height, otherwise the game is over. At a certain point of each stage we will find ourselves having to follow the orders of Penny (the owner of the dog, in the film), who in this case will tell us to jump or crouch in the vicinity of dangers that come from below or from above. Already from the first levels we will have the possibility to take advantage of some ~portals~ that amplify our jumping ability, essential for reaching otherwise inaccessible platforms. The control system is classic, with the d-pad for movement and two keys (5 and 0, which has already been mentioned) for attacking. Unfortunately, the response to the commands is not always immediate and precise, so we will have to apply the right pressure at the right time in order not to involuntarily suffer damage. At the same time, the game doesn't seem to digest diagonals: this means that in most cases we will have to use the numeric keyboard to jump... On a technical level, this tie-in presents itself in an unobtrusive but far from exceptional way. Bolt's sprite is well drawn and has an animation set of sufficient quality, while the enemies leave a lot to be desired in both variety and design. The backgrounds offer a good sense of depth, thanks to two-level parallax scrolling, and at least there's not much repetitiveness in the graphics. Finally, the sound is composed exclusively of MIDI music: the quality is not amazing, but they manage to accompany the action without being annoying. Too bad there is no independent volume control.
