{"name": "History Channel: Battle for the Pacific - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/history-channel-battle-for-the-pacific-recensione.html", "text": "It's a short step from Guadalcana to Iwo Jima The story takes place in one of the bloodiest phases of the Second World War. Theater of horrors are the islands of the Pacific, where Americans and Japanese fight for a common goal: to conquer military hegemony. In the role of an American marine, you will thus be called to fight in places not inclined to human settlement; just the misery of settings represents the first, unforgivable flaw. The 10 levels that make up the Single Player campaign (for a total of 2 hours of play: trust me, you won't consider low longevity as a problem due to boredom...) are in fact made up of only three variations: the trench, the jungle and the grotto. The poor characterization of the environments, combined with a literally photocopied mapping of the stages, thus gives the impression of always finding yourself fighting in the same places. A lack of commitment to the variety of settings is followed by the carelessness in recreating a realistic scenario: the hand of the History Channel is in fact tangible exclusively in the very short original films (in English and without subtitles) that precede the various missions. On the battlefield, on the other hand, one absolutely does not breathe the climate of destruction and misfortune to which Call of Duty has long accustomed us: the result is progress from point to point without the slightest presence of pathos, an indispensable component for immersing the player in such a dramatic historical context. Boredom in abundance It is certainly not from a low budget product that innovation can be expected. However, having reached the era in which FPS represent the most inflated genre, it is reasonable to expect a solid product even if it is the bearer of stale ideas. Unfortunately, Battle for the Pacific manages the difficult task of disappointing especially on the gameplay front. The various missions are the most tedious that can exist: your objectives will range from the simple defeat of the enemy forces, to very short, and neglected, sessions on board the anti-aircraft. The variations on the theme are very minimal: you will happen to have to blow up some houses in the area, or to defuse mines; all tasks that do not require any skill, other than the simple push of a button. Such a limited game can therefore only be on very rigid tracks: each mission will thus see you following your Sergeant, forcing you to follow a pre-established path, otherwise the mission will fail. Too bad that your foreman often gets stuck in areas without hostile forces, forcing you to retrace your steps while waiting for the artificial ~dementia~ to do its duty. On the AI front things don't improve by analyzing the behavior of the enemies: you will never witness any offensive dictated by a glimmer of tactics. They will simply face you head on one after the other, like the more classic (i.e. from twenty years ago...) by Shoot 'Em Up. It follows that the degree of defiance borders on the ridiculous. Yuhuuu, is anyone there? Theoretically, there is a full-bodied multiplayer, both in LAN and Online, consisting of 5 modes: in addition to the obvious Deatmach and Capture the Flag, you can try your hand at Elimination (both in team and solo), in which you will have a number of lives pre-established. Of course, the player or team that manages to survive wins. Unfortunately, in practice we have never been able to test the title online: the rooms are in fact perpetually deserted (zero players in the world!), which says a lot about the quality of the title. However, if you manage to create a small group of friends, you will be able to confront each other in 6 maps, all based on real battlefields: however, the tiny number of weapons available could disappoint. They are divided into 5 classes (rifles, machine guns, machine guns, sniper rifles and pistols), each consisting of only 2 weapons: the American and the Japanese. However, an inaccurate historical reconstruction does not reveal a substantial difference between the Yankees and the Eastern armament. The doctor recommends: an Aspirin after use Technically speaking, the game lines up with the overall mediocrity of the product. To annoy the player's eye it will not be so much the poverty of polygons, but rather the frame-rate, stuttering not only in the most agitated phases. The natural consequence is a very strong migraine, which can only be sedated once the game session is closed. Along your way you will also run into many bugs, more or less justifiable; mines and snipers that appear out of nowhere, trunks without the physicality in which you will pass through, companions that float during sudden ups and downs: all problems dictated by a programbotched mation. Things do not improve by analyzing the sound sector. There is no music in Battle for the Pacific. If this lack can be considered a stylistic choice during the missions, leaving the player immersed only in the sound effects of the war, the same certainly cannot be said of the end credits, whose desolation would certainly have been mitigated by a beautiful enthralling song. Comment Battle for the Pacific was born from a winning idea: the almost unprecedented setting in the world of video games, combined with the infinite archive of the History Channel, could transform the gaming experience into an exciting interactive history lesson. Unfortunately, the premises have not been kept: the reconstruction of the events is marginal, and is not supported by a gameplay up to the competition. The result is a totally bite-free game, which will make you breathe more than a sigh of relief once completed.
