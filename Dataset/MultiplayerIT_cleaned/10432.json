Ubisoft also tries, which produces a very ~European~ and surprisingly fresh and intriguing investigative title. It was a dark and stormy night The premises, again have practically nothing. Metropolis is the name of the city where you will live your cases, but more than Superman's city of the same name, sunny and hyperactive, this seems like an even more noir and decadent version of Batman's Gotham City: crime is rampant everywhere without being in the least worried by a corrupt and incapable police, the streets are dark, dirty and dangerous, a den of thieves, murderers and all sorts of criminals, the buildings dilapidated and unsafe... A nice mess then, where one would not expect to find a like Red Johnson, a young private detective very skilled and quick both with reasoning and with a gun. As if that weren't enough, Johnson is an idealist and a tough guy, in short, someone who doesn't let anyone put his feet on his head, the true defender of citizens from injustice, the... In short, you understand the character! And all the clichs of the noir genre are certainly not skimped during the four cases you face as Johnson, four cases of heinous murders full of beautiful fatal women, illicit deals, incompetent and conceited agents, informants, fearful witnesses and double agents, excursions into the supernatural, rooftop chases, gun duels, phone booths and most of all rain, lots and lots of rain... Hound nose! However, do not be fooled by such unoriginal premises: in addition to the fact that the canonical atmosphere is still rendered very well as we will see later, the real gist of Metropolis Crimes, the gameplay, shows a surprising charge of originality at least in the detective field game. In fact, unlike illustrious exponents of the genre such as the aforementioned Phoenix Wright, here the resolution of the various cases is much less guided and one-way: you can in fact go ahead even letting some clues and information slip away, the important thing is that in the end you know indicate to the game the fundamental information and above all the name of the culprit. All of this is possible thanks to a scoring system that penalizes your ranking in the event of repeated errors and attempts, but which will never stop you from doing all your fine logical reasoning and getting to discover the culprit without the plot of the game , unfolding, find out for yourself. In practice, the adventure takes place by moving through the classic static backdrops of any self-respecting investigative adventure: as soon as your magnifying glass (which starts by drawing a circle on the touch screen) encounters an area worthy of more attention, the 'puzzle/mini-game, which is played with the stylus and whose types can vary from the logic puzzles typical of many classic adventures to the frenetic mini-games typical of many DS games, thus testing both your gray matter and reflexes and coordination eye-hand. Even the interrogations never lose sight of the playful objective of the game, as it is a real intelligence challenge with the interrogated to the best of three or four rounds! Worth mentioning is the presence of an informant who you can call in case of need and who will give you a clue to overcome the obstacle, as well as the practical presence of a notebook where the fundamental information is marked. Each case ends in the study, where you have to, thanks also to the help of a computer, analyze the evidence, establish the necessary connections and finally draw up a report consisting of various questions on the case in question, last and most important the one on the culprit . In short, a fairly profound concept, sometimes even a little too cumbersome and which is sometimes lost in the practical implementation of the given minigame, but which succeeds, in fluency, in an attempt to always keep both the fun and the l player's attention. Poor butler! A defect that can be ascribed to Metropolis Crimes is the not excessive duration of the game: four events, each of which can be solved quite comfortably in a single session do not add up to many hours of play, yet, more unique than rare, the peculiar scoring system could give someone a little push to replay, nothing exceptional but still remarkable given the genre in which it iswe're talking. From a graphic point of view, for 95% of the game we are faced with the classic static screens typical of many adventures, drawn in a style that recalls the old adventures of the past and which will therefore give pleasant sensations to lovers of the genre: the more interesting the speech on the characters, who are presented to us in a style halfway between the Franco-Belgian bande dessine and the Japanese manga, for a discreet result that however seems a little out of context with respect to the rest of the graphics. There are also 3D sections in the context of some minigames, on which, however, there is not much to say beyond a laconic ~without infamy and without praise~ given the scarcity of time in which we find ourselves in these sections and their very poor interactivity. Then the animated introduction, also made up of more or less static screens, allows us to begin to appreciate the sound aspect as well, and especially the music that moves, wanting to set a cinematographic reference point, between noir of the 40s and the action detective story of the 70s. Nothing original, but all well done.", "date": "2009-10-27", "grade": "7.5"}
