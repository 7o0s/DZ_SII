The game arrives on the Nintendo hybrid console several months after its debut on PC, PlayStation and Xbox, and can therefore count on a series of improvements and contents that were not yet available at the original launch , in particular new characters capable of substantially enriching the roster available for the Clash mode. History Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles in the early stages of the campaign As we were able to write in the previous review of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles, the story of the game faithfully follows the events of the first season of the anime, concluding with the dramatic saga of the Mugen Train, within of eight chapters anticipated by a prologue which is used to introduce the protagonist of the adventure, Tanjiro Kamado, and his sister Nezuko. The two are the only survivors of a family massacred by demons, but not without consequences: the girl was transformed in turn into an infernal being, but it seems that she somehow managed to preserve her instincts and to remember her affection for her brother, who, in revenge for what happened, decided to undergo the very hard training to become a Demon Slayer. The campaign of the game, characterized by a duration of about six hours where the long and frequent interlude sequences are not skipped, starts from Tanjiro's training and then accompanies us to the difficult exam to obtain the title of Demon Slayer, which takes place on a cursed mountain where a very powerful demon roams who has massacred many people. There is no doubt that the strong point of this latest licensed game signed by CyberConnect2 is precisely the narrative sector: the Japanese team knows well how to bring the spectacular nature of certain sequences to the screen and here too it reaffirms its talent, achieving moments from great visual and emotional impact, especially if you've seen the anime. Structure Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles, the fascinating scenery of Asakusa In terms of content there are no differences between the Nintendo Switch version of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles and the previous ones, except, as mentioned, for the six additional characters available for Clash mode, which bring the roster to a total of twenty-four fighters, albeit with several alternative versions. In reality we are not yet faced with a definitive edition of the game, in the sense that starting from this summer further DLC will be released which will focus on the history of the War Quarter Pleasures, with Uzui, Daki, Gyutaro and four other reinterpretations of Tanjiro, Nezuko, Zenitsu and Inosuke, in addition to those already present in the basic package. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles, two of the new playable characters on Nintendo Switch There is no doubt that the introduction of figures such as Susamaru, Yahaba, Enmu and the couple formed by Tamayo and Yushiro increases the depth of the experience, at least in the context of versus, which is however a somewhat end-in-itself modality itself and strongly linked to the presence of online players available for a challenge. For the rest, the problems we talked about a few months ago in relation to the story mode remain. Beyond the length itself, the campaign unfortunately presents itself as the most classic of the transpositions, in the sense that not all the events of the anime of Demon Slayer lend themselves to an action interpretation and CyberConnect2 hasn't actually done much to make the level design of the settings more interesting, which in some cases appear as short stretches of road or, in the more complex versions, small labyrinths without any interaction or puzzle. Gameplay Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles, Tanjiro performs one of his special moves As written at the time of the previous review, the gameplay of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles has several points in common with the Naruto Shippudden: Ultimate Ninja Storm series, in the sense that it stages an arena fighter with battles that develop in all directions but at the same time maintain great basic accessibility. Unfortunately, this trait translates into a general lack of complexity in battles with artificial intelligence, in the sense that it is enough to always run theusual combination of moves, between standard and special attacks, to get the better of your opponent, provided obviously you dodge his blows during an offensive phase which is however well ~signaled~ by the game. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles, Inosuke against a demon The good thing is that the enemies never try to get away forcing us to chase them, a rather frustrating dynamic which however is typical of the aforementioned Naruto tie-ins, and it is probably also for this reason that the degree of challenge of the campaign is confirmed discreetly trivial: to run into game over you will really have to load head down ignoring any warning. The impact yield is excellent, the supers are truly spectacular (and God forbid, it is practically the specialty of CyberConnect2) and the inevitable quick time events characterize certain phases of the battle. Too bad that the exploratory phases are really, really weak and based on simple gimmicks (see the smell of demons) that add very little. Graphics and sound Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles, a particularly suggestive sequence We have replayed the game campaign on Nintendo Switch almost always in portability, a dimension that is well suited to the experience offered by Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles and which is also more consistent in terms of frame rate, with 30 fps that are maintained firmly and without blunders, as well as excellent image quality. With the console connected to the TV, the situation changes a bit and evidently the higher resolution creates some difficulties for the graphics engine, which is not as precise and loses some hits during the most agitated sequences, as well as showing a general slowness in the streaming of assets during the exploratory phases. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles, Yushiro and Tamayo Having said that, CyberConnect2 confirms itself as a master in the use of cel shading and in the ability to bring moments of great impact to the screen, perfectly directed and often capable of surpassing the original material for the goodness of the solutions adopted. A trait that however is overshadowed when the cutscenes are entrusted to the actual game engine. The uploads are obviously longer than what the SSD of the new-gen consoles has accustomed us to, but the waiting between sessions is not likely to cause problems. As for the sound, the English and Japanese dubbing (with Italian subtitles) will please everyone, as will the music.", "date": "2022-06-09", "grade": "6.7"}
