{"name": "Sly 2: La Banda dei Ladri", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/sly-2-la-banda-dei-ladri.html", "text": "Beagle Boys There's already a major difference between Sly 2 and its prequel in the title itself. This episode is so subtitled Band of Thieves, precisely because this time not only the intriguing protagonist will enter the action, but also his fellow adventurers, Bentley and Murray, who this time can be controlled by the player to exploit their their unique abilities. Sly's new goal is to close the game once and for all with Clockwerk, the mechanical creature faced and defeated in the first episode, now dismantled into various parts, which have come into the possession of the various bigwigs of the mysterious Klaww Band. Sly and his companions must therefore steal the various components from the bosses in the eight chapters into which the adventure is divided, and doing so will not be easy: each chapter will be set in a specific location, and the first thing our group of bandits will do is install a base of operations. From there, we will be able to explore the environment at will, face the various enemies that roam around, perhaps exploiting them to make some money, and proceed with the quest: in fact, to recover every part of Clockwerk, it will first be necessary to solve mini-missions that , organically linked to each other in a not entirely linear way, will lead Sly straight to the goal. Murray and Bentley will come into action in these phases, when Sly's agility will no longer be enough: Murray is the arm of the group, and this means that when there is something to destroy or a group of enemies to fight we will be able to resort to his strength, while on the other hand Bentley, as the brains of the gang, will become our alter-ego in the less agitated phases, when Murray's brute strength against puzzles and riddles will become at least inappropriate. Although each chapter is structurally similar, the interest remains high thanks to the enormous variety and intelligence of these missions that entice the player to continue the adventure... Beagle Boys Although each chapter is similar on a structural level, thus dividing into minor quests that lead each one back to the final face-to-face with the boss on duty, the interest remains high thanks to the enormous variety and intelligence of these missions that entice the player to proceed in the adventure, if only to find out what new skill our heroes will learn, between stunts and floating jet-packs. Moreover, the acquisition of the new skills of Sly, Murray and Bentley takes place in a way that is not entirely original but certainly effective. In the world of Sly we will have access to ThiefNet, a sort of website where we will be able to spend the money earned during our raids to buy the new skills of our pets, for a maximum number of eight per thief; moreover, Sly will only have access to a personal special ability in each stage, recovering the thirty clues scattered in every corner of the main location. Thirty-two skills, therefore, sixteen for Sly, eight for Bentley and eight for Murray: certainly there is no shortage of variety, and the possibility of assigning them to the back buttons to combine their use is a gimmick that allows you to customize control as much as possible each character and its abilities. Matter of style The improvements made by Sucker Punch to the Sly concept are not limited only to the playful mechanics, the technical department has also undergone a drastic improvement. The excellent cel-shaded realization already seen in Sly Cooper & the Thievius Raccoonus returns in Sly 2: Band of Thieves and, in a word, amazes. In the previous episode we had large and detailed settings, but nothing particularly spectacular, in Sly 2 instead the locations are not only masterfully created from every point of view, both structural and purely aesthetic, but they present a stylistic design that fits perfectly with the cartoonish and at the same time mature atmosphere of the story. The animations of each polygonal model continue to be excellent and give the idea of watching a cartoon, thanks also to the interlude sequences, created with that slightly retro comic style that makes them irresistible. The humor and refined characterization of the various characters, whether good or bad, do the rest, thanks also to an enjoyable and above average dubbing in Italian which, combined with a well-orchestrated and always spot-on soundtrack, completes a technical picture of everything respect. The first Sly Cooper was a great game, but not a great game. It was a short-lived title, compelling to be sure, but destined to be put back on the shelf after the few hours it took to reach the end credits. The new Sly, on the other hand, is a great game, certainly one of the best action-games available for PlayStation 2. The strength of Sly 2 is certainly the cSucker Punch's ability to blend the practical unfolding of the action with the interesting plot, a feature that gives meaning to the various missions that will have to be faced, without the narrative becoming a mere pretext, making the progression more and more compelling and intriguing. If we add to this an excellent technical sector and a more than decent twenty hours necessary to complete it by discovering all its secrets (unfortunately not many), it is easy to understand how Jak 3 and Ratchet & Clank will have to sweat to compete with Sly 2 as the best action game for the Sony console. And all in all, among the three litigants, we are the ones who enjoy. Pros: Perfect cohesion between game and narrative Three different characters to use Various and fun quests and missions Cons: A few frame-rate drops too few extras undermine its replayability This year's fall season seems to be a particularly lucky time for the Sony console. Between shocking announcements (Resident Evil 4), titles of surprising quality (GTA San Andreas) and future stars that already shine through a few but convincing photos, PlayStation 2 owners find in their hands a machine capable of giving fun for all tastes. And a sector for refined palates, even if it may not seem so, is that of action-games, where competition is fierce: Jak 3 and Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal are on the way, which promise sparks. Sly 2: Band of Thieves, sequel to that discussed Sly Cooper & the Thievius Raccoonus that convinced critics a couple of years ago, can be considered a formidable competitor in this season of videogame fire. Will the programmers of Sucker Punch have managed to improve the characteristics of that already excellent prequel?", "date": "2004-11-10", "grade": null}
