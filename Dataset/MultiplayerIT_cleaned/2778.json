We won't start in the usual way, inviting you to read the next few lines to find out if it's a game that's right for you but, on the contrary, dissuading you from continuing to read, if you fall into at least two preponderant categories. The first is that of the detractors of the musou: for you this genre is evil, a cancer to be eradicated without half measures with the destruction of the offices of Koei Tecmo and Omega Force. You only play soulslike, action RPGs for real men and despise any other genre in which you don't have to pour sweat, blood and tears to get to the end credits. Needless to explain that Hyrule Warriors is not the usual musou: you have already decided that the Nintendo title is not for you. If you belong to the second category, then you can't tolerate the idea that the brand can take other forms than the third person adventure. Any deviation in this sense is pure heresy. You fear that Nintendo will march on the franchise and your worst nightmare is a match-3 for mobile systems. The Legend of Zelda means puzzles, puzzles, exploration and open world, even if the open world in the series only exists in Breath of the Wild. Furthermore, the fact that Hyrule Warriors is a prequel is inconceivable: the stories are now told only for suggestions and panoramas, so much so that you have skipped every cinematic of Breath of the Wild and have started to change the dialogues in every other game. Here, if you fall into at least one of these two categories, continuing to read this review would be perfectly useless. If, on the other hand, you're feeling a bit rebellious and subversive, and are willing to broaden your horizons, then Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity might surprise you. The story: Zelda yes or Zelda no? Needless to waste so many words: Hyrule Warriors is a musou, so much so that in Japan it is called , Zelda Musou. It is a genre founded on immediacy and spectacularity, in which a sword blow is enough to defeat entire platoons of enemies, particularly suitable for staging the action in titles that tell of great wars and epic conflicts. Hyrule Warriors is not The Legend of Zelda, but it was the best way to adapt the apocalyptic battle that serves as a prelude to Breath of the Wild in the form of gameplay. In addition, the previous Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition had gone very well, especially in the Rising Sun where musou are much more appreciated, so it made perfect sense to try the experiment again with an extra gear, or the supervision of Eiji Aonuma and the team who developed Breath of the Wild. We don't feel like blaming the detractors of the second category totally wrong, those who didn't see the need to tell the story before Breath of the Wild. The Nintendo-branded masterpiece made environmental storytelling its workhorse, limiting the exposure to short cinematics that didn't really say everything about the war that brought Hyrule to its knees, and which left the players with the pleasure of interpretation. On the other hand, thanks also to the voiced dialogues and an extraordinary art direction, Breath of the Wild has given us some of the most charismatic characters in the entire franchise that it would have been truly a waste not to cultivate. The good news is that Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity isn't really a prequel. The game actually starts as such but, thanks to the trick of time travel, it takes a turn of its own in terms of narrative, guaranteeing some unexpected surprises. The first hours of the game tell the beginning of the war against Calamity Ganon in more detail, but also in a more clumsy way: the first animated interludes do not show off particularly sharp writing, but the more you continue in the campaign and the more interesting the interactions between the numerous characters who go to baste the cast. The story, in particular, focuses heavily on the relationship between Zelda and her father, King Rhoam, and on the machinations of the Yiga clan who, together with a mysterious sorcerer, are attempting to resurrect the god of rancor. We won't anticipate anything, except that the last missions are a succession of exhilarating moments that seem like a crossroads between the cinematic Lord of the Rings, with its galvanizing speeches to the armies gathered on the common front, and Japanese action anime, with a direction of kinematics that skilfully mixes the shots and the splendid and pressing soundtrack, partly taken from Breath of the Wild and partly unpublished. The gameplay: action and feeling Useless spsay other words on the combat system, on which we have concentrated the previews and tests of the last few weeks: the demo is available for download and offers the entire Chapter 1 with the possibility of exporting the save at the release, so we advise you to download it for get an idea of the gameplay. However keep in mind that the demo only scratches the surface. Of course, Hyrule Warriors is not a true RPG with vertical progression and what you do in the demo, good or bad, you will continue to do all the time. We completed the campaign in about forty hours, solving almost all the secondary missions in between and leaving some outstanding, to which were added those that make up a large post-game. We spent the time breaking through enemy battalions with combo shots, as happens in many musou, but the introduction of the Sheikah runes into the gameplay proved to be a winning intuition that greatly refined the experience. We had already talked about it in our last test, but continuing in the game we were able to further appreciate this mechanic which, as mentioned, changes significantly depending on the character used, forcing the player to reevaluate the timing and positioning, especially when fighting the more as powerful as the Hinox, the Guardians or the terrible and very fast Lynel. The bigger they are, the more noise they make when they fall, one could say, but in reality the openings are getting shorter and shorter, the time to use a counterattack Sheikah rune is greatly reduced and Hyrule Warriors stops being a carefree action game to put the cornered player already at the standard difficulty level of the four available. It is not only necessary to use runes or elemental magic wands to weaken the enemy, but it is also necessary to evaluate which combos to use, in order to avoid being trapped in too long an animation while the enemy has recovered and is already preparing to strike. Then there is an elemental relationship to take into account, which is not limited to environmental interaction: as you probably know if you have read our insights or played the demo, fire rods can set grass on fire spreading damage to larger areas wide, electric ones can paralyze enemies in puddles, as well as ice ones or the Glacyor rune can freeze soaked targets. Some enemies are then infused with elemental powers that change their attacks and also our approach, so hitting an Ice Hinox with the fire rod, for example, allows us to weaken its armor, helping us to attack its weak point more easily with the powerful extra attack. All these mechanisms help to maintain a substantial variety for the duration of the adventure, bypassing the age-old problem of repetitiveness in the musou: yes, in Hyrule Warriors you always do the same thing in general, that is, fight enemies and minibosses at full throttle, but you can do it in different ways. In this sense, the variety of the cast is one of the best aspects of the Koei Tecmo title. Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity has about twenty playable characters, and fortunately none of them are clones of the others. Each unlocked hero uses the Sheikah runes in a different way and, although he takes advantage of the exact same combos that alternate the X and Y keys, he enjoys a so-called personal action that defines him perfectly also on a narrative level. Some characters work so differently from others - for example Revali, who can fly - that it won't be difficult to find the one you prefer in terms of gameplay as soon as possible. It being understood that playing them all in rotation is the best solution, also because some main and secondary missions require the use of one or more specific characters and the weapons found in the various stages correspond to the characters you are using at that moment. Beyond combat In the hours we spent with Hyrule Warriors we rarely stopped to ~grind~ materials or experience points. We used a few tricks, like experience-boosting foods, to rotate characters through missions, then turned to the paid training service to level up and get pretty much the entire main cast - because, yeah, there they are also some secret characters! - always ready for the challenge. Obviously it is possible to replay the completed stages several times, perhaps to find the Korogu and the hidden chests: we also very much appreciated another wink at The Legend of Zelda as a franchise, with the Sheikah runes that are not only used for fighting, but also to solve some environmental puzzles. The radio-controlled bombs poThey can destroy boulders and cracked walls, while Calamitron can lift buried chests just like in Breath of the Wild, and so on. The maps are not particularly interactive, but Koei Tecmo has essentially extrapolated them from Breath of the Wild, confining them to smaller but still large enough scenarios to guarantee a minimum of satisfaction for those who love to explore. Most of the time, however, you will have to deal with time limits, especially in side missions that impose it nine times out of ten, but it must be said that the optional stages are generally much shorter and scaled down compared to those of the campaign, representing excellent content for those who love to play on the go. We are not at the levels of Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition and its immense Adventure mode - which, however, was built over time through numerous DLCs - but the new structure is certainly less dispersive and overwhelming. In this sense, Hyrule Warriors is an unexpectedly interesting title from a content point of view because the much talked about secondary tasks that are completed directly on the map by pressing a few keys are not as simple as they seem. At some point they become so many that you will literally have to micromanage the situation. Will you consume the materials you have saved to add a heart to Impa's life energy or will you unlock a new combo for Daruk? Better to immediately unlock the radar that suggests the missions and shops where you can find the materials needed to complete the tasks, or a nice discount at the shops in East Hyrule? And yes, at some point, perhaps, you will have to repeat the stages to scrape together some material that you are missing, but the immediacy and frenzy that distinguish the combat system make the inconvenience much less annoying than it might seem, also because he always gets something, for example rupees - which are never enough - or new weapons to fuse at the blacksmith. This too is practically a game within the game, as the automatically generated weapons can boast random abilities that you can combine in an attempt to forge the best weapon for each character. Tasks on the map will allow you to unlock new features at the Blacksmith, including polishing - which can transform rusty tools into extremely powerful weapons - and the ability to remove and recombine weapon bonuses. Solving tasks is a constant surprise because most of them are intertwined, following a narrative logic that unlocks new side quests, costumes for Link, upgrades and additional features. We had feared that the map was a simple interlude between the stages, and instead it turned out to be a Machiavellian content that fits well into the pace of the game, and which sometimes forced us to rack our brains and carefully consider our possibilities. However, the actual internships are many, and perhaps we would have preferred a slightly diversified level design because the missions in which you have to micromanage the team's movements during the fights are almost all in the campaign. To be clear, Hyrule Warriors is not a game in which you just press random keys and move from one point to another to win: especially in advanced missions, it becomes essential to open the menu to order other characters to attack certain enemies or defend some bases allies while we deal with another emergency. In these situations, the Koei Tecmo title really gives its best, exerts considerable pressure on the player and forces him to tactically choose paths and objectives. The frame rate trying If you've played Breath of the Wild, then you know very well that the army of Hyrule fought at one point to protect the castle from Ganon's armies. Hyrule Warriors plunges you into that pivotal moment in history in the most spectacular way possible. Rains. Lightning flashes in the sky while all hell is on the ground. Hordes of grublins, lizalfos, and moblins infest the surrounding plain. Possessed Guardians come from every corner. The wind shakes the grass, there are enemies everywhere. The Hyrule army fights alongside you above and below the stronghold. Fire and flames everywhere. If you look around, you can also see the Holy Colossi bombarding enemies from afar. It's an absolutely spectacular mission, accompanied by an amazing soundtrack, and it's a real shame that often the game drops frames because it can't make it, because too much stuff is moving on the screen at the same time. In an age-old digital incarnation of the saying ~I want to but I can't~, Hyrule Warriors has a major prob", "date": "2020-11-18", "grade": "8.5"}
