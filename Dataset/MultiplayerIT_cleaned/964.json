The art of fear The results of the autopsy of the first victim. It could very well be the opening scene of a film and instead it is the prelude to one of the most intriguing games of the year, which in any case owes a large part of its use to the cinema and in particular to psycho-thrillers. The superlative introduction offers a tasty taste of the strong-colored atmospheres and the enthralling game rhythm that will absorb us for almost the entire adventure: this immediately throws us into the heart of the story, given that we take over the fifth corpse and investigations now underway; our killer loves to have fun not only with his prey but also with the police, to whom he leaves nothing but fragmentary clues and delirious written in blood; the latest murders indicate a progressive escalation of violence and his modus operandi seems to evolve over time. Victoria has water in her throat but decides to take a break, at least to bring her Christmas present to her father. To reciprocate, the latter gives her an old family heirloom (when it comes to recycled gifts... of course, always better than wrapping up the house cat to fix something at the last minute): it will be the key to access the memories of the grandfather Gustave McPherson, who in his time had followed a similar case, a little too similar to be honest. At this point, Still Life surprises us with a sudden change of scenery, rhythm and protagonist: a diary forgotten for years in the attic transports us to a canal in early 1900s Prague, the screen suddenly takes on the rough sepia hues of an old faded photo and we find ourselves in the role of Vic's detective grandfather, grappling with yet another prostitute's corpse fished out of the river. Two different cities, two different eras... only one killer? At the scene of the first crime in Prague. Reading Gus' diary will represent a bridge with the past throughout the course of the adventure, which runs on a razor's edge intertwining two parallel stories and bouncing us from a cold and aseptic Chicago of today to a suggestive postcard Prague. The differences between the two eras in which the game is set are not exclusively graphical and stylistic, they are also reflected in the gameplay: while Vic collaborates with FBI experts and makes use of the most modern technologies for gathering clues and identifying suspects, Gus makes his way to the sound of punches, burglaries and break-ins, with slightly less orthodox methods and the help of his psychic powers and some trusted friends in the police or in petty crime. Reading Gus' diary will represent a bridge to the past throughout the course of the adventure Two different cities, two different eras... only one killer? A visit to the Chicago morgue. The case in question is quite believable and the profile of the killer holds up just fine. In fact, cinema was not the only source of inspiration for the developers: chief designer Mathieu Larivire said he read up on the books of John Douglas, a former FBI agent and now consultant, and that he is an admirer of Patricia Cornwell, especially his ~Portrait of a Murderer~. It will be clear to everyone by now that Still Life is a ~bad~ title, aimed at a mature audience: the crimes are depicted in all their crudeness, the atmospheres are oppressive, the dialogues are realistic and do not save on profanity and jokes gun cotton, how natural it would be in such a context! The protagonists themselves are certainly not two boy scouts: more often than not they are the first to break the law, Gus never disdains resorting to strong ways to get a lead and has the bad habit of getting too involved in cases on a personal level and, from for her part, Victoria is completely desensitized to violence and has no qualms about sending procedures and her boss to hell if necessary. Two different cities, two different eras... only one killer? The result is a perturbing cocktail of different tensions, atmospheres, rhythms and styles of play which, despite some form flaws outlined below, won't fail to conquer a place on the shelf of every graphic adventure enthusiast, especially those with a penchant for the thrill and the mystery. There are aspects of the plot that touch emotional climaxes that are rare to experience in a video game. Flashbacks are masterfully woven into this interactive thriller, through subtle narrative devices and cutscenes that have nothing to envy to the more memorable sequences of the cinematic counterparts. Even the ending, for better or for worse, has a lot in common with thatthem that often re-propose feature films of the genre: whoever gets there will understand why! Anatomy of an adventure Once the strengths of the setting and game mechanics have been gutted, let's take into consideration the actual technical realization. The pedigree of the MC2 team developers is in itself a guarantee of quality and high production standards: many have been involved in previous Microds adventures, in this case Syberia and Post Mortem, and we have already reported how and to what extent Still Life can be considered the direct heir, in its preview. The commitment and resources invested in the effort to give shape to a complex and relatively original concept are more than evident, also because otherwise we would not be able to enjoy an equally intense and evocative gaming experience. The puzzles are varied, discreetly stimulating and well integrated into the context. Anatomy of an adventure Nothing complicated: we just need to get the fingerprints on this bottle. The puzzles are varied, discreetly stimulating and well integrated into the context: they offer the most diverse challenges and range from fingerprint detection to the preparation of biscuits. We will test our logic and our patience using the right object in the right place, deciphering symbols and numerical codes, maneuvering more or less complex mechanisms, recomposing interlocking and sliding puzzles, without even exempting ourselves from the classic labyrinth, albeit revisited in a relatively innovative. Noteworthy are above all the puzzles in which the artistic flair and the murderous madness of the assassin mix to test our deductive abilities, giving a whole new depth to the adventure: not only are some passages of the story told in a suggestive way through his paintings, with the same livid and hallucinated pictorial stroke, but the whole story revolves around them and the final enigma can only be solved with an overall analysis of his work. Another original and engaging expedient is the use of photos taken at crime scenes in Prague to search for clues. The level of difficulty, however, is somewhat uneven. Anatomy of an adventure Here we are grappling with the infamous grandmother's biscuit recipe! The level of difficulty, however, is somewhat uneven: the puzzles related to inventory and interaction with the environment tend to be logical and simple to overcome, even for a beginner. Some puzzles instead end up harming the pace of the game, which thus suffers from ups and downs with sudden setbacks: for the most part, they are genuinely original and fun to solve, but two or three are particularly difficult and break the narrative flow irritatingly (one can't waste time perfecting an old family gingerbread cookie recipe while there's a homicidal maniac on the loose in Chicago, much less spend hours puzzling over how to delicately pick a lock , while a potential victim of the killer is missing)! More feedback was promised for the complex puzzles but there isn't: it still happens that you have to go on trial and error with infinite possible combinations, without ever knowing if and how close you are to the solution (an example is the previously mentioned biscuit puzzle, in which it is necessary to reconstruct the exact sequence and doses of the ingredients of a delirious recipe: the idea is appreciable and original but frustration is always lurking because, when it's time to put the dough in the oven, Vic limits himself to informing us that he doesn't have the desired flavor and throw it away to start over). The hated puzzle of the lock to pick is damning like in Post Mortem and perhaps more: it had already been harshly criticized in the predecessor of Still Life and the developers had the audacity to recycle it, however evolved compared to the original (with the result which is definitely more difficult)! That said, one still can't complain about the lack of variety or puzzles that give even the experts a hard time! Perhaps, there would have been a few more stages in the CSI, given the theme and the spirit of adventure. How long you play will largely depend on your ability to digest the trickier puzzles, as beyond these it flows nicely quickly. A nature that is far from dead The signature of Syberia's artistic team is also recognizable in the implementation of the enhanced graphics engine, which makes a brilliant display of its skills by recreating decidedly more sinister settings than its predecessor but just as detailed and suggestive. Particularly appreciable is the change of colors and atmospheres in the transition from one era to another: the bruised and sharp stylethat characterizes the scenes set in Chicago contrasts sharply with the faded and dreamy glimpses of Prague. The real-time reproduction and manipulation of light and shadow is truly remarkable. The reflections on the water and the fog effect are decidedly convincing. As in Syberia, many of the two-dimensional backdrops are embellished with small details and graphic gems which, while not immediately catching the eye, help to animate them and make them more vivid: rats that suddenly dart from one side of the screen to the other, curtains swaying elegantly, flickering candle flames... The three-dimensional model of the protagonist is very detailed and well animated, the others a little less. A similar argument must be made for the numerous films that punctuate and enliven the adventure: some will remain indelibly impressed in the player's memory, due to the incisiveness of the shots, the refined style and the unusual suspense for a video game, others quality, although the average remains high and the film cut unmistakable.

[/C] The interface is essential and functional: interactions with the game environment and menu selections are made with the left mouse button, while the right opens and closes the inventory. However, it may require a little adaptation effort by veterans of the genre, accustomed to the direct use of objects in the game environment: in Still Life you have to approach the on-screen element you want to interact with and wait for the appearance of an appropriate icon, before accessing the inventory menu and selecting the item to be used automatically. This mechanism simplifies the solution of many puzzles and solves the problem of ~pixel hunting~, or the frantic search for hot spots on the screen, but it is not necessarily intuitive. The inventory screen, which includes areas for collecting evidence and documents obtained during the game, offers the possibility to examine and zoom in on all the three-dimensional objects in our possession: for example, we will be able to rotate a card to read a code on the back . The dialogue engine provides two different ways of interacting with the characters in the game and the alternate use of the left mouse button for options related to investigations and the right one for more personal questions or reflections, which do not directly affect the solution of the adventure but they give depth to its protagonists. Nonetheless, the conversations are rigidly linear and do not allow us to intervene in any way on the choice or order of the topics covered. Gus cross-examines a key witness. Apart from some small inaccuracies in the translation, the dialogues flow and it is a pleasure to listen to them, even when the characters dwell on anecdotes or details of their private life. Strange as it may sound, it is also a pleasure to browse Vic's reports and autopsy reports, always realistic and well written. In the exchanges between the protagonist and the other characters, even in the most dramatic moments, there is never a sharp joke that manages to pleasantly displace the viewer and dilute the dark and tense atmospheres that pervade the game. Not all voice actors offer an inspired interpretation though. The audio sector is impeccable: the effects are of excellent workmanship and the soundtrack alternates intense lyrical pieces with more modern and excited atmospheric pieces, easily passing from the echoes of ancient barrel organs to the strident sounds of electronic music. Comment Paying more than a tribute to the tradition of graphic adventures and thrillers, not without introducing some noteworthy new ideas, Still Life manages to carve out a space of its own in the panorama of titles that currently represent the genre. Its strength is undoubtedly the use of two different settings and styles of play in the service of a single story. The difficulty of the puzzles is not always well calibrated but the variety is guaranteed. The enthralling screenplay, the aggressive cinematographic system and the level of immersion in its dark and disturbing universe make you forget the small graphic flaws and granite linearity that undermine an otherwise impeccable product. Pros: Adult and well-articulated plot Use of two characters Varied and engaging game mechanics Cinematic cutscenes Original and incisive graphics and sound Cons: Fluctuating difficulty level Some drop in quality in cutscenes and animations Extremely linear gameplay and dialogues The art of fear Our ~artist~ at work.", "date": "2005-04-15", "grade": null}
