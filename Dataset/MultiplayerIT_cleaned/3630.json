{"name": "Rainbow Six Siege: Operazione Phantom Sight", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rainbow-six-siege-operazione-phantom-sight-recensione.html", "text": "Rainbow Six Siege: Operation Phantom Sight presents itself with the same formula as Grim Sky (last season last year) and imposes itself as a turning point in the way of understanding the DLCs of the tactical shooter developed in Montreal. As usual, two new operators join the Rainbow team, but this time they do not belong to the same unit nor to the same continent (just as happened with Maverick and Clash). Nkk, the ~Phantom~ of the title, is the Danish assailant who is a member of the Jaeger Corps; the ~Sight~, on the other hand, refers to Warden, an experienced defender from the United States and belonging to the Secret Service. This unusual format of Siege updates will be re-proposed at least until the end of Year 4 and does not include the introduction of new maps: with Phantom Sight, specifically, the development team preferred to focus on a profound reworking of Caf Dostoevsky. This decision, however, certainly did not surprise us: Ubisoft had already been clear at the time of the presentation of the Road Map, during the last Six Invitational, and had shown us part of the changes coming to the Russian location. We also know that a restyling of this type will also affect Kanal and Amusement Park, respectively at the beginning of the third and fourth seasons of this year. The absence of the ~revolutionary content~ could make fans of the title turn up their noses, but even if the remaining two maps were to be improved as much as happened with Caf, we are sure that they would be appreciated in the same way (and, perhaps, even more ) of the introduction of a new scenario. As promised at the release of Burnt Horizon, the punishment system for players considered ~toxic~ and, in particular, for teamkillers, has been enhanced and perfected where necessary, going to touch the damage inflicted through explosions, toxic gases and gadgets in general. In our opinion, Reverse Friendly Fire is a functional and not overly invasive solution, but it can and must be further improved. At the moment, in fact, the mechanics affect the individual player, but fail to limit enough the inappropriate attitudes that can occur when you are placed in lobbies whose members organize themselves to ruin the gaming experience of the unfortunate person on duty. However, the developers are fully aware of this and will continue to monitor the entire system to make further changes. The most discussed novelty certainly concerns the update to the Ranked scenario list. In order to make the environment more competitive, Ubisoft has made a decision that defining ~courageous~ would be an understatement: no more Presidio or Rescue, in Ranked only Bomba (ex-Bomb squad) will be played. Operation Phantom Sight, therefore, may not be innovative due to the small amount of unpublished content, but it certainly is due to the powerful turn made with the clear aim of showing players (casual and otherwise) the eSport side of the home title ubisoft. Nkk & Warden: the Ghost and the Vision The grand introductions of new operators have become the cornerstone of each season. Ubisoft is getting us used to a large characterization of the characters, which are structured with a well-defined background. As much as we liked it, the presence of all this lore (especially in the last year) at times made us suspicious and perhaps it found an explanation in the recent announcement of a new chapter in the Tom Clancy saga: Rainbow Six Quarantine. Even in the case of Nkk and Warden, the writers have not skimped on the information inserted within their respective biographies. The two specialists share a propensity for delicate situations where infiltration and espionage skills are extremely necessary. In fact, Nkk's true identity remains unknown, but it is suspected that he may have something to do with the Danish royal family. The new attacker can take advantage of a high-tech gadget, which works similar to Vigil's ERC-7. We're talking about the HEL Presence Reducer, a glove accessory that makes the Dane invisible to the cameras and reduces the noise produced, a mechanic also seen with the Caveira Padfoot. In fact, Nkk is very reminiscent of the Brazilian in her movements and, due to her very particular uniform, she is even more terrifying. Unlike the latter, however, it is not forced to use the pistol when the HEL is activated, but can also move with the primary weapon. Although she may seem very agile and light from the outside, the operator falls into the group of specialists with Armor 2 and Speed 2. The equipment seems to have already been seen ... perhaps because all the paraphernalia at his disposal was galready present in the game. As for the primaries, in fact, Nkk can choose between a silenced SIX12 shotgun and an FMG9. No assault rifle and, therefore, no ACOG for the female assailant. The decision, therefore, is based solely on the style of play you prefer: the shotgun is recommended in small maps and for players who prefer to take advantage of close-up firefights, otherwise it is better to opt for the machine gun. On the secondary, however, there is little to think about: the D50 (which now also allows you to accessorise the silencer) wins hands down on the 5.7 USG. The Dane has been theorized with Breaking Charges and Claymores, but, at least at the beginning of the season, the latter will be replaced by Flashbangs, in order to avoid the tedious problems that afflict mines that can be placed for a month now. Ubisoft, however, has guaranteed the release of the fix during the season and, at that point, will proceed with the reinstatement of the Claymore. His unique ability features numerous interactions with the environment and other gadgets. The assailant is totally invisible to the cameras until she moves at normal speed or switches weapons; all other movements, such as running and crossing Barbed Wire or a Lesion Mina Gu, produce some sort of easily recognizable noise. Nkk cannot say that she has a good relationship with drones: if framed by those hacked by Mozzie or by Echo's Yokai, she produces a noise in the image (similar to that caused by Vigil's ERC-7). Collinn ~Warden~ McKinley is the balanced mix between Commissioner Gordon, James Bond and Walter White. Bodyguard of the highest political authorities of his country, he also enjoys a certain reputation as a womanizer. The special agent obviously wears Kevlar and this justifies his heavy armor and reduced speed to a minimum. The Glance Smart Glasses draw heavily from Ying's abilities, allowing the American defender to be immune to all sorts of flashes (when already active) or to instantly cancel the effect, and of Glaz, making it possible to see through the smoke bombs (as long as you stay still on the spot). Also in this case the same reasoning applied to the new Danish attacker is valid: Warden has at his disposal an equipment made up of components already present in Siege. Shotgun M590A1 and MPX are the two alternatives for the primary weapon, while P-10C and SMG12 are the secondary ones. Despite the anchor tonnage, therefore, the American defender cannot take advantage of the ACOG and, on the contrary, thanks to his ability, he lends himself to being played from outside. Barbed Wire and Mobile Shield are the secondary gadgets, but a bit like what happened with Nkk's Claymore, again due to a bug, Warden is also affected by a change that sees the Impact Grenades temporarily replace the shield (at least until when the fix patch is released). Obviously, counters cannot be missing: Thatcher's EMP and IQ Detector must be absolutely avoided! With Phantom Sight, as far as the two new operators are concerned, Ubisoft has decided to move in the diametrically opposite direction to that taken in the previous season: while Mozzie and Gridlock serve to give further information to their teammates, Nkk and Warden go to reduce the certainties of the opposing team. It will be interesting to analyze their inclusion in the game meta since, at least at first glance, the weapons supplied do not make them attractive enough choices. ~Caf~ break The work put into one of the most iconic maps of the title is commendable. An absolutely necessary restyling, since Caf Dostoevsky was the last location, available in the Ranked pool, to present only 3 sites in Bomb mode. The development team, however, did not limit itself to adding a new one (that of Sala Camino - Sala Lettura), but decided to better balance the entire structure, making it more articulated, but also clearly balanced. Although the building, from the outside, does not seem changed at all, a careful look at the repositioning of some windows and the presence of new covers already allows us to understand Ubisoft's painstaking operation: reduced risk of spawn kill for attackers and, at the same time, much more homogeneous interior lighting. Proceeding from top to bottom, on the roof we come across a second trapdoor, not far from the first, which gives direct access to the new wing of the Cigar Shop. The mezzanine here is larger and more defensible, above all thanks to the expansion of the balcony on both sides and the modification of the skylight. You can also stop the annoying music from the speakers in the Cigar Lounge: just fire a shot to be able to cut out the concertclassical music and to finally be able to hear the noises produced by the opponents. The first floor is the one that has undergone the least amount of retouching, all aimed primarily at making the Reading Room area more impregnable. From the removal of one of the large windows in the main hall, to the closing of the Retro Bar hatch, to the total masonry of some walls (previously destructible), these changes have made the new site a very valid option. On the ground floor, on the other hand, it is difficult to settle in immediately: a few games are needed before you can get a complete view of the renovation. Access from the main entrance takes us into a mini lobby complete with a window onto the brand new cloakroom and which, as soon as we go beyond it, offers us a living room divided into two areas, thanks to the repositioning of the main stairs. The most important changes, however, certainly concern the Kitchen, reworked in order to contain both bombs: we can say ~goodbye~ to the plant on the bakery door! Seeing the result achieved, we can only be hopeful for the long-awaited return of Kanal, scheduled for next season, and for the makeover of the Amusement Park. With Caf Dostoevskij, the development team has shown that they have a clear understanding of the player's needs in terms of destructibility and balance between attack and defense. Everyone in the Pro League! We called it a ~courageous decision~ since setting Ranked only and solely on Bomb mode was not a risk-free move... on the contrary! We have known Ubisoft's intentions for some time: to bring the game community to better appreciate the competitive side of Siege. Precisely in view of this, the wording ~BETA~ present until a few days ago in the Ranked menu has finally been removed and the Pick&Ban has also appeared in this update, welcomed with great enthusiasm by the majority of players. The complete removal of Presidium and Rescue from the Ranked scenarios list, on the contrary, has unleashed the ire of many players (especially the more ~casual~ ones), who have felt forcefully dragged out of their comfort zone. Until the end of Burnt Horizon, in fact, it was always possible to choose the preferred mode in complete autonomy and we understand how much a sudden change of this magnitude can leave us disoriented. If then, to this, we also add the introduction of the Attack-Defense rotation over 3 rounds... the omelette is done! In fact, the feedback from players who have never felt any interest in the competitive scene has not been at all lenient or flattering. It would have been the case, perhaps, to try a more gradual approach, allowing Siege fans to adapt over the course of an entire season, perhaps removing one mode at a time. Ultimately, however, the advantages of such a choice are obvious: significantly reduced matchmaking times and homologation of the ranks achieved by the players. Competing in a single mode means competing on equal terms, without any kind of advantage, within the global placement rankings, inserted in special screens precisely with the arrival of Phantom Sight.", "date": "2019-06-14", "grade": "7.8"}
