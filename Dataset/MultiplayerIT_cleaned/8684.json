{"name": "Vessel", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/100362-vessel-dal-liquido-primordiale-a-mondi-steampunk.html", "text": "The life of a scientist lasts: in the continuous pursuit of progress, playing God can have its side effects, and a couple of Asimovian laws are not enough because, and science fiction enthusiasts know it well, if something can go wrong it will for sure. Even the bewildered Professor Arkwright knows it well, an inventor by trade but who dresses like an Ian Solo who, fed up with interstellar travel, has begun to be a plumber. The protagonist of Vessel has earned a certain fame after using common liquids to create the Fluro, cyclopean beings capable of replacing man in the most difficult labor jobs. Never premise was so obvious: for some unknown reason, the harmless Fluro have begun to behave in a strange way, to replicate autonomously and to create havoc all over the world, leading Professor Arkwright to investigate and roll up his sleeves in the eight hours that make up the puzzle game that marks the debut of the US team Strange Loop Games. Water balloon time Made over three years by a small group of developers from the late Pandemic Studios, Vessel tries to offer extremely original mechanics and puzzles even though it is by no means the first puzzle based on the physics of fluids. ~The goal that our team wanted to pursue with Vessel,~ explains team founder John Krajewski, ~is to put the power of modern hardware at the service of gameplay, and not just graphics~. All this translates into a strong 2D platform component which, as in Braid, marries and mixes perfectly with the countless puzzles scattered along the various game levels. Professor Arkwright is guided directly via keyboard and mouse, and with him you jump from platform to platform, climb stairs and cling to levers and handholds. Then you jump straight into a pool of water, and the great work of the authors immediately catches your eye in making the engine linked to the physics of liquids as credible and dynamic as possible: based on the height of the jump, the angle and at the point of impact we note that the sketches are always different, but the usefulness of such a complex technology in a two-dimensional indie game sold at a budget price is justified by the fact that all the puzzles in the game revolve around the behavior of water, washes and various juices. A few moments from the start and you get to know the Fluro, the bizarre creatures with which you find yourself interacting for the entire duration of the adventure in an increasingly elaborate way. At first we limit ourselves to conducting the water in special machines to create a Fluro that activates levers and switches for us, while later it is possible to carry them with us or use a gun capable of spraying particular liquids; the eye, the real nucleus of these creatures, is able to attract the surrounding fluids like a magnet, a feature that is useful, for example, when the direction of a water flow needs to be slightly shifted. The more you progress in the game, the more you come into contact with new types of Fluro, each characterized by a particular behavior with which to become familiar in order to overcome a particular puzzle: some of these move, for example, towards illuminated lamps, others tend to hole up in dark places, and it is when more Fluros together have to interact with each other that the puzzles begin to get really complex. As if that weren't enough, from time to time it is required to combine different liquids to cause chemical reactions, and for example putting lava in contact with water allows you to obtain a cloud of steam. With all these variables at play, it should be clear how deep Vessel's puzzles are capable of offering, yet, as we've already said, something can go wrong: the Fluro artificial intelligence occasionally misfires, and in fortunately rare moments happen to see them stuck in one point of the scenario or, worse still, wandering back and forth before deciding which switch to move towards. Nothing serious, mind you, also because the absence of limits and the possibility of eliminating a Fluro simply by jumping on its head allows you to never get stuck due to a bug with the artificial intelligence routines. If the goodness of the puzzle design and game mechanics represents Vessel's strength, the same amount of attention has been paid by the guys from Strange Loop to the aesthetic component of the work. It is no coincidence that the developers have drawn inspiration from Braid and Limbo, not so much for the gameplay ideas, but for the ability of the respective authors to pursue a particular and wonderful artistic vision. Turning a blind eye to some sporadic slows downment, the fascinating steampunk settings and the particular artistic style make Vessel a simply splendid game to see, thanks also to a dynamic camera that continuously tries to emphasize the passages from narrow places to large and complex rooms: memorable is the moment in which from the laboratory by Arkwright you descend into the depths of a huge mine clinging to a sort of pulley, with the camera constantly moving away and getting closer going hand in hand with the excellent soundtrack by Jon Hopkins, musician and producer who has collaborated with artists of the likes of Brian Eno, Imogen Heap and Coldplay.", "date": "2012-03-13", "grade": "8.8"}
