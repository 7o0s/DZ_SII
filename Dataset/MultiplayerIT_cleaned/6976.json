However, having the field a little freer from cumbersome blockbusters is obviously not a guarantee of success, because the quality of the production remains a fundamental and unavoidable requirement. Siesta Fiesta fortunately seems to have all the credentials, starting from an idea that is solid and partly original at the same time. Siesta Fiesta is a more than pleasant reinterpretation of the classic Breakout formula The 3D effect Almost completely absent, it even appears harmful making the image less defined at the price of a minimum depth effect. Much better to leave it off. In fact, the title created by Mojo Bones develops on the foundations of the Breakout formula and its countless clones: in practice you have to bounce a ball on a bar controlled by the player to destroy the blocks on the screen. Very simple, immediate and quickly understandable. Even the developers have made an effort to imagine a plot in which the protagonist, a certain Siesta, planning a nap instead finds himself falling into a very deep sleep, during which he does not notice that his bed is traveling towards a island populated by bizarre and colorful creatures called Fiesta. And it is precisely here that Siesta, always continuing to sleep, takes the form of a ball destined to bounce on her bed, controlled by the player via analog, directional cross or stylus. Pure madness that in any case serves no purpose other than to give a justification to what happens on the screen, which as mentioned at the beginning collects with both hands from the gameplay of Breakout. Nonetheless, Siesta Fiesta also introduces some variations on the theme that contribute to giving freshness to the product, starting with the absence of the fixed screen replaced by a forced lateral scrolling, and the possibility of adding further momentum to the ball's bounce by pressing the A key to moment of impact with the bed. First of all, this choice produces a greater dynamism in the development of the levels, which can thus guarantee a remarkable variety of situations: the block structures, while never excessively complex, are presented in such a way as to always require a certain level of analysis and evaluation as to what is the best way to attack them. Yes, because obviously the challenge lies not only in trying to clean up the screens, but in building combos such as to increase the score to thus obtain a medal: if bronze is within everyone's reach and silver requires a little effort, gold takes the proverbial seven shirts and several tries. Too bad that the effort is not repaid, making everything a bit of an end in itself: there are no particular extras to unlock or rankings, which is why the motivations tend to be lacking. Even from a purely aesthetic point of view, something more could have been done to underline the creation of the best combinations so as to further enhance the player's efforts. Despite this, the good - albeit inconstant - care in the level design is evident above all for the variety that the developers have tried to guarantee, not only with blocks of different appearance and texture, but also with puzzle elements and variations on the main theme such as time and boss fights. The latter, positioned at the end of each of the eight worlds (for a total of 64 levels), also require a minimum of reflection and strategy to be completed. The control system, on the other hand, despite the various options described at the beginning, necessarily results in the use of the stylus which is actually the only way to guarantee the reactivity and speed necessary to support the pace of the game. The graphic component is quite pleasant, very colorful and with a style that is somewhat reminiscent of Rayman, although it cannot boast a characterization of the characters that is not even remotely comparable. However, the variety of settings is remarkable, which helps to make the progression fresh and pleasant.", "date": "2014-07-31", "grade": "7.3"}
