{"name": "Patrician III: L'impero dei Mari", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/patrician-iii-limpero-dei-mari.html", "text": "Unity is strength The strong point of many strategy games, and probably the aspect for which this genre of games attract an increasingly vast pool of users, is a captivating game system that fits perfectly into a precise historical context. In PIII we will deal with various cities belonging to the famous Hanseatic League. The most powerful nations have always accumulated glory and wealth knowing how to make the most of a dense network of trade and maritime trade routes. A role of primary importance was played by the cities belonging to the Hanseatic League established in the early thirteenth century among many cities in northern Germany, the Netherlands, England and the large port cities of the Baltic Sea. Among these, the German Lubeck stood out, which for many years served as the capital of this congregation of states. The Hanseatic League experienced periods of great prestige and in the states belonging to this union there was a notable development in the agricultural field and an improvement in industrial techniques. Although the league was founded for exclusively economic purposes, the states saw important goals from a socio-economic and cultural point of view. The Hanseatic League acquired such prestige that many European rulers, intimidated by its stability and economic power, made pacts and agreements with it. Furthermore, due to its democratic system, combined with the economic development constituted by its network of relations and commercial exchanges, the Hanseatic League is considered one of the forerunners of the current European Union. PIII is placed in the middle of this golden age in which it will be up to us, with our actions to determine the prestige of the city we have chosen as our commercial stronghold until the complete domination of all the seas. Again at home After opening the rich game package (praise for the richness of the contents and for the complete localization, including the excellent manual in Italian and entirely in color) and launching the game, from the first moments we will notice that substantial differences, from the he last time we sailed the northern seas, they don't seem to be there. The introduction itself is very reminiscent of the one already seen a couple of years ago in the previous Patrician and also the initial menu, provided you have played PII, will reserve us very few surprises. In fact, also according to the developers, the most substantial changes have been made ~under the skin~, thanks to the renewed game engine called, with no little pride, ~P III Engine~. As usual, we will be able to choose whether to start with a little exciting tutorial, whether to embark on a free game with victory objectives chosen by ourselves, whether to undertake one of the different campaigns offered by the game and, lastly, whether to play an exciting (but decidedly long, it should be said) multiplayer challenge. How to get rich PIII's graphics are strictly two-dimensional. From time to time we will be able to witness, on the occasion of certain ~historical~ events or player choices, various animations - relegated to a fairly small screen pane - in pre-calculated 3D, but the graphic style of the entire title is still firmly anchored to the dear old Bitmap graphics. In short, as in any self-respecting management software, graphics and sound are certainly not the strong point of the entire production. The unfolding of the game will mainly evolve in the general map of the ports of the Hanseatic League, where we will plan the routes of our ships, and in the isometric view of the various cities where we will decide our commercial strategies and more. At the beginning of the game, depending on the scenario chosen, or the game mode undertaken, we will start with a certain number of commercial offices and ships (usually small but fast schooners) that we can use to start trading goods. It must be said right now that if the game appears clearly oriented towards a rather ~mercantile~ style (exchange of goods with other ports, establishment of commercial routes, management of public or private convoys and so on) one of the novelties of this PIII consists precisely in the possibility of undertaking new careers and influencing even more the destiny of one's city of residence and also of the entire Hanseatic League. Age Of Seas. After the experience of naval battles in real time, with PIII we are witnessing the introduction of new gameplay elements typical of the most famous RTS. Once you become mayor of your city, for example, it will be possible, among other things, to expand the city walls, recruit new garrisons, ororganize the city's defenses to prepare to face the attacks of marauders greedy by the wealth of our domain. Still thanks to the new features of this PIII, however, we will be able to decide to let ourselves be tempted by the dark side of force and abandon the path of commerce to reach wealth through the shortcut of crime. We will thus be able to become pirates ourselves or perhaps, to try not to ruin the reputation of our name, hire some unscrupulous captain and then maneuver him in the shadows. But even if we remain simple markets, we assure you that there will never be a lack of opportunities to make some extra money in a not exactly legal way. Starting from the still tolerated but frowned upon loan sharking, up to the recycling of stolen goods or the rental of space in our warehouses, for the storage of material of dubious origin. One of the major strengths of the series therefore, that of the countless choices given to the player, seems to have been even more taken care of. Even the feeling of identification with our - as RPG enthusiasts would say - player character is even more accentuated. The possibility of getting married and having children, that of being able to aspire to a political career, perhaps first by entering the good salons of society with donations to the church or perhaps thanks to the organization of sumptuous village fairs, are all things that can only help enter our share of thriving medieval merchant. Who starts well... When it comes to business, you don't mess around, so here are some useful tips to extricate yourself from the hostile field of commerce. When you carry out your trades, keep in mind to bring three goods to your city that must never be missing: beer, cereals and fish. Heed this advice as it would be witty if you yourself were the major purveyors of these goods throughout the empire of the seas. Another very profitable type of trade is that of work tools, which are in demand in almost all the cities belonging to the Hanseatic League. Lubeck is a large producer but has to import the raw material, iron, from Oslo. Remember instead that Stockholm, unlike its German ~partner~, has large deposits of excellent iron to give life to a thriving trade of excellent tools for the job. Don't forget to visit London and Bruges from time to time as they will have an excellent variety of cheap spices on their market. These are just a few but useful tips that, together with your cunning, will pave the way for your glorious goal: to become the Governor of the Hanseatic League, the undisputed master of all the seas. Good luck! The soul of business... Up to now we have mentioned a small part of the vast opportunities offered by this new Ascaron title, especially in what is still the heart of this game, namely the very accurate trading simulation. So accurate that, just to give you a taste, the cycle of the seasons as well as influencing the purely aesthetic aspect of the game and not only (from the fact that our cities will be covered with snow up to the possibility of having ships blocked in port due to of the freezing of the waters of the port) will ensure that some goods are more or less in demand by the various markets, forcing us to store some of them during the summer to make a profit on them in the harsh winters. The game mechanics are so complex that the difficulty curve, unlike similar titles, appears rather anomalous. If initially managing your trade with a single ship will be quite simple and even satisfying, we will soon realize that with the expansion of our fleet and the birth of new commercial offices in other cities of the League, things will become increasingly difficult. From this point of view, we would have preferred, for example, a more user-friendly and simplified management of automatic trades. But after all, the strength of this game also lies in this, in the possibility of being exploited - even if only marginally - both by the beginner (or almost) and by the more savvy player. Unfortunately we are sorry to note that the game interface does not always help us, not even in the most frequent and trivial operations. More than once we had the impression that with a different interface design certain operations could have been implemented with fewer mouse clicks. Furthermore, even after several hours of play, sometimes it may happen that you no longer remember where it was possible to carry out that particular operation or select that particular option.Comment Patrician III is an immense product, vast and - despite the enormous number of options - cared for in every single aspect. Of course, there are flaws. Among all those that make themselves felt the most are the game interface that can still be improved and, for those who have also played the prequel, a series of innovations which, after all, do not change the gaming experience much. Yet this new edition costs so little (certainly less than many official expansions that are decidedly less full of novelties) that I feel like recommending it without reservations both to all fans of the genre who have missed Patrician II and to all players who have played it and appreciated. Instead, all novices are warned, Patrician III is a truly lavish title of satisfaction, however it requires a lot of effort on the part of the player. However, this commitment will pay off. Pros: Deep and complete title Guaranteed longevity Practically without competitors Low selling price and quality of the packaging Cons: Improved user interface The three-dimensional accelerators of your expensive Graphics Cards will enjoy a more than deserved rest Few real news We return by sea... A little more than two years after the appreciated Patrician II, the Teutonic software house Ascaron takes us back, in grand style, to trade in the North Seas, at the time of the prosperous Hanseatic League. ~Patriciani III: Empire of the Seas~ (henceforth PIII) comes almost as a surprise in a genre where competitors are becoming less and less. Apart from dozens of little more than amateur (or almost) productions, the management game scene for PC is less and less flourishing, mostly leaving the field to the big productions of development houses such as Maxis, FireAxis, Lionhead and very few others. In fact, with the expansion of the average user, almost paradoxically, one of the genres that has helped the videogame market to thrive on the PC platform and which still today represents its exclusive prerogative, gives us fewer and fewer new titles every year. Luckily, the million copies sold by Patrician II serves precisely to demonstrate that, if there ever was any doubt, even less immediate and more profound genres manage to obtain their own share of the market  even quite large  provided be conceived and conceived in a serious and intelligent way. And now let's find out together if ~Patrician III~ will be able to repeat the success of the successful prequel ...", "date": "2003-12-30", "grade": null}
