{"name": "Fifa 2002 World Cup", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-2002-world-cup.html", "text": "Options section Let's start with the ~Options~ section. Various aspects of the game can be prepared: length of the match, player fatigue, the stadium, the choice between day or night (there is no possibility to choose the weather in friendlies), the difficulty which is divided into five levels, even if the first two are really simple; the EA assistant (it advises you during the game when to make substitutions, but it's almost useless), the speed of the game, the severity of the referee (it's advisable to let the computer decide, so it's a surprise to discover the severity of the referee) ; activate or deactivate bookings, offside, injuries and gamepad vibration. The various options regarding the view, such as the camera (there are many different ones, but in any case the best ones remain the classic ~Tele~ and ~Tower~, even if the one on the action of the players is very well done, very close, but still playable), display of score and time, radar and players name. Audio effects, such as commentary, music, game sounds. The last set of options concerns the various game actions, such as the assisted and normal cross mode (there is not a lot of difference, logically the normal one is a moment more controllable by the human player), the modification of the speed of the power indicator and finally a real novelty of this edition that has made many gamers turn up their noses, but which in my opinion is a nice addition: the presence of ~phenomenon~ players for each team. Each team has at least one player who stands out from the others for some ability (running, shooting, passing) and this is indicated (only if the aforementioned mode is activated) by a star above the player during the game. It is therefore possible to know during the game which players are capable of ~changing the tide of the match~, perhaps by shooting a missile from outside the area (the ball, for those who possess this skill, will become fire), perhaps by quickly sprinting into a counterattack (in this case the player with the running ability will be marked as running by a color trail). These options can turn the game into one of those old bar coin-ops, but it doesn't make it any less realistic: it is not possible to score, for example, from midfield even if you kick the ball with the player who has the ability of the maximum shot. This option of the ~stars~ (let's call it that) only wants to facilitate the recognition of those champions present in each team, it does not give them magical powers. Also in the ~Options~ section it is possible to manage the various formations of the national teams present, even if the names of the players, the shirts or the physical characteristics cannot be changed, but only the layout on the field, the formation, the tactics ... The Managerial Area The friendly match can of course be played with up to 4 players (two per team), like the world mode. The national teams present are those that qualified for this year's World Cup, plus other national teams. There are some serious shortcomings, such as Holland, Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria. We repeat, one of the major defects (perhaps the only really heavy one of this edition) is the concentration solely on the final part of the world championship, as if it were only an update of Fifa 2002, thus preventing it from being able to compete with other video games (only in terms of tournaments ) like ISS2 or the upcoming David Beckham Soccer. When choosing the team to play in the world championship, the real qualification date is indicated, its best position in the history of the world championship and finally a number that indicates the team's skill (it goes without saying that France is number one, unfortunately). Let's move on to the game. After choosing the team that will participate in the World Cup, we are projected onto the management screen: we find the matches that have been played that specific day, our real group (for Italy there are Ecuador, Mexico and Croatia, but I haven't doubts you already know), the ability to manage formation, game modules and substitutions before each match. The ~managerial~ part is less manageable and less important than in other games. Fifa is essentially an immediate game, even if it still devotes a decent space to empathize with coaches. We can choose our formation on the field (only 442-451-532-541-343-352-433 available and cannot be modified), as well as deciding how to deploy attack, midfield and defense (for example with the libero, with movements on the flanks and so on). In the ~Strategy~ section we can modify various parameters such as ball management (counterattack, possefixed, neutral) or the defense (bolt, pressing), as well as then deciding who should take penalties, free kicks, corners. Finally, our team, the starters and the reserves: each champion, as mentioned before, is distinguished by a star (if we have activated the relative mode, which I repeat, it does not transform the player into a superman but only allows his immediate identification) . The graphics Having fixed the parameters of the team, let's move on to the match. While we wait for loading, the image of the stadium in which we will play scrolls, accompanied by a map of the state (Korea or Japan) with the city in which we will be located indicated. The presentation of the match is really excellent (even exaggerated), the stadiums (all those of the World Cup, exactly 20) are very detailed in every aspect, the fans are not wooden silhouettes, but real people who move, jump and cheer; moreover you can glimpse the shots of the photographers, the confetti thrown from the stands and the various flags of the national teams present in the match in question and finally the two giant ~aliens~, mascots of the World Cup, always present. Then in the evening, a laser reproduces the colored silhouette of the World Cup on the playing field. The players enter, usual films with the preparation of the players. The details of the physique and face are absolutely perfect, you can recognize the various players, even during the game, so realistic are the somatic features. The pitch was also created very well, as was the official ball and the uniforms of the various national teams (only the name of the player behind the shirt is missing, there is only the number). To complete the description of the graphic detail, we conclude with the linesmen who follow all the various actions at the edge of the field and, if the ball goes out, are ready to report it: the only flaw is the fact that they don't raise their arm with the flag regulations that they support with their left hand, but raise their arm without a flag, a negligible but strange technical defect. The same graphic precision applies to the referee who follows each match (occasionally he will also disturb the action with his presence, being hit by the ball) realistically right in his actions (he too makes mistakes). On the edges of the field also the various technical commissioners and the benches, in motion. As for the physics of player movement: very satisfying. The players move naturally, the passes, lobs and shots are realistic, as are the slides, tackles and falls (during the replay of the fouls, the falls are well done, but the clash between the two players, even if during game action, they are really perfect). The same goes for headers, with the player's neck turning to give spin to the ball, as with volleys. The goalkeepers also dive in a realistic way, even if (as indeed also real goalkeepers) occasionally make ducks. The match Let's move on to the actual game. The ball bounces very well, it doesn't take strange trajectories, but it moves like in reality. As always, Fifa's flaw, when running with the ball, it doesn't seem to move because it is hit by the player's feet, but always remains a few millimeters from the athlete. Even if you don't notice it during the game, it is still a defect, even if we understand it must be difficult for programmers to eliminate. Passes, lobs and shots are all regulated by a bar which indicates, based on how long the relative button is pressed, the power, as well as for headers and volleys. Another defect concerns the aerial game: even if created in an impeccable way, as in the previous versions, one cannot decide whether to make a header or a bicycle kick (for example, for 2000 euros, double-clicking the shot button a bicycle kick, a single click, a header), but is decided by the computer based on the space available to the player when the ball is received. A limitation that does not allow you to measure the power of the shot, since if it is a header, even at maximum power it will not go out, but if the player stops the ball with his chest and then kicks, if we, waiting for the ball , we had filled the power bar in view of a header, we risk sending the ball out. The trajectory of the ball is completely decided by us, in fact we will often have to send the shot wide or pass to the opponents: a fact that definitely increases realism. A very small flaw also in this area:it is true that we decide the trajectory, but the ball always has a slight impact, which is negligible in any case. Lobs can easily be used to jump the opponent or to mock the outgoing goalkeeper. The feints available are the classic step-over ones, in addition to the one-two easily executable with the right stick, which indicates the direction of the triangle. New to this edition are the dribbles that can be performed by pressing the right stick and then keeping a certain power bar always active by alternately pressing the sticks and the black and white buttons. It is therefore possible to dribble with the feet, the thighs, the head and make real evolutions to mock one's opponent and also be able to shoot on the fly. The penalties are marked by the classic arrow for the direction of the shot. Penalties don't have crosshairs like in other games which makes shooting or blocking unrealistic. Everything is decided by luck, but also by the ability to shoot with the right power and the right aim; the same goes for the goalkeeper, you need to know how to dive in the right direction, paying attention to the opponent's feet and above all to where he is looking at the moment of shooting: probably an intentional fault, but he always kicks in the direction he is looking at a second before the shot. TO THE The AI is very good, has good ball management and makes really decisive raids and counterattacks. In the same way he closes well in defense (in any case it depends from team to team) and it is no longer sufficient to make a cross and hit the header: in most cases it will be the opposing defender who arrives first and will not always throw the ball close to the area thus allowing a recovery and a goal; often throws her out or away from the area. The goalkeeper comes out with his fists to remove the ball to a ~safe~ distance which prevents the classic ~shot into an empty net~. External elements The cheering from the stadium is always present and accompanies the various actions: if the player misses a goal, the boos and disappointment arrive, as does the applause when he scores or there is a goal opportunity. Then the choirs, drums and trumpets to increase the immersion in the stadium. At the end of the game, perhaps exaggerated for a moment but of sure effect, the fireworks, the confetti and the celebrations always excellently carried out, such as the grimaces of the player who misses a chance and the exultation after scoring. Replays are ubiquitous after fouls, missed chances and after goals; all action taken from various angles. Unfortunately, the possibility of saving the replays of the best goals is missing. The ~Bonus Materials~ section allows you to see some films in English about the passion for football (with interviews with various fans, including Italians: a Lazio, a Roman and a traffic warden), the presentation of the two host countries, some comments from the supporters of some national teams, an interview with the commentator John Motson, and preview titles from Ea Sports (Fifa 2002, F1 2002, Nba Live, Madden, NHL 2002). In conclusion An excellently made game in all respects, from the graphics (truly incomparable) to the very real playability, to the managerial management, less technical than other games, but sufficient to make the player identify with the difficult task of national coach. The only real flaw of the game is its limitation in terms of cups and tournaments: the World Cup prevails over everything. But unlike, for example, a Euro 2000 dedicated only to the European Championships, but full of statistics of the various national teams, the possibility of playing the great finals of the European Championships of past years, the training section... this FIFA World Cup is dedicated solely to the World Championship final. However, it remains an excellent game waiting for David Beckham Soccer, which promises to be well planned right now, and the next Fifa 2003. Pros: Ultra-detailed graphics Official licenses of the World Cup Real ball management Very real player movements Cons: Only, always and only World Championships Little complex management area Lack of localization of the software in Italian Lack of an editor Materials: Screenshots Tips General Presentation Also this year, on the occasion of the World Cup, EA Sports takes home all the official football licenses.
