In particular, a dark force awakened after centuries that the Guardian Owls have perceived again. However, it is also the great adventure of NAPS Team, a small Italian studio made up of just three people who wanted to try their hand at a particularly ambitious project, putting together a Studio Ghibli-style aesthetics, enhanced by excellent cel shading graphics, and atmospheres close to The Legend of Zelda series, to then launch the game on five platforms simultaneously. Let's find out about this ambitious project in the review of Baldo: The Guardian Owls. History Baldo: The Guardian Owls, one of the first villages you will find yourself visiting As mentioned at the beginning, the story of Baldo: The Guardian Owls takes up a bit the tradition of the predestined young hero and from this point of view it doesn't reserve any particular surprises, while sparing itself the trouble of introducing who knows what narrative assumptions and starting immediately with head down with the protagonists of the adventure and the first, simple tasks they will have to deal with. There is obviously a lot of Hayao Miyazaki in the simplicity with which the interactions between the characters are represented, the trio that is formed closely resembles that of Conan the boy from the future and these associations, although not explicit, allow the game to do some economy on the actual development of the plot. However, albeit perhaps in an unconventional way and linked to frankly dated solutions, this component is present and unfolds slowly and progressively, discovery after discovery, in the encounter with new figures and in the exploration of new places to add to a map that immediately appears quite extensive. In a maze of textual dialogues to which attention must be paid (this is another thing that for years now we have been asked very little to do), the small animated sequences stand out for their communicative capacity and demonstrate, as mentioned above, how much the mix created by NAPS Team works and is able to give satisfaction in the end. Gameplay Baldo: The Guardian Owls, one of the many shops that we will find along the way Surrounded by some fetch quests that frankly we would not have chosen for the introductory phase of the game due to their excessive slowness and cumbersomeness, the first assignment we will have to deal with in Baldo: The Guardian Owls concerns the discovery of a hidden galleon  la Goonies, that the protagonist's grandfather (here again Conan) is convinced he is near the village. Without the equipment and skills that we will be able to acquire only a few hours later, we will therefore find ourselves exploring caves and large rooms, without the support of any indication and with the only schematic representation of the area we are in and of any doors present, whether they are blocked or open. A declaration of intent made gameplay, but certainly not the best way to start an adventure in 2021. Baldo: The Guardian Owls, Luna and her inevitable smile In fact, the distortions of a system closer to that of the barely discreet Oceanhorn: Monster of Uncharted Seas catch the eye immediately than to the elegance of Zelda, in which the game over is managed in a questionable way with respect to its actual meaning (yes dies, yes, but then you're right back to where you were before it happened) and hints at the lack of boundaries and refinements that would certainly have made the experience less frustrating. which we were no longer used to; but, above all, there are unexpected mechanics, which the game doesn't clarify (in fact, the game basically doesn't clarify anything) and which turn out to be decisive, only that they have to be looked for, tested in the ambit of a damned approximate trial & error that looks like a roller coaster ride. Baldo: The Guardian Owls and a mobile platform How discouraging to shoot the scenario for the umpteenth time and with the usual slowness; but how much satisfaction in having understood that the ancient vase shouldn't have been saved, but thrown against a lever after having taken it with us on board a small boat which otherwise would have stopped halfway through. And speaking of vases, who knew it would be possible to throw one over a fence to press a button on the ground? Or that you could place another one on the ground, at a height difference, and climb on it to overcome the obstacle? Baldo: The Guardian Owls has a lot of problems that go beyond thepurely technical aspect, glitches and bugs (sometimes quite serious, which have further slowed down our progress with the game), but in its so antiquated and ruthless structure there is no doubt that there are very valid intuitions, capable of repaying the frustration and discouragement of many moments, or the exhausting backtracking (thankfully then the ability to teleport to already discovered areas of the map comes to the rescue), with a flash of joyful satisfaction. Baldo: The Guardian Owls, one of many forest crossings However, desire and patience are needed, a lot. When Baldo finally comes into possession of a sword to fight with monsters and tentacles present along the way, possibly performing a somersault with a jab which is very useful when you want to take your opponents by surprise, things are already starting to take on different contours. It turns out practically by accident that the character can also wield a shield, and so the most complicated duels suddenly become within our reach. Other abilities are added to the repertoire during the course of the campaign, but these are often impromptu discoveries: if you come across them, Well; if you lose them along the way, they turn into further, frustrating dead times in which you desperately look for an indication on what to do among the descriptions of the quests unlocked up to that moment. We don't know how intentionally this lack of indications or the inability to communicate them effectively is, but the result is inevitably that of creating a divide between those who want to give Baldo: The Guardian Owls their time and those who prefer to devote themselves to an experience more respectful from this point of view. Technical realization Baldo: The Guardian Owls, another really cool scenario It is obviously a pity that the game has such a clear and severe design, so slow and cumbersome in many aspects, because in terms of technical realization it must be said that the NAPS Team guys have done a small miracle. The cel shading was obviously the best solution to visually represent a tribute to the works of Studio Ghibli, and we can say that the goal has been achieved in a surprising way. The characters, the animations, the richness of the settings, but also the excellent column sound contribute to immerse us in the world of Baldo and undoubtedly represent a valid reason not to abandon the game at the first difficulty, but to take a break, maybe think a bit, get back into the role of the young hero and finally find the square to move forward.", "date": "2021-09-04", "grade": "7.0"}
