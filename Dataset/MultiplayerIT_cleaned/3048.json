It is a genre that has dominated the mobile sector for years, only to experience an inexorable decline given by the physiological saturation of the market, but evidently there is still someone convinced that the solution can work, presented moreover without particular additions or variations to the standard formula. The new Spongebob game is in fact very canonical, if it weren't for the charisma of its characters and the world of the Nickelodeon series which still manages to stand out and give a remarkable identity to the whole. Beyond some ideas given by the transformations of the protagonist, the gameplay does not offer noteworthy solutions compared to what has been seen so far, but the presence of Spongebob's underwater world manages if nothing else to bring out pleasant levels and funny situations. The story is obviously just a pretext to kick off a mad chase through the underwater settings: the usual evil genius, Sheldon J. Plankton, has come up with a new attack on the serenity of Bikini Bottom, stealing the secret recipe of Krabby Patty and , in order not to miss anything, even deciding to kidnap all of Spongebob's friends, forcing our beloved hero with boxy pants to embark on an epic adventure to restore peace in the depths of the sea. The Nickelodeon license allows you to take advantage of the original animations of the cartoon for the introduction and cutscenes, which helps to recreate the unmistakable atmosphere of Stephen Hillenburg's stories in the game, actually the greatest strength of the game. entire production, while for the rest it seems to take a real dive into the mobile panorama of a few years ago. Spongebob auto race The gameplay of SpongeBob: Patty Assault precisely follows the classic standard of endless runner games, or rather auto-runner, which in fact are generally distinguished from the first by a greater complexity in the structure of the levels. In fact, the mechanics are more similar to Super Mario Run rather than Temple Run: the control over the character is greater, with the possibility of making Spongebob change direction as well as making him jump and perform accelerations with which he can knock down enemies and obstacles. This greater possibility of control is reflected in a more complex level design, with the presence of forks and different roads to explore, which also assume a certain replay value in case you try to get all the collectibles. In any case, the gameplay remains somewhat simplistic, simply requiring you to get to the end of the levels by jumping or accelerating with the right timing and possibly collecting all the coins and palettes scattered around, exactly according to the simplified platform model that made this famous particular sub-genre. There is also some characteristic element, which manages to shake up a structure that is otherwise very anchored to the hackneyed standards of the genre in question: during the levels it is possible to obtain transformations that change Spongebob's appearance and trigger some changes to the gameplay given by new movement possibilities, but they are rather short phases and which in any case do not generate particular upheavals in the basic structure. Much of the success of the auto-runners is given by the perfect way in which they adapt to the control system of touch screen devices , being in fact studied above all from this and SpongeBob: Patty Patty is no exception. The protagonist is managed with short and simple touches on the screen, using only one hand and thus also meeting the use on the move that is typical of mobile platforms, only this is not exactly flawless. Also based on the feedback collected online, it seems that the game works perfectly on the most modern and performing devices but has some problems on those that are not very recent, but are not even considered ~old~, such as the iPads of two or three years ago, on which you notice a certain delay in response to commands, as we have directly noticed. These are fractions of a second, but they are enough to somewhat ruin the gaming experience in a gameplay entirely focused on timing, hoping for any subsequent fixes through patches. Based on the original drawings and animations, the graphics of SpongeBob: APatty Bash certainly cannot disappoint and is in fact a particularly prominent element throughout the game. The appearance seems to be a direct evolution of flash or HTML5 productions, of which Nickelodeon has a vast catalog, but it is precisely what one would expect from a SpongeBob game, precisely reproducing the 2D drawn world of the series, even if something more on the front of the variety of settings could have been done, counting on about six settings in total.", "date": "2020-06-09", "grade": "6.0"}
