{"name": "Restaurant Empire", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/restaurant-empire.html", "text": "As you may have already understood, in Restaurant Empire we will have the task of building, organizing and maintaining a chain of restaurants in every detail: from the furniture, to the staff, to the menu, to customer relations. To do this, we can choose between two different modes: quick game and adventure. In the quick game freedom is practically absolute, and it is even possible to decide the starting budget. There are no objectives, and this allows the player to freely indulge in the creation of his own restaurants in any of the three cities present in the game (Paris, Rome and Los Angeles), with the only concern of making ends meet. The adventure mode, on the other hand, is the true heart of Restaurant Empire: a maxi tutorial, in which the various aspects of the game are proposed and explained through 18 scenarios connected to each other by a simple but pleasant plot. We will take on the role of Armand Le Beau, a young chef who has just graduated from the French cooking academy who, armed only with a great passion for food, a little money, and his uncle's old, now closed restaurant, decides to try his climbing the restaurant world. To make it triumph we will have to overcome all kinds of difficulties: economic, political, even love affairs, up to the dirty tricks of the giant Omnifood who does not hesitate to use genetically modified ingredients in order to win. Manage a restaurant Most of the action obviously takes place inside the restaurants. As soon as acquired the building is completely empty, only four walls and the stairs (if it has two floors), everything else has to be placed manually by the player, from the rooms (kitchen and toilet), to the tables (of different cost and quality) to the decor (according to the nationality and the theme of the restaurant). There are paintings, tapestries, columns, fireplaces, fountains, carpets, lithographs, photos, stuffed fish, Indian tents, juke boxes, over 200 objects that can be positioned the way you want, and the same goes for the decor of the toilet and kitchen utensils. Placing them is very simple, and the possibilities are therefore enormous and depend only on the personal taste of the player. However, the job is not limited to just furnishing the restaurant, you have to hire employees, choosing them on the basis of their abilities (the better they are, the more they cost), assign them tasks and decide how much to invest in their training. However, there is a limit to the number of employees that can be hired based on the role and size of the restaurant. This limitation is right and helps not to overdo it in the early days, the only problem is the number of chefs. In fact, it always happens during the adventure mode to have the complaints screen full of complaints about the slowness of the service. Initially one is led to think that the problem is due to the waiters or maitre d's; in reality, however, it is almost always a matter of the small number of chefs. Doing some math, it turns out that a very good chef can cook for no more than six tables at the same time (less if fixed menus are used), which, multiplied by the number of chefs who can work in the same restaurant (from 3 to 5 depending on the size), makes a maximum of 18-30 tables depending on the size. A decidedly low number compared to reality, and which, also given the large spaces available, forces you to waste an impressive amount of space. This inconvenience is felt more in the adventure mode, in which it is not possible to hire chefs normally, and where it often happens that you can only use one of the restaurant floors due to the shortage of manpower, without however being able to avoid being overwhelmed by protests . To attract an ever-increasing crowd, it is also essential to improve the reputation of the restaurant, with advertising or, even better, by satisfying customer expectations. In fact, it is essential to satisfy customers, because, as Michael Le Beau, Armand's uncle, says, ~a satisfied customer is the best advertisement and, above all, it's free~. To represent the level of satisfaction, each person has an expectation value, i.e. the minimum they expect when entering our restaurant. Then all the characteristics of the place, the furnishings, the comfort, the ability of the employees, the time required to be served and obviously the quality of the dishes ordered, are compared with the expectation, and the result indicates the level of individual satisfaction . This value can be high or low, moreover when something is definitely below expectations, the customer complains to the staff, and in thisway the player has the opportunity to realize the most serious problems. Once the work inside is finished, it is good to give a tidy up to the outside as well, given that no matter how good the food is and how beautiful it is inside, no one wants to enter a shack. Also in this case the system is very simple: just select the improvements and they are carried out. A little cooking As I have already mentioned, in Restaurant Empire there are dishes from three cuisines, French, American and Italian, and are ordered according to the French convention. This system obviously does not suit Italian cuisine at all. For the uninitiated, Italian cuisine is one of the very few in the world in which there is a distinction between first and second courses. This was absolutely not taken into consideration by the programmers, with effects between ridiculous and disastrous. In fact, not knowing where to put our beloved first courses, they scattered them at random among the appetizers and main courses!!! The result is that Maccheroni alla Bolognese (simple macaroni with meat sauce) is among the starters, while Pasta alla Bolognese (according to the description a pasta of your choice with meat sauce) is among the main courses. And similar examples abound. To explain well the reason for this at least questionable decision, however, it is good to first explain how lunches and dinners are considered in the game. Probably still according to French convention, a full meal consists of two starters, a soup, a main course and a dessert. So the programmers, given the Italian exception, thought it was the same thing to place some first courses among the appetizers, without considering the possibility of surreal pairings such as: Maccheroni alla Bolognese, Insalata Caprese (without tomato too!), Minestrone and Carbonara in that order. A culinary disaster that could have been avoided with just a shred of attention. In fact, the literal translation of soupe is not ~soup~, as they probably erroneously thought, but ~minestra~, which includes, based on Italian cuisine, both broth and dry soups. So it would have been enough to change the name of the category to ~Soups and First Courses~ and put all the Italian first courses in it. All without any extra effort. The same selection of Italian dishes is completely devoid of any criteria, so much so that there is no trace of many of the most important and famous ones. The bucatini all'amatriciana, the pasta with pesto, the risottos, the pizza margherita (there is the one with salmon and the margherita is missing!), the lasagna alla bolognese, even the TORTELLINI are missing! All this, for an Italian, is unacceptable in a game based on cooking! The menu The recipes in Restaurant Empire are part of French, American and Italian cuisine (and I would also like to see). For each dish there is a brief description, an image that can be rotated in any direction, and the list of ingredients. It is possible to modify the quality of the ingredients (represented by stars like all the other values present in the game) to reduce costs, but this affects the quality of the recipe, and therefore the success of the dish. At the beginning we will have only a limited number of good, but not excellent recipes and ingredients available. Occasionally, however, some special customers will enter the restaurants, who will be signaled by a specific alarm, who will make us a proposal. In exchange for money they can provide us with a new recipe, tricks to improve the chefs' skills in preparing a certain dish (NOT the quality of the recipe), some additional ingredients to improve the quality of a recipe itself, or special suppliers that can allow us to have access to higher quality ingredients. Other characters, on the other hand, will offer to buy our recipes, or ask to be hired as a chef. The more than 180 dishes are divided according to the French convention (breakfasts, appetizers, soups, main courses and desserts) and according to the country of origin. The interaction with the menu is simple and intuitive as for the other aspects, with a few clicks of the mouse it is possible to insert or remove the dishes and modify their quality and price. On the other hand, the compilation of the fixed menus (complete lunches and dinners defined by the player, very useful for training the chefs in certain dishes) is more cumbersome since they are at the bottom and there is no way to reach them directly, but you have to browse through the whole menu first, and at only three plates per page it is a bit long especially if it has to be repeatedta. The cook's test To spice up the game even more, there are cooking contests. Quite apart from the management structure, they are only available in the adventure mode, where they are often indispensable for completing the scenarios. But how is it possible to explain something as complex as the culinary art to a computer without making it a mere series of mechanical actions (take the ingredient, put the ingredient in the pot, mix)? Surely even the programmers of the Enlight team will have racked their brains over this question when they had to face the problem, and the solution they have arrived at (and which I fully agree with) is to let the numbers take their course. I'll explain. Chefs have a skill for each recipe: it is a simple percentage value that represents how skilled they are at preparing that particular dish. To define the goodness of the result (it should be said) there is an algorithm that compares the skill of the chef with the quality of the recipe, always as a percentage. To make a dish better, it is therefore important to train the chef by having him prepare it as many times as possible so that his skill increases, and to have higher quality ingredients to use at crucial moments. Obtaining these ingredients is not as easy as it seems: some special customers will be able to offer samples (at very high prices) to promote their business, other times it will be necessary to visit some of the external locations and buy them directly. Once on stage, with all the ~tools of the trade~ ready and a fairly precise idea of what the result of our efforts will be, it's time to start the actual competition. With the other parameters already defined, the variety is provided by the chef's concentration, which is represented by a series of mini-games to be played in a few seconds. Elementary games, such as hitting the target with a moving dot, or clicking six scattered numbers or letters in order, and which provide a very small bonus based on the speed with which they are completed. All obviously within the time necessary to cook the chosen dish. A sufficiently realistic idea that does not force the player to remain passive and wait for the result, therefore overall decidedly successful. Technically Speaking Restaurant Empire is absolutely not excessive in terms of system requirements, both thanks to the programmers (lately the tendency is to require more and more power even when it can be comfortably done without it), and due to the lack of importance that the graphic component has in this type of titles, and it works without any problem even on low-medium range PCs. The only slowdowns are encountered in the advanced stages of the game, when you own more than 4-5 restaurants, and the program has to calculate what's happening in all of them at the same time, or the first few times you switch from one to another, when it needs to be calculated the graphic aspect. The view is the now usual three-dimensional with the possibility of rotating and zooming both indoors and outdoors. The level of detail of the objects is excellent, while the models of the people leave something to be desired. As long as you keep your distance, which is almost always the case, everything is fine, but if you look closely, the defects, both in the polygonal structures and in the textures, are clearly seen. The only characters reproduced with decent detail are those important to the plot, while the others are unfortunately well below what is expected these days. The music is nice and accompanies pleasantly, but is interspersed with inexplicably long periods of silence, often over half an hour. In the more reflective phases of the game (especially during the furnishing) they are not particularly missed, while on the contrary you almost jump on your chair when they start again seemingly from scratch. The reason for this choice is not well understood, when it would have been much better to always have the music or at least an option to select the length of the silent interludes. Even the sound effects do not stand out for their brilliance, and are almost always reduced to people's shouts, while to hear the cooks at work it is necessary to zoom a lot inside the kitchen. <i>In Conclusion</i> It will probably remain unknown to the general public, and fans of action for the sake of action will not deign to look at it, but Restaur", "date": "2004-05-05", "grade": null}
