FIFA itself on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 has struggled quite a bit to implement the revolution that we have been able to appreciate since 2009, becoming a point of reference for fans and succeeding in just three editions (four, also counting the World Cup ) to defeat a confused and numb competition like a boxer who has made the serious mistake of underestimating his opponent, suddenly finding himself taking blow after blow. The situation on PC is different due to some questionable choices, but this year seems to have reached a turning point and bodes well for the future. Even on PSP FIFA is able to give us spectacular action and great emotions. So what's going on with the Nintendo DS game reduction? FIFA 09 had in fact deceived us that the developers had set to work to create something important, a football game that inevitably had to give up on beautiful graphics but which made up for the technical shortcomings with solid gameplay and decent multiplayer online via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. A year later, the bitter disappointment of FIFA 10, which re-proposed the problems of the previous editions, magnified by the passage of time and by a technical realization that now seemed truly inadequate. What about FIFA 11? Beyond some marginal innovations regarding the modalities, it still suffers from a mediocre visual sector and from a series of limitations of the AI which it seems to have given up on remedying. The flaws appear evident from the very first bars of the game, with the defense opening mysteriously, avoiding marking the opposing ball carrier, the frequent impossibility of selecting the player closest to the action and the almost complete absence of any choral action , of insertions that allow us to pass the ball into the penalty area for a winning triangulation. From this point of view, FIFA on Nintendo DS seems to go back to 1994, when you scored from midfield and won matches only with long balls. Lost at the table In addition to the classic ~kick-off~ to play a friendly match with random parameters, FIFA 11 offers us the ~professional~ mode, the new ~ultimate 11 challenge~, the ~coach~ mode, penalty kicks, multiplayer in local or online and a small series of nice mini-games. The ~coach~ mode is the one we already know: having selected a team, we will be able to manage it in all aspects and try to achieve the seasonal objectives indicated by the management, on pain of being fired. The matches, in this situation, can be played normally or simulated, while a little attention must also be paid to training to improve the general condition of the players. The ~professional~ mode is also an old acquaintance of the series, and sees us control a single player (with a Libero Grande-style view) with a view to fulfilling this role in the best possible way, from match to match. challenge ultimate 11~, a real novelty of this edition of FIFA, is a sort of ~master league~ with tournaments enriched by the presence of ~cards~ that can be purchased using the points earned by playing, and which allow us to sign new players. The penalty shoot-out minigame is played using the stylus and the touch screen: when we control the penalty taker, we have to draw the trajectory of the shot on the screen and adjust the speed of movement to increase or decrease its power; when we control the goalkeeper, on the other hand, we have to move with the stylus and try to guess what our opponent will do. The multiplayer mode is once again confirmed to be of good quality: the matchmaking works well and manages to find a match rather quickly, we did not encounter any lag and the experience, in general, proved to be quite fun in its simplicity. However, we must not forget the defects in the gameplay to which we have mentioned previously, and with which we end up dealing also and above all when measuring ourselves against a human opponent. The ~minigames~ mode, another novelty introduced by FIFA 11, includes six different challenges: ~sniper~, in which you have to score as many free-kick goals as possible; ~wizard of free throws~, or rather a comparison based on finishing from a corner; ~catch me if you can~, a timed challenge in which you must prevent your opponent from capturing the ball; ~muraglia~, a minigame dedicated exclusively to our skills as goalkeepers; ~interceptor~, in which one undertakes to steal the ball from the opponents as frequently as possible; ~master of the slalom~, a challenge basedon dribbling. Summing up As already mentioned, in the end we are faced with marginal innovations, which do not change the gaming experience in its essence by an iota and which therefore do not justify the purchase of the new edition by those who already own a previous one . Even the squads of the available teams do not appear updated, even if there is an option that in theory should ensure that they are updated via the internet. The flaws we found in the AI and gameplay in general could perhaps have been ignored three years ago, thanks to the lack of competition, but seeing them still there only paints the sad picture of a ~sop~ that is being offered to Nintendo DS owners waiting for the 3DS. A thought that is reflected also and above all with regard to the technical implementation: the resolution of the dual-screen portable console already has major problems in guaranteeing a certain ~readability~ of the action with eleven players on the field, therefore it doesn't help that the models polygonal are so angular and similar to each other. The cel shading card could have been tried, or with a little courage to face the question from a different angle, closer to the peculiar characteristics of the DS, but it is clear that this would not have guaranteed good results, especially in economic terms. Definitely ugly graphics, therefore, accompanied by the usual commentary in English and sound effects with no particular impact.", "date": "2010-10-21", "grade": "6.0"}
