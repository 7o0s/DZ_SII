The Ukrainian company has finally allowed us - after two trials that had intrigued us - to get our hands on the full version of their investigative game. Here is our review of Sherlock Holmes Chapter One, which we played in the PS5 version for the occasion. Cordon A view on the island of Cordona As many will already know, Frogwares has never been too concerned about creating continuity between one chapter of Sherlock Holmes and the next, often preferring to give up and start over with a ~new~ character, obviously always based on the famous detective of novels. In Sherlock Holmes Chapter One, the developers have decided to tread even more hand with originality, going into the most remote past of the (will be) detective. What we will check is a boy who, although a skilled deducer, is far from being the private investigator we all know. Sherlock is just a young man who suffers from the loss of his mother, which occurred ten years earlier, but never got over. To seek a sense of conclusion, ours returns to Cordona, which was his home for some time and where his mother met her end. Once he arrives, however, he realizes that something is not right. His memories speak of a death caused by consumption, but some information that he will discover seem to point in a very different direction. The first big case of Sherlock Holmes - according to Frogwares narrative, clearly - then becomes the case of the death of Violet Holmes. Sherlock and Jon The Holmes villa in Cordona The search for clues will take us back to the Holmes mansion in Cordona, long abandoned but still full of memories that the young Sherlock seems to have locked away deep within himself. The investigation will therefore take place in the outside world as much as in the mind of the detective. The journey conceived by Frogwares is obviously investigative, but - unlike the previous Sherlock Holmes and also The Sinking City - the story of Chapter One has a much more emotional and human cut. Cordona's adventure shows us a Sherlock obsessed with truth, facts, abstention from emotions. These elements are not presented to us as obvious characteristics of the man he will be, but as a response to the mystery of the mother who - even if unconsciously - has clearly deeply disturbed him for years and whom the boy tries to fight with his oath to seek empirical. Sherry won't be alone in dealing with the traumas, but she will have Jon by her side who, as is confirmed from the beginning of the adventure, is an imaginary friend, ~born~ in childhood. He is a companion in adventures, crimes and investigations, but he is also a sort of brother, a role that Mycroft has never really covered, as he is forced to play the figure of a father. Jon is a very good friend to Sherlock It is precisely the relationship between Sherlock and Jon that is at the heart of the game. The imaginary friend is present in every event, whether it's a memory of the past or one of the cases we'll face in Cordona. Jon comments on each scene, sometimes dramatically but more often with a comedic edge, and plays second to Sherlock in his reasoning. It's a well-crafted and well-executed figure, definitely Frogwares' best idea (except when we get something wrong in the investigation and Jon repeats the same line over and over to tell us we're not doing the right thing). An excellent idea, however, which risks not having all the time to shine through. The main plot is somewhat narrow, consisting of only five mandatory missions (one of which is a prologue / tutorial, irrelevant to the overall plot) which will spread over about ten hours. The story behind the mother's death is also much simpler than one might initially imagine and it would not have been unpleasant to see some additional twist or red herring. The Sinking City suffered from the opposite problem, proposing a main plot that stretched a little too much, but Chapter One goes overboard in its operation of subtraction, with an ending that comes all too suddenly. Most of the time, speaking of pure main storyline, we will spend solving cases that have little or nothing to do with the death of Sherlock's mother, but which will eventually unlock some memory inside the mansion. The mother's story then evolves in a few limited scenes and, having reached the conclusion, we were surprised that we had already solved everything and we weren't deeply moved by it. Side quests and open world A bird's-eye view of CordonaFortunately, the main storyline isn't the only content in the game, which far exceeds the basic ten hours thanks to a series of side cases and ~Cordona Stories~. The latter tend to be very short missions, small adventures around the city during which we won't even have to investigate, but simply wander around looking for a few clues that allow us to discover something particular about Cordona, its traditions or personal facts of the Sherlock's childhood. These are intriguing narrative fragments, which require minimal effort and reward with pleasant little stories. The secondary cases, on the other hand, vary enormously in breadth and complexity but follow a classic investigative structure (which we analyze a little below), with some that almost manage to match the main missions (in our opinion more a demerit of the latter than a merit of the prime). To close the circle of contents there are the collectibles, a series of furnishing objects - such as paintings, furniture, carpets... - which will serve to restore the ancient splendor to the various parts of the villa and to unlock additional memories. Most are obtained by simply purchasing them with money earned via cases. The Chapter One adventure is therefore above all a great journey through Sherlock's memories, which however struggles to convince on a narrative level, with a too concise main plot and a series of secondary elements that only partially help to flesh out the offer and to tell some additional details about the person behind the detective. We feel Frogwares could have used some of the side event minutage to create a denser and more intense main story. An ancient Roman ruin of Cordona Furthermore, everything is scattered in an open world / sandbox structure which - by its very nature - is fragmentary. The problem is that this open map, once again after The Sinking City, has no real purpose, other than being an obligation of modern times that demand large spaces in which to move freely without having much to do. The only reason to go around the city, beyond the movements to go from one place of investigation to another (fortunately shortened by the presence of fast travel points), is the search for the aforementioned Stories of Cordona, which are unlocked only if you reach the places dedicated to them (and not signaled in any way). For the rest, the city is just a pleasant background in its multicultural being. The ancient districts, the port districts, the areas of Venetian origin, the Ottoman ones and the English ones merge naturally: Cordona, a fictitious island in the Mediterranean, is much more cared for and studied from a historical point of view (it starts from ancient Rome ) than one might expect, and how much is actually needed. Investigations A detective scene from Sherlock Holmes Chapter One Obviously Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is not just a plot but first of all investigations. The gameplay will not particularly surprise players who have tried the development team's previous works, The Sinking City in particular. A classic investigative section is made up of various phases, starting with the search for clues. Within the environments we will have to check each interactable element, even with the help of a small ~sonar~ that highlights the objects (and colors those that we still have to analyze in yellow). We will be able to set various levels of difficulty in total freedom, choosing to have an icon on the map that indicates if we have found all the clues, if we have found the key ones or if there are still many missing. On the contrary, we can also completely cancel the interaction icons (a choice we strongly advise against) or even just prevent the game from warning us if we have found all the clues. This freedom is very positive. Once we find what we need, we can question suspects or witnesses, present them with our ~evidence~ and obtain additional information (you can also go brute-force and select each piece of evidence, at random, until you find the right one). Sometimes you have to follow footprints or trails of blood, using a sort of detective view, or ask questions of passers-by. Finally, you have to use places like the town hall or the police station to access archives, searching according to various categories. All this, however, always selecting the right test (there are still icons that suggest what should be used and how, so it won't be complex). Sherlock Holmes Chapter One, in other words, takes some of the ideas from The Sinking City, expands them and contextualizes them for a much more detective game than the previous one. We will have to analyze some scenes del detail to find all the clues Finally, the clues must be connected to create a series of key points that will allow us to accuse one of the suspects. Unlike The Sinking City - where the events were always very obvious and we ~only~ had to make a moral decision, sometimes even doing something profoundly illegal - in Chapter One it won't always be obvious who the culprit is, at least not until when we have not accused him and he has confessed. Here too we will have to decide whether to propose a maximum penalty (even death) or whether to suggest pardon. Unfortunately, both solving the case perfectly and completely wrong, there will be no particular consequences. Sherlock will continue his journey and, in addition to reading the front page of the newspaper (which serves as a historian of our investigative exploits), there will be no consequences of any kind. This is a pity, as one gets the impression that much of one's work is superfluous and, again, the non-linear structure of the open world is not exploited in any way: this would have allowed to insert different events or scenarios according to of our choices (a trivial example: was an angry crowd in front of the police station in case of wrong arrest so complex to insert?). Minigames There will always be someone dead somewhere Chapter One also features a variety of mini-games. We will be able to play the little chemist with some specific clues, analyzing substances in a sort of mathematical game in which we will have to add, subtract and blend three different reagents characterized by a number, to obtain a specific final formula (very trivial even at maximum difficulty, but if it's not for you, you can skip it). There will then be a mini-game during which we will have to eavesdrop on conversations and guess among the various chatter which ones are relevant to the case and which are not: it is a ~new~ idea but in reality not very interesting. Finally, there will be the fights. In The Sinking City survival was a serious issue and you often had to fight monsters of various kinds. The third-person shooting system was botched, but narratively and in terms of pacing it had its place. In Sherlock Holmes Chapter One it is a somewhat forced addition. We'll have to fight in specific stages of the game, almost never being able to avoid it (unless we set the game to skip the fights completely), and it will never be a fun experience, especially since the fights tend to last much longer than necessary. The fighting mini-game isn't amazing Regardless of the result, the idea is simple: Sherlock has a gun with infinite ammo and must knock out all enemies by hitting various non-lethal weak points, then get close and knock them out. with a trivial QTE. The combat phases take place in arenas filled with objects useful for causing stun to enemies, such as pipes from which to squirt boiling water or oil lamps to explode. You can also kill without hesitation (there are also two dedicated trophies), but narratively Sherlock is a pacifist and all the characters, Jon first of all, encourage us not to do it. We close with a quick technical comment. Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is an AA game, like its predecessors. The need to create a large open world, with a technical level that is not incredible but still more than valid, has caused various optimization problems that have forced the postponement of the PS4 and Xbox One versions. This does not surprise us given that even on PS5 the game has a frame that is nothing short of a dancer, never fluid. A corrective patch that limits the problem should arrive on November 16, but at the time of writing it is not yet available and therefore we do not know what impact it will have.", "date": "2021-11-17", "grade": "7.0"}
