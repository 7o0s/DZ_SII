{"name": "Dio o demonio?", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/god-hand-2.html", "text": "With the imminent European launch of the PlayStation3 completing the global distribution plan for the new Sony console, it is clear that most developers have begun to direct their efforts in that direction. This means that PS2 releases will inevitably dwindle in number, but it also means that the major software houses won't leave such a significant stage without a sharp finale. In the case of Capcom, two big names (Shinji ~Devil May Cry~ Mikami as director, Atsushi ~Viewtiful Joe~ Inaba as producer) wanted to study together an atypical product, a sort of ~divertissement~ that pays homage to Hokuto no Ken and, in general, the vein of scrolling fighting games. In a post-atomic scenario very similar to the one shown in the work of Bronson / Hara, cities are invaded by human-looking demons, who enslave people and aspire to total control of the planet. Only a warrior who has the power of a god can oppose this design... and fate wants this person to be Gene, a decidedly unconventional fighter and a bit of a braggart, who lost his right arm to save a girl in difficulty but now something more is found... a God Hand. The girl, Olivia, is in fact the sole survivor of a caste whose centuries-old task was to guard the God Hands, the arms of the savior who was the first to send the demon Angra back to the underworld. The power of these relics, which actually replace the arms of the wearer, can be used for beneficial or evil purposes... as we will discover as the game's plot unfolds, through the numerous cutscenes that are shown between stages. Absolute God Action If the word ~presentation~ were still present between the cells of a hypothetical report card, God Hand would not get great marks. The new Capcom product, developed by Clover Studio, in fact presents itself with a lean and raw aspect, without an animated intro and with a title screen that leaves something to be desired. It is clear, however, that there are many other factors to take into consideration to evaluate the quality of a game, and it is precisely in this sense that God Hand amazes, as it focuses completely on the fights and leaves everything else aside, with the result that we are often offered very short and simple internships, whose only reason for being is to act as a scenario for one or more clashes. And what fights. It was obvious that combat was the fundamental element of God Hand, but you can't imagine how immersive and challenging (very challenging) the game can be if you don't play it for a long time. The first game can be discouraging, there's no doubt: the enemies are many and dangerous, energy is low and the environment is stingy with supplies. After you have built the first combo, however, you will understand the mechanism and you will be able to finish the levels without continuing dozens and dozens of times... Those accustomed to ~normal~ fighting games will be traumatized once they ascertain that Gene cannot block the blows of his opponents, but has three types of evasive maneuvers available: the back somersault, the lateral swerve and the direct dodge, all operated by moving the right analog stick backwards, sideways and forwards respectively. For such movements to be successful, you need to time accurately and have really good reflexes, also because there are few PS2 games that use the right stick in this way, giving it so much importance and requiring such promptness. The Square key is responsible for executing the combo, while the Triangle and X keys allow us to perform two single attacks. Finally, the back keys are used to make fun of enemies (L2), turn the character quickly (L1), activate the God Hand (R2) and access the list of special moves available (R1). Undoubtedly the most particular aspect of the game lies in the total customization of the attacks. After each stage, in fact, it is possible to spend the money collected to buy techniques, special moves and upgrades. The techniques that can be bought, and which are unlocked as you progress through the story, are then assigned to the main keys of the Dual Shock 2, so we will be able to literally build our combos and opt for one shot instead of another depending on our approach to fighting: if we love to strike in a reasoned way, we can opt for slow but highly effective roundhouse kicks, to be released at the right moment; if, on the other hand, we prefer a more ~bloody~ style, we can use less powerful but faster combos of shots, to be scored in succession. The moment an enemy remains intontited by our attacks, we can go close to him and press Circle to perform one of the many available ~holds~, which vary according to the opponent and which are absolutely spectacular and fun (one example above all: the super spanking). Where the release of the power of the God Hand allows us to obtain a short period of invincibility and greater power and speed, it is important to bear in mind that even the special moves are subject to customization: the available ~slots~ are not infinite, therefore at a at a certain point you will have to decide which ones to leave ready for use (generally the most powerful and/or more ~convenient~ ones in terms of energy costs) and which ones to put out of the squad. Technical realization As mentioned earlier, God Hand doesn't take into high consideration all aspects beyond pure combat, and this philosophy is also reflected in the technical realization of the game. From the point of view of the characters, the Capcom title excels in every aspect: the protagonist, Gene, boasts something like a hundred different attacks (each with its own animation), to which must be added the spectacular special moves and, in general, a style of out of the ordinary design, which closely resembles the polygonal models of Resident Evil and Shadow Of Rome for beauty and detail. God Hand is also one of the few titles to have a huge number of enemies, divided into numerous types not only for the aesthetic aspect but also and above all for the truly differentiated combat skills. In this sense, the absolute excellence in the design of the bosses is the icing on the cake: from the insane to the monstrous, the end-of-level enemies will amaze us for a thousand different reasons and will represent a challenge of an extraordinary level as never before. And there is no shortage of quotes, just think of the group of five demented doubles of Viewtiful Joe (to whom Gene, at one point, mimics: hilarious), the dumb gorilla who disguises himself as Tiger Mask, the giant Baba in ~Big Zebra~... Finally, the animated sequences are also excellent and numerous, in real time, which make extensive use of a typically Japanese visual humor and which boast a phenomenal level of detail. The other side of the coin is represented by the settings, which in fact form a pure frame for the fights and for which the developers did not waste themselves. The graphics engine manages to manage everything without ever slowing down (actually, some rare uncertainty is noticeable but only in the last stage - and looking at it you can understand why), but unfortunately the walls of the buildings in the locations tend to become ~transparent~ due to a visual defect, when you walk alongside them. The sound sector succeeds in keeping up with the graphics, thanks above all to a series of truly particular and ~raw~ but damned successful music, to which are added some excellent effects and a not very well recited spoken word in English (therefore average of Capcom productions), translated into Italian on the screen, not without some small blunders.", "date": "2007-02-13", "grade": "8.7"}
