{"name": "Townsmen 5", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/townsmen-5_a.html", "text": "In short, the mobile phone stands as an all-round gaming device, which often provides developers with the opportunity to experiment from every point of view to get the best out of the available resources. The technical aspect of this discussion has already been addressed on more than one occasion, with high-end terminals that can now compete (quietly, or almost) with gaming systems that have only been out of the picture for a few years. For the rest, the obvious limitations of a control system remain which is still reluctant to lend itself to the most frenetic action games, but which in the case of ~reflexive~ products such as Townsmen 5 proves to be practically perfect: the joystick moves the selection of the object , the FIRE (or 5) key activates a contextual menu. That's all. Let us not be deceived by the simplicity of the control system, however, as the HandyGames series has accustomed us to thick structures, which lend themselves to prolonged use and which therefore, from this point of view, have little to do with mobile games as they are commonly understood. The incipit is always the same: we start from a building (usually a warehouse) and around it we will have to gradually build a small city with its farms, its quarries, its outposts and its taverns. Guided by the indications of one of our expert servants, we will face the various stages in rapid sequence and we will complete them only when we have achieved the set objectives (build a certain number of farms, for example, or upgrade the buildings already present, or even submit a neighboring village to use its inhabitants as workers). Each built building has its own function and we can engage it in the production of different goods: water, meat, wood, iron, stone and so on. These goods will be needed for the construction of further buildings or for the improvement of existing ones: when the stocks run dry, our workers will stop until things are put in order. Once a stable economy has been reached, our warehouse will be periodically visited by merchants, to whom we will be able to sell excess goods and from whom we will be able to buy those that we do not yet produce or which we are in short supply. Only after a certain number of missions will we find ourselves defending our walls or eventually conquering new lands, placed on a map that is shown little by little. The technical realization of the game is excellent: the style is the same used for the fourth episode, with an excellent level of detail for all the buildings. Only the rather spartan icons are a bit subdued, while the interface manages to always be clear, legible and intuitive. Perhaps a little more could have been done with regard to on-screen warnings: when, for example, a farm stops producing due to a lack of essential goods, a warning appears, but the building is not clearly highlighted and therefore you have to check manually to figure out what it is. The sound lets us choose whether to listen to the music or the effects, with discrete results in both cases: the music is catchy, the effects nice even if not very clear. We have already mentioned the control system: simple and immediate, it allows us to control each building quickly and intuitively, navigating through a series of contextual menus. The left soft key can be used at any time to speed up the time or to view alerts. PRO Rich in thickness Technically excellent Good interface... AGAINST ...apart from some cases Only for fans of the genre Almost identical to the fourth episode", "date": "2008-02-08", "grade": "S.V."}
