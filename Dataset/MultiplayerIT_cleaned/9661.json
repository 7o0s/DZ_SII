This hero of few words with a steely physique but a big heart has been from the beginning, back in 1983, as a manga (Hokuto no Ken) on the pages of Shonen Jump, signed by Tetsuo Hara and Yoshiyuki Okamura, an object of great interest by the public and companies. With the latter ready to churn out hundreds of gadgets of all kinds over twenty-seven years in order to satisfy the requests of the fans (and earn a lot of money). Obviously this also concerned the world of video games, where the good Kenshiro was the protagonist of a series of products not always worthy of his great value, and often relegated to the Japanese market only, from the first titles such as Hokuto no Ken: Violence Gekiga Adventure for NEC PC-8801, NEC PC-9801 and FM-7 to the latest Hokuto no Ken: Shinpan no Sososei Kengo Retsuden for PlayStation 2. However, things could have changed thanks to Tecmo Koei and his Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage, a game developed on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 platforms which aims to subvert the negative tradition of themed productions and which we are about to analyze. Ken the Warrior Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage has two main game modes which are the one called Story and the one called Dream, to which we will dedicate a separate chapter later. The first is mainly focused on the events of Kenshiro in the first manga series, precisely on those that start from Shin and end with the epic clash with his older brother Raoul. Although later the mode can be played with other characters from the series. However, everything is set in a violent post-apocalyptic future that fans of the manga have come to know over time and that we will quickly summarize for those who do not know it. After a world conflict that led to the collapse of modern civilization on earth, the few survivors were forced to live in small urban gatherings, often authentic slums. Besieged by bands of marauders who plunder everything they encounter, the inhabitants of these oases in the middle of the desert of a now destroyed nature live in a thousand hardships. As indeed does Kenshiro, sixty-fourth successor of the martial arts school Divine School of Hokuto. Thanks to his physical abilities and his fighting technique called Hokuto Shinken, which through particular touches conveys the practitioner's energy into specific pressure points of the opponents' bodies, called tsubo, causing them to explode, he managed to survive in his search for the kidnapped girlfriend and to help the weakest encountered along the way. Needless to say, the game appears from the outset as a production dedicated to fans of the saga, built, that is, in order to make them relive the epic of the man with the seven stars. It is the classic scrolling fighting game of those that once depopulated in arcade cabinets and on the first 8 and 16 Bit consoles which were called beat'em up. Think, to be clear, of Final Fight or Street of Rage and you will immediately have an idea of what we are talking about, or, if younger, of any of the more recent Dynasty Warriors. Consequently, the ultimate goal of the product is to move along a predefined path that reflects from time to time those scenarios that, as mentioned above, distinguish manga and anime, eliminating enemies until the final showdown with the boss on duty. Hokuto Hyakuretsu Ken In some cases, however, the game asks you to complete sub-quests, but always within the predefined route taken, such as, for example, saving the inhabitants of the city in which you find yourself from the clutches of the thugs of some gang or escorting them to a safe place making sure that they are not killed by some attacker. By satisfying these and other requirements, Bonus points can be obtained at the end of the level. As the genre dictates, opponents, generally quite numerous and varied in appearance, can be hit with flurries of punches, kicks, or grabbed and thrown at other opponents. Or against the objects of the scenario, within some of which you can also recover sandwiches, drinks and other elements useful for recovering vital energy, as well as power-ups or, to a lesser extent, skill points. All by combining the various keys on the pad. Obviously there is no shortage of thatthe spectacular and lethal fighting techniques to be used against the unfortunate ones on duty, which fans have admired in the cartoons and which here, with the continuation of the adventure, can be expanded in number. In fact, killed enemies release luminous spheres that can be collected by Kenshiro. These energy forms are called Karma and are used to earn useful points to improve the character. Before the start of each level, in a special pre-area menu, several options are available (Map of Meridians in particular) within which to indulge oneself in search of those skills to be purchased with the aforementioned points, or where to equip techniques up to to a maximum of four such as Hokuto's One Hundred Destructive Fists, to then be selected using the directional cross on the pad during fights. Everything happens in these cases by filling the bar called Concentration Indicator which draws its source of charge from the damage inflicted on the enemies. This bar, once full, allows you to perform the basic moves mentioned above or in some cases super special techniques. Complete with an anime-style still image shortly after the execution to underline its effectiveness and spectacularity. Other important elements for the execution or at least the increase of parameters such as the strength of the blows are the Aura Segments, elements which, through the Spiritual Aura, increase the attack strength of the character used. The boss fights are then the logical conclusion of each area. They range from minor gang leaders like Zeed to major ones like King. They are obviously the most difficult enemies to deal with and often, in the more advanced levels, require some strategy. Xbox 360 goals Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage offers forty-seven objectives to unlock: they are linked to the Story mode and are obtained simply with the progression of the game by eliminating particular enemies with a special move, as in the case of Rei to be finished with a Coup de grace in the Postal Code. 1 in Legend of Raoul mode or by slaughtering a total of 1,000 enemies during the adventure using special techniques. Dream Mode Even if, as often happens in this type of product, once the weak point of the individual in front of us has been identified, it becomes quite easy to exploit it to defeat it. Once the boss has been properly weakened, he kneels stunned and at that point by pressing the button indicated on the screen, on Xbox 360 it is B, the coup de grace can be performed on him. How it works: after pressing the appropriate key on the screen, a sequence of buttons to be pressed in time starts, once completed, the hero of the moment will perform a devastating final move that will end the fight and the enemy. As an alternative to the main mode analyzed so far, as mentioned at the beginning, there is also another rather interesting one called Dream, which is unlocked after finishing the first level of that Story. These are small parallel adventures to the main storyline, in which it is possible to use all the most representative characters of the saga including the so-called villains, from Shin to Rei, passing through an unusually super sexy Mamiya in a thong and Toki. Each of them features all the moves and strikes they mastered in the comic. In this mode it is also possible to play in two split-screen with a friend, and it is freer to face than the main one. In fact, here you have the entire map available to move around and the primary purpose is not only to eliminate as many enemies as possible, but also and above all to achieve certain objectives required by the game. The latter can vary during the battle and consist, for example, in protecting an ally or a specific area, or in conquering the various forts scattered along the way. The map, in fact, is populated by small strongholds (in blue those of the player, in red those of the opponents) which constantly churn out enemies and which must therefore be occupied both for the reasons described above and to stop the hordes of criminals. To do this, it is necessary to eliminate all those present on the site, including the foremen. In this way the point becomes a free zone and a forge of friendly soldiers, who will watch over the area trying to avoid its reconquest by enemy troops. It goes without saying that all this gives a strategic impact to the game, given that it is often necessary to plan carefully which forts should be conquered first. Europe vs Asia The European edition of the product is also decidedly better than the Asian one. Nothing great,let me be clear, but certainly the tweaks are there and you can see them. For one thing, unlike what has always happened with the cartoon, the western title enjoys a massive implementation of violence. Blood flows in rivers and there is even a special option to increase the amount. All this is expressed thanks to a greater representation of the explosions of the bodies of the enemies following the deadly blows scored by Ken, often with the single press of the Y button (or Triangle in the case of PlayStation 3). Then added other goodies such as motorcyclists who run around in some areas, certain moves by Kenshiro available from the start or the most effective controls. Then some slight tweaks were made to the gameplay, such as the one concerning the engagement of enemies and the possibility of correcting a possible error in choosing a target by simply moving the analog stick during a move and a slight simplification of the bosses. Even the enemy AI looks less idiotic. The European version of Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage is also better from a purely graphic and technical point of view, with interventions aimed at the textures that make up the settings and characters on the one hand, but also as regards the physics of the engine from other, further refined and balanced. This upgrade allows the title to have a greater impact than the Japanese release from the first glance. Notwithstanding the fact that in this sense we are always on the level of sufficiency for the general quality given that characters and scenarios, while effective and faithful to the series, always appear poorly finished, with animations and textures that are in short not suited to the potential of the consoles on which the game turns. But on the other hand Koei has never shone in its productions for detail. The audio sector is instead of excellent workmanship. In addition to the dubbing available in both English and Japanese, with all the original voices of the series, selectable at will, there is the presence of a discreet sampling of the various game effects and a soundtrack in which the arrangement of the splendid You wa stands out. shock among many unpublished songs.", "date": "2010-11-11", "grade": "6.5"}
