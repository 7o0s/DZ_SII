{"name": "Gli inferi di Sanctuary", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/103508-diablo-iii-gli-inferi-di-sanctuary.html", "text": "When Erich Shaefer, co-founder of what over time took the name of Blizzard North, was asked what were the most successful aspects of the entire Diablo II development process, the first point identified was the continuity of the playful experience with respect to the his predecessor. A continuity made up of a few repeated gratifications and procedurally generated content, Schaefer explained, but also of an immediacy that should allow anyone to get in front of the monitor without any need to read the manual or have who knows what role-playing background. Twelve years after playing Diablo III we realize the effort made by Jay Wilson, the new game director, not to deviate from this directive. Adapting it to a partly new audience, perhaps sucked into the Blizzard universe through World of Warcraft, and partly returning to the world of Sanctuary after playing many other titles over the years and ultimately evolving their expectations. In short, if the basic ingredients could not change, the recipe for success on a large scale should have gone through some important changes which in the end produced a title of excellent value. A champion in the hack and slash genre that in the whole of an overall very rich and multifaceted offer, is not free from more or less inherent errors within a gameplay that focuses heavily on some totalizing choices. Hack and slash Diablo is considered a sort of manifesto-series for the hack and slash genre, characterized by mechanics that have long characterized its immediacy and which return almost unchanged: the isometric perspective, the simple and repetitive selection of thousands of enemies, the collection of the loot from the ground and the progression in the difficulty of the challenge are distinctive elements that once again make it the absolute protagonists here. The five classes - Barbarian, Demon Hunter, Magician, Monk and Shaman - have symmetries compared to those of the second chapter but at the same time do not fail to strike positively. Barbarian and Mage fall into the clichs but enjoy a new thickness thanks to the more sophisticated characterization. The Monk is a ruthless man of faith with lightning reflexes. While Shaman and Demon Hunters relate in a diametrically opposite way with darkness: evoking it in his favor, the first, and making the killing of demons his only reason for living, the second. Without forcibly going into the description of each class - the official site is well documented - the alternation of figures specialized in close range or close attacks and the facets themselves within each role make each choice a valid option. In short, it is credible that you want to try the five figures carefully, and then decide which one (or which ones) to attempt the climb through the four levels of difficulty. Normal, Nightmare, Abyss and Hell are the steps of a ladder that starts as a simple walk, ideal for swelling your chest with pride by observing how powerful your alter ego is, and gradually becomes more and more fraught with obstacles, bastard. Even for an avid user, Diablo III manages on the one hand to renew each completion just enough to offer a different experience from the previous one, on the other hand to make it increasingly fun and nerve-wracking exercise in masochism with enough content to engage for a long time. Among other things, for the most demanding, the whole rigmarole can be repeated in Hardcore, complete with a thrill for the eventual permanent and definitive death. In all of this, if it is always possible to play alone, while remaining connected to Battle.net, it is evident how central the four-player cooperative is, which can in all respects be considered the main method of use: each new game is open by default to friends, the progression of the public rooms is well staggered by chapters and experience levels, some options such as the automatic achievement of companions are a panacea and in general many small adjustments to the quests and the division of the loot favor a perfect sharing of the time spent online. Whether with friends or complete strangers. It is unlikely that another so sophisticated coop mode will be released in 2012. Over the years, Blizzard has also learned a lot regarding the procedural generation of content with the usual dungeons with visual variety and content created from scratch every time you enter them, monsters that re-propose depending on the difficulty and large quantities of objects with which to fill the inventory. Even small events or meetings that are absolutely secondary but amused pass through algorithms and equationsentities as well as capable of curbing the sense of discovery that is inevitably lacking by returning several times to the same places. At all times, exploration thus becomes an unknown factor and this despite the fact that the minimum twelve to fifteen hours to complete each run are a process guided by the classic main quests and extremely linear. Despite, in short, there hasn't been a proactive push aimed at increasing freedom of action or inserting who knows what secondary content. The foundations are therefore classic but solid, ideal for supporting the user within the four acts into which the adventure is divided and responding to his requests, at the same time giving him the opportunity to experience a growth system that has not failed to make discuss. Non-stop action The role-playing system of Diablo III is what, apart from the diatribe on the requirement of a permanent connection, has most of all raised controversy: the elimination of skill trees and the lack of manual assignment of points within the statistics have been strongly criticized because identified as a reason for oversimplification. Blizzard has decided that the interest generated by the definitive choices of the past, often subject to the identification of more effective ways than others, could well be replaced by the progressive and predetermined unlocking of active and passive skills but also of runes. These normally do not limit themselves to acting on the statistical values but can, depending on the case, vary the type of damage, the range or the entire purpose of a power, transforming it for example from offensive to defensive. The representation is very rich in details, the assets used are many and this contributes not a little to giving a sense of satisfaction returned also thanks to the excellent weight of the shots, explosions and well-finished effects as well as a variety of stunning animations. There are some things that money can buy and when the result is such visual variety repeated for five characters, one can only be satisfied. In short, our wizard played for the review had at every moment of his development the same basic statistics and the same powers available to any other wizard of the same level in circulation. On the other hand, however, being able to change each of the six active and three passive selectable powers whenever desired translates into a great drive to experiment and considering that there are billions of possible combinations, there is certainly no lack of choice. Among other things, the variety of achievable builds fits naturally into the cooperative vocation of the title: in various situations, going online from one group of perfect strangers to another, it was much more gratifying to be able to adapt one's style of play to the classes and decisions others, compared to what it would have been to have to be forced to settle. And finally, this flexibility should prove successful in the team PvP mode, which is expected to be released within the first major patches. The exaggerated search for frenetic action that has led to moving the role-playing choices from some cold numerical accounts and opportunities to experimenting with the battlefield has also prompted several innovations that have made the combat system more enjoyable. In particular, the cooldown of the potions, the energy spheres on the ground and the presence of a specific resource for attacks for each class, make the clashes more varied, strategic and fun. On the other hand, what overall can be considered a very successful transition to a more modern gameplay is not without some contradictions. Above all, the presence of a main statistic per class and the absence of major limitations on the weapons that can be equipped make the challenged typology completely irrelevant for some of them - including the magician himself. In short, if you enjoy going around fluttering and throwing fireballs, an ax or a sword will be fine as long as they have high values under the Intelligence heading. In general, the whole process of creating, collecting and managing items should be fixed. Not so much in terms of variety, very high, but in terms of assigning values. Too advantageous to contact the auction house to see what has been collected by others, a process that mortifies obtaining in game, while the Legendary and Special sets do not always hold the comparison with others of a theoretically lower level but more useful in practice. An economy to be rebalanced and a loot creation system to be calibrated: necessary adjustments both in view of the transitions between users with real currency, and to restore importance to artisans and crafting which right now are a nice idea, well done mhardly convenient. A life of Hell Diablo III could disappoint someone in several respects, starting from the plot and the atmosphere, and in the days following its release it was much discussed. What certainly does not disappoint however are the mechanics that evolve from difficulty to difficulty until they are magnified towards the end of the Abyss level and the beginning of the Inferno one. Unfortunately, for the magic to happen, you need up-to-date equipment, without which everything resolves into frustrating sequences of instantaneous deaths as soon as a trio of champions, perhaps accompanied by a special guest with a yellow name, appears on the horizon. But don't waste time in the often excessive auctions and aim to reach the maximum experience level. In fact, at level 60, thanks to the Valor of the Nephilim blessing which increases the percentage of collection of objects, dressing suddenly becomes much easier. In any case, even equipped at the best, on many occasions you will have to use the nine skills available, perhaps reorganized as desired in Elective modes, to defeat enemies who run at the speed of light, launch lasers and regenerate at ultra speed. Some situations literally turn into Hell and to overcome them without tricks you often need patience and the right spec, since changing a skill can determine life and death as much as objects and manual skill. Once you have found your dimension within the gameplay, the title becomes tight, the combos fit together perfectly and Blizzard's choices relating to Diablo III magically take shape, making the timing game a decidedly apt gameplay choice for the series. Unfortunately at the moment, and unfortunately it's a big deal, the Inferno difficulty can be easier solo given that in a group the cooperation must be perfect to avoid being hit by mobs that, disproportionate for the single player, can kill with a single hit . In short, Abyss and Inferno enhance the gameplay and are addictive despite the numerous and almost inevitable deaths. But things are certainly bound to flatline once you get maxed out. In the absence of PvP and fast farming mechanics, there is the risk that the fastest and most assiduous will find themselves with nothing to do but start a second character, embark on Hardcore mode or devote themselves day and night to auctions and the subtle craft of digital loan sharking. However to break the monotony, and to replace the mythical secret level of the cows, there is the lysergic and colorful realm of the MiniPony and the Care Bears that we can make explode in a sea of blood in search of special objects. And it doesn't mean that there aren't other secrets like a new Black Diablo to be unlocked by selling who knows what items to shopkeepers... by Mattia Armani sanctuary As mentioned above, Diablo III also develops along four acts which correspond to as many main locations. Without going too much into the specifics of the events so as not to risk spoiling anyone's surprise, we can say that from the initial gothic region, the one around New Tristram, we continue through environments that repeatedly mention previous places already known within the geography of the series but which have been completely revised. The alternation of open levels and dungeons is also remarkable for how they are contextualized: underground sewers contrast with the opulence of the arebeggiante Caldeum, impregnable fortresses become more and more gloomy as you go deeper and ancient sacred places in ruins contrast with the wild arrangement of labyrinthine caverns. Visually, especially if we get involved in the new atmosphere, we are certainly facing the best game ever made by Blizzard thanks to the details placed on the dozens and dozens of armor, enemies and structures. The use of the third dimension has allowed the developer, much more than in StarCraft II, to implement a physics worthy of the name which, despite not having real reflections on the gameplay, gives credibility both to the interaction with enemies and to that with the seabed . Many production efforts are at the service of the usual plot orchestrated at Blizzard by Chris Metzen and associates, complete with immense dangers, heroic and demonic figures as well as a perfect savior role for the player. Unfortunately, the ideal need to conclude the trilogy with Diablo III prompted writing a story that starts as hoped, with an engaging mystery, well-introduced characters and a balanced pace, then accelerates out of control and throws a catwalk of equally consummate protagonists onto the track. in a hurry, before a grand finale that fails e.g", "date": "2012-05-25", "grade": "9.0"}
