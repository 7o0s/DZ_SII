Thanks in particular to a series of innovations in the gameplay, and the addition of various game modes, the EA title has been able to satisfy even the finest palates and today it is the best title available on the market for the sport it reproduces. The dream that a large part of fans of the genre has been chasing for some time is to live a similar experience on portable consoles too, and perhaps, let's face it right away, this time this desire has found real foundations in this edition for PlayStation Vita. Without exaggeration we can in fact define FIFA Football as an almost perfect port of its namesakes on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Contrary to what many may think, it is not only FIFA 12, but it is also FIFA 11, in a strange (quite) successful mix that we will dissect and explain in a few lines. But let's proceed in order. The title offers more or less the same methods present in the home counterparts, some of which are however re-proposed for the occasion with some modifications or cuts, except for the Ultimate Team, completely absent here. So in FIFA Football you can play friendlies as always, all the international championships and the various official tournaments of the series (also missing in this edition the Champions League whose rights belong to Konami as is well known) or the personalized ones, the Professional mode as a goalkeeper or footballer, then the online which, however, we will talk about in a little more detail later, and the Career, as always the beating heart of genre productions and specifically of EA sports titles. Like at home The modality in question indeed plays a fundamental role, being the supporting structure of the single player with its formula that perfectly imitates the commitments of a club divided between European, national and championship cups along a whole series of seasons (fifteen) just like in the reality, and consequently potentially guarantees dozens of hours of play for those who like to identify themselves in the role of coach, player (impersonating their own Virtual Footballer, a created footballer or a real one) or both at the same time. In all cases, however, there are the various sections that fans of the series are already familiar with, from the transfer market, made easier to manage as regards offers, negotiations and contracts (no co-ownership which is an almost exclusively Italian practice), to the technical management and team economics. On the other hand, the search for talents and therefore the whole part relating to scouting and the possibility of integrating budding champions into one's own youth team are absent, and the emphasis placed on the last hours of the market seen always applied in the aforementioned FIFA 12. Staying on the subject of shortcomings, also reconnecting to what was mentioned in the previous paragraph, in the game there are not even the EA Sports Football Club and the online seasons. However, the offer in this sense is still rich enough with one-on-one challenges to be enjoyed with friends via Wifi in normal or customized matches, ranked and unranked, within leagues or friendlies, etc. The matches played on the net take place, among other things, in a smooth way, even if in certain situations there is some annoying lag. Closed the parenthesis dedicated to the various game options, it's time to analyze the gameplay. After an initial wary approach, FIFA Football instead lets itself be played with pleasure and immediately shows all its facets, giving matches a depth and variety that are difficult to find in a portable football. The gameplay is at excellent levels and is practically similar to that of the domestic counterpart, although contrary to the other features of the game, in many respects it is, as mentioned at the beginning, borrowed from FIFA 11 rather than from FIFA 12. FIFA 11 and a half? In fact, FIFA Football lacks the precision feint, the impact engine has a role reduced to a minimum and tactical defense is re-proposed in a very simplified version, to the point of being almost absent. The system that manages physical impacts is not in fact as evolved as the one present in the twelfth chapter of the series, but it seems more like a sort of update than the one seen in the eleventh, with a couple of tweaks. Ditto for the part relating to defense, where the tactics and strategy required in FIFA 12 to take possession of the ball give way in the vast majority of cases to the old pressing with the X button and FIFA 11's doubling of marking, albeit in a form less invasive and ~heavy~ thanks to the implementation di a couple of ad hoc functions and to the referees, ready to sanction the most impetuous or continuous contacts. As far as artificial intelligence is concerned, the CPU performs quite well and as the difficulty level increases, the problems for the gamer increase, while as regards the management of tactics, we have substantially unchanged options. For the rest, as always, there is an excellent response to the commands, the possibility of choosing manual controls and, in addition, that of integrating the new Vita touch controls, for a completely renewed management of actions and athletes. Assuming that whoever is reading this review has played at least one episode of FIFA or PES in his life and therefore knows the basic controls of a modern football title, let's dismiss the argument by saying only that they are similar to those of the home versions of the saga, and therefore require the use of sticks, buttons and so on. There are only a few differences in the mapping of a couple of commands due to the Vita's missing R2 and L2 triggers. On the other hand, the speech relating to the functions of the Sony portable platform is different: in this case FIFA Football provides a scheme that concentrates ~its~ attention, as mentioned before, on the front and rear touch points of the console, integrating these specifications with the classic commands, which remain always active. Playstation 3 trophies Fifa Football offers users forty trophies divided into twenty-six bronze, ten silver, three gold and one platinum. To obtain them, you need to satisfy requests such as, for example, totaling a certain number of goals or scoring some using Vita's touch commands, playing and winning in each stadium or making a certain number of saves. A handful of trophies must be unlocked by playing online instead. At your fingertips But let's see how it all works: when you are in possession of the ball during a match, just press your fingertip on the console screen and near the player you want to pass the ball to to serve him automatically with a low shot or a high opening on the opposite band. Depending on the pressure exerted and the distance between the two teammates involved in the action, the CPU will adjust the power, type and precision of the pass, also evaluating some statistical factors such as the technical ability of the player who executes it, his freedom of movement determined by the proximity or otherwise of an opponent to cause him some discomfort and the position and balance of his body. Obviously the same goes for the receiver, who could then block the ball badly or always be anticipated in relation to the parameters mentioned above. To tell the truth, this is not always easy to achieve considering that it can be difficult to manage an athlete with the analog and at the same time use the touchscreen to select a teammate to give him the ball or to take control of him in the event of a defensive action. since the gesture, among other things, also implies covering the user's view for a few moments. More interesting in our opinion is the part relating to the shots. They are performed via the Vita's rear touchpad which is treated by the game as the opponent's goal. When you are near the penalty area or you are inside it, just touch the area of the console corresponding to the mirror of the goal where you want to direct the shot to then see it executed by the player in that direction. For example if you press the bottom right back of the touchpad, the virtual athlete on the field will kick to the bottom corner, and so on. In these cases, instead of the radar, a reproduction of the aforementioned goal appears on the screen, with a circular indicator indicating the point selected for the shot and the goodness of the subsequent conclusion using different colors. This function becomes particularly fun during free kicks, where it is also possible to kick by literally drawing the trajectory on the touchscreen with lots of effect. But not all that glitters is gold: sore points of this feature are the ease with which compared to the home version of FIFA, even players with not very refined feet like Diarra or the good Mariga find the goal from a distance, and the discrete frequency with which involuntary shots are fired simply by accidentally moving your fingers while holding the console. That's it for the part played. We conclude our review by taking a look at the technical part of the product. Graphically speaking, the title is nothing short of impressive considering the platform it runs on, let's not forget, as powerful as you want, it's always porttiles. The textures relating to the field are excellent and well represent the turf, as are the well-made elements that make up the outline, from the structure of the stadiums, characterized by the usual ups and downs in terms of construction to which the counterpart has accustomed us housewife, up to the fans and the elements on the side of the pitch. As for the footballers, they are reproduced quite well and boast extremely detailed polygonal models which, thanks to the excellent work done by the engine and the general graphic cleanliness that it gives to the title, are particularly enhanced in the workmanship of the faces, which appear soft, clean and easily identifiable, at least for the most famous athletes. Even the animations are harmonious and fluid, except in rare cases where you can see drops in frame rates. In terms of licenses, having as always many teams (however the rosters are updated before the January repair market) and championships, the title also offers an excellent reproduction of the shirts complete with sponsors and logos in full view. The sound is also good, which features the commentary in Italian by Fabio Caressa and Beppe Bergomi, the same excellent match audio effects already appreciated in the home counterparts of the production and a series of musical pieces which, apart from some number cuts, is identical to the one heard in FIFA 12.", "date": "2012-02-25", "grade": "8.2"}
