{"name": "Pi fitness per tutti", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/88095-exerbeat-piu-fitness-per-tutti.html", "text": "It can be said that the resounding success of Wii Fit has inaugurated a real new genre, that of fitness video games (although the term is not exactly exact), i.e. tools that theoretically allow anyone to keep fit in their own living room, maybe even having fun along the way. It matters little if the effectiveness of these systems has never actually been demonstrated: many have ventured into this new form of entertainment, and the latest in order of time is Namco Bandai with the Exerbeat present here. Tough exercises for everyone Compared to its main competitors, Exerbeat aims at a more ~playful~ approach to fitness, while not affecting the now established characteristics of the genre. The first thing the user must do after the opening credits, therefore, is to enter some data relating to age, height and body weight, so that the software can calculate with an appreciable degree of precision the quantity of calories burned and so on. Once this is done, you can indulge yourself with the 150 exercises made available in absolute freedom, or set up a training routine according to your needs: you can select your favorite activity categories, decide on which parts of the body to focus your efforts and final goals to be achieved (weight loss, toning, relaxation, etc.), as well as determining the time you want to dedicate to the session. In these early stages, Exerbeat struggles to rival the expertise of Wii Fit and EA Sports Active, honestly much more structured as regards the planning and management of workouts, but still puts the bare minimum on the plate to be simple at the same time and hopefully effective. However, the Namco Bandai title recovers ground when it comes to the six categories into which the exercises are divided, to which the developers have evidently tried to give the widest possible scope in order to please everyone a little. The inevitable section dedicated to classical aerobics is therefore accompanied by those reserved for stretching, the combination of pilates/yoga, hip hop dance, Latin American dance, fit-boxing, karate and its forms; there is not even a part dedicated to the little ones, including 5 mini-games (actually rather weak) in a party game style. Furthermore, there is a particular mode designed for the whole family, in which the results of the various users' physical activity are transformed into kilometers that the Mii associated with the player profile travels on its journey around the world: new ones are unlocked at each stage exercises as well as information relating to the country in which you are stopping, and whoever completes the journey first wins. If the transversal nature of the offer is commendable, the same cannot be said of the overall quality of all the individual establishments, many of which tend to look a little too much like each other: in any case, each of them is marked by an indicator which illustrates how tiring the routine is, so as to allow the player to choose the one that best suits his state of form. Two remotes are enough for me Although Exerbeat provides the support of the Balance Board and even the Motion Plus for some (few, to tell the truth) exercises, the bulk of the experience is faced by holding a Remote and mirroring the movements of the personal trainer on the screen , assisted by the latter's voice instructions and arrow-shaped indicators that indicate which direction to follow. A fairly simple and intuitive solution, but one that doesn't always work properly: sometimes the doodles that appear on the screen aren't very clear, or the coach's advice comes too late, or even a motion detection that's anything but excellent prevents the software from correctly recognizing some movements. In short, the Namco Bandai product certainly does not stand out for its attention to detail, making the comparison with its more illustrious colleagues quite merciless, but all in all it still manages to carry out its duty as a fitness partner without major tragedies. Furthermore, for a more complete experience, Exerbeat recommends using two Remotes, holding one in each hand, a solution that we absolutely recommend to those who want to tackle the exercises with greater precision. Where the game proves to be decidedly unjustifiable, however, is in the implementation technique: certainly not the most important aspect in a product of this kind, but Exerbeat really does its best not to like it. The graphics are really poor, with spartan scenarios lacking in detail, while the characters on the screen (ie the personal trainer and to thesome students who follow him closely) appear woody and poorly defined even for a historically unpretentious console like the Wii. It's even worse from a sound point of view, with objectively bad music that doesn't convince even when it should be an integral part of the experience, or in the section dedicated to dance. In short, considering all the factors involved, Exerbeat is decidedly in the background compared to titles such as Wii Fit and EA Sports Active: we therefore feel like recommending the purchase of the Namco Bandai product only to those looking for a less demanding and less demanding fitness game. that can be appreciated more easily by all members of the family.", "date": "2011-05-02", "grade": null}
