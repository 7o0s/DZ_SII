{"name": "Etherlords", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/etherlords.html", "text": "When it comes to arms stolen from agriculture. Etherlords is a turn-based strategy game with a sprinkling of Fantasy RPG elements and a great imbalance towards the combat phases that are managed with a particular inspiration taken from the ~card-games~ that have depopulated so much in recent times, marking generations of kids. Speaking of a game with RPG elements, we could therefore begin by outlining the plot that forms the background to this title. We could, but we don't want you so badly, so we won't: in fact, the plot is perhaps the worst aspect of the whole game and right from the first frames of the beautiful introductory sequence you will have to press the ESC key to not prolong the torture too much . Let's just say, to do justice to our role as mere reviewers, that the player will step into the shoes of an Etherlord and will have to fight against others for domination of the White Ether. Any television episode of ~Sereno Variabile~ is capable of presenting more interesting narrative cues. The graphic brilliance. But the story (fortunately) is not all and Etherlords is immediately forgiven. This is because the graphic accuracy of this product can already be understood by admiring the game menu. Entering the game sections then (skilfully dribbling the briefing screens that manage to bore even more than the introduction) the pupils will begin to rejoice in the glorious show described by the three-dimensional models that populate the ethereal world. Although by now accustomed to the graphic qualities of games such as Return To Castle Wolfenstein or Battle Realms (just to change the genre) we assure you that seeing our heroes move on the game map or during the combat phases will tire you very late. The Etherlords graphics engine is able to handle about 50,000 polygons in complete fluency, guaranteeing excellent levels of fluidity even on medium/low level systems. The game map can be rotated and zoomed at will and is dotted with an infinite number of secondary animations that contribute to increasing the fantasy atmosphere of this title. The first hours of the game it will be very difficult to believe that what moves on the screen is entirely polygonal, the level of detail of the graphics of Etherlords is in fact ever closer to that offered by entirely two-dimensional titles maintaining that expressiveness which, until now , only two-dimensional graphics were capable of expressing. Another step towards the total abolition of the use of two-dimensional graphics in PC titles. Even the sound department looks good but it won't give us those sensations that the graphic counterpart is capable of doing. Let's run our own empire (pretend) In the game setting Etherlords will immediately remind us of the ~Hereos of Might & Magic~ series, we will have to move our heroes on a three-dimensional representation of the surrounding region and we will have to conquer mines, enchanted buildings, magical artifacts and areas of particular importance in order to be able to appropriate of the resources produced and thus ensure raw materials necessary for the sustenance of the Kingdom and for the research of new magic. Our command center will be the castle: here we will summon our heroes and from here we will be able to launch some special spells capable of influencing the whole region. The heroes will then leave from our fortress and will be able to do only one action per turn, the actions that can be carried out go from those of attacking an enemy entity, to the conquest of a specific structure to the purchase of new spells and runes. Once we start playing, however, we will notice that the management component is much less preponderant than that present, for example, in the titles of the New World Computing saga. In fact, even if ~theoretically~ we would have on our side a certain freedom of action precisely of this kind of game, we will soon realize the few ~strategic~ skills necessary to be successful at Etherlords. In fact, our choices will almost always be forced: this is because different monsters/opponents will be able to be faced only after having made our heroes reach a certain level of experience (in full RPG tradition) and to do this we will have to make them face the various creatures that litter the field of the game in an almost obligatory order (first those with an easier level and then the stronger ones). Let's run our own empire (pretend) This impression is further strengthened by the fact that at the beginning of each level our heroes will lose all powers, experience points and arts.facts that they had earned during the course of the previous mission. The reason for this design choice is very clear: it would have been too difficult to control the player's choices without knowing the power of his pawns in advance, instead by resetting the level of the heroes at each mission, the plot of each campaign can be very easily traced . Too bad that if this on the one hand helped the developers' task on the other it mortifies the player who, after becoming attached to a given character, sees him stripped of his personality and his story with each new mission. Really annoying. For the record it is true that during our movements it will be possible to establish alliances with the neighboring kingdoms but it is however clear the fact that the ~strategic~ management has been designed mainly as a function of the combat phases which, spannometrically, will occupy about 70% of playing time. Ether wears down those who don't have it. As already mentioned above, the fights are almost embarrassingly reminiscent of that Wizard Of the Coast best seller that the pockets of many fathers have cursed: we are obviously talking about Magic The Gathering. Each hero loses the functions of commander, which he instead takes on titles such as Warlords, and takes on the guise of a powerful summoner (Summoner for the most English speakers) with, in his own library, a certain number of spells (spells= and magical creatures ready to be cast against the opposing wizard. The duels will, as expected, be managed in turns. During the fight, all the Spells of our library will not be available at the same time, but they will be ~drawn~ randomly by the computer at each turn in a progressive manner. Each turn subdivides into different phases: that of preparation, that of attack and that of defense.During the first phase we will be able to summon creatures under our control or cast spells of different types, in the second we will choose any creatures which creatures to launch in the attack and in the third we will choose if and how to defend ourselves from the opponent's attack.Each of our creatures can only be used once per turn (you will therefore have to decide whether to use it to attack or save it to defend) and basically has two attributes: the attack power and the defense level . The first value indicates the amount of damage it can inflict while the second represents the number of damage it can absorb before dying. Then there are several ~secondary~ abilities such as self-generation, the possibility of bypassing the defense creatures and inflicting damage directly on the opposing mage and so on which guarantee a truly impressive variety. Ether wears down those who don't have it. Each sorcerer has a certain number of hit points at the end of which he will be considered defeated and a quantity of Ether which represents the raw material of the ethereal world and is essential for casting each spell, obviously the more powerful the spell/evocation is, the more Ether will be required .. Our Ether resources will certainly not be infinite but they will grow more or less quickly at each turn depending on the generation channels each sorcerer is equipped with. Described in this way, the whole process could still seem very simplistic but we assure you that this is not the case and that indeed every duel will be able to excite you a lot. After all, if the so-called ~trading card games~ have been so successful in recent years, there must be a reason ... Too bad that, just like in the games that inspired Etherlords, very often the thin line between defeat and victory is represented by only one thing: luck. Yes, because it's really frustrating to lose some duels just because the computer has picked for us, among the dozens of spells available, only the most useless ones. Multimagic. The Multiplayer section of Etherlords is really well cared for. Through the now widespread GameSpy Arcade it will be possible to go on the Internet and look for an opponent to beat. There are basically two modes: the duel 1 vs. 1, in which all parts of the game unrelated to combat are omitted and the only choices to be made will concern the power of the contenders and the composition of the deck ... oops ... starting library. In the single mission, however, more players will be able to play simultaneously (up to 8) and through alliances, intrigues and betrayals they will be able to spend whole hours for a single game. Obviously this last mode is much more suitable for LAN games (it is also possible to save the game) than for Internet games.t. Although there are many selectable spells (over 130 creatures and dozens of other spells) and despite the fact that it is possible to choose the ~color~ of one's spells (Order or Chaos?) the duels risk falling flat quickly because the spells in play will always be those . After all, it is the ~price~ to pay if you don't want to run into business models like that of ~Magic OnLine~ where players literally have to buy ~virtual~ cards even to play via the Internet. On the other hand, all users of 56Kb modems and similar will be happy because the type of game also lends itself well to lines that are not exactly fast and therefore the Lag phenomenon will be much less wearing than in other titles. Concluding. On balance, despite the splendid graphics and the very particular game system, Etherlords does not appear to be able to face the comparison with the upcoming Warlords Battlecry or HoMM IV, this for some questionable design choices, some ingenuity here and there and a longevity not really insured. But after all it seems that the developers of Nival Interactive have not even tried: Etherlords represents more of a genre in itself and, perhaps, will only have to compete with the release of Magic: OnLine. In short, if you love card games like Magic you will go crazy for Etherlords, if instead you like strategic ~massive~ ones like ~Master Of Magic~, if we were you, we would put the money aside for some other soon-to-be-released title (there is a need again repeating the names) ... but if you have some pennies left over Etherlords is worth it all. Let's Introduce. Fishtank Interactive, the name of a publisher that hasn't been heard of for a long time in the world of electronic entertainment, a name that we will certainly get to know much more about. Gothic and Rally Trophy are just two of the games that come to mind and which represent two little pearls. In particular, Gothic itself, which for a long time risked not even seeing the shelves of shops, worthily represents that type of game which, away from the clamor and the spotlight, manages to amaze everyone thanks to only one great gift: passion. Etherlods itself, although it does not present anything particularly innovative, is presented as a product with attention to every aspect and, above all, enjoyable and playable. But perhaps we are forging ahead, let's start from the beginning ...", "date": "2002-03-29", "grade": null}
