Will the Tamsoft title, published by Bandai Namco, have succeeded in its intent? Many fans of Holly and Benji have been wondering for some time now, since the announcement, and we tell you about it in the review of Captain Tsubasa: Rise of New Champions. The return of Captain Tsubasa Already from the very first test of the title, back in January, the impression was that of a product full of love for the brand and for the fans, poised between success and failure. Making a work like Captain Tsubasa playfully enjoyable, without making sensational slip-ups, is a titanic undertaking, not only due to the nature of the work itself (which, unlike Inazuma Eleven, takes itself more seriously), but also because the needs of the current audiences are decidedly different from those of gamers of the late 90s. Starting from this premise, therefore, let's immediately remove the pebble from the slipper (given the summer period): Captain Tsubasa: Rise of New Champions does not fully fulfill its objective, indeed often and willingly it stumbles over the ball, having it stolen by imperfections and watching it roll in network due to some problems. However, the title has some excellent ideas, some interesting ideas that remain there, however, left to wander in the penalty area without an attacker to push them into the goal. The first crucial point regarding the Tamsoft title is the gameplay. Ludically speaking, Rise of New Champions is fun: seeing your favorites perform certain techniques or conclude an action worthy of the anime is satisfying, very satisfying. The problem is ~how~ we get to create these situations of irrepressible joy. The game offers a somewhat wooden and mostly random in dynamics complex of mechanics, which needs some time to be assimilated. The mapping of the commands (similar to what happens in football simulations) is classic and differs only in the long press of the through ball, cross and shot keys to activate the special techniques combined with them and in the use of the R1 and R2 keys to the techniques of dribbling in attack and tackling in defense. All this must be included in what is a real system of ~paper, rock and scissors~ from anime action games, almost from beat'em up. The skill of the player lies in understanding when the opponent will perform which action and responding with the right counter. Everything must be done in a few tenths of a second and the keystone lies in learning the animations. The problem in this case is that often chance and luck will decide the outcome of these clashes and if you have the misfortune of suffering a lot of dribbling, the field for the opponents will become completely free. The power of customization The other side of the coin related to the gameplay is definitely fun. The pleasure derived from being able to make the Skylab Hurricane to the Tachibana brothers, rather than the Toho Twin Shot to Sawada and Hyuga is great and the depth offered by the title in these terms is remarkable. Whether you're using a created character or existing ones, the possibilities for spectacularity and memorable action are many and incredibly satisfying. However, the playful component does not only concern the field. Captain Tsubasa: Rise of New Champions allows players to indulge themselves even outside the green rectangle, through the New Hero mode. Yes, because within the Journey mode (this is the name of the Story mode of the title) if in the Tsubasa Episode you will retrace (in what serves as a real tutorial) the exploits of Tsubasa and his companions in the third and last middle school tournament , in the New Hero Episode instead you will create your alter ego and lead him to victory in the American World Youth Challenge (not to be confused with the World Youth tournament of the original work). In this mode, divided into two distinct narrative arcs, you can have fun making your character progress, making him interact with other iconic protagonists of the work and you can create your favorite footballer prototype. The great strength of RONC lies precisely in allowing total customization. No one will forbid you to create a defender with tiger shooting or an attacker with Jito's blocking skills. However, like any medal, the opposite face to the great freedom and depth offered by character customization lies in the tedious narrative component thatin both episodes, Tsubasa and New Hero, it is often slow and in its interactivity, which is resolved in multiple choice dialogues, almost useless. A big flaw is the triple story management of the New Hero mode which basically does not guarantee any replayability stimulus after the first run, except that Tamsoft forces the player after the first completion to re-start it twice to unlock the use of the national youth teams of Brazil and the USA, otherwise inaccessible. This choice, which does not include the possibility of choosing which match to play, or skipping the dialogued parts entirely to speed up the matter, really seemed to us one of the biggest flaws in the title. Therefore, if the Tsubasa mode and the New Hero are the backbone of the single-player experience, there are the local versus, the challenges and the online modes to surround and support the end game. The challenges consist in fulfilling certain objectives to unlock: movies, music, elements to be used in the customization phase and an in-game currency that can be used in the shop (which does not include microtransactions) to buy friendship cards (which can be used to acquire new techniques for created players ) and cosmetic items such as shirt styles, boots, or hairstyles. The online modes, on the other hand, consist of both friendlies with friends through the creation of a lobby, and the so-called Leagues. The Leagues involve the use of teams created by the user both in appearance (logo, name, uniforms) and in the composition of the squad (you can choose from all the players present in the game, after unlocking them thanks to the New Hero mode). Each League will ask you for certain conditions in order to register the team and play. For example, the initial league, called the Beginners League, will require your team of 18 players to have an overall rating of 1,100 valor points (the valor is the numerical total that represents the player's overall strength). These tricks make it possible to keep the competition fair and to make the matches balanced, avoiding all the same teams made up of the strongest players in the game. On a technical level, the game has an extremely bipolar structure here too with on one hand the cutscenes, the scripted animations of the special techniques and the special effects that impress the player and help the exaltation factor. On the other hand, the polygonal models of the players, the field, the stadiums and the general technical level of the matches which is decidedly subdued. However, the music saves the situation, decidedly exciting, always spot on and composed of a large group of memorable songs. A striking example of the excellent use of the sound sector is the use of the songs present in the announcement trailers of the national youth teams when their Zone V is activated in-game. We also invite you to finish the New Hero mode to hear a surprise song inserted by the developers in the end credits. Even the Japanese dubbing and the localization of the texts in Italian are expected to be on a good level, an aspect which in the last period should not be underestimated.", "date": "2020-08-27", "grade": "7.0"}
