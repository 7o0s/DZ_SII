{"name": "The Sojourn", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sojourn-recensione.html", "text": "The Sojourn is the first project by independent studio Shifting Tides. The British team, currently made up of only four developers, has created an interesting puzzle game in which the incessant relationship between light and darkness is probed by referring to existentialist concepts on the nature of material reality. Made using Unreal Engine 4, the title is available from the end of September on PC (time exclusive on the Epic Games Store), PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Let's find out more through our review. Playstation 4 trophies The Trophies of The Sojourn are seventeen overall, mostly hidden. Puzzle game in a mysterious land The Sojourn accompanies us to a place with evocative atmospheres, where settings full of colors and relaxing background sounds dominate. In the early stages, all you have to do is follow two small lights making their way through narrow corridors and small open spaces that suddenly take shape as the player passes. The fundamental variable, in this context so rarefied and full of mystery, is represented by the flame that gives access to the so-called dark world. Pervaded by this energy, the surrounding environment changes in tone turning towards blue, causing a momentary alteration of reality. Starting from the path, since some platforms and certain interactions with the objects necessary for solving the puzzles are activated precisely in the instants in which you have access to this alternative plane of reality. The effects of the flame are exhausted in relation to the amount of steps taken in the level, and is pragmatically represented by an indicator placed in the center of the screen. It is precisely on these assumptions that a good part of the concept underlying the game rests: during these phases the user is put in a position to exchange places with the statues present in each level, limiting himself very simply to selecting the object and pressing the right trigger of the pad to translate to the desired position. In some cases it is also possible to insert a statue in a cylindrical section and then see it duplicated in another area of the level, with the effect of unlocking the gate that leads to the next puzzle. Depending on the situation, it is therefore necessary to think about the correct sequence of movements and the positioning of the resources at one's disposal, so as to open a path towards the exit of the section. In addition to the statues, new factors are gradually added such as the harps, which if played with the right timing activate bridges that can be crossed for short intervals of time. Further on, particular projectors of dark light are also introduced which substantially create energy tunnels in which one enters the same status foreseen when one crosses the flame. During the journey, the opportunity to lodge a special relic inside the artifacts is also unlocked, so as to be able to exchange positions or interact with them even if one is not pervaded by the energy of the dark world. The mysterious atmosphere that reigns in the game recalls in some ways that experienced in The Talos Principle, the excellent puzzle game created by Croteam and published on various platforms between 2014 and 2015. On an aesthetic level, however, we have glimpsed small similarities with the buildings and the rarefied atmosphere of The Unfinished Swan by Giant Sparrow, although in the case of The Sojourn the black and white hues have been replaced by landscapes full of bright colors, simple in their structure and equally limited in terms of interaction, but very enjoyable to observe. After the initial section you have access to an imposing building in which you have to try your hand at a series of challenges located on several floors. Each of them involves solving a puzzle, but after successfully unlocking the level exit you can also try to figure out the path needed to reveal a scroll as a bonus item. Inside these documents contain small philosophical maxims of an existential nature, which in some way are linked to the particular place in which the user is immersed, and essentially represent the only indications of a textual nature in addition to the synthetic concepts expressed upon entering each new area. The atmosphere that pervades The Sojourn takes on distinctly dreamlike contours, but is essentially supported almost exclusively by the gameplay. In fact, nothing concrete is explained to us either on the nature or on the origins of the protagonist, just as the information on the particular world in which he operates remains mostly unfathomable. This consideration isand also for the scenery, pleasant to contemplate and yet very static and less characterized than the more noble exponents of the genre.", "date": "2019-10-04", "grade": "7.5"}
