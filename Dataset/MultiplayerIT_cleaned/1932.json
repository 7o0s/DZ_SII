{"name": "Fifa 2003", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-2009.html", "text": "Here is the innovative menu The introductory movie of fifa 2003 is different from the usual, in fact we will not find any scene in computer graphics, but we will see Edgar Davids, Ryan Giggs and Roberto Carlos try their hand at fantastic shots of class. After the introductory sequence we will be catapulted into the initial menu of the game, from which we will be able to choose the numerous competitions available to us. This menu is easy to use and intuitive, divided according to the competition you want to undertake. In the first part of the menu we will be able to choose whether to play a friendly or load previous saved games, whether to set the options or look at the extras available or whether to start a competition that sees all the strongest teams in circulation engage. The other sections of the menu are used for the most important competitions, cups, leagues, etc... Long live the transfer market As the title suggests, in this fifa 2003 we will have the possibility to buy and sell players with other teams in the world. The management of the sale is done very well, in fact we will have the opportunity to try our hand at two different types of transfer market, the first of which will be more simulative while the second will give free rein to our fantasies. The first method is to make transfers once a league has started. In this section we will have a fairly meager initial budget, which will allow us to buy a maximum of 2 medium-high level players. To buy more players we will therefore have to deprive ourselves of some of our men, thus reducing the number of reserves. However, it must be said that the price difference between the most popular Ronaldo (about 35000000) and any of the reserves of each of the big teams (20000000 on average) is not very high and therefore will allow us to buy many of the most famous players in the same circulation. The second method consists in transferring the players from one team to another without having to spend even a penny. This can be done directly from the main menu and, unlike the previous one, it will change the team in all the competitions we will undertake (friendlies included) The kick-off As previously mentioned, fifa 2003 abandons the road of the arcade to undertake that of the simulation. The title has succeeded very well and this has also been demonstrated by the wide acclaim obtained by the public. As with all fifa 2003 versions, it allows the user to use almost all the teams in the world, and to undertake each of the available competitions with them. The players all have real names and are very similar to reality (we will go into more detail in the graphic part). As soon as we take the field and touch the first balls we will notice the difference from the previous versions, in fact it will no longer be possible to take solitary actions from the center of the field and then finalize them with a goal, but it will be necessary to create an intricate and dense network of passages. The race has been changed from previous versions, as now it will no longer be necessary to repeatedly press the key to increase speed, but just hold it down to see our player sprint off like a bolt of lightning. While running, the player will lose much of his manageability, as stretching the ball will no longer be able to have impeccable control. Dribbling past opponents will initially be quite difficult, but over time you will be able (using the right analog) to fake and therefore, sometimes, pass the defender. Unfortunately the hardest part is not overcoming the defense, but finalizing the actions. The goalkeepers in this new edition are very strong and most of the time when they can't reach the ball it's because it goes high or wide. The final result of the matches will depend a lot on the time of the same (logical^_^), by playing a 10 minute timed match it will be possible to reach a total number of goals of 6 or 7, but don't be surprised if sometimes the match will end with a much lower result (juve modena 0-2 nooooo) Also the refereeing, like the rest, is done very well. The referees will not hesitate to issue a yellow card for brutal fouls and a red card for last-man fouls. A possible innovation (I couldn't figure out if it was a mistake or a quality of the game) could be that of the simulation: My player was marking the opponent's attacker, when this shot hit him on the legs with the ball, the my player fell to the ground and the referee blew his whistledo this by cautioning my defender and awarding a free-kick to the opposing team.....simulation? up to you to judge Multiplayer what a passion The game becomes even more fun when played in multiplayer, as fifa 2003 offers us the possibility to undertake championships and cups using 4 teams at the same time. This implies the possibility of playing the championship together with 4 of your friends, so as to give life to a real top quality competition. A fairy tale commentary!! In this new version of the title, the commentary will no longer be made by Bulgarelli and Caputi, but by Bruno Longhi and Galli. As you may have noticed from the title, in this 2003 version not only has attention been paid to creating a dream gamelay with equally beautiful graphics, but the commentary has also been treated very well. In addition to the normal commentary (even the one done very well) it will not be uncommon to hear considerations on interventions, passes or shots on goal, even if unfortunately the jokes about the fouls that characterized the commentary of the two predecessors have been lost. The best done part is the one related to the transformation of a shot into a goal. As soon as this happens the commentators, in addition to praising the player for his performance, in some cases they will recount some events that occurred in the latter's past (for bobo vieri they will remember the number of goals scored at the World Cup, etc...) well done from all points of view and above all able not to bore the user, who on the contrary will most likely derive further enjoyment from the interventions of the magnificent Longhi and Galli. Graphically speaking Graphically FIFA 2003 does not disappoint the public's expectations. Very detailed animations and very well made players are the spearheads of the fifa graphic apparatus. The players (especially Davids Giggs and Carlos) are made with great craftsmanship and really look like the real ones. In many cases these will be recognizable even without having to look at the appropriate indicator. The team shirts are made with care down to the smallest detail and, in addition to the sponsors, we will also be able to see the name and number of the player wearing it. The stadiums and gates are well made and free from defects. The goal net moves very well in contact with the ball and makes a nice effect. Player animations are smooth and real, especially in shoulder-to-shoulder tackles and on-the-fly tackles. Can you let him get away? Fifa 2003 is definitely the best football title on xbox. I recommend the title to all lovers of the genre, but above all I suggest to all those who are looking for a good football simulation to drop into the shops and grab this big title. If on the one hand the new style of play will satisfy lovers of the simulation genre (the majority) on the other it could disappoint those who particularly love the arcade, but on the other hand it cannot satisfy everyone :-( Personally I can only say that this fifa is the best of all time and will be able to engage in a good fight with winning eleven Finally the answer to the question you find in the title is definitely NO Pros: high gameplay Well done animations high realism Official licenses Well done commentary Cons: no editor of players else? The new FIFA Like every year, the new EA football title, the very famous fifa, arrives on all the most important platforms of the moment. As mentioned before, every year we have had the opportunity to test a new version of fifa, but never before have we seen a game so enormously revolutionized by the previous ones. In fact, we had been accustomed to many small changes, graphic and otherwise, which provided the user with the possibility of having more and more fun over the years. With the 2002 world cup version, we had seen an attempt by the developers to imprint the game with a more simulation style (always remaining an arcade one), however with this 2003 version the quality step was taken that transformed this football title into the best simulation present on the microsoft console and on pc, also opening the doors to a clash with the colossus of Konami ..... it will be a good fight!", "date": "2002-11-18", "grade": null}
