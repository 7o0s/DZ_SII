It probably won't be the most convincing title, and moreover a title of launch, to put all the potential of the new consoles to the test, but without a doubt Battlefield 3 is of all the games the one that has most dug a furrow between the old and new generation, and not only in the technical field. Battlefield 4 - even if still with one foot in the current gen (projected towards the future anyway) - can tell us a lot about the initial state of the new machines, thanks to its visual orgy made up of special effects with no expense spared and polygonal mass at a loss an eye, all in the name of a finally high detail and sixty frames per second. Well, let's see how it went. Battlefield 4 is the triumph of teamwork but there are some shadows, even on Xbox One What (not) history! The game offer is the one we all know, that is a campaign, the full-bodied multiplayer complete with a test field to practice with weapons and above all means. Our thought, in this sense, ~flies~ precisely to those planes. The campaign, as we all know by now, is the game's biggest disappointment. Presented in previous meetings not as a simple succession of shootings in different environments, but as the story of men grappling with the brutality of war, attentive as much to ballistics and explosions as above all to the story of the human dimension, it turned out to be completely bankruptcy in this area. Amateurish in writing - almost to the point of involuntary ridicule - and not at all exciting, the Battlefield 4 campaign, however, has some positive notes to point out. The breadth of some environments pushes us to abandon the classic Crysis-style ~binary~, just as the soporific rhythm of the third episode is now finally more sustained. The level design is therefore a strong point of the campaign in various situations, and also the destructibility, generously indicated by the tactical viewer which highlights everything that can explode, undoubtedly make the fights more exciting than in the past. Nothing shocking however, we are certainly not talking about a miracle of inventiveness and variety: a setting is practically recycled a couple of times and more generally there is the constant feeling of already seen, but at least individually the missions are all in all quite fun . But some things go wrong. The usual mediocrity of artificial intelligence greatly affects the sense of immersion in firefights. The level of difficulty is never too prohibitive, the opponents often present in large numbers put us in difficulty, but more often than not their invasive behavioral scripts give rise to paradoxical situations. In addition to frequently standing in the open under our fire, or not seeing the cover falling apart beneath them, they often run towards us without seeing us because their guidelines require them to crouch behind a certain cover, or worse they move in groups without the slightest knowledge of the situation that is developing around them. Moments like this make it much easier for us also because the tactical viewer we mentioned above ~tags~ them, as in Far Cry 3, even through walls, making them always visible; an all too effective advantage. But the thing that left us most amazed is their ability to ~reborn~, to ~respawn~ even in areas that are now free, and this peculiarity is particularly frustrating in conjunction with the often distant checkpoints. A decidedly nefarious combination. Continuing to talk about the problems of the campaign, we must also point out a problem of too much lead tolerance and, even more serious, of the hitbox, the latter defect also present in the multiplayer component. Just shooting between the eyes can instantly kill an opponent, otherwise even at point blank range a shotgun does little damage, as does the assault rifle. Even the sniper semi-autos seem to appeal only to the Chinese and only the far more powerful sniper rifles are effective in any situation. It leaves you dumbstruck to observe the enemies who get back on their feet after two or three hauls and who don't even suffer anything when instead our projectile should be lethal. It seems that sometimes our lead is lost in thin air. On the other hand, the diversification of the guns is decidedly apt, so much variety, and their feeling is very different, which tangibly changes the approach to shootings. For eachWhere So many words spent so far for the campaign, but obviously the real heart of the game is the multiplayer. Finally, sixty frames per second and sixty-four players on the screen arrive on consoles, effectively eliminating everything that castrated the old gen versions. Battlefield at its best, with the plus of the new Levolution feature, or substantial changes to the map, scripted but triggered by the player, which modify the level during the game. Not only aesthetic upheavals, but obviously also in terms of gameplay. We have all seen and played the siege of Shanghai, with the skyscraper collapsing and creating a perfect area for close combat among the rubble, but without a doubt Paracel Storm and Flood are emblematic maps of this spot on and effective feature. In the first, a storm slowly arrives, visibility is reduced by the rain, heavy seas castrate the aim aboard a dinghy or a motorboat. It is also impossible to swim to get in ~stealth~ mode to the capture point on the most distant island. But the most important ~physical~ event is the possibility of freeing the ship anchored offshore to wreck it on the beach, effectively creating a completely new layout. In Flood Zone, on the other hand, we can submerge a small neighborhood by tearing up an embankment, transforming the central buildings into islands in all respects: we start with wheeled vehicles and end up with amphibious ones, then amplifying the fun when we get on roofs, real tuna traps, well structured, full of shelters, side passages and raised areas. Even the maps that don't have gigantic and pyrotechnic events are characterized by a classy level design, which enhances all the possibilities offered by the gameplay, without any class feeling excluded. This is the case of Golmund Railway, huge, probably the largest of the pack, perfect for tanks, equipped with capture points on the move, but also with hilly areas made especially for infantry. We must also mention the ingenious Rogue Transmission. Everything revolves around a gigantic parabola, being able to fight both above and below it, and which, being destructible in several points, can be used to hit those who are below and vice versa. Summing up, the maps in the basic package are perfectly designed not to disappoint anyone, enhancing all the potential of the gameplay. We also like to point out the marked verticality of the level design. Skyscrapers, small buildings, plateaus, valleys, hills and mountains give us the opportunity to always have a good overview of the battlefields, to better manage the complex dynamics of the game, and why not to put into practice effective ambushes with sniper. In terms of content, the two new game modes seemed particularly apt and functional to break the classic routine of Corsa, Conquest and derivatives, or the best way to enjoy all the potential of the game to the fullest. We are referring to Obliteration and Defuse, playable on all maps, where the size of the same and the number of players present change. Obliteration involves us in collecting bombs that appear randomly on the map and then detonate them in the opposing team's control points. Fast and frantic, perhaps a little less tactical than the usual notes, but still a lot of fun. Defuse instead is the exact opposite of Obliteration: reduced maps and zero respawn. Trigger or defuse a bomb. We move with great circumspection, dying immediately due to rashness means putting the final result of the game at risk. To conclude the range of novelties there is the return of the Commander, even from a tablet, which allows us to play even when we are not sitting on the sofa. It works very well, it requires a glance and great speed in predicting the evolution of events, but more generally the concept of teamwork between the ~supervisor~ and the ~boots on the ground~ is well implemented. The concept is simple, the better the team acts in battle, the more help we can give. Time will tell if we can understand it as a full-fledged class; for now our judgment is very positive. Ultimately the dynamics set up by DICE are extremely rewarding, well balanced between the classes, and with a sense of progression guaranteed by many unlocks, class specializations and battlepacks of different rarities to be opened upon reaching a particular score. Here too, however, as written a little further up, there is the problem of the hitboxes. The ranged weapons are all pretty accurate, maybe a little too much, both the pistols and the small onesmachine guns, provided however that they are used with a single shot, but sometimes it seems that the shots are not correctly registered and thus get lost in the void. Venial sin in the campaign, no doubt more frustrating here in multiplayer. Xbox One goals The specific Xbox One objectives are not yet known, but the Xbox 360 ones are well known. To obtain them you have to divide yourself between online and offline play, completing individual missions within the campaign mode, or by making a series of specific kills or by collecting a certain amount of collectibles. Visual orgy? But on a technical level, how are we doing? Let's clear up the resolution controversy right away: Battlefield 4 on Xbox One runs natively at 720p, while the PlayStation 4 version runs at 900p, consequently there is a decidedly high advantage in terms of pixels and clarity for the Sony console, despite an upscale to 1080p which ~spread~ the images a bit. We must also say in all frankness that the Xbox One version tested in the Stockholm review session was not the final one (but practically definitive according to DICE's words less than a month after the game's release) and that according to the developers themselves it lacked some unspecified features and ambient occlusion, a technique that guarantees a better and more realistic lighting of the scene. The general picture is of great impact, both in the exuberant campaign (in terms of effects), and in the more ~normal~ multiplayer, granitically anchored to sixty frames per second, for a generational leap visible even with your eyes closed. The result of these ~deficiencies~ and compromises is a less clean and detailed overall picture than the PlayStation 4 version, with visible aliasing, and a less marked degree of polish. The differences, although not significant, are noticeable: after all, the higher resolution, even net of forced upscaling, makes all the ~impurities~ of the images less visible. We are however talking about a top cosmetics, but which is positioned on the lowest step of the next gen podium.", "date": "2013-11-12", "grade": "8.5"}
