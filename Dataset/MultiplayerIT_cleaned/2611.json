{"name": "Winning Eleven 5", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/winning-eleven-5_a.html", "text": "Looking for an interpreter The menu and all the texts are in Japanese, there is no choice of language, however all the options and settings of the previous version seem to be present, including and expanded Master League, and what should not be underestimated is the possibility of playing friendlies directly with the full club teams and with the real names and values of the squad. Fortunately, the position of the menus has remained unchanged, so just remember by eye where the desired option was previously in the Psone version and that's it. The same thing applies to the team settings menus, which however add something on a tactical level. The game speed bar has disappeared or is hidden between the folds of the ideograms. It is not found by pausing during the match, but by setting the parameters of the latter immediately after choosing the teams there is an option with the possibility of choosing values from one to seven. What is this? That we are given the possibility to set the severity of the referee? Putting on seven I didn't see sudden accelerations of the players, nor even more fulminating shots, but it seemed to me that something changed. If you know Japanese, please contact me. On a tactical level, I really liked the expansion of awareness, or awareness if you prefer. Now, in addition to the possibility of setting both defensive and offensive movements (i.e. right arrow, left arrow), we can indulge ourselves in cuts in the center or outwards, that is, exploiting all the diagonals of the pad cross, as well as up and down. Then in the match we discover the real effectiveness of our choices, exalting ourselves with movements by heart worthy of the best Sacchiano Milan. Kick off Analyzing the mechanics of the game, there are some rather showy changes, which certainly don't prejudice the philosophy behind W.11, but which in any case blow up certain consolidated habits in the more expert players. I refer in particular to the new method of closing 1-2 and crosses from the back. In the first case the matter is more complicated. Simply pressing L1+X is no longer enough. Then the 1-2 opens, you also have to close it, it's not automatic. This involves pressing either the cross button or the pass button, and at the same time you have to keep running the player responsible for the first touch, under penalty of being stunned by the aforementioned who remains at attention. The first impact was dramatic, cries of pain and despair rose from the dumbfounded reviewer, shocked by the passing of this offensive means, but then having discovered the mystery, jubilation and joy returned to the poor man's greatly saddened face. Nonsense aside, getting used to the new method, you immediately understand the increased effectiveness, given that before the 1-2 came from the most expert intuition, favoring timely closures. Crosses from the back are done in the same way, but with very different results and effects. In general we can say that making imperious header goals is more difficult than before, positioning the player on the trajectory of the ball and pressing the shot button in time is fundamental to say the least, even if advances on the near post seem to be more frequent. As a rule, with the exception of parabola crosses (single press), each pass to the center is faster and more tense. My optimal scheme provided for the arrival on the back, to then carry out a half-height cross (double pressure), to take advantage of either the attacking midfielder's or the central forward's insertions from behind. Now it is no longer possible. Arrived at the baseline, out of breath from the umpteenth bucking as well as from the most intoxicating dribbling carried out, in an extreme simulative impetus that wants to faithfully render the loss of lucidity after a prolonged effort, we witness a festival of busted throws in mouth to the goalkeeper or the near post. Brilliant idea and perfectly implemented in line with their own ideas by the programmers, but perhaps a little too real in a video game. And we know that too much reality leads to frustration in the videogame field. The consequence of all this pistolotto is that the triple pressure is preferred, the low shot that cuts the area diagonally, or the classic Di Livio-style feint to cross back to the goal which clearly slows down the action in speed favoring the positioning of the opposing defenders, and in many cases offside, complete with a central defender who calls him by raising his arm. So the same story of the 1-2 is repeated. The other gameplay additions are nothing short of exceptional and at the same time beautiful to look at. The programmers have learned Pippo Inzaghi's lesson perfectly. The balloonsthey are strenuously defended, spreading their arms and leaning on the marker, making it extremely difficult to advance. Then the first touches are beautiful, with applause animations, in case you pass the ball on the fly by jumping or heading. The withering counter-attacks are then served on a silver platter. Reality or video game? Returning to a more classic system of the review, it would be right to spend a few words on graphics and sound. W. 11 is undoubtedly a feast for the eyes. The first things that catch the eye are the extraordinary fluidity of the title and the total absence of jaggies. The animations are amazing (new ones have also been added regarding goalkeepers and light tackles) and the skins applied to the polygonal models are terrific. The reproduced faces of the real counterparts are most often the same as the original. Del Piero and Davids are identical, unkempt beard and tamarri goggles included, Toldo looks more like Turci, and if it weren't for the white band he would mistake Totti for Baronio. However, I repeat, they are the most beautiful and plausible skins that have appeared so far. The stadiums are qualitatively fluctuating. The actual structure and the smoke bombs are Oscar-worthy. The level of detail is impressive, too bad for the public, clearly two-dimensional and characterized by poor graphics quality to say the least. The textures of the terrain are impressive, as is the effect of the weather conditions on it. San Siro is also unwatchable here, and even in the fiction of the game, the physics of the ball is affected by the holes. The rain effect that was laughable in the Psone versions is now beautiful and realistic, complete with a heavy field and attached Fantozzi puddles. In my opinion, the gap between the areas in the sun and those in the shade of the ground is shocking. Depending on where the player is located, it's hard to put into words, the brightness, NOT the quality of the textures, changes. They shine in the sun (which seems to have different intensities), and suddenly darken in the shade of the stands. Exceptional. Even the sound is attested to levels of excellence. John Kabira is in splendid form, the sampled choirs elicit smiles and applause. Unfortunately the new sound effect of the ball on the post reminded me of the infamous dull thud of Di Biagio's penalty at the Saint Denis stadium, however it is very beautiful. The referee's whistle in the case of double and triple whistles is rather out of breath. ? Perfect? Almost... In the end, however, there are also major flaws, which in some cases can lead to frustration for less patient players. The first and, in my opinion, more conspicuous, is the occurrence, fortunately not always, of a very annoying delay in the response to pressing the keys. Clearly this involves an endless series of sensational blasphemies, in case the good moment is lost, ending up fiddling with the ball at his feet, thus facilitating timely closures or making inaccurate passes. The same thing happens for volleys, and above all for robbery touches inside the small area. It would be better not to try to block the ball 2 meters from the goal line, and instead even pressing the shot button at the same time that the ball is within reach of the boot, we will often see our player carry the ball forward in the grip of an almost morbid attachment to the ball, so much so as to favor the recovery of the opposing goalkeeper. The goalkeepers are decidedly scandalous. They may also be animated by God, but they just do their homework, in fact they score goals on diagonal shots that make their arms fall. They are decidedly lackluster, and sometimes do not even dive (and when they do many times they are late), assuming a position somewhere between the mushroom picker and the electrocuted lumbago. Less frequently we see colossal sleep from the players, who caught in the middle don't know where to go to close, standing still impaled so as not to do anyone an injustice. As expected, real trademarks of the Winning 11 series remain, such as the keystrokes that remain in memory, or situations in which the CPU takes possession of the players' movements (such as when you involuntarily try to recover a ball on the wire of the lateral out, then ending up giving it to the opponent, given the poor ability to control the ball in the race), but that's the game, let's be satisfied. Final whistle Winning 11 5, graphics aside, adds very little new to the previous version.Depending on the interpretations this can be good or bad. Personally I think this is a positive fact, a pity for certain defects that partially prejudice a judgment of absolute excellence. In other words, the soul of the title has remained intact, pure simulation has not been sacrificed on the altar of immediacy and cheap playability, and I think this is the best thing. For now, the title is globally slightly lower than I.S.S. PRO 2 for Psone, but if as usual the European release brings corrections and adjustments, then in October we will have the most beautiful sports title ever on our hands. I now leave you with BOC's comment which you will find on the next page. Pros: It's Winning Eleven! Great graphics and cool animations Real player names Friendlies between club teams Cons Slow response to commands Some annoying bugs Very poor goalkeepers BOC's comment As mentioned above by the good old GOZZER, this bi-review was chosen both because the title in question is one of those games that every Ps2 owner can't wait to be able to play (so better two voices than just one right!?) but above all because we are both fans of the Winning 11 series since its first incarnations on the good old Super Nintendo, when it was still called Perfect Eleven! Having played practically all the chapters of the saga, I was able to appreciate how over time the programmers have succeeded in the difficult aim of improving a product that made people cry for a miracle at each of its releases, making the players amazed from time to time, thanks to countless innovations that have brought the game to levels of excellence never seen before. I state that I had great difficulties (especially in the way of playing) in the ferry between WE 3 Final Version and WE 4 and honestly it took me some time to fully appreciate the new title. The transition to the more recent WE2000 was less traumatic since it was only an upgrade of the previous version and indeed some errors were corrected. With this premise, you can imagine the spirit with which I approached the PS2 pad for the first time! I was terrified that my established schemes and tactics would be irrevocably lost due to a revamped game system, but on the other hand I certainly wasn't hoping that WE5 would be a better copy of its younger brother.I wanted a new game, better, seen and considered that Konami has accustomed us to these businesses for years now. BOC's comment At this point you will rightly want to know if my expectations have come true? I will answer with a philosophical NO!!! Now let me explain. The game is actually different, even if the underlying mechanics remain the same; as far as graphics and other things are concerned, I refer you to what GOZZER wrote above because he was very exhaustive and said what I think too. Regarding the gameplay aspect, I was a little disappointed because the hateful bugs that afflicted the previous versions have returned, first of all the response of the commands. It is unacceptable that there are delays in response when a button is pressed: if I decide to pass the ball to a teammate, everything must be immediate and not even a second can, indeed must not, pass! On the contrary, we often find ourselves with players who continue on their way or who are motionless, without carrying out the commands given by you. All this given that over the years the problem in question had been more than solved. Another note about goalkeepers. They are a little more clumsy than usual and score really stupid goals, leaving a bit of bitterness and frustration in the player who probably had worked very hard to keep the advantage and can be seen reaching and maybe overtaking in two seconds due to gross errors by the goalkeeper . I conclude my analysis of the ~problems~ with a rather subjective aspect: the movement of the players. By now the movements have become hyper-realistic and this makes the game a bit too cumbersome in my opinion, especially in performing manual dribbling (I'm not talking about the automatic feints) which are now really tough to make, but as I anticipated, this it is an aspect that some might even like, but which did not convince me. For the rest, however, we are faced with Winning 11 in all respects and without any problem it can be awarded the palm of best football title currently available for Ps2, a game that will unquestionably give many beautiful hours of play to all those who decide to buy it.
