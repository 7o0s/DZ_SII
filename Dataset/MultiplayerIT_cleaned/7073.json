The most widespread home systems were absolutely unable to reproduce the wonders that illuminated those slot machines on which many early gamers grew up, videogame speaking. Usually you went to a fixed arcade, where you knew the individual games and the layout of the coin-ops by heart. Every now and then we allowed ourselves some escapades to find out what the other arcades had to offer and maybe learn about some titles that never arrived in ours. We add that it was the clear demonstration that the image of the solitary gamer was just a commonplace even then. Many friendships were born by exchanging advice on how to overcome a Gun Smoke boss or by playing titles like 1943 together. And how can we forget the classic group of bullies, who never failed to persecute the other patrons while they played, trying to steal their game or beating them up? directly without any reason, just to reiterate that they were in charge? Well, that too was a form of socialization (not very pleasant, let's face it). The important thing, however, is not so much to know the individual anecdotes, but to understand that it was a more complex ecosystem than it might seem to those who observe it from afar, without having known it directly. Complex and remained in the heart of those who lived it. Among these we can also include who is writing this article. You will therefore understand the happiness felt in knowing that someone was creating a management system dedicated to that world, now almost completely gone, or in any case become something else where it survived. Arcade games are back in Arcadecraft, an all-too-casual management system that didn't quite convince us What is Mouse? Firebase Industries' Arcadecraft puts us in the shoes of an early eighties arcade manager. The aim is to make it grow in fame and turnover in a period ranging from 1981 to 1986 (actually you can also play for all of 1987, but without new coin-ops to buy). At the beginning we have to choose a name for our business, then the gender of the manager and finally take action by getting our hands on the first bins and customizing the environment. The first flaw of Arcadecraft emerges as soon as you start wanting to do something, since it takes little to understand that the game interface is designed to be managed with a joypad, with a cursor that moves on a chessboard where you have to grab and drag the objects box by box, without being able to do it freely using the classic mouse pointer. The same goes for the selection of already positioned objects, which must be reached by the cursor and clicked with different keys depending on the action to be performed. In short, Arcadecraft is a management system, a typical genre of the PC world, but it seems to try everything to annoy those used to playing especially with a mouse and keyboard. If you want we add that even the management of the camera is as cumbersome as that of the objects and you will have understood that we are facing a half-disaster, unless we attach a joypad to the PC and pretend nothing happened, which is what we did to write this review. Minimal management Unfortunately Arcadecraft is also very lacking from a management point of view, which is its most unforgivable defect. In fact, the player is only required to buy coin ops and place them in the only available environment, which cannot be modified except in some cosmetic elements, which we will discuss later. Taking into account some factors, such as the variety of genres of the games purchased, useful for attracting the public, or the positioning of the bins, which must have a minimum of harmony avoiding holes or dead zones, the manager's job ends here. Yes, we are not kidding. Each coin-op has its own price and, depending on the fame of the arcade and that of the game itself, customers will be more inclined to invest their coins in it or not, making our bank account grow. The problem is that absolutely nothing happens in Arcadecraft. Indeed, there are four events, but they are only four (a few more, in reality) and they are repeated for all the years of the game. At the beginning it can also be fun having to reposition all the coin-ops due to a blackout, or having to kick a customer out of the room who kicks the machines in frustration, or even repair the faults that must be included in ordinary maintenance , but in the long run these are tiring activities. Sometimes it happens that a collector wants to buy one of our cars at insane prices, other timesI think we are offered an exclusive coin op, but otherwise nothing really happens to add some spice to the monotony of the gameplay. Let's also assume that our main activity, as machines and success increase, will become the coin dispenser (it must be done by hand, but you can hire an employee to help us, even if the substance changes little) and you will understand that it takes very little to want to play any other title one has installed on the PC. The coin box is stuck Each month, a summary of the results will appear, with the money earned and the expenses incurred. We will also be notified of the release of new coin-ops, produced by different houses, which we will be able to buy to replenish our collection or replace the old ones (the latest games will always attract more customers than the past ones). The coin-ops themselves should be Arcadecraft's strong point, and in reality they are (there are more than a hundred to buy), except that they too only require superficial management, almost like a casual title. The only two factors that can be modified in each chest are the price of the single game and the level of difficulty. What do they entail in terms of gameplay? Nothing, at least in our experience. Every time we have tried to increase the price of coins we have seen a slowdown in coin-op revenue, even lowering the difficulty level of the game to try and balance. Basically, the winning strategy turned out to be the same for all the years of play, even at the peak of success: leave the lowest price and keep the difficulty level on medium. To make you understand how superficial the management part is, it is enough to know that the years with the greatest influx of new coin-ops are the first. Where is the problem, you may be wondering. Well, it's the time when you have the least money. When economic well-being is reached such as to be able to buy what one wants, i.e. in the last years of the life of the business, there are not enough machines to choose from and one simply ends up buying all those available, without discernment, gradually selling the older machines. In short, the chests are also graphically well done and many recall famous real titles, but curiosity does not last very long, also because you don't have much time to observe them closely (they are not playable), having to constantly empty the coin acceptors. Also from a technical point of view Arcadecraft is really poor. The coin-ops are nice, but the rest is lacking in every way. The arcade is ugly and lacking in variety in appearance. Of course, it can be customized, but the customization options are very few and often result in changing a few colors. Do you think that in addition to the coin-ops, the only other purchasable items are a jukebox, a vending machine and two seasonal decorations: a pumpkin for Halloween and a fir tree decorated for Christmas. In short, the contents are in short supply, even if the developers have promised new ones as soon as possible. For now, however, the situation is desperate.", "date": "2014-06-06", "grade": "4.0"}
