Another point to consider is that at the price indicated in the box on the left, you can take home both parts that make up the complete game. At the moment, however, only the first part is out - it's difficult to give a definitive judgment on the first half of a game, but for the record, let's start talking about it. If you are new to the series you may want to wait for the second part to come out before buying Broken Sword 5. The good news is that it is not necessary to have played the previous episodes to appreciate the new work of Revolution Software. The masterpieces of art remain so although appreciated in later periods, or almost always. However, they are children of their historical period: there was a time to shoot Apocalypse Now, write The Brothers Karamazov and develop Broken Sword. To expect that after eighteen years the same type of game could still surprise and make millions of players cry for miracles would be nave and unfair to the author. What do we expect, then? A solid adventure, which honors the name it bears and does not horrify its fans, thanks to which Revolution Software raised the $771,560 on Kickstarter that made this new chapter of the saga possible. So let's see what happened with Broken Sword 5: The Serpent's Curse - Episode 1. George and Nicole's new adventure begins in Paris and immediately strikes us for the quality of its images. The backgrounds are splendid postcards of the French capital, a riot of colors illuminated by an intense and warm spring light. The short trip to another famous European metropolis only enhances the leading role of Paris. Above all, the cleanliness and detail with which the objects have been designed facilitates the task of discovering the sensitive points, without the need for the horrible function that puts them on display; a modern shortcut that Broken Sword proves to us is unnecessary, if the developers know what they're doing. The characters of the adventure move on this enchanting scenario, drawn in a cartoon style that we promote unreservedly. The final effect is convincing and just admire a close-up of George and Nicole to dispel any fears. If you don't know, in fact, this series has suffered due to the inconstant choices in the graphic representation, which has passed over time from two to three dimensions: we are convinced that the 2.5D of Broken Sword 5 puts everyone in agreement. Another nice surprise concerns the subtitles, which are immediately present also in Italian. Too bad for the dubbing and the filmed sequences - the latter two in all - which could have been treated more. But they are trifles compared to the other strengths of Charles Cecil's new artistic direction. Broken Sword 5 - Episode 1 is only half the game - it's not perfect, but it's an authentic Broken Sword Couple of the year Charles Cecil's inspiration is everywhere in this fifth episode and once again gives us an adventure with a well-defined personality: a quality that is difficult to define that allows it to leave a mark beyond its limits. Strengths and weaknesses do not oppose each other, but rather mix in a satisfactory amalgam. Let's take the cast of characters for example: there are stereotyped caricatures that invade the scene a bit, realistic characters and others that are over the top, some well defined and intense like Bijoux, others still barely sketched, but it's impossible not to promote the whole group if let's add George and Nicole to the carousel of faces. The complicity between them whenever they're together on screen, and it happens often, is magical. The polite and sober, but not naive, American insurer and the shrewd and decisive reporter are the best couple of 2013, at least as far as video games are concerned. Therefore the subdued supporting actors count for little: in the end the set of personalities seduced us. Even the humour, despite often leaving us cold (and sometimes on purpose: that's George's style) suddenly elicits two full, unexpected laughs from us. So while we can't call Broken Sword 5 a brilliant comedy, it does leave us with a lasting feeling of sympathy. This discord of elements, which on the whole however pass the test, also concerns the plot. As was to be expected, Cecil's fascination with religious conspiracies returns - and we do too, to tell the truth - but half the time it's hard to feel genuine interest in the affair. The powerful start with a dummy and uTheft is also fine, except that the presence of George and Nicole at the scene of the event is willed by Providence, and it is known that when stories are moved by an arbitrary fate, the result is never satisfactory. But then, slowly at first and then with increasing vigor, the story unfolds layer by layer like an onion, demonstrating the depth we all expected, and previously noted flaws are more readily forgiven. It's just a pity that when the plot has finally hooked us, the curtain suddenly drops and leaves us there, sitting in front of the monitor, in the company of our frustrated desire to know how it continues. Obstacle course The puzzles of Broken Sword 5 have the great advantage of always being justified by events. It never happens to think: ~hey, it's time for a puzzle~, as if it were an element detached from everything else. And in fact to find the solution it is necessary to think about what George wants to achieve and the situation in which he finds himself. Nothing complex however: the answer to the puzzle is usually found in the same screen or in the adjacent one. Even if in some moments of the game we turn to a map of Paris, the road ahead is a straight line, and there is no need to tread much or puzzle over to pass the tests. In addition, a very explicit help system is always present to get the player out of trouble. The quality of the ideas is good, we particularly liked the puzzle of the neon writing, because it was cleverly designed to highlight the personality of a secondary character. Cecil took care of every detail, and was able to justify even one of the typical nonsensical actions of adventures, like showing your objects to everyone. Instead of preventing the player from doing so, the author of Broken Sword has found consistent answers for everyone, so that we can always ask someone if by chance they need the nail clippers that we carry in our pockets without feeling like a complete idiot. The dialogues are well written and you can choose whether to view them in the old-fashioned way, as you can see from the photos, or in the form of boxes that are clearly visible on the screen. George only collects the essentials, without becoming a ridiculous object-carrying truck, but a moment escaped Cecil when Nicole makes a floor-washing mop disappear under her jacket. And speaking of the two: even if they have to work together, alternating between one and the other is never about solving a puzzle: at certain points in the game, Nicole simply becomes the protagonist of the action. These parts are less successful than those where only George is present or both together (the best, definitely) and seem designed only to lengthen the duration of this first part of the adventure, which is around six hours. Only one flaw stands out that spoils the party, the inexplicable delay between one line of dialogue and another. This waiting gets on the nerves and dampens the rhythm of the dialogues, making them extremely impatient. If we add the difficulty of the characters in finding their way to an object, the frustration is felt enough to undermine an experience that would otherwise have been much more fluid and fulfilling.", "date": "2013-12-11", "grade": "7.7"}
