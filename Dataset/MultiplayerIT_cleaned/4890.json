The vicissitudes of the two most famous roosters in the world are in fact now well dated, considering that in 2019 the comic had blown out its first sixty candles. The production of new video games of an appreciated series should make everyone happy; however our readers will have already noticed that the results are not always rosy, first with the review of Asterix & Obelix XXL 3 in 2019, more recently with that of Asterix & Obelix: Slap Them All! of 2021. After just a year, in fact, we are once again grappling with a third iteration which is a little more than a pleasant experience. Continue reading our review of Asterix & Obelix XXXL: The Ram From Hibernia to understand what's new, how much has been recycled, and overall the reasons for our doubts. Plot and structure: these Romans continue to be crazy The glance of Asterix & Obelix XXXL: The Ram From Hibernia is very often satisfied Rather than taking a cue from one of the countless comics from the golden age of Goscinny and Uderzo, with Asterix & Obelix XXXL: The Ram From Hibernia the developers preferred to propose an unedited and carefree story, perhaps imagining to address an audience of casual gamers or however not perfect connoisseurs of the starting narrative context. The plot, in fact, appears devoid of who knows what pretensions and boasts few innovative elements worthy of interest even for historical fans: in Hibernia (present-day Ireland) the Romans are practically one step away from conquering the village of the rooster Irishcoffix, who then sends his daughter Keratina to ask for help from the cousins of the continent.Keratina explains that a large part of the problems is linked to the disappearance of the beloved Irishcoffix's golden horned ram; obviously, in Gaul, Asterix and Obelix sometimes don't think about leaving as single representatives of an improvised relief expedition, because any excuse is good to beat up some Roman. To get to the end credits of Asterix & Obelix XXXL: The Ram From Hibernia takes little, from four to five hours, depending on your pace of play. The speech is different if you try to get all the gold medals of each single level. In this case you will have to replay them one at a time (and more times, presumably) respecting a whole series of parameters, for example completing them within a certain number of minutes. The structure of the product is extremely simple and linear: the story binds together a series of scenarios (six in all) that are simply juxtaposed with each other; within the individual game areas, each level does nothing - in turn - than juxtapose other explorable terrain. In this context, the player must clean up a given area from all the Romans present, unlock access to the next one, and continue to the bitter end: nothing more, nothing less. The simplification is truly remarkable, even if the level design has not been excessively impoverished compared to the last 3D chapter dedicated to the historic duo; as well, a certain lack of creativity and any willingness to experiment are evident. Gameplay: barrel from orbi seen from above Boat fights? Asterix & Obelix XXXL: The Ram From Hibernia has those too In the wake of the previous chapter which has already been mentioned, Asterix & Obelix XXXL: The Ram From Hibernia also inherits the bird's eye perspective: basically you will therefore find yourself playing, on the gameplay side, an action title with an isometric view similar to that of the more recent Diablo. You can control both Asterix and Obelix, and switch between them at any time, but not other characters; this is quite strange, considering that the production is basically designed for sessions of up to four players at the same time. Exclusively locally, because the internet apparently hasn't arrived in Gaul yet. None of the characters can jump, the mechanics aren't really present; but the ideas, although repeated to exhaustion, are not lacking in any case. At least the peculiar characteristics of the two roosters have been maintained: Asterix is much lighter than Obelix, and can therefore dash in the air towards other raised platforms, to advance along the path (the bigger companion would end up with them collapsing); for his part, Obelix can however move massive elements of the scenario, because of the two he is the one who fell into the pot of the magic potion as a child! Collect and throware objects represents the real novelty of Asterix & Obelix XXXL: The Ram From Hibernia All levels include crazy fights against those crazy Romans: all you have to do is beat them up from the first to the last, often eliminating the field tents that allow their continuous regeneration. Everything has therefore remained unchanged compared to the past, except the possibility of collecting various types of objects from the ground and then using them as weapons. There is not much difference between chicken legs, fish and spears: all weapons, from your own to improvised ones, inflict more or less the same damage and wear out the same way. Even the Romans, if stunned by the blows of the roosters, can be challenged - taking them by the feet - and used as blunt instruments. Several other features combine to make Asterix & Obelix XXXL: The Ram From Hibernia a not exactly memorable title. Passes for the absence of online multiplayer, also passes for a level of difficulty deliberately calibrated downwards: the repetitiveness of the situations is excessive, the enemies are always the same, there is no progressive evolution of the protagonists' skills, and overall the whole adventure - net of all this - it can also be completed in no time.", "date": "2022-11-11", "grade": "6.5"}
