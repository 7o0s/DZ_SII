{"name": "Un'avventura occulta", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/107409-yesterday-unavventura-occulta.html", "text": "Part Memento and part Dan Brown, Yesterday is the most recent of the graphic adventures created by the Madrid-based Pendulo Studios team. Initially released on PC and published in Italy with the more banal name of New York Crimes, the game has also recently arrived on iPhone and iPad with a practically unchanged conversion of the original, re-proposing on mobile that very successful mix between intriguing atmosphere, original graphic style and well-constructed dialogues that the authors of Runaway had delighted us a few months ago. A cult to rule them all... Being an almost identical port, Yesterday does not see any novelty in its narrative plot: in a blend of investigation and paranormal, the player takes on the role of Henry White, a boy with glasses and a bit of a nerd who, while doing research on the mysterious disappearance of the homeless of the city, comes into contact with a religious sect led by what appears to be a duo of Sciroccos. This at least initially, because once you have passed a fascinating introduction and completed the first puzzles you go to check John Yesterday, an investigator expert in occult rituals and satanic sects who, in the most classic of clichs, seems to have lost his memory. With the help of White, now a millionaire head of a multinational corporation, John must retrace his steps in the hope of remembering who he is and what mysterious case he was working on. In short, between the paranormal, satanic cults, murders and sexual references, Yesterday is definitely proposed as a story aimed at a mature audience, although the subtle humor between the lines of dialogue and the numerous thoughts of the protagonist takes care of eliciting some forced smiles. The plot from time to time makes some excessive leaps, leaves some explanations on the street and forces the player to think abstractly in an attempt to patch up an interesting script but which looks like an old puzzle that is missing some pieces. Nothing to say instead about the dialogues, entirely translated into Italian and able to slightly revive a cast of characters who, with a few rare exceptions, really struggle to emerge for charisma and personality, where everything is further enhanced by extremely agreeable. The merit is in large part of the cartoon and caricature graphic style that has already characterized the previous productions of the Spanish development studio, but an excellent work of shots and directorial tricks make Yesterday one of the most visually successful point and clicks among those present on the App Store . As for puzzles, the game looks like a decidedly classic adventure, with an inventory in which to keep the objects found and combine them to create new and useful tools. To streamline the experience and avoid confusing the player too much, Pendulo Studios has made sure that the characters, in one way or another, abandon objects that will no longer be useful during the game, while great attention has been paid to the double aid system for less patient and savvy players. Through the touch of a key it is possible to highlight all the objects on the screen with which it is possible to interact, thus avoiding getting stuck for not having seen that piece of paper under the bench. The second aid, which can also be activated on command, is decidedly more decisive and gives the player a clear suggestion on what to do or which object to use: in theory, to activate these clues, the player should first load an indicator by making attempts independently, but the less patient can easily find a way to override this system and abuse it.", "date": "2012-08-27", "grade": "7.8"}
