{"name": "Tony Hawk's Project 8 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tony-hawks-project-8-recensione-2.html", "text": "Tony Hawk has been a gaming fixture, synonymous with console skateboarding for the past 8 years. The series, already very well known in our parts, is practically mythological overseas, where the episodes of the Man-Hawk are practically comparable, in terms of proselytism, to FIFA or Pro Evolution Soccer in Italy. Neversoft's success was built almost entirely from the first two episodes, still considered the best today, which achieved enormous success with critics and audiences, placing themselves in the top ten of the best video games ever in various sector newspapers. The brand then went diluting in the following episodes, as often happens, failing to maintain the high quality level and getting lost in game solutions and fluctuating settings. With the last digression, American Wasteland, the saga seemed to be directed towards the ascent of china, a sensation confirmed by the latter Project 8, which undoubtedly rearranges the course on a more convincing road. Project 8 The story is extremely simple, as befits a skateboarding game on the other hand. In fact, you impersonate the boy on duty with a passion for skateboarding on wheels, who happens to have an opportunity not to be missed: in fact, there is none other than Tony Hawk himself in the city, and he is looking for a team made up of the 8 best skaters in the area to create his own personal crew. Project 8, in fact. The whole game is based on trying to climb the ranking of the best 200 skaters up to become part of the top 8, and the road is obviously very long, since our hero will be forced to start from the last place. From the beginning, every race we participate in, every mission undertaken and every single successful trick performed will increase the score, which will gradually allow the long climb up to success. In addition to the legendary Birdman, there are several professionals included: among them some elements of the (relatively) old guard such as Bob Burnquist or Rodney Mullen, but there are several new introductions, with younger and particularly talented skaters such as Ryan Sheckler, Nyjah Huston and Paul Rodriguez, all faithfully reproduced (well, let's say with ups and downs) and inserted into the fray. It's a skate world A big novelty introduced by Neversoft in this new chapter is the large playing area made available: an entire city has been modeled to be able to be traveled freely far and wide with a skateboard, without intermediate loads or too many invisible walls, apart from those that delimit the areas to be unlocked by continuing in the game. At the end of the initial loading we will be faced with the choice of the character from a list of pre-established models, which can then be modified through the typical editor: the selectable models, unfortunately, are not that great and the editor is one of the poorest seen in the latest titles released , Sin. At this point, we are ready to launch into the big city by leaving the house directly, initially sowing panic and destruction only in the neighborhood, but soon opening the way to all the rest of the reachable neighborhoods. The city is vast and very varied, full of passers-by and skater, and the fact of being able to turn it freely gives the pleasant sensation of being faced with a sort of free-roaming on a board, rather than closed within small patterns separated by millennial loads. The scenarios range from the playground, to the school, to the city center: settings already seen in other sauces, but never so homogeneous and closely connected to each other. In some cases, the areas must be unlocked through the achievement of some particular objective , such as completing certain ~missions~, until the complete opening of all the available areas. A demanding job The whole game is based on the accumulation of points necessary to increase personal stats (divided into the various fundamental skills of skateboarding) and climb the ranking of the best skaters on the square: the ways to achieve these objectives are countless.Essentially, every trick performed, roaming freely around the playing area allows you to earn points, but there are more profitable methods, consisting of ~missions~ and ~challenges~. The missions are often triggered by meeting some characters who populate the city, and who will ask you to do the most disparate things: there is the photographer who will force you to perform particular tricks in certain points, the boy who will offer to shoot your demo, which you will have to chase by performing the moves it will show you gradually, or some characters who will trigger the typical phases defined as ~Classic Mode~, a legacy of the previous episodes. In these cases, we will be faced with a time limit within which to executevarious tasks, such as knocking down signs, pulling off particular jumps, collecting the letters that make up the word skate or combo, and more. Things we remember from the first chapters of Tony Hawk. Then there are the challenges with the Pros and the competitions: the first are triggered when within the various areas we come across the professional skaters who are part of the cast chosen by Activision, who will challenge you in some techniques of which they are specialists. Competitions, on the other hand, are races, which are held in specific points on the map. These are divided into two distinct parts, in the first the minimum score must be achieved to enter the competition, which will constitute the second part.Each event mentioned can be concluded with three different results, each characterized by a minimum score to be obtained for be achieved: AM, Pro and Super, the higher result will obviously mean a greater amount of positions climbed in the global ranking. Nail the trick Nail the Trick mode is probably the most interesting addition in Tony Hawk's game structure. Imagine the scene: you head at high speed towards a cliff, or a particularly high jump, as soon as you are in the air, press any of the analogs and the magic is triggered. Nail the trick The camera zooms in on the skater and board, time slows down in a magnificent slow-mo that focuses all attention on the trick, and the two analogs will allow you to freely control the legs of the character. Through light movements of the sticks, brief touches are made on the board, capable of making it rotate and move in different directions. Nail the trick With the right lightness and good timing, it is possible to trigger devastating combos up to the last centimeters of flight, before landing. Exhilarating. What's new Beyond the graphics, the first novelty that stands out in this chapter is the vastness of the playing area and the freedom of action allowed within it, but this also brings with it a negative note: the design is not always convincing of the settings. The entire city is far too full of ramps, low walls, spines, overhead railings and half pipes, not to mention the ability to grind on virtually any surface. For example, one of the first missions will require you to attach posters by performing wallrides on different walls: the main difficulty lies in being able to holly in the exact segment to gain altitude and reach the wall, because if you press too soon the Y key will most of the time end up performing a grind on the curb. The elements of the scenario that can be interacted with and on which to perform tricks are too many and too close together, making the execution of the moves and combos too artificial and exaggerated. Conversely, you will occasionally find yourself seeking refuge in the training shed: here a host of professional skaters will instruct you on the various techniques in which they specialize (Paul Rodriguez on the ~Rail~, Mike Vallely on the ~Wall~, Tony Hawk the ~Vert Air~ is obviously dedicated), to be performed step by step. The relativity simplicity of the area is like a breath of fresh air compared to the intricate skein of lines that make up the city outside. Arguably the most impressive new additions are Focus Mode and Nail the Trick mode, in which the game puts out a great display of effects, quite impressively. Focus Mode can be triggered by filling the ~Special~ bar, through the execution and correct conclusion of tricks and combos. Once filled, pressing one of the analogs will zoom in on the skater and time will slow down in a spectacular slow-motion, which will highlight the tricks performed in the following time frame. Nail the Trick is instead a new mode, which is explained elsewhere in more detail, which allows the creation of tricks in real time, based on the use of analog and slow-motion, one of the most pleasant and satisfying features of this Project 8 Among the novelties, the poverty of the character editor is striking, which allows very few variations on already scarce and not very beautiful basic models, and the almost total absence of an editor to create customized areas from scratch. There are some points on the map where it is allowed to move the elements of the scenario at will, but we are far from a real ~create a park~ editor, which is strange given the next gen assumptions of this chapter. The Table Under Your Fingers Like every chapter in the Tony Hawk series, this too is essentially based on the mastery of the control system, coordination and the right timing with which to issue commandsi to the skater, obviously in relation to the position of the latter with respect to the elements of the scenario. The controller allows the execution of a huge number of tricks and combos, once you struggle a bit to tame it. Compared to the X360 version, the PS3 version is characterized by the implementation of the possibilities offered by the Sixaxis sensors. Tricks, grindings and rotations can be performed simply by rotating the pad and looking for the perfect balance. However, it must be added that the classic analog stick is much preferable to the innovative control system. There is too much imprecision in controlling the skater writhing frantically to get the right angle of rotation. Even if it's damn funny! The fact remains that the game shows us all the potential of Sixasis, absolutely to be refined but still interesting. Another peculiarity, unfortunately negative, of the PS3 version of Project 8 is the total lack of support for online play. A real shame given that on X360 it is a decidedly interesting and well-crafted feauture. Graphics and Sound Project 8 is therefore the first iteration of the series to reach next-generation platforms with a purely next-gen graphics engine, and the changes are remarkable. In particular, the motion capture-based animations are very realistic and pleasant, and the more detailed polygonal models make the movement much more believable, despite the obvious exaggeration of the game. The vast scenario is probably more striking for its breadth than for the graphic quality, which beyond detailed textures, bump mapping and rare effects does not impress that much, often also afflicted by frame rate drops that tend to make you lose concentration , as well as being inherently annoying. In general, the graphics sector does not make you cry out for a miracle, but it performs its function well, especially in the quality of the animations and especially during Focus Mode and Nail the Trick. Unfortunately, the PS3 version gives way to frame rate problems compared to the one for X360, decidedly more stable, otherwise quite similar to its Microsoft counterpart. The audio includes the predictable plethora of licensed songs, a feature that has always been closely linked to the series: the genres hover around Punk, Rock and something Hip Hop, with songs almost always spot on even if you regret them a bit (but it's a subjective opinion) the old tracklists full of Punk and Melodic Hardcore pieces, once considered genres closely related to the skate environment. For the rest, the audio is normal, focusing for the most part on the noise of the table sliding on the various surfaces and impacting on obstacles, with few environmental effects, beyond the occasional voices of passers-by nearby. Comment Tony Hawk's Project 8 is certainly not the seminal title that was Pro Skater 2, but it is in any case an extremely fun game. Clearly, the skate culture in our area is not comparable to the American one, therefore the public is necessarily more restricted in Italy, where not everyone will appreciate the structure of the game, essentially based on pressing keys and sticks with the right timing and coordination. The idea of a unitary and vast play area to be traversed freely is pleasant, albeit with all the pros and cons of the case. If you are looking for a skateboard game, you can safely proceed with the purchase of this title which still represents a big step forward compared to the last chapters of the series. If, on the other hand, you are not familiar with the genre, a bit of work awaits you in trying to better master the control system, but if you pass the first somewhat frustrating sessions unscathed, you will discover that this title can give satisfaction and fun in quantity. Pros: An entire city to explore on a skateboard Beautiful Focus and Nail the Trick modes Significant improvement in graphics Cons: Some framerate problems and absence of the online mode Poor editor of the character and game zones Nothing decidedly new compared to the series", "date": "2007-03-23", "grade": null}
