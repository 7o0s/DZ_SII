{"name": "Uno skate per tre", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/77110-skate-3-uno-skate-per-tre.html", "text": "Version tested: Xbox 360When Electronic Arts decided to launch itself into the videogame simulation of skateboarding, albeit with a certain suspicion, it was easily imaginable that behind it it had a rather solid idea on which to base the start of a prolific brand, capable of - if not quite break down - at least make the status quo of the genre creak, then represented by the simple and monolithic domain of Activision and its Tony Hawk. We've all seen how it turned out: Skate has proven itself not only as a viable alternative, but the only real skateboard simulation with some substance, replacing the old key control setup with a dynamic system based on usage of analogues and forcing the competitor to take refuge in extreme and controversial solutions such as the plastic board of Tony Hawk Ride, with at least questionable results. Having cleared the field of uncomfortable adversaries, the Black Box series has obviously exhausted the innovative thrust of which the first chapter was permeated, and taking the characteristic control system as a solid foundation on which to add new contents, it brought out a second chapter which perfected the typical structure by improving all the surrounding elements. Having reached the third iteration, which is appearing on the market these days without excessive clamor, it is clear that the time for experimentation is over to leave room for the classic commercial operation on an annual basis, without prejudice to the undisputed goodness of the game. The base of passionate users is now a certainty, as is the quality of production, but after a second chapter that has improved the excellent structure of the first while remaining essentially similar, what will Skate 3 have to add to what has been seen so far? This seems to be the biggest problem for the third chapter, which offers the same excellent playful dynamics of the other two, with some additions especially concerning online multiplayer, but in which there are no substantial changes to the gameplay. Following the normal logic of the market, we are faced with what English speakers normally define as a ~more of the same~, however representing the best skateboard videogame simulation currently in circulation, and that is no small thing. Let's talk business The usual filmed introduction with a humorous-demented tone - a sort of trademark for the series, at this point - also returns in this chapter, telling the simple background on which the (necessarily) weak story of the game is grafted. The mysterious skater to whom we must give a name has now become a celebrity, climbing the social ladder of the sports environment to the heights of international fame. Just during an extreme show that should consecrate him further something goes wrong, and ours finds himself crashed to the ground, apparently with no memory of the past but willing to get back on track immediately. The new driving idea has something capitalistic, that is to create its own label of skate decks and sell as many as possible, an objective for which we will find ourselves performing within the new city of Port Carverton trying to achieve maximum notoriety and consequently advertise our company. In essence, the sale of boards replaces the classic scoring system here: each performance is rewarded by the sale of a certain number of boards, in proportion to the complexity of the challenge and the way in which we completed it. As in the other two chapters, the exploration of the playing area is mostly free, a sort of sandbox with the possibility of performing any trick at any time and in a reachable place, but with points of interest located along the streets through which access certain pre-set challenges, which you must participate in to sell boards and advance through the game. From this point of view, Port Carverton represents a certain conceptual variation with respect to the San Vanelona of the previous chapters. While ~San Van~ was designed to be a realistic city, where the player had to conquer the spaces in which to perform his tricks (beyond those already prepared in the challenges, of course) by finding them in the middle of the metropolitan structures, Port Carverton with the Its three main areas represented by University Hill, Downtown and Industrial is a skater-friendly city, with access points for tricks and combos that are much more close at hand and clearly visible at a quick glance. There is a certain shift towards a more immediate and simpler approach, increasing the pace of the game on the one hand but reducing the simulative and technical, somewhat ~hardcore~ spirit of the first two chapters on the other. Curiousty The ~Flickit~ system is at the heart of the Skate experience. The revolutionary method of control has replaced the simple pressing of keys for long and frenetic sequences with the dynamic and fluid movement of the analog sticks. The left stick, in particular, is dedicated to the movement of the skater (shifting weight and feet on the board or simple walking) while the right is dedicated to controlling the board through ollies, nollies, various flips, manuals and grinds. The combination of the two movements together with the use of the lats that control the hands for the various grabs generates an enormous amount of tricks, the execution of which may seem difficult at first but undoubtedly much more intuitive and exciting than what has been tried so far in the others titles of the same genre. Team play So let's start from what is known: the dynamic control interface is the same as in the first two chapters, based on an ingenious innovation introduced by Black Box which still represents the state of the art. The ~Flickit~ system allows you to perform the vast repertoire of tricks, movements and combinations that are part of the classic skateboard repertoire through the use of analogs and back buttons, a system that once again proves to be intuitive and somewhat close to perfection. as regards the reproduction of movement, control over the board and ultimately the very spirit of skateboarding in video games. All the good things that were introduced in the second chapter can also be found here, in particular as regards the possibility of getting off the board to move on foot and moving some elements of the scenario to create obstacles or surfaces suitable for chaining tricks at will. The main novelty of Skate 3 concerns a particular propensity for online play, determined by the use of teams. In order to make your company progress, we must in fact rely on the creation of a good team of skaters capable of expanding the visibility of the brand through group performances and challenges between teams. All of this can take place in both single offline and online multiplayer, with a persistent progression between the two modes that allows for a dynamic transition between the solo sessions accompanied by artificial intelligence and those in multi-player, in which we find ourselves performing together (or against) other users in the flesh. The rules that can be adopted for the exhibitions are varied, and range simply from the challenge to the best trick and consequent collection of points to modalities in which we find ourselves ~conquering~ various areas of the city by performing performances with the highest score of the opponents, in a sort of strategic on skateboard, just to give two examples. The skaters created by friends, if included in their team, continue to be present even in offline games, controlled in this case by artificial intelligence, thus creating a continuum between the two game modes. Group challenges clearly take on greater depth when faced with other human users, however it must be said that the essentially individual nature of skateboarding does not make multiplayer use a substantial evolution compared to the single experience. Another element in line with the ~social~ spirit of the game is the presence of constant updates on the results obtained by friends through the ~skate.feed~, a sort of integrated social network in which it is also possible to share videos and images of the game. Xbox 360 goals With a free approach to the missions to be completed and the numerous actions to be carried out within Port Carverton, there are also numerous objectives to unlock, located along the entire playing area. In addition to the progression along the main direction of the career and brand awareness, the 47 achievements are largely based on the records and performances of which we are protagonists in every moment of our life as virtual skaters. Comprehensive collection of points requires some effort. Skate-friendly There are no particular steps forward from a graphic point of view, with the use of what appears to be the same - however excellent - graphic engine of the previous chapters and the elements of greater discontinuity represented by the architecture of the new city, less realistic and more inclined to be ~experienced~ on board, and some improved animation for skaters. Evidently accepting the requests of various users, Black Box has included the possibility of choosing between two different shots, with one from above and further away that goes alongside the typical one of the series, rather squashed towards ground level and closer to the skater, who completesnsa the poorest visibility with a superior spectacularity. As far as tested, all the online apparatus behaves quite well, without particular latency phenomena although it was not possible to try the game on public servers and therefore the vision of this aspect remained rather partial. The tendency towards realism typical of what can be defined as a real skateboard simulation, albeit characterized by a necessary emphasis on general spectacularisation, is nevertheless demonstrated in the accuracy of the animations which will never fail to give satisfaction to the player. From an audio point of view, the usual excellent ~EA Tracks~ selection also brings together in this case a good number of licensed groups and songs taken from the indie, rock, hip hop, hardcore and punk panoramas as per tradition, as well as excellent vocal renditions of the various skaters played within the game. In this regard, we note the presence of Jason Lee (actor and ex-skateboarder, protagonist of the series ~My Name is Earl~) in the role of Coach Frank, the hilarious master of the Skate.School, or the guide who accompanies us during the long and continuous tutorial of the game.", "date": "2010-05-12", "grade": "8.0"}
