Slow, cadenced, almost as if the new Nintendo flagship wanted to wait for the end of the current generation outside the door, away from the limelight. The big N does not feel part of this dying cycle, it has so far shown only a part of its axes and continues its solitary journey against the criticisms of half the globe. It's true, calculating the way its hardware has evolved, this time the Blue Ocean Strategy of the Kyoto house is certainly not as clear as it was with Wii, but if the ideas and interface proposals of Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate are just the first signs of the new eye/video ratio pushed by Iwata&Co. then move the verse thumbs away, this is not the case. As for Monster Hunter Tri Capcom, developer and publisher of the successful saga of fantasy hunters, has left the task of managing marketing and distribution for PAL territories (Europe, Australia) to Nintendo. A choice that once again emphasizes the desire to forcefully bring a saga to the West, such as that of Monster Hunter, characterized by a singular background. Relatively young, the Capcom brand is literally a real commercial tornado in Japan. Few other titles guarantee equal system selling in the motherland, but one should not be surprised if in the West the mechanics are different and much less fortunate. The doors of fame were opened wide in 2010 with the arrival of Tri on Wii and now the promises are multiplying with this revised and corrected version. All maintained? More beautiful and better When just under a year ago Nintendo showed its concept of asymmetric gameplay via gamepad, many dreamed of an immediate move of all that information extraneous to the eye. Icons, virtual keys, bars, counters, notoriously condensed into a summary technical term: HUD, i.e. Heads-Up Display. Translated? Head-on information, in other words the well-established videogame posture that has accompanied the screen interface for decades. Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate takes the decrepit concept and sets it aside. What follows is the pleasure of witnessing for the first time a passively useful use of the gamepad, which absorbs on its 6.2'' all that infinite amount of information that has filled the screens of fans of the game since 2004. saga. The world of Monster Hunter is vibrant, rich and truly boundless thanks to the fullness of the video stream in the field, which no longer has to deal with visual obstructions of the game elements, yes necessary but now finally transferred, and in their entirety, to the new Wii U controller. The gamepad thus becomes a grid of panels, which can be positioned at will, to be filled with the vast amount of information available, based on needs and situations. Map in one corner and health bars in the other? Done. Bag of items between the two? Nothing simpler. Convenience and personalization are the watchwords. Capcom wanted this interface option to be dynamic, to underline the intrinsic movement no longer relegated to pointing the eyes only at the screen, making the neck and its rotation in search of the gamepad the actual protagonists of the action. Of course, enthusiasts will always be able to decide to fill their living room LCD with all the video infrastructure of the saga, by virtue of the correct objection according to which a hardcore game does not allow dead seconds and all vital counters must be easily consultable. It can be shared, especially when the action is pressing, but the evolutionary approach proposed by Capcom in this sense is much more functional than one might think. The gamepad does not fail to quickly become an information window of its own dignity, allowing full customization of the information you want to have quickly at hand. This is only the first of the many steps that the modernization journey made possible by Nintendo hardware will have to take, but the direction taken by Capcom is undoubtedly the right one. Next Gen If there is a console that has experienced a commercial birth in the eye of the storm, it is undoubtedly Wii U. The Kyoto-based company's shyness in proudly revealing the bodywork of their latest technological jewel has opened the door to criticism from many disbelievers, not very confident in the long legs of the machine in the next generational race. Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, from this point of view, is certainly not the long-awaited answer, but it has some good on its side. The native 1080p anchored at 30 frames per second show an image cleanliness certainly sufficient to forgive the many now visibly dated textures. It should also be remembered that the title belongs to that group of software developed with the very first development kits, unfortunately incomplete, moreover with an approach still tied to the CPU, a weak point of the console. Considering the premises, it is therefore legitimate to frame this iteration of the brand as a good port of the Wii version, which by adding dynamic shadows, pixel shaders and the total absence of aliasing provides that something extra to chase away the shadows of deja-vu and let the brand in the pride of high definition. The animation park has remained almost unchanged, thus maintaining the movement frames of the hostile fauna on good levels but not rewriting the rules of interpenetration of the bodies, anchored to old dictates. The filters in the aquatic sections give an apparently bolder lighting than the Tri, but it's only an impression well masked by the high resolution and cleaner screen. As always, more could be asked for to please the eye, but the idea is that Capcom is keeping the real leap forward for the next official chapter on 3DS, thus embodying the spirit of a new milestone and not a mere, however full-bodied, update of a title already released. Hunting together It must be said that the word Ultimate could not be better chosen. The definitive nature of the title comes out thanks to many advantages that make Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate the ideal version for every fan of the saga and the best start for the less accustomed. The first is in terms of content and although it was obvious to expect greater quantities, it is heartening to observe with what detail the Osaka publisher knows how to reinterpret the best of the previous episodes and instill it in the upcoming ones. Compared to the Wii episode, this Ultimate introduces a brand new boss, variants of old monsters, shooting areas, others created from scratch, tons of new equipment and hundreds of never seen quests, so as to make the offer of this episode of the saga palatable to any type of palate, including those who have already explored every corner of the Tri. Not to mention the support in the months to come with free DLCs that will be released on a regular basis. But what really shines is the relationship between Wii U and 3DS. The respective versions of Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate were created to allow for seamless dialogue between consoles, with the ability to import savegames and guild cards from one device to another and continue the adventure seamlessly. For those who want off-TV play, i.e. the possibility of playing only on gamepads, an update scheduled for April will add this feature as well as the coveted cross-region multiplayer between Europe and America. To close the circle intervenes the possibility of interfacing up to three 3DS and a Wii U to make offline multiplayer sessions of four players, which share with the online multiplayer the total absence of lag and an enviable connection stability. Capcom has created, also thanks to the will of the producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, the best possible multiplayer proposal, which makes it pleasant to embark on impervious quests with friends and thus take advantage of all the strategies that the Monster Hunter structure makes available.", "date": "2013-03-18", "grade": "8.8"}
