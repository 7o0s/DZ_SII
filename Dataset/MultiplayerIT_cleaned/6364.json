Perhaps only Evil Genius by Demis Hassabis managed to dent it, but otherwise the dungeons of evil are full of the corpses of those who unsuccessfully attempted to storm the castle by crashing into the walls. Peter Molyneux's Bullfrog title thrived on such delicate and perfect balances that any attempt to modify them has only produced disasters, as demonstrated by the recently released mobile version, which we define shameful to be kind. Dungeons, released more than four years ago, was one of the most accredited ~new Dungeon Keepers~. Unfortunately, the desire to make it suitable for everyone forced the developers to make a series of big compromises that partially undermined the result. In our opinion it was still a discreet and enjoyable title, but certainly not at the level of the source of inspiration. Dungeons 2 restarts from Dungeons, but tries to follow a different path so as to gain its autonomy within the genre. The basic concept is always the same: in the role of an evil lord you have to accumulate power by developing large underground labyrinths from which to draw sustenance. Dungeons are regularly attacked by heroes of good who want to conquer them to plunder their treasures and kill us, so you have to defend them by placing traps and creating an army of nefarious creatures that shove freshly polished armor down their throats. In addition to the management part, an RTS section has been included in Dungeons 2, actually closely linked to the other. Basically, the servants of the dark lord of the underground can, indeed, must go to the surface to carry out various missions. For example, they may have to destroy an outpost of good, or obtain the favors of a race to increase their ranks. There is no shortage of pitched battles against particularly powerful heroes and RPG-like sequences with objects to find and characters to talk to. We've dug into the depths of Dungeons 2 - let's see what we found in our review The Alternatives A valid and recent alternative to Dungeons 2 is a title that can only be purchased in Steam Early Access for now. It's called Dwelvers and offers more hardcore gameplay, with more control of the troops in the dungeon, but without the RTS side of the Kalypso title. Having said that, always consider the possibility of recovering the titles already mentioned in the article, namely the two Dungeon Keeper and Evil Genius, still the best of the genre today. Fight and dig One of the major criticisms that have been leveled at Dungeons 2 is the relative simplicity of the two sections into which it is divided. Realmforge is accused of oversimplifying the RTS part and automating the troops too much in the dungeon. We are not surprised by the criticisms, which actually start from real data, but we consider them misleading. A title must be observed in its entirety, not in its individual parts. Let's explain better: the individual elements, once examined, must be inserted into an overall picture and see how they relate to the others. This is a golden rule that should always apply when reviewing a video game. So the question to ask isn't so much whether the RTS and management parts of Dungeons 2 work individually, but whether they work together. Given the dynamics of the game, it is likely that a general increase in complexity would have led to many problems in refining the balance. Some compromise choices appear much more natural if you observe them in action, rather than using them for improper comparisons. The standard game of Dungeons 2 requires you to pay attention to many elements at once. In the dungeon you have to dig building areas, build rooms, recruit workers and troops, research new rooms, spells, traps and so on. In short, there are many tasks to be performed using a dedicated interface, centered on the hand of the lord of evil, which allows you to perform a whole series of actions in a natural and dynamic way (once you get the right confidence). The interface of the RTS section changes and becomes much more traditional, in order to simplify the movement of the deployed troops. Let's tell a typical situation: digging a tunnel our servants broke into a room full of giant spiders, at the same time the dungeon ended up under the attack of a large handful of heroes, which the traps placed at the entrance slowed down but did not stop . Meanwhile, on the surface, we have arrived near an enemy camp that we have to attack. In short, the situation is complex and we need to run for cover. Imagine having to do thiswith a system that requires direct intervention on all fronts. It would be chaos. Thus, the much reviled automation of the troops in the dungeon, in such a situation, more frequent than it seems, appears as a godsend that fluidifies the game, preventing the action from becoming heavy. The same goes for the relative simplicity of the RTS part. It is true that the fights do not require the use of who knows what tactics to be won, but one would think that spending too much time working out one's moves on the surface would make life difficult underground, which in the meantime would lie forgotten. Let's shake it up On the other hand it is true that Dungeons 2 is an overall easy title. The continuous suggestions of the amusing narrator, translated and dubbed really well into Italian, combined with the simplifications mentioned above, make the player's life simple, who often has to limit himself to doing what he is told. The situation improves a bit in advanced missions, but the moments in which you risk being defeated in a sensational way are rare. When you have started the dungeon properly and have set enough traps, you never lose control of the situation and the dangers are always manageable. In short, nothing to do with the extremely difficult advanced levels of Dungeon Keeper, but this is probably not even what was wanted for Dungeons 2. The single player campaign is finished in 15-20 hours, but the multiplayer side and the possibility of indulge in the fun self-contained skirmishes that add game time. Another flaw to report is the overall uselessness of the spells. There are more than twenty in total to research, but there are only a couple of really useful ones. Above all, the offensive ones come in handy on very few occasions, while the recall spell of the warrior units in a single point is vital to speed up the assembly of the army. From a technical point of view, the title of Realforge does a decent job and nothing more. Stylistically we are faced with the classic cartoonish fantasy with saturated colors and very marked caricatured features. In short, it is something already seen that follows a very specific trail of titles, starting from Dungeon Keeper, passing through World of Warcraft and various MOBAs. The exact same can be said for the soundtrack, a disengaged accompaniment that never stands out for its creativity or originality, although it is not despicable.", "date": "2015-05-05", "grade": "8.0"}
