There are some downsides to this interactive novel but not so severe that the intrinsic quality of the game falters. Psycho-Pass: Mandatory Happiness is a visual novel that shouldn't go unnoticed The elegance of cyberpunk It is difficult to have to talk in depth about a visual novel without being able to make precise references to its plot but to safeguard your gaming experience we will tell you the bare essentials. But first it is interesting to understand the setting of Mandatory Happiness, or the universe of Psycho-Pass. The anime is set in a future in which the fate of men has been entrusted to the Sibyl System, a computer system capable of reading the attitudes of human beings and placing them in the best possible way within society; to safeguard harmony and the law, the Sybil System is programmed to decipher the Psycho-Pass of every human being, i.e. the degree of latent criminality determined by the individual's mental state. For this reason, the dystopian society of the future shuns stress and the deepest feelings, living in absolute rigor and slave to medicines and psychological therapies. The operational extension of Sibyl is the Department of Public Safety, made up of inspectors and executors: the former conduct investigations and supervise the latter while the executors are latent criminals who can no longer aspire to a clean Psycho Pass, having as their only alternative, in addition to detention, the ability to hunt down other criminals. Both then make use of the Dominators, devices directly connected to the Sybil that come into operation only by reading the target's Psycho-Pass... In short, very interesting assumptions and set in a first-class cyberpunk universe! Obviously all this in Mandatory Happiness is explained and we can mark this as the first positive point of the game: you don't necessarily have to have seen the anime to understand the narrative universe, on the contrary, paradoxically it represents a delicious appetizer before enjoying the animated work, also because on a narrative level the game is placed approximately between the third and seventh episode of the first season. In the incipit of the game we see a mysterious hacker take possession of the mechanical body of an android held in custody in medical laboratories, with the aim of using it in order to make people happy (and the title of the game is immediately explained); an apparently obvious clich which, however, has always given great charm to the cyberpunk genre, after all many great works of the genre share the narrative clich of android and cyborg hacking... the gynoids of Ghost in the Shell set school in this sense. At this point we will be asked to choose between two characters or Nadeshiko Kutagachi and Takuma Tsurugi: the first is an inspector who is injured due to an accident during her training and completely loses her memory while the second is an executor, who has become such because he rebelled against the sentence of the Sibyl. Then alongside the antagonist and the two protagonists we will find all the members of the first division of the PSB: the two inspectors Tsunemori and Ginoza, the executors Kogami, Masaoka, Kagari and Kunizuka and the blonde analyst Karanomori. All the characters, both unpublished and original, are well blended in the story and dance in a complex narrative plot that lasts about a dozen hours, which can be multiplied exponentially if you decide to replay the title with the second character and exploring each narrative ramification. Unfounded criticisms Let's now review the more technical aspects of Mandatory Happiness, where we will find, so to speak, the small sore points of the game. Indeed, let's start from these, mainly two: the lack of localization of the title in Italian and the non-existent gameplay. At this point it would seem that our review should end here with a nice 4 but that's not the case, because frankly we don't feel like belittling the game in the face of these precise criticisms. First of all, the adventure is still very enjoyable and understandable even if entirely in English: the title maintains the dubbing in Japanese, with obviously the original voice actors of the anime to lend the voices to the characters and both the subtitles and the menus are fully translated in English, the only element localized in Italian is the instruction booklet. It is logical that the language is a significant obstacle for those who do not know it but it is also true that the lack of translation of the game into Italian does not worsen its narrative quality, it is a flaw that makes the nature of the game problematic only for us and not being an element of universal disadvantage we do not feel like highlighting it as such. In addition, the speed of the dialogues can be set to automatic or you can choose a custom speed, in order not to miss a single word of the dialogues. The second aspect judged to be apparently negative is the non-existence of the gameplay: between one dialogue and another the game will ask us to make choices and to take (or not) our medicinal supplements to keep our Psycho-Pass at bay. Many complained about this, saying it lacked all the action and didn't even come close to the fluid interactivity of ~Telltale-esque~ adventures. Not even this is a real problem for us because Mandatory Happiness does nothing but faithfully adhere to the guidelines of the most classic interactive novels: a compelling story full of narrative ramifications, quality dubbing, well-defined characters, very beautiful drawings and a very high degree of fidelity in the comparisons of the original work. Frankly we ask ourselves what more a player can expect from a Japanese visual novel and for this reason not only do we not join the chorus of criticisms but rather, we are sure that a product like Mandatory Happiness can entertain anyone... as long as you have want to read! Little but good So we come to the positive sides of the game. By asking the player for a very low rate of interactivity, the command interface is very dry: with the right backbone you can decide whether to set the speed of the dialogues to manual or automatic and with the left one you can quickly open the suggestions section, i.e. a list in order alphabetical list of all the terms and key names useful for the investigation: when you meet one of them during a dialogue for the first time, to signal the presence of the term in the database, the word will appear in the upper center of the screen in the appropriate mask. The square button (or X on Xbox) will open the full menu where you can save and load the game, read the hints and access the game options. The saves are all manual and you can make them at the end of a sentence of dialogue: in this way the save will take the name of the sentence and when you load the game you will be able to read the last sentence of the speech and resume from there or, if you feel that you are approaching a narrative crossroads, no one forbids you to save first and then explore the different alternatives. In the menu, in addition to the normal functions, we will be able to choose the playback speed of the dialogues and in the audio options the volume of the voice of each individual character. In this case we would like to give you some advice that has worked for us: if you have never played a visual novel or you are not familiar with the sound of Japanese voices, slightly lower the volume of all the characters and leave the volume of the protagonist higher. in this way you will not get confused during the dialogues! Another significant element for a visual novel are the drawings and even here Mandatory Happiness is not wrong: the drawings are pleasant, both those of the characters and the environmental scenarios, even if here obviously our judgment may not be worth so much because every enthusiast has a certain predilection for the stroke of one designer rather than another. The menus are particularly beautiful, with a perfectly successful and extremely faithful graphic style compared to that of the anime; all the text curtains have a small animation that enriches them, making the screen less static and within the main menu it is possible to always keep our Psycho-Pass color under control, an element that you will have to consult often given that, as we anticipated , the game will cyclically offer you to take your medicinal supplements. We close with the soundtrack, never boring and designed to emphasize particular moments of the story with its presence or absence. Before leaving you to the final verdict, we remind you that you can find the first season of Psycho-Pass dubbed in Italian on Netflix.", "date": "2016-09-18", "grade": "8.0"}
