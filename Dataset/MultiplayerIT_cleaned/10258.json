Take up residence in Eastern Europe and its surroundings where the genre is still very flourishing and the followers of Heroes of Might and Magic flock like snow. If, on the other hand, you are satisfied with a quick visit from time to time, the time has come for you to familiarize yourself with the King's Bounty series, taken over by the Russian Katauri Interactive who, with The Legend, brought back a brand from the early 90s in 2008, replicating the 'year later with this Armored Princess that we review with a little delay in this first part of January stingy with big names. What was initially announced as a simple expansion has transformed over the course of development into an unoriginal but playable product without the predecessor, able to perfect it and ultimately featuring one of the most profound gameplay currently available. Return to Endoria The plot takes the user back to the fantasy world of Endoria, and then immediately drags him to Teana, a parallel reality where the player's alter ego, Princess Amelie, will have to find the knight Bill Gilbert, the only one able to save the native land of the beautiful crowned, currently besieged by a number of assorted demons. In short, the classic race against time but in a pink sauce, a starting point more than anything else to then accompany the user along the islands that make up the Teana archipelago, a series of thematically different settings but filled with the same alternation of environments to explore - collecting items, interacting with non-player characters and engaging in missions - and battles to complete. As foreseeable, the clashes themselves are the strength of King's Bounty: Armored Princess: the battlefields recalled from time to time provide for the strategic arrangement of the forces available, each with a certain amount of possible movements that can be carried out on the hexagonal box chessboard and therefore equipped with specific stats and abilities, so many as to allow thousands of possible combinations as well as an impressive level of detail. After the first hours of the game, challenging but surmountable without too many uncertainties, the challenge rate grows exponentially and with it the need to carefully choose each unit, object or spell, a process fortunately supported by the enormous balancing work done, such as make every encounter a stimulating run-up to the right move. If the battles are the masters, the more strictly role-playing part is also particularly successful which, whatever the initial choice between mage, warrior or paladin, provides a triple skill tree with as many types of resources to access the individual spells or to upgrades for them. A rather classic scheme which, however, in combination with the many objects to be collected as loot or purchasable through the appropriate vendors, offers a more than discreet customization of Amelie. In short, a game of substance, capable of entertaining for almost thirty hours and making up for the slow-paced action typical of the genre with a generous amount of new notions and possibilities gradually introduced. Of course, the structural innovations compared to The Legend are not very many, mostly involving the introduction, not very interesting to tell the truth, of a dragon as a pet with passive and active skills, depending on the choice made at the time of its adoption , and better management of the Teana world's internal economy. Enormous defects cannot be found and, in addition to the extreme sectorality, what kept away a higher vote was exclusively the too quickly with which one is inserted into the heart of the action - the short tutorial is not very good and, in a nutshell , it is almost assumed that you have some experience - in addition to the absence of any multiplayer, present only in the form of online rankings dedicated to the score obtained during the campaign. Armored Princess has not been distributed in stores in Italy but is available for download via Steam and GamerGate at a price of just under forty euros. Not beautiful but charming? If the mechanics work thanks to the broad shoulders with which a genre that proceeds in very small but effective steps is equipped, the whole gameplay support structure is similarly designed to be functional. Overall, the interface is good despite the excessive frills and some original choices - the button for closing the windows at the bottom right is unorthodox - while the commands are appreciated for their ability to not get complicated due to the many possibilities, making themselves available even exclusively via mouse. Graphically the style is cartoonish and often nIt doesn't hide the desire to imitate World of Warcraft, compensating for the lack of originality with a good yield available even for the most modest configurations; worth noting is the presence of an option to view King's Bounty: Armored Princess in anaglyph 3D - with blue and red lens glasses - a nice addition rather than a real possibility given the annoyance of viewing with altered colors. Artificial intelligence is very good, capable of dominating the pitch by putting it in difficulty just enough to stimulate the continuous use of gray matter, without giving the impression of cheating. Finally, the sound makes use of a pleasant soundtrack composed of catchy tunes while the rather poor set of sounds that accompany battles and exploration leaves less satisfied.", "date": "2010-01-12", "grade": "8.2"}
