{"name": "The Boulevard of Broken Dreams", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/77877-green-day-rock-band-the-boulevard-of-broken-dreams.html", "text": "Tested version: PlayStation 3 The fight between Guitar Hero and Rockband continues with shots of exclusives and musical legends, the two titles that by now monopolize the scene of that genre of games that try to reproduce, in an ever more maniacal way, the experience that trying to play in a group. The last real blow had been struck by Harmonix grabbing the Beatles license and producing what, in our opinion, has become the term of comparison on how titles dedicated to a single band should be built, striking the right balance between exploitation of a prestigious license and the satisfaction of the players, thanks to the content and gameplay mechanics. With Green Day: Rock Band MTV is back on the field, putting one of the most popular rock bands in the world on track, but it does it, and it hurts to admit it, in a much more superficial way than it did with the Beatles, almost totally forgetting the cues that 'had resulted in a great game, rather than a mere ~fan catcher~. The green of hope It is unlikely that many of those who will read these lines do not know who Green Day are, but for those who are wondering what could have led to dedicating an entire chapter of Rockband to a relatively young band, suffice it to say that it was Billi Joe Armstrong, the singer, and the two partners to revive punk rock worldwide before the success of other groups such as Blink 182, where Rancid had managed to do little beyond the underground music circuit. More than 15 million records sold worldwide and numerous critics' awards, given that the group, which started from a simple punk rock with a hit like Basket Case, very popular on radio and music TV, has transformed over time into something more. spokesperson for a social conscience that culminated with the end of the Bush era in the United States and was embraced by millions of kids around the world. Having said that, however, we return to Green Day: Rock Band which, revolving around the group's repertoire with a selection of a handful of albums, covers three phases of the band's career with 47 songs and three concerts recreated in a rather faithful way, above all from the point of view of the expressions and movements of the three musicians. This, undoubtedly, is the part that fans will like most, in addition of course to the more or less known songs, after which, by taking a closer look, the problems inexorably emerge. Where in the game dedicated to the Beatles, the history of the group allowed the developers to indulge themselves with a fascinating creativity and flair that had led to the creation of computer graphics videos and imaginary settings to build the feeling and emotions of the career of a group that made the history of pop music, the fact remains that it is a trio that started playing in distressed t-shirts and that within ten years passed to black shirts and ties. It did so, however, keeping its structure unchanged and without yet having the time to leave other particularly important cultural signs, and those left behind have not been translated by the developers into content capable of giving substance to the game and variety, above all. There are only three settings, and they are, like the repertoire of songs, all available immediately, but the differences are only marginally appreciable. This will seem normal to the band's staunchest supporters, but, if there weren't some dates written next to the three concerts (the first imaginary, having only to give an idea of the alternative phases of Green Day's early days), there would be no other element to indicate the passage of time or the evolution of the group, given that there are no videos that link the three phases or unpublished materials created ad hoc for the game. In each stage there are a number of sets of songs to be played in order to access the next sets. Depending on the number of stars obtained, one or two photographs from the band's archive are unlocked and, once the sets of songs have been completed, credits have been accumulated, it is possible to spend them to unlock some challenges (which consist of other sets of the same songs to be played without interruptions , even reaching 14 consecutive pieces), which allow you to obtain footage from the life of the group on tour or from live shows. However, everything lacks organicity and the photos themselves are a simple gallery of images without any bibliographic introduction that tells the player where the photo was taken or on what occasion. You end up, therefore, with a simple roundup of funny faces that elicit a few smiles, but which quickly wear out their charm and interest for anyone who is not a Green Day fetishist. Playstation 3 trophies Like all music games, Green Day: Rock Band is very time consumingin order to get the most consistent trophies. You have to face the game by taking up all the instruments and trying your hand at the voice, playing online and ringing impeccable note sequences. Passion for music requires commitment and sacrifice, even in a game! Pros and cons of being Punk Rock! Arriving then to look at the game mechanics proper, being Green Day: Rock Band all centered around the group's repertoire highlights its limits, given that our three heroes, although starting from very fast and very short songs and arriving to pack more complex songs in even rather articulated conceptual albums, make an immediate and dry rock their disruptive force, which works great live in a concert, but which has much less charm having to play on it with guitars and plastic drums. The songs, in fact, are all quite similar, in terms of structure and type of rhythmic construction, obviously not melodic, with some notable exceptions, and those who have already played other RockBands will find the challenge as a whole not very stimulating, with easily tamed and rather repetitive. The situation is different for the new adepts of musical games, who here will be able to go, with a little practice, even to Expert, precisely by virtue of a rather accessible level of challenge, given that the most difficult songs are almost exclusively for the great speed at which Green Day play. Certainly the offer for fans is still interesting also because the songs can be exported to the libraries of other RockBands and the models of the three are really faithful with even facial animations that reproduce winks or grimaces that those who have followed the group a minimum will recognize on the fly. That said, and having exhausted the thrill of being able to sing and play on songs like American Idiot, Basket Case or Boulevard of Broken Dreams, and made some forays into the online career and challenges with friends, it is clear that the package as a whole lacks something and that Green Day: Rock Band represents a step back from the standards imposed by Harmonix with the game dedicated to the Beatles.", "date": "2010-06-08", "grade": "6.0"}
