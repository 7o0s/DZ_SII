In short, there was a lot of material to work on for a second chapter that could improve what was done by the debut title: a pity that the developers preferred to look elsewhere... Flashout 2 does not make good use of the room for improvement, proving to be a rather ordinary sequel The future is a trap Like its predecessor, Flashout 2 undoubtedly looks good, starting with a main menu that offers a considerable amount of content, divided between single and multiplayer: in the first case, you can face races, races against time and a career mode divided into many small cups distinguished by different events, while in the second one you can try your hand at races against human players or with the ghosts of their best times and even gamble in a special section dedicated to bets. In both cases, you always have an eye on your budget to spend on improving the spacecraft available or buying a new one, choosing from the seven models on display. Also considering the number of layouts contained in the package (as many as ten, scattered in various parts of the world) it certainly cannot be attributed to the product for any lack in strictly numerical terms, even if it takes little to discover that the quality of the material is unfortunately not of equal level. In terms of pure and simple gameplay, Jujubee almost seems to have had no desire to improve what was offered by the prequel, despite the wide margins for maneuver: therefore all the problems that afflicted the first Flashout return almost unchanged, from the lack of incisiveness of the weapons to a from a bit too slippery control up to a very banal design of the tracks. The total inadequacy of the solution adopted by the developers to respond to the criticisms concerning the lack of the air brake in the previous game makes us smile: a virtual key has been inserted that allows you to slow down the progress of the spacecraft, a pity it is equipped with disproportionate power, such as to make it practically unusable except to suddenly stop in the middle of the track and thus be caught up by the opponents. Add to the bill other minor oversights (such as the too thin design of the power-ups which makes them distinguishable only at very short distances) and it is clear how much better could have been done in this Flashout 2, without limiting itself to a work of mere updating - albeit appreciable - of the graphic and content qualities of the product. The Jujubee developers have in fact concentrated mainly on a cosmetic restyling that can already be seen from the menu interface, distinguished by a much cleaner and more essential look, and which has involved the entire visual sector of the product, fast and fluid like few others others in the mobile sector. Decidedly less pleasant, on the other hand, is the clear intention on the part of the authors to encourage the user to make in-app purchases, despite the fact that the title does not belong to the freemium category: the paid packages that give access to certain amounts of virtual money turn out to be practically indispensable right from the start of the game, when you take a look at the very high prices of the most performing spaceships and related upgrades, which would require dozens and dozens of hours of play to be unlocked normally. But the most unpleasant part is the one involving weapons and power-ups, given that only a very small percentage of them can be obtained directly on the track: you therefore need to stock up via a pre-race menu, spending your money to buy turbos, missiles and company without which (thanks also to the contribution of a particularly incorrect artificial intelligence) it is almost impossible to reach the finish line first. All this has the bitter taste of mockery if you consider that the unused upgrades are not kept for the next race and above all that the prizes for victories barely cover the costs incurred. In short, Jujubee's intent to monetize appears all too evident, and ends up spoiling the experience with what is still the best WipeOut clone available in the mobile sector, despite a few too many compromises to bestay.", "date": "2014-03-27", "grade": "7.0"}
