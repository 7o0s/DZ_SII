{"name": "WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2008 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2008-recensione_a.html", "text": "Wrestling cut The first thing that strikes you about Smackdown vs Raw 2008 for Wii is the simplification work implemented by the developers, which can be seen right from the start screen: the modes have been reduced in number, and in this case allow us to play a quick match , to participate in one of the available tournaments (which are unlocked gradually), to access the ~Main Event~ mode and to create a wrestler by customizing every aspect. This last possibility, which has already been present for some years, on Wii becomes much simpler and more intuitive thanks to the fact of using the Wii-mote to move between the dozens and dozens of parameters available. Unfortunately, the ~24/7~ and ~General Manager~ modes have been eliminated, ie those that made the title developed by Yuke's practically infinite between meetings, stipulations, rivalries and a background plot. In their place there is the ~Main Event~, or a career mode which, however, develops in an extremely simple way and sees our popularity rise to various levels as the matches are won within the selected roster (Raw, Smackdown or ECW). In practice, it is simply a matter of accepting or not the challenges that are thrown at us (and that we ourselves can launch), waiting for our positive streak to convince the boss to give us a chance for a title. Between one encounter and another we can spend the points earned to train (and therefore improve the character's characteristics) or to get a massage, which is essential for recovering energy. The latter is the key that determines the outcome of our matches... Wrestling fought The energy management system in the Wii version of Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 has also been simplified. Now it's a question of keeping an eye on a bar that drops rapidly with each attack suffered and which, in career mode, can remain low after a particularly tough match, really putting us in a position of inferiority compared to the new opponent we have to face. To remedy this situation we can resort to relaxing massages (in the ~Main Event~ mode) between one engagement and another, or carve out a moment of respite during a match and perform a characteristic gesture of the wrestler to inflame the audience and recover a little strength. Thus Kane will raise his arms and then suddenly lower them, Undertaker will do his typical ~slaughter~ mimicry, Rey Mysterio will rotate his fists and then raise one up... and we will have to move the Wii-mote and Nunchuck (holding down the button C) in a similar way to how real wrestlers do, in what is the nicest application of the control system. And the rest? Well, don't expect to take your usual giant teddy bear and smack him to the ground with a chokeslam, because the game won't detect your movements that way. It does not work like that. Let's say that the developers have opted for very simple controls, which see the movement of the Wii-mote and Nunchuck replace the pressure of simple buttons: by moving the controller up, down or sideways we can hit the opponent in a different way , and performing these actions by holding down the A, B or both buttons will allow us to perform a large number of tricks, which can then turn into moves depending on the next movement. For example, Rey Mysterio can climb onto his opponent's back by moving the Wii-mote up and pressing B. At that point, if we move the controller down, the wrestler will perform a spin that will knock the enemy to the ground. Similarly, Kane can lift the opponent and then, depending on whether you move the Wii-mote to the right, left or down, crush him to the mat with a different maneuver. But you can also rage when the enemy is downed, overrun him and fill him with punches (moving both the Wii-mote and the Nunchuck accordingly)... The result is encounters that are really resolved in a matter of minutes, much shorter than to the other versions of the game, with all the pros and cons of the case: on the one hand a decidedly simpler and more intuitive control, of which the need was felt; on the other, a mechanic that can quickly become repetitive. Shake merrily While on other consoles you have to use the joypad's back buttons to make counter moves, on Wii you just need to shake the Wii-mote while your opponent delivers a blow or tries to make a move to counter it. Similarly, to exit an enemy maneuver or to get back up you have to shake the controller like a maniac, since in fact moving the Wii-mote replaces the rapid press of a button. At the end of a series of meetings you may have a little numb arms... Technical realization With the release of titles such as Metroid Prime: Corruption and Super Mario Galaxy, it is clear that the expectations of all Wii owners have increased: much more is expected from the new wave of titles than shown so far. In this sense, Smackdown vs Raw 2008 isn't technically exceptional, but it does its job in a more than decent way: the wrestlers are reproduced in a really excellent way and are, in most cases, terribly faithful to their real counterparts (with the exception of the wrestlers, very well made but not very similar to the originals). Looking at the audience, really approximate (even without reaching the frightening levels of the PSP version) it is clear that the developers have used almost all the resources available for the wrestlers, who move like real ones and boast a very high level of detail. The action is also quite smooth, often hovering over 60fps with support for widescreen and 480p video mode. All in all, we're head and shoulders above the PlayStation 2 version and you really can't complain. The sound sector is also very well done: there is the usual string of rock songs inserted almost everywhere, with the result of getting tired immediately; but most importantly all six original commentators, who do a great job during the meetings and deliver their most characteristic lines. Comment Smackdown vs Raw 2008 has the great merit of simplifying the control system of the series, which has now become really cumbersome and not very intuitive, as well as making the action much faster and more frenetic. Two elements which are really needed and which should be reflected upon for the 2009 edition, on all platforms. It is also true that the simplification work has gone a little too far, eliminating much of the thickness as well as the longevity that has always distinguished the THQ product. In this case, the ~Main Event~ mode unfortunately turns out to be not very varied and multifaceted, proposing a sequence of meetings for its own sake that ends up being repetitive after a few hours and does not include any of the innovations introduced in the 2008 edition on the other consoles. So we are faced with an experimental product, fun but highly limited, which has the advantage of laying the foundations for a future evolution in the name of involvement: WWE wrestling fans should not let it slip away anyway. Pros: Immediate and fun Technically well done Faster action than the other versions... Cons: ...but poor depth Few game modes Tends to be repetitive", "date": "2007-12-27", "grade": null}
