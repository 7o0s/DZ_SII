{"name": "Brawl Stars", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/brawl-stars-recensione.html", "text": "Brawl Stars takes a rather decisive distance from the previous works of Supercell, capable of enjoying incredible success today. The new title of the team therefore arises as a very courageous move, which highlights the desire of the developers to experiment with new paths and new mechanics, leaving their comfort zone and throwing themselves headlong into a project halfway between brawler and shooter, this too based completely on competitive online multiplayer. The excellent graphic style to which we are now accustomed has been preserved, giving life to twenty-two beautiful characters that we will be able to unlock with a view to a rich and articulated progression system, which always keeps the interest alive with its prizes and upgrades for the roster already at our disposal. The uniqueness of the experience naturally lies in its gameplay, which features direct control of the avatar according to the canons of twin stick shooters: a virtual analog stick placed on the left of the screen allows you to move, whereas a stick on the right side allows you to shoot aiming manually or automatically (in this case hitting only the closest targets), trying to make the best use of the three-shot magazine at our disposal. A further button appears when we have loaded the special, different for each fighter, capable of inflicting serious damage: a maneuver of great importance, which can make the difference in various situations. The functioning of the gunplay has been refined in a very careful way during the long soft launch of Brawl Stars, and it presents itself at the global launch with a balance that seemed excellent to us, although the matter must be verified in the long term, with all the characters and power-ups . Mode The protagonists of Brawl Stars have the task of challenging each other in arenas of varying dimensions, according to the rules of four different modes which also become accessible gradually, thus urging us to continue playing. The first, Gem Grabber, is an interesting three-against-three with clear tactical implications, in which two teams have the objective of collecting the greatest number of gems, possibly from the corpses of killed enemies, to trigger a counter that closes the match in favor of whoever owns all the precious stones. The second mode, Survival, is instead a real battle royale, playable in single or in pairs, with ten contenders who must eliminate each other in a map that gradually shrinks. Then we have the Robbery mode, a three-on-three very similar to the classic deathmatch, in which the kills made are counted, and finally a funny variation on the football theme, Footbrawl, in which our character has the task of conquering the ball and throw it into the net while preventing it from being caught by your opponents. To this set of options are added special rotating events that keep interest alive, all without stringent freemium mechanisms: an approach very similar to that of Clash Royale, without action energy or timers, but with the possibility of quickly unlocking the fighters using real money. The protagonists of Brawl Stars not only boast a beautiful design, as mentioned, but also very different characteristics, which differentiate them in a profound way and open up to further strategies based on team balance. This system, so immediate yet at the same time endowed with a discreet depth, proves to be particularly solid and well implemented right from the start: the touch controls work perfectly, the matchmaking is very fast and we have never noticed episodes of excessive lag or problems of any kind . The technical realization goes hand in hand with the care of everything else, offering us articulated maps, with an excellent use of colors and a really pleasant cartoon style.", "date": "2018-12-18", "grade": "8.2"}
