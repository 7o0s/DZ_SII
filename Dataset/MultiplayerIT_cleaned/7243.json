The aim after all is to move up and down the screen, passing precisely through blocks and trying to hold your nerve for as long as possible. Yet the link between the two games is only apparent, both because Thomas Janson's arcade has been in development long before Flappy Bird became a successful phenomenon, and above all because, if we really have to find similarities, the game seems to squeeze more Keep an eye on the geometry of Super Hexagon, both in style and in concept. A dizzying journey As mentioned, Wave Wave is entirely based on a single essential mechanic: holding a finger on the screen moves your avatar upwards, while letting go moves it downwards; as soon as you touch an obstacle it's game over. Until you get the hang of it, managing not to crash for more than a handful of seconds is however a titanic undertaking, due to the precision required between the various zig-zags, the speed of the game and the constant changing of the scenario: the The environment rotates, pulsates, deforms and overturns ceaselessly around one's avatar, so that the tension of the continuous ups and downs is accompanied by the need to stay focused and ready for a sudden inversion of the controls. Such an unpredictable variable can make Wave Wave seem not only a sadistic but also an incorrect game, independent of the player's skills and mistakes. In reality, this is exactly where the geometric design adopted by the Australian developer comes into play: the fact that any object, obstacle and backdrop is made up of equilateral triangles, and that one's avatar moves by 60, ensures that every movement is rigid, precise and schematic. In this way, those who play know that, however much it may move and distort itself, the path continues to follow ideal tracks, and that losing a game depends only and only on timing and concentration. In this case, those who have played Super Hexagon will experience a very familiar feeling, given by the perfect balance between tension and precise movements within a game structure that is extremely regular and geometric. In short, like Terry Cavanagh, Janson manages to eliminate the barriers between aesthetic design and mechanical design, making sure that the shapes and movements of the camera represent the very foundations of the gameplay. Difficult, fast and psychedelic, Wave Wave is the top for lovers of challenges Triangle no The Melbourne developer then took advantage of the flexibility of the idea to offer it in different sauces, enriching Wave Wave with a whole series of modes, options and difficulty levels. In addition to a must-have Infinity mode, in which the game doesn't end until the player makes a mistake, the game offers two particular variants. In the first, Galaxy, your avatar has an energy bar and takes damage if it collides with one of the many objects floating along its path; from time to time you can collect power-ups that recharge health or make you invulnerable, while with very rapid touches on the screen you can enter the so-called Wave Mode, a special status that allows you to earn bonus seconds with each touch. The last option is called Levels, and as the name suggests it differs from the previous ones because it offers pre-built scenarios rather than freshly generated ones: the goal is therefore to overcome the challenges proposed by the author, gradually unlocking increasingly complex levels. As mentioned, almost all modes can be played at additional difficulty levels, where the speed is higher and the obstacle patterns, as well as camera changes, become more unpredictable. In addition, it is possible to choose to face the Infinity mode in three different configurations: Random, with which the graphic effects and camera changes occur completely randomly, Rotator, which makes the level run continuously, and Repeater, in which no effect is applied and you face an ever-changing pattern of obstacles, thus challenging the player to maintain a steady pace throughout the entire match. At this point it should be clear that another point of contact between Wave Wave and Super Hexagon is the psychedelic and exhilarating style, made up of pulsating graphics and noisy electronic music; the same female voice that whispers the name of the game, announces the start of a game, exclaims ~Game Over~ and is heard at every power-up and camera change cannot fail to bring to mind the thousand curses and the busy hours of tension spent in the company of Cavanagh's game. Maybe that piz is missingzico of originality that Hexagon had in its debut a couple of years ago, but Janson's certainly proves to be a fun arcade with its own personality, and not the derivative game it may seem at first glance.", "date": "2014-03-20", "grade": "8.0"}
