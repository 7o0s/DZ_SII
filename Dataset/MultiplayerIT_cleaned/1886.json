One year later, Pacific Coast Power And Light Co (PCPALC, from now on) consolidate their hard-won position with this Mx Superfly Featuring Ricky Carmichael (released a few months ago in the United States), which we're going to analyze right away. Two wheels in the air The gameplay and the concept of Mx Superfly do not differ much from the prequel, which is already more than valid in itself: the twenty-five tracks available to the gamer (three more than Mx2002), most of which outdoors, are divided between some really exist and others invented from scratch; globally they form a perfect combination with the control system set up by the American coders, giving life to a dynamic and fun driving game, supported by tricks, or rather spectacular acrobatics which constitute one of the main dishes of the dish distributed to us by Thq. Two wheels in the air The control system turns out to be immediate and very intuitive: with the left analog stick you steer and perform the many stunts included in the video game package, with the right analog stick you accelerate and brake, while with the back buttons you load the suspensions , to prepare your vehicle for a flight from which you will show off (after a few laps) somersaults at 360 degrees, sudden rotations on its axis as well as mini flights upside down for a few meters, trying to make a tumble that can waste precious seconds . It is also true that, especially if you want to test yourself in Career mode, it will be a real obligation to perform repeated stunts, gradually different (to avoid pay reductions) and increasingly spectacular, while climbing to the top of the rankings and you go up in rank, or rather in the displacement of your bike. The aforementioned control system, whose immediacy and intuitiveness should (at least) be commended, marries well with an artificial intelligence of the opponents in charge of the aggressive andante but, at the same time, permeated by a touch of realism (curves that are badly overcome, falls following very difficult numbers, mid-air collisions and so on) absent in many racing games, even those with not very veiled business cards bearing the wording ~simulation~. Two wheels in the air A flaw, indeed, a limitation, resides in the fact that our videogame alter ego goes astray and, after a couple of seconds, is ~magically~ punished by the American coders with the unseating (immediate, inflexible and mandatory) from the beloved vehicle, penalizing the user by a further two/three seconds, who would certainly have preferred to run around the track undisturbed, perhaps suffering any sort of penalty at the level of the regulation. Apart from this small neo, everything runs like a pleasure: the variety of tracks, the many ways in which you can perform in front of a crowd and the (already mentioned) a.i. enemy, give Mx Superfly a truly remarkable playability and a longevity surely destined to last for whole weeks, thanks also to the split screen mode for 2 players, which will surely increase the high attractiveness that characterizes this Mx Superfly with great character. As if all this weren't enough, PCPALC gives us (so to speak Nd Tanzen) an editor to build the track of our dreams, providing it with curves (more or less infamous), ramps, gradients, bumps, bumps and so on. our fervent imagination will suggest something else. Renderware again The graphics engine used to create Mx Superfly is the well-known Renderware by Criterion (developers of Trickstyle and, above all, of the Burnout bilogy), a graphics tool that greatly simplifies the work of developers (Namco, Capcom, Konami, among others illustrious names), without however renouncing at least discreet cosmetics (Renderware was not designed with only the Playstation 2 platform in mind); the screen update is fixed at 25 constant frames, a choice (at first glance) that can make fluidity maniacs turn up their noses, but once it is ascertained that no slowdown peeps out (except in very rare situations and for a few thousandths of second) even with 12 bikes on screen or split screen mode in use, you can onlyat least be pleased with this choice. Renderware again The color palette used is adequate, without ever falling into banality, the textures settle on a good quality level (the overalls, for example, are likely to get dirty after a tumble on the ground), while a number of polygons more than gives life and shape to Motocross professionals, also equipped with excellent animations: the latter, fluid, realistic and, above all, very varied, only increase the sense of realism that permeates Mx Superfly. It is enough to observe, for example, a runner falling disastrously to the ground, to then see him standing and ready to run again, after a good shake of dust, to give credence to these lines. The discreet cosmetics that permeates the title programmed by PCPALC can also be found in the beautiful backdrops, both in the outdoor ones (surmounted by hills, flanked by mountains, set in the city), and in the indoor ones, whose polygon count is settle on suitable values. Music baby The sound sector of Mx Superfly is certainly one of the flagships of the title produced by Thq: beyond the implementation of Dolby Surround, the rock / hard rock / hip hop pieces by bands such as Spineshank, The Vandals, Hotwire and Souls Of Mischief, are decidedly enjoyable, many of which are even galvanizing and blend well with the tussle that, on the other side, Renderware manages on screen. Music baby Thumbs up also for the realistic and perfectly fitting sound effects, among the best heard in a racing game, while the sampling of digitized phrases remains a bit poor, aimed at commenting on our races and the craziest and most exciting stunts. Conclusions Mx Superfly Featuring Ricky Carmichael effortlessly poses as the hero to admire and surpass to aspire to the throne of motocross-focused racing games, improving on every aspect of the Mx2002 prequel and systematically, mercilessly, knocking down Mx Rider and Jeremy McGrath Supercross World (the latter, in itself, completely undeserving of purchase). Graphically it is convincing and without too many frills (although far from the graphic orgy of Gran Turismo), acoustically it is brilliant and on the rocker-hip hop going but, above all, it is characterized by immediate fun that should not fail within the canonical 2/ 3 weeks (thanks to the various game modes, the 25 tracks available and the handy track editor). Conclusions Mx Superfly, in a nutshell, is THE Motocross video game, a mandatory purchase for the fanatics of this world and, at the same time, it turns out to be fun, enjoyable and varied even for those looking ~only~ for a fun racing game. We conclude this review, recalling that the Mx Superfly here includes the rights of about twenty (and more) true Motocross champions, as well as some of the major brands in terms of motorcycle manufacturers, as well as being (already) also available for Nintendo Gamecube . Conclusions Pros: - skyrocketing fun - excellent longevity - bombastic music - level editor Cons: - it may not appeal to lovers of classic racing games - average graphics Ricky Carmichael strikes again A year ago, in these (wet) times, two video games of a somewhat mistreated typology on Playstation 2 (and not only), made their appearance on the black Sony monolith almost simultaneously: Mx Rider, created by Paradigm Entertainment (developers of Pilotwing 64) for the Atari/Infogrames label and Mx2002 Featuring Ricky Carmichael (distributed by Thq), both determined demonstrators of the Motocross genre who filled, in a flash, a gap that dissatisfied a fair share of owners of the famous 128 bit of the big ~S~.", "date": "2002-12-09", "grade": null}
