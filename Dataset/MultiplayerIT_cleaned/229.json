{"name": "Dead or Alive Xtreme 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/dead-or-alive-xtreme-2-recensione.html", "text": "Dead Or Alive was not widely understood as a playful product and was considered as a mere tech-demo for voyeur fetishists Actually today we can say that the then Xtreme Beach Volleyball (where volleyball offered a great excuse to ~watch~ the athletes) was nothing more than one of the first conceptually ~easy~ games, the Americans would say, ~easy~ to play, playfully undemanding and open to all. Practically the way of the ~Touch Generation~ so dear to Nintendo of children and families, of its Animal Crossing, of Sims, of Wario Ware mini-games. Dead Or Alive offered all of this, a series of easy and fun sub-games, a casino (has anyone thought of 42 Timeless Classics by any chance?) and many beautiful girls to observe and admire with their jaw grazing the ground due to the polygonal mass of the their buxom breasts. A game with many facets Today we're talking about a game for Xbox360, Dead Or Alive Xtreme 2, the sequel to what was once the volleyball of the Tecmo girls. Times have therefore changed and we find ourselves judging a more mature product, now inserted in unsuspecting times where ~conceptual~ games invade the shelves of our shops every day. Tecmo therefore had the opportunity to improve the structure of DOA Extreme and expand it even further, trying to give it a playful dignity previously only dreamed of. The heart of Xtreme 2 is not to be found in the mini games themselves that are part of it. The playful component has a double value as an excuse: the first, and the most obvious one (hard not to notice) is the satisfaction of being able to admire so many beauties at the bathroom, dressed, let's say, only in bikinis and very small swimsuits. All topped off with a ~Mune Yare~ effect of bouncing breasts that can be adjusted as desired by the generous options. The second, less palpable (perhaps) pretext is to raise money, lots of money, to buy objects, gifts and food. today we find ourselves judging a more mature product, now inserted in unsuspecting times where ~conceptual~ games invade the shelves of our shops every day A game with many facets In fact, on the tropical island of DOA there are numerous small shops where you can go shopping: once inside you can select the thing to buy and have two options. Keep it for ourselves or give it to a girl, to win her over and convince her to become our friend. Or maybe a playmate. The more girls we conquer, the better it will be for us, the aim of the game is in fact to make inroads into the hearts of the other protagonists. The most important ~side quest~ is that of collecting and finding particular items. The amount of objects, food and above all costumes that you can buy and use is impressive and new things are constantly discovered with each game, a factor that greatly stimulates replayability even once the main story is completed. The sexy coefficient Volleyball put aside, here comes other new games in Extreme 2: one of all is the jet ski race in full Wave Race style. The Nintendo title is mentioned not by chance as it seems that Tecmo has consistently traced its playability and style. The slopes will be gradually unlockable, we start from the classic ~loop~ in a circle, a very simple slope that we will need to practice with the controls: the backbones are used to make tight curves (as on the N64 and GC), the second right backbone instead it will give a nice acceleration boost. With the keys you perform the pirouettes and the various tricks, at the end of the race in fact we will be assigned a score based on the position obtained, the numbers performed on the jet ski, the time and the ~sexy~ coefficient due to the various provocative poses assumed on the track. Based on these scores we will earn the ~zack~ dollars necessary for our purposes. the current currency is always that of Zack as the nice and rich DOA character is once again the undisputed King of the tropical island The sexy coefficient Yes, the current currency is always that of Zack as the nice and rich DOA character is once again the undisputed King of the tropical island. The other minigames aren't quite as fun and are much more limited in controls and concepts. For example, it is possible to throw yourself down the slides of the water park, fight in the pool to make your opponent fall into the water or walk on the inflatable course without ever losing your balance. Each of these is played simply with a key and only the right ~timing~ is required for correct pressure, or by simply moving the left analogue which controls the movement of the girl we have chosen. The absolute King is still Zack Once again, as we said, Zack is the assolute ~big brother~ of the island that commands everything and sees everything. After all, it's all his property. In the evening before going to bed he will probably send us some gift packages, to thank us for what, then? Or he will invite us to his very private casino already known in the first chapter, where it will still be possible to play all the various attractions typical of these places: roulette, blackjack, slot machines and so on. A great way to bleed our finances, or boost them, if we're lucky at the game. There hasn't been, unfortunately, any kind of novelty or addition to any of this. The same goes for volleyball, almost intact compared to the previous chapter. Same controls, just two buttons, and same game mechanics: fun, very arcadey and simple. Also spectacular if desired, thanks to the excellent replays that inevitably linger on the soft curves of the athletes. In the evening before going to bed he will probably send us some gift packages, to thank us for what, then? The absolute King is still Zack It is also possible to unlock a camera that will allow us to take photographs at any time and from any angle, really all of them. The only problem is the relative difficulty of maneuvering with the joypad to be able to use it, the configuration of the keys certainly does not help to understand how to move the lens and the action is rather difficult: the movement that would be natural to everyone is certainly that of a classic FPS, left analog for visual, right for movement. Unfortunately it doesn't work like this to take pictures and to train the machine it will take some time and getting used to. The objectives of Dead Or Alive Xtreme 2 In DOA Extreme 2 there are the beauty (it is appropriate to say it) of 46 objectives to be achieved, with a total of 1000 points at stake. Although so numerous, they are mainly divided into two categories: making the most friends and completing the swimwear collections. Each character must conquer at least two, four or six friends to unlock the related 3 objectives, and acuistare the complete collection of bikinis. It is relatively easy to unlock the first ones, those from ~2 friendships~, much more difficult to reach all the others. Each of them ~gives~ 20 points, and there is also a secret objective not declared by the developers to consider, in all probability reserved for the online mode with ranked matches. Freedom of movement? What we all kind of expected from DOA Extreme 2 was a refresh of the concept of the game itself, Zack's wonderful island is the backdrop for all the sexy scenes of our heroines: from bright and sunny beaches to the forest, from the pool to the ocean sea. However, such beauty is castrated by the fact that it is absolutely not viable, walkable, explorable, in short, watchable. It is therefore a beautiful setting, an absolutely non-interactable polygonal scenography, and it is clear how much a pity it is not to be able to visit it at all through the free movement of our protagonists. Just think of the island of Test Drive, wonderfully immense, sometimes with splendid views, completely photographable. It is also true that it is still a question of looking at the girls, and not at the vegetation, but greater freedom would certainly have given the skits more appeal and an even greater longevity. Furthermore, most of the locations are recycled by weight from the first Extreme Beach Volleyball, it is clear that the work of Team Ninja has not been studied sufficiently. It is therefore a beautiful setting, an absolutely non-interactable polygonal scenography, and it is clear how much a pity it is not to be able to visit it at all through the free movement of our protagonists Freedom of movement? The whole game is built with the old graphics engine of the first Xbox, suitably modified to add some polygons in the right areas, and we all know what they are. DOA has always been a graphically avant-garde series for some aspects, such as the polygonal mass, but absolutely behind as regards graphic effects and filters. Also this time the girls have practically no effect applied on their body, except for the shadows finally inserted (ie the shadows that derive from another part of the body and not those reflected on objects or the floor). Even the hair animation routine is the same as in the old chapter and shows some uncertainty: DOA Extreme 2 certainly doesn't scream technological marvel, certainly on Xbox, at the time, it had managed to amaze much more. If the comparison is then made with similar games such as the new rumble rose, the Tecmo title comes out even worse. Albeit the nipp styleAlthough both really pleasant and sexy, the creation of the girls in bikinis of Rumble Roses is much, much more advanced from all points of view: anatomical, polygonal and for the effects applied to the textures. When being old has its perks The animations are as usual very good and all derive from an excellent motion capture. Apart from those of the hair, which are not always beautiful to look at, the movements of the girls are sinuous and very provocative. By setting our age up to 99 from the options, it is possible to increase the bouncing of the breasts beyond belief, it is recommended to enter an age of about 40-50 years to have a fairly natural effect, but still deliberately and forcibly exaggerated. Another thing that could make you turn up your nose are oversaturated color combinations: magenta red mixed with intense green, or an electric blue with an intense brown. The same shades of various locations are not always spot on, perhaps it would have been preferable to use softer colors so as to give an effect of greater realism. Moving on to the sound department, the music of DOA Extreme 2 is very good, with a repertoire ranging from Bob Marley's reggae to Hilary Duff's typically Californian party pop. Most of the time we will listen to American pop-rock tunes in full college party style for teenagers, and we find that the choice is at least spot on. On the island there is a radio station where it is possible to select tracks and listen: certainly the amount of music and songs is not fantastic, on the contrary. In the end it's always the usual 15-16 looped songs, mostly taken from the old chapter in large part. A greater variety would not have hurt at all: the style was the right one. By setting our age up to 99 from the options, it is possible to increase the bobbing of the breast up to capacity When being old has its perks Speaking of the online component, it must be said that it is possible to create personalized lobbies with our avatar (which can be a fish, an octopus, a crab) which will be displayed on the beach of a deserted island where other people can enter . Once you enter the island it will be possible to chat and start some challenges with jet skis or volleyball. Ranked matches generate a score ranking based on the victories established in each sport, while those of the player will allow us to challenge friends from our personal list. Comment DOA Extreme 2 is basically the old version shot in high definition. There are too many similarities with the Beach Volleyball of a few years ago: the costumes, the locations, the volleyball and the graphic sector itself have remained almost completely unchanged. Those who are lucky enough to own an HD TV will be able to notice the differences, for all the others it will be difficult to distinguish one from the other. The music is spot on, but rather repetitive, as are all the new mini-games included: the jet skis aren't bad, but you don't play anything other than that, except volleyball which is the same as the previous edition. We would have expected some substantial news that unfortunately has not arrived, Extreme 2 is therefore recommended only and exclusively for those who have missed the first chapter on the good old Xbox and want to enjoy a different game than usual. Pros Girls in bikinis Jet skis Sexiest instruction booklet in gaming history Cons Old high resolution DOA No innovations Often very limited checks The release of the first Dead Or Alive on Xbox caused a stir, and for several reasons: first of all it was the first new generation game to leverage all those pseudo-erotic impulses typical of the male video game user, but above all for the long diatribe triggered by the fact that it wasn't a real game. With hindsight it is easy to understand today that Dead Or Alive was not widely understood as a playful product and was considered as a mere tech-demo for voyeur fetishists.", "date": "2006-12-07", "grade": null}
