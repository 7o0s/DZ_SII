Either due to technical shortcomings, controls or simply due to lack of commitment by the developers, the fact is that by limiting ourselves to this generation of handhelds, neither DS nor PSP (the latter despite a certain Gran Turismo) have been able to offer something really valid belonging to this thread. Who knew it would take award-winning iPhone and Gameloft to turn things around... Brum Brum Expected for several months as one of the most important products destined to appear on the App Store at the beginning of 2010, GT Racing is an automotive title clearly inspired by the ~masters~ of the genre on home consoles, namely Gran Turismo and Forza Motorsport; therefore, although originality is missing, but this is certainly not a novelty in Gameloft's productions, the final result can be defined as nothing less than surprising. On the other hand, if in most iPhone games immediacy is the master, often sacrificing depth and longevity, on the contrary GT Racing can boast content that would not be out of place not only on more famous handhelds, but even on home consoles , all this without having to bring up the price issue. In fact, for 5.49 euros you are faced with a fleet of over 100 models divided by 24 manufacturers, 14 different tracks and above all a truly sensational main game mode. It is not excessive to say in this sense that GT Racing offers that career mode that should have been present in the aforementioned Gran Turismo for PSP. In fact, the ~race center~ offers access to 4 types of competitions, divided into GT touring championships, constructors' events, driver contracts and special invitations, for a total of 63 races; a remarkable variety, which develops on the basis of a further subdivision into 4 classes (C, B, A, S) which are nothing more than the licenses. The latter must be obtained through the relative exams which are completely similar to those of the Polyphony title. And like the Japanese title, there is also a deep section of car customization, through the purchase of parts in the engine, tyres, weight reduction, suspension, brakes, spoilers and bodywork categories. The only regret in this sense is that the aesthetic changes are not displayed graphically, since the models of the cars always remain the same whether they have just left the dealership or whether they have been fully developed. But in addition to all these elements, it is in the pure and simple gameplay that GT Racing proves to be a product of great quality; anyone who has had the pleasure of playing Firemint's Real Racing will be able to find several similarities in the mechanics studied by the programmers of the French company, and this can only be a compliment. The differences between the various cars are actually perceived, the driving model is satisfying and robust - although obviously far from the sophistication of Polyphony products - and the artificial intelligence of the opponents is at least satisfactory. What is important, however, is to deactivate all driving aids immediately, in order to be able to fully appreciate what GT Racing has to offer. Obviously the control system makes extensive use of the accelerometer, and despite the various possibilities offered in the options, the best choice remains the one that delegates the steering to the inclination of the iPhone and accelerator and brake to the virtual keys on the screen. Too bad that in such a positive picture, the only real defects are attributable precisely to that graphic aspect which from the images seemed to be the main workhorse; far from being an aesthetically unappealing game, GT Racing however suffers from very marked bad clipping for the trackside elements, such as to make entire buildings appear suddenly a few meters away. Similarly, there are many problems in the so-called ~lod~, or the level of detail of the opposing cars that changes all too sharply in front of your eyes, and the frame rate is discreet but far from that of the rival Real Racing. It is evident that Gameloft wanted to ensure compatibility for all iPhone models, but at least the automatic detection of the hardware would have been appreciated to improve the situation on the 3GS. The multiplayer is good, available both locally and online, even if a greater amount of options and an internal chat in the lobbies would have been welcome.
