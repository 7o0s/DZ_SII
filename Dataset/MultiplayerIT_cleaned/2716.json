No wonder, therefore, in the face of the arrival of an incarnation of the series in virtual reality that promises tension in quantity, exploiting the stealth dynamic typical of the films to make it the main fulcrum of the experience of this title for the Oculus platform. The advantage of virtual reality Almost entirely shaped around the stealth dimension, Jurassic Park Aftermath leverages one of the sequences most common to all the films in the series, the one in which the protagonists narrowly escape the voracity of the Velociraptors. In this case, however, we are completely alone in the face of predators as lethal as they are intelligent who can concentrate all their ravenous lust towards us. Fortunately, a voice guides us on the radio, showing us a path to safety through the semi-destroyed buildings of Jurassic Park, now iconic environments, albeit different in this case. They are in fact reinterpreted with a view to a marked cel shading which returns an excellent three-dimensional sensation, but which at first certainly does not seem the most suitable choice to enhance the realism to which the experience aspires. But the subjective perception has the advantage of changing, in this case thanks to colors and excellent animations that scene after scene transform a world at first sight alien into a reality that slowly engulfs us, allowing us to fully enjoy an intense atmosphere that represents without doubt the main pillar of experience. On the other hand, we find ourselves alone and unarmed to face some of the most dangerous creatures that have ever lived on our planet, starting from the Pterodactyl that welcomes us on Isla Nublar to the T-Rex that certainly cannot be missing in a Jurassic Park. But the main opponent, the one who chases us for almost the entire game, is the aforementioned Velociraptor who in Aftermath plays the role of the xenomorph of Alien Isolation. The dynamics, on the other hand, are the same and push us through tunnels and hiding places in order to escape the rounds of enemies with unscripted artificial intelligence who enjoy excellent hearing, do not completely erase their memory when they lose sight of us and have an unpredictable behavior that often manages to surprise. The experience is less complex than that of Alien Isolation and leaves us more loopholes thanks to the large number of hiding places present, but among those that have clearly been inspired by the Creative Assembly title, it is one of the most successful. The tension is always palpable, the margins of error are slim and it is also necessary to be very careful about the force with which a locker closes, which enhances the virtual interaction. A few compromises too many Unfortunately, not all elements of Jurassic Park Aftermath combine to enhance its virtual dimension. Slipping between desks, ducts and more or less large environments, the first thing that becomes evident is the almost total lack of interaction with the game world. There are puzzles that include radios to tune and levers to pull, just as there are devices to be activated remotely to distract enemies, but from this point of view it would have been much more engaging and believable to be able to grab and throw objects, as happens in infinite other stealth titles. Furthermore, the gory scenes are hidden from view and this takes away a key component of the franchise from a title which, among other things, is certainly not designed for the little ones. The suggestion, however, holds up well, even if tested by the repetitiveness of the stealth dynamics that often put us in situations that are all too similar to each other. At first, to be clear, the escape from Velociraptors has all the intensity of the cinematic Jurassic Park, but in the end one has the feeling of having seen that film too many times. In the middle of the adventure, it must be said, there is a sequence that changes the pace and which is decidedly effective, but it is not enough to avoid a feeling of repetitiveness that clashes in a title whose duration is around four hours, even dying many times. Definitely not much, even considering that it is half of the adventure and that it has a price of 21.99 euros. We must take into account the fact that in 2021 the second half of the game will be released in the form of DLC, but for now we have in our hands another virtual experience with great potential that lacks in terms of duration, suffers from too many shortcomings and is rather trivial from the plot point of view. We know that developing a VR game takes more effort in front of an audiencestill limited, but with titles like Jurassic Park Aftermath it seems that the developers lean too much on the wonder effect of VR, sacrificing too much the other aspects. In this case, however, the compromise linked to the graphic design makes sense. On the one hand, we have said, the cel shading technique has limits which in this case are magnified by a general lack of detail, glaring where some objects are not even modeled three-dimensionally, but once you get used to it everything works properly and requires minimum hardware resources, which is very useful to ensure full fluidity and extremely fast loading in the case of a title designed to run exclusively on Oculus Quest viewers. Furthermore, the audio sector is excellent and it is both in the dialogues in English that act as a guiding light towards salvation, and in the music that picks up on the thread of the soundtrack of the series, also useful for maintaining the atmosphere and involvement which, we repeat, are the pillars of a title that does not shine for interaction with the game world, such as to make it unnecessary to play in roomscale mode. Indeed, the very low ground view, like the very few options dedicated to the accessibility of VR, encourage you to play seated, thus also reducing a sense of vertigo that we felt more strongly in Jurassic Park than in other comparable titles.", "date": "2020-12-31", "grade": "7.5"}
