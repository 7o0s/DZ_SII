{"name": "Far Cry 5: A Spasso su Marte", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/far-cry-5-a-spasso-su-marte-recensione.html", "text": "Far Cry 5: A Spasso su Marte is the second of the three narrative DLCs dedicated to the last episode of the Ubisoft series, placed within a Season Pass characterized above all by the presence of Far Cry 3 Classic to lead the way. However, if the previous expansion saw us engaged in the role of veteran Wendell Redler at the time of the war in Vietnam, this time the developers have seen fit to take us even further, to be precise on Mars. The mad and foul-mouthed Hurk has in fact reached, it is not known how, the red planet, where he has fallen in love with an artificial intelligence which should represent a barrier against the advance of an alien race hostile towards the Earth. Knocked out and literally ~decomposed~ by the enemy, the unlikely paladin has enlisted the help of good old Nick Rye, the airline pilot who in the timeline of this pack has just had a child and is returning home from his wife. Nick is therefore teleported to Mars and dressed up in a space suit while Hurk explains what he must do to avert the terrible threat: collect cores, reactivate a series of towers and kill as many alien monsters as possible. Gameplay The setting of A Spasso su Marte significantly influences the basic mechanics to which Far Cry 5 had accustomed us: the presence of a reduced gravity allows you to take large leaps, and during the first stages you come into possession of a jetpack which it allows you to rise in the air for a few moments, so as to reach raised platforms which, more often than not, make up the structures on top of which there is a device with which we have to interact. The problem is that all around is red sand, and under the surface there are hordes of not exactly friendly aliens, ready to emerge at any moment and attack us. We will be able to defend ourselves using an arsenal created specifically for the expansion, made up of pistols, machine guns, shotguns or sniper rifles, as well as homing missile launchers, all united by the fact that they use energy projectiles and therefore have infinite ammunition, net of a cooling timing that often forces you to change weapons on the fly in order to be able to extricate yourself in a frenetic fight. The cores we need to reactivate the artificial intelligence defenses are generally guarded by the alien queens: opponents to be reckoned with, who require a large number of hits to be knocked out; but there are some variations on the theme. With each new restored location we will be given the opportunity to use a high-tech 3D printer to purchase new weapons and items, including the good old wingsuit, a set of grenades, special ~patches~ to heal us, armor and more . Payment is not in dollars, but in units of a substance Hurk calls, er, space seed. I mean, not exactly with this term, but we understand each other. It is obtained from killed opponents and from a series of barrels arranged within the map, fairly large but a little too similar to itself: seen a reddish expanse, seen all. Playstation 4 trophies There are only seven Trophies in Far Cry 5: A Walk on Mars, and it is possible to obtain them by completing the campaign, eliminating all the queens and collecting all the notes scattered within the levels. The rest of the achievements are based on numbers and require you to eliminate a certain amount of enemies. Structure and humour Reaching and unlocking towers or locations is in no way new to the Far Cry series, but the formula still holds up well and, in the case of A Spasso su Marte, guarantees around five hours of fairly enjoyable gameplay though not for the reasons you might think. In fact, the weapons seemed lacking in terms of design (aesthetically they all look the same) and the feeling of the fights is not the best, proving to be a bit too slippery and inconsistent in many situations, although the degree of challenge in the end is not trivial to the intermediate level of difficulty. We also appreciated the platform sections in which Nick has to take advantage of the jetpack to reach platforms placed higher and higher, perhaps freeing them from the presence of enemies by placing a few shots on the fly, assisted by the robotic version of Hurk which you see below. Brobocop? However, Hurk is the real protagonist of the DLC, as well as the most valid reason to buy it: if you have tried your hand at the Far Cry 5 campaign, you will certainly know the crazy dialogues that put this crude, embarrassing character at the center of the scene and the absurd naturalness with which he tells completely crazy anecdotes. Well, in A Spasso su Marte the screenwritershave pushed that aspect to the max, with exhilarating results, which alone are worth the price of admission. After all, if Hurk is irresistible normally, how could he not be when he's reduced to a head floating in the air? Here, exactly. In short, compared to the first package, Hours of Darkness, the improvement is clear, and although this new expansion does not adequately exploit the potential of the Martian setting, proving to be generally repetitive, completing it will represent a pleasant challenge.", "date": "2018-07-22", "grade": null}
