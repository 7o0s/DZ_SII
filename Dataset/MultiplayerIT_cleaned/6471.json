The original Fruit Ninja, forerunner of the times and father of all touch screen casual games, was a resounding success, achieved by few others in the world on portable platforms. Furthermore, the game developed by Halfbrick Studios is one of the most played and loved ever with 300 million copies downloaded. Once the formula was guessed, replicating it on other platforms was only a matter of time, but when the first console chapter came out a few years ago, we needed a device capable of ~simulating~ a touch screen that didn't exist. Kinect was perfect for that purpose and thanks to its innovative and unique features the first Fruit Ninja was also quite successful on home screens. What could the developer add to the original formula to be able to re-propose it once again in a homemade sauce, this time on Xbox One? Fortunately, the heart of the game has not been distorted, but only enriched with new modes, options, characters and much more. The new Fruit Ninja Kinect 2 is an orgy of colour, fruit and lethal ninjas! Hokuto's Hundred Bananas After a short tutorial we can finally throw ourselves headlong into the mad fruit salad of Fruit Ninja Kinect 2, in which we are called to slice all kinds of fruit with karate strokes, trying to pulp as much as possible on the screen and at the same time avoiding toxic bombs and poisons. Of course, the classic ~quick game~ mode has been maintained, where the only aim is to keep the score counter running. Each type of fruit gives a certain bonus, which can be multiplied by chaining winning hits (yes, okay, combos). Once the maximum multiplier is reached, this is transformed into a score, which rises more and more until we make three mistakes, an event that inevitably leads to game over and the only condition for ending the game early in the classic mode. By selecting Arcade, however, we have to fight against a countdown trying to wildly slice everything that moves with moves that vaguely resemble those of a crazed Ken the Warrior against apples, pears and bananas. Our record automatically ends up in the online leaderboard among friends on your list, and also in a parallel leaderboard displaying all players worldwide. The novelty of Fruit Ninja Kinect 2 is a sort of story mode (let's call it that, even if it is decidedly sketchy) in which we have to face some tests within a hypothetical traditional Chinese festival. By selecting from four protagonists we have to try our hand at some skill tests that involve exercises that are slightly different from the classic ~cut and slice~. There is to dodge the Shuriken ninja without being hit, or to karate our way through a dense bamboo forest, cutting the plants that stand in the way. If, on the other hand, we wanted to try local multiplayer, the option to play with friends also appears, both in cooperative and competitive mode. To enter the game, it is enough simply to be in the view of the Kinect, which automatically detects us and allows us to start without much discussion. Occasionally, if positioned within two meters of the television, the camera can lose sight of someone and cut them off without warning. The advice we give is to play it at least three meters away to have perfect and error-free detection. We have tested the game with users of various heights (from one meter to one meter eighty) and we must say that Fruit Ninja Kinect 2 manages to detect all types of people very well, including very small children, thus allowing us to play peacefully all together in family. The game is full of moves to learn, mythological items like rare fruits, combos and special moves to unlock. Although the heart of its gameplay is quite repetitive, The new Fruit Ninja certainly has the merit of being more diversified, deep (as much as it can be a casual game) and varied compared to its predecessor already seen on Xbox 360. Many could ask how Kinect can imagine when we want to lunge to cut or hit, distinguishing it from a simple movement or dodge. The impression we had is that the developers, to ~activate~ the cut, have foreseen two factors: the approach of the hand to the screen, inevitable when miming a sword, and the acceleration given to the movement which in doing so activates the saber . Assumptions aside, there is only to record an excellent functioning of Kinect 2.0 which behaves very well both in menu navigation, always easy and fast, and in the game itself where the error percentage is trulylow body. Xbox One goals Fruti Ninja 2 puts the canonical 1000 points on the plate to be unlocked through 27 main objectives (some secret). Most are very easy to obtain and it's just a matter of practicing a little in Zen, Classic and Arcade modes, trying to slice as much fruit as possible in single player. It is necessary to explore all the various ways to get the most out of it, it is not a difficult undertaking but on the contrary, it will give you a lot of satisfaction. Some objectives are quite difficult (hit 10,000 fruits, or take 4 of the same fruit with one hit), but it's all about practice and perseverance. I would like two pears, at least I'll eat one! From a purely technical point of view, Fruit Ninja 2 bases all its technology on the exploitation of Kinect 2.0, even before the creation of next-gen graphics or anything else. Returning from the experience with the iOS and Android systems, the Canadians of Hibernum have created a very pleasant title to see, hear and ~touch~. The graphic sector is solid, without uncertainties during the hectic phases of wild slicing. These are very simple on-screen elements, without the amazing effects that Xbox One would be capable of or a thousand polygons, but the final effect is enjoyable and functional. The accompanying music follows the oriental setting and is very reminiscent of those already heard in films such as Kung Fu Panda, with which it shares many sounds and effects. The responsible software house has also made games such as Splinter Cell, Assassin's Creed and Star Wars on mobile platforms, and their absolute experience background has certainly influenced the success of their first console creature.", "date": "2015-03-20", "grade": "7.5"}
