{"name": "Nintendo Touch Golf: Birdie Challenge", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/nintendo-touch-golf-birdie-challenge.html", "text": "Swing Screen In ~Nintendo Touch Golf: Birdie Challenge~, the gesture that the player is called upon to perform to make a throw is not particularly difficult, and requires a little more attention only if you want to make a spin shot. In the standard setting, the ball is represented in the upper limit of the touch screen, while the space below is what you will use to make your shot. An orange line represents the recommended power to reach the distance you need, the blue one will be the power you decide to give to the shot. The shot is carried out by drawing a united line from the point of support (which will mark the power of the shot), up to the ball. If in the stretch you go a little wrong it is not important, the important thing is that once you get to the ball you are rather in the center of it. Hitting it from the side will mean making lopsided and weak shots, or worse yet, missing it completely, will mean adding a unit to your shot counter. The swing must also be carried out with a stroke as fast as possible, in fact even if the power is given by the initial point where you will place the pen, too slow an execution leads to an inexorably soft shot. The spin shot is made by drawing a diagonal stroke, then starting your shot by leaning the pen to the right or left of the screen. The important thing, the same, is to hit the ball in the center. An indicator marks the expected parabola for the throw you are about to make, and you will be able to see how the effect you intend to imprint will act. The parable will also change according to the type of spin you want to give the ball. Changing the spin means altering the height of the parabola, where the ball lands, and the influence that the wind will have on it. Golf? A child's game ... except that ... On most pitches you won't have any problems, just find a good support position for the DS and the rest will take care of itself. Once on the green you can send the ball into the hole with the ~put~ using the same system (obviously it is useless to impart spin and effects). A trajectory drawn on the green via will help you send the ball into the hole without too many problems, you just need to make it coincide with the hole, and calculate any variations in power given by the difference in height of the terrain (or weather conditions). With this system you will be able to pocket the ball at a very long distance, and in any case it will greatly facilitate the player's task. In very unfavorable conditions, the drawn trajectory will rightfully become semi-useless, either because the stretch is interrupted well before reaching the hole, or because the line folds back on itself due to the structure of the green. Just when the green takes on a particularly inadequate shape, shooting becomes a nightmare. Sometimes the gradients are really exaggerated, and although you think you have compensated more than adequately, you will find the ball at the same point from which you made the shot. Once, a second time and a third time. The player will not hesitate to save the game and restart the hole from the beginning, to recover a game that until then had been flawless. It should also be said that perhaps the same green tackled from the other side (therefore landing beyond the hole), could present itself with a totally different level of difficulty. These difficulty imbalances are one of the flaws of the game. The game runs smoothly most of the time, it seems simplified in all its phases. The swings rarely fail because of you, and you will soon discover that landing in tall grass, or in bunkers, carries almost no penalties, and you will always find yourself on the green with the expected number of shots, even in the case of wrong shots. An important variable is given by the wind conditions, which greatly affect the trajectories of the ball. However, in the event that the wind has carried you off the ~fairway~ there is little cause for alarm since you can immediately get back into the race with the next pitch. One reason for failure could be the default indicator that indicates club coverage (complete with landing grid). In simple shots it could happen that you adjust to this suggestion, but only by entering swing mode will you visualize the most indicative trajectory. The result is that a shot is made as intended, but simply calculated on a wrong figure, always remember to enter swing mode, therefore, before taking measurements for a shot. When approaching some external obstacles such as trees, a bit of confusion ensues: although the swing path appears to come out of any collision, the shot could still hit the obstacle. The lack of clarity in these rare situationsion leaves the player at the mercy of fate. Mode and aesthetics Of the various game options, the one that deserves the most attention is naturally the career mode, where you'll be called upon to face a long line of rivals in competitions of increasing difficulty. The holes will get more difficult from competition to competition, although the difficulty in the end is more given by the infamous greens than by the rest of the hole. The opponents are not too fierce and if you are used to golf games, you will be able to keep up in the standings without too many hitches, obviously restarting in those times in which you will lose even 3-4 shots to get out of an absurd position and in which you waited to meet again. By completing the various tournaments you will unlock the paths in the other game modes, fast and multiplayer, and you will also earn the money needed to update your wardrobe and equipment, in order to improve the characteristics of your character. By buying new sets of clubs, for example, you can increase the throw distance and vary the type of super-shot. I know you're wondering, but if I haven't told you about super shots before, it's because they're actually almost irrelevant to the game. By making good shots you will fill a bar that will accumulate up to 9 super shots. By pressing L while swinging, you have the possibility of executing a super shot based on the one allowed by the set of clubs in use at that moment (either long shot or curved shot), but due to the carelessness put into the reactions of the shots and the structure of the courses, you will be able to play all the holes without using particular attention when throwing. In any case, as soon as you have accumulated a nice nest egg, it is a good thing to go and buy tools that will bring you immediate benefits. It must also be said that these accessories are sometimes very expensive. The game interface is totally taken care of using the stylus, and works very well, except for some interaction choices that seem unsuccessful and usable to us, also due to some delays in the graphic update of trajectories or camera. Nothing that doesn't come naturally after a few minutes of play anyway. The programmers have tried to meet the players by allowing them to choose the hand that will hold the stylus, and during the game you can also turn the frame that allows you to make the swing. The upper screen sports sufficient 3d graphics, while the lower one follows the game via an overview of the field from above, in 2d graphics. 4-player multiplayer with one cartridge is also supported, where it is possible, among other things, to write pictochat-style messages to opponents, obviously in a more limited way. If you have four cartridges instead each player will be able to use his own character, and other game options will be available. The sound accompaniment is more than discreet, with catchy music each matched to a path, and also with some virtual surround effects. In a competition, for example, there are cricket songs and chirping that it is hard to believe that they come from the two loudspeakers of the sporting director. Finally, I remind you that the game is completely localized in Italian. Comment The major flaw of ~Nintendo Touch Golf: Birdie Challenge~ is that it is not as exciting as it should be. Golf games are neither spectacular nor adrenaline-pumping. Their strong point is to virtually lower the player into a golf course. Every shot, even the simplest, must require a minimum of study and apprehension, and any errors must lead to imbalances. In Touch Golf, on the other hand, you will soon discover that too much attention dedicated to studying the shot is superfluous. The shot will not lead to major penalties if it ends up in a bunker or tall grass. Problems immediately become frustration in the rare times that the ball ends up in a really unfortunate position and you'll lose 2-3 points for errors that you don't consider your own. This general carelessness of the game, and a careless course design causes the player to quickly lose interest. The swing made with the touch screen works very well, and that's what saves a game that otherwise has little else to say. If you are looking for a golf game for Nintendo DS, thanks to the functionality of the control system, Nintendo Touch Golf is currently the most suitable, but our advice is to wait for something more deserving, and above all more exciting. swing system works Discreet technical realization Cons Not passionate Shots sometimes inaccurate From simplicity to frustration Tiger Woods, despite the inaccuracies and difficulties of the case, proved that a touch screen-based swing could work. T&E Soft, not new to experiences in golf games, manages to improve the EA concept and makes italso accessible. Set aside the initial fear, already with the first swings you will understand that making good excellent shots via touch screen is not only possible, but it is also customary. Let's abandon the ancient philosophy of three taps on the button to swing, and let's go into this new vision of electronic golf.", "date": "2005-12-07", "grade": null}
