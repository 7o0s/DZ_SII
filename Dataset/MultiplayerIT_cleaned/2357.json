{"name": "The Sims: Hot Date", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-sims-hot-date.html", "text": "The city centre The thing that struck me the most is that in the downtown everything is very realistic: the people passing by and you can choose to greet by shaking hands or just nodding, the waiters who clean the tables in restaurants, the cooks, the lady of the cleaners, shop assistants talking to customers The city center is made up of various lots, just like in the classic neighborhood, which you can build and embellish as you like: each lot can have a name (City Park, Sim Shopping Center City or other titles suggested by your imagination), followed by a brief description of the place. In each of them you will have unlimited money to build the various buildings, indulging your creativity and decorating them with new and beautiful fences, with signs indicating the types of shops that are located there, flower beds, benches and so on. The construction of the shops is entrusted entirely to your imagination: you can build them from start to finish, just as you do for normal houses, deciding which type of items to put on sale. However, it must be remembered that in each lot there must be at least some external or internal public toilets (marked by the classic symbol on the door indicating ~ladies' or ~men's toilets~) and the counter with one of the various types of tills that are available. However, to make a more specific and orderly description of what we will encounter, it is worth listing the most significant innovations: first of all the clothing stores, where you can put various types of exhibitors that satisfy the tastes and budgets of each customer, from the most wealthy to the one with a limited budget. After a quick look at the various garments, the customer will be able to choose from the elegant dresses, costumes and lingerie available by going to try them on in the dressing room and looking in the mirror to see how he looks with what he has just worn. At this point he will enter the scene the clerk who will ask the customer whether he wants to buy the dress or not and will conclude the sale (you can wear the purchased garment once you get home). The city centre You can also buy your sweetheart some clothes and let them try on what you choose. As for the gift shops, you can create buildings with displays of flowers, jewels, toys and sweets. By clicking on each exhibitor you can choose one of the two products available...and if you don't trust what you buy if you don't have information about it beforehand...no problem! The shops in the city are attentive to the most demanding customers and you can read an accurate description of the product before making your choice! Among other things, every object you buy will be included in the ~gifts~ menu and you can give it to another sim when the occasion arises: if, for example, you are romantic and want to impress your loved one on a first date, introduce yourself with a beautiful bouquet of red roses purchased for the modest price of 200 simoleons. Is your she as sweet as a little girl? Surprise her with a teddy bear just like the one she had as a child and with a delicious lollipop! If, on the other hand, your sims would like to vent on someone just like you do with them, make them similar to gods by making them buy a copy of The Sims!!!! Corriere della Sera or the Resto del Carlino? To keep up to date with current news, you can't help but go to the newsagent and buy one of the six magazines available (Maximum, Victors' digest, Livin' Large...): in fact, with Hot Date, each Sim will have a interest indicator (as it has been with the skills indicator so far) whose knowledge points will increase by reading the magazines mentioned above. In this way each Sim will be able to decide to devote himself to one or more topics of his choice between travel, money, politics, weather, sport, music, the outdoors, art... Each Sim will therefore have his own interests and, for example, a Sim who is passionate about fitness will find it better and make friends more easily with a neighbor who deals with the same things, than with another who understands completely different things, such as politics and money. Obviously the more you are expert in many fields, the more you will have the possibility of being nice to others and impressing your favorite sim: when you talk to someone else, the option ~talk about topics~ will appear and, if you have nothing in common with yours interlocutor, the conversation will quickly tire you. Corriere della Sera or the Resto del Carlino? If while you are out shopping you feel peckish, you can also choose from a wide range of places according to your palate and, above all, theyour pockets: if you are a gourmet and you love elegance, for example, the French restaurant could be right for you! As soon as you enter one of these places, you will notice the comings and goings of waiters who clean the tables and serve customers and, if you peek around a little, you'll see the kitchens with the cooks busy preparing delicious morsels. The maitre will offer you three menus of different prices and, when you have decided on the one that best suits you, he will make you sit at a luxurious table. In the meantime, the pianist will pleasantly fill the wait and, if you want to surprise your better half, you can hire a violinist who will come and give her a romantic serenade. To conclude the evening, why not go for a stroll in a disco-bar and have a good drink? If, on the other hand, you don't want to spend a lot, practical fast food outlets are at your disposal where you can eat a tasty pizza or a hot dog followed by a good ice cream cone. Beaches, parks and other news Have you always wanted to take your Sims out and about, tired of spending most of their time indoors? Well yes, now you can do it without problems, there's not even a beach missing... We must immediately say that it won't be possible to swim in the sea, but we could very well build a nice swimming pool close to the beach where the Sims will happily splash around. But how can I take a nice swim if I'm elegantly dressed and have forgotten my swimsuit at home you might say? Beaches, parks and other news No problem: very comfortable cabins are at your disposal where you can easily change and put on your swimsuit away from prying eyes. There will also be deck chairs on which to relax in the shade of beautiful palm trees and, of course, if you have a sweet tooth you will not even be deprived of the pleasure of the stall that sells ice creams. If, on the other hand, you are not a lover of the sea, but prefer to spend some time surrounded by nature and are looking for a place to relax away from the office and the noise of the city, Hot Date has also thought of you. In fact, it is now possible to take the Sims to the park, where they will have fun playing with the remote-controlled boats that float in the pond: if you are a romantic, on the contrary, you can rent a delicious picnic basket and eat a good snack alternating with kissing by rolling around in the 'grass with your beloved half. There will also be spaces to have a nice barbecue with friends and enjoy everything sitting on comfortable picnic tables. Alongside these ~geographical~ innovations, the major innovations that Hot Date brings to the basic version of The Sims are the 40 new interactions that the characters can now develop. Each old interaction is now divided into various categories: example under the ~talk~ option, the choices appear. Ask how she is, talk about interests, ask how work is going, gossip... There are also various types of courtship and, above all, kisses: fast, passionate, polite, respectful, romantic, suddenly jumping into the arms of the beloved... If instead you believe that sympathy and making each other laugh are the most important thing in a relationship, you can improvise ventriloquist and entertain your better half with a puppet. Depending on the occasion, you will also decide whether to slow dance or go wild like crazy: the choice is yours! Hot Date's ~buy~ menu also received new icons and subgroups for each category. Beaches, parks and other news For example, under the table category there are the subgroups ~bedside tables~, ~kitchen tables~ and ~counters~, or under the decoration category there will be subdivisions into ~paintings~, ~sculptures~ and ~carpets~. There are also 125 new objects of which I will illustrate some of them below (many others have already been described dealing with the downtown). If you love tropical fish there is a beautiful giant aquarium, while in the garden you can put a nice pond with goldfish. For group activities, on the other hand, there is the beautiful heart-shaped bathtub in which the Sims can ~play~ (as in the love bed of the previous House Party expansion), kiss, hug and wash with each other. It goes without saying that this new object will dramatically increase the degree of friendship between Sims, as well as the new interactions that can be had on the sofas: hugging, caressing, rushing on the Sim who has just sat down or approaching slowly and nonchalantly, preventing the 'other than sitting, talking, flirting Among the new coordinated furniture sets and numerous decorations, a beautiful professional hob with hood, a ceiling fan and many single beds stand out.The latest news... and the conclusions. Even the build menu now boasts beautiful new entrances, including custom-made doors for shops, lovely wooden shuttered windows and flower pot on the windowsill, elegant fences and ornate walls for the city park. your gardens can also be renovated with beautiful new trees and ornamental plants: there is also no shortage of wallpapers and floors that are very suitable for covering the interiors and exteriors of shops. The latest news that is worth mentioning concerns the added skins: in addition to the lingerie, costumes and elegant clothes that you can buy in the center, Hot Date adds new heads with the most diverse hairstyles and replenishes your wardrobe with new men's suits and as a woman. 9 Now is the time to answer the question we asked ourselves at the beginning? Is it worth adding yet another add-on to The Sims? After playing with Hot Date I must say that I was immediately very enthusiastic about it, and I really believe that the response is positive. This expansion perfectly meets the expectations that the most devoted fans of this fantastic game expected from it and I'm sure that if you don't know The Sims well yet, or have doubts about it, with Hot Date you will be enchanted by it and you will no longer want to detach yourself from computer! Introduction: the love affairs of our Sims. Hot Dates is the new expansion that all The Sims fans who want to develop interpersonal relationships between their characters have been dreaming of for a long time. For the first time in the series, in fact, it will finally be possible to go downtown, go shopping, taste a delicious dinner at the restaurant and enjoy the view by having a nice picnic on the grass. To find out what's new at our disposal, once you get to the main screen of the game, you need to direct us towards the city centre, by clicking on a special icon or, if you are already playing with a family, by calling a taxi and paying the modest amount of 50 Simoleons. It is possible to take a tour of downtown with members of your family, or by meeting up with some friends you have previously invited over the phone. During your stay in the city, you will see a light indicator on the sim that is with you that will change color based on how much the guest is having fun or not. It will therefore be your task to make the time spent with you as pleasant as possible for the other sim. From now on you will have to sweat both love and friendship relationships: this is the beauty that will indulge your imagination! If, on the other hand, you prefer not to organize anything in particular and you have an adventurous spirit, you can very well go downtown on your own and approach the beautiful simmers of your neighborhood who pass by... who knows if you will meet your soul mate: with Hot Date everything it's possible!!!", "date": "2001-11-17", "grade": null}
