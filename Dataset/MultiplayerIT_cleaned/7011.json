The Italian developers of Digital Tales have bravely tried to fill this void, bringing the SBK14 Official Mobile Game, the official videogame reduction of the SBK championship, to iOS devices. The license allows the game to offer all the drivers and thirteen circuits of the current season, with a view to a very full-bodied and competent career mode, which includes both qualifying and complete races over the course of an entire championship, or in one race single that it is possible to face by selecting the driver and the track that we prefer among all those available. After downloading it for free from the App Store, you get a real demo, clearly limited, and the possibility to buy the complete product at the price of 4.49 euros, without further in-app purchases or any monetization attempt . An ~old school~ approach that we greatly appreciated, as it allows you to touch the quality of the game and possibly decide to buy it at a completely reasonable price, if we consider the contents and quality of the package. It is precisely the technical quality that affects the first impact with SBK14 Official Mobile Game, in fact: the graphics are detailed and very fluid, with very few uncertainties and a large number of bikes on the screen at the same time that challenge each other between hairpin bends and straights. The track flows beautifully and reveals interesting details of the scenery, including a variable day / night cycle that is decided randomly by the system. What is not convincing are the connection animations, for example when an impact or a fall occurs: the solution adopted in these situations is simplistic and clashes with the care placed in the other aspects of the technical sector. If you are looking for a nice motorcycle game, SBK14 Official Mobile Game is what you are looking for As you want me The control system adopted by Digital Tales for the SBK14 Official Mobile Game revolves around the accelerometer, which is used by default to control the inclination of the bike and whose sensitivity can be adjusted so as to meet our tastes and increase or decrease reactivity to inputs, a fundamental factor especially during on-the-fly trajectory corrections. However, there are nine selectable styles for the controls, which provide the aforementioned accelerometer or a virtual joystick, accelerator and brake buttons or an analog ~slider~, and so on. Rarely have we found such an abundance in terms of control customization in a racer; and here too we must applaud the attention of the developers, who have not forgotten even to include driving aids that can be deactivated and different levels of difficulty which substantially influence the behavior of the bike on the track. It is a pity that in terms of physical rendering the game lacks a bit of personality, i.e. it appears ~light~ compared to what occurs on the screen, without translating the forces acting on the bike in a sufficiently realistic way when we we lean to go around a hairpin bend or we brake to the limit. Let me be clear, these are shortcomings that we have often and willingly found in productions with very different ambitions, and which therefore in no way affect the goodness of this SBK licensed racer, which has a traditional but full-bodied structure (and made more interesting by the presence of numerous objectives), excellent graphics and sound of good workmanship, functional to the action.", "date": "2014-07-11", "grade": "8.0"}
