{"name": "Jedi Starfighter", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/jedi-starfighter-3.html", "text": "Adi Gallia & Nym In Jedi Starfighter first of all we will be able to use two different characters, Adi Gallia and Nym, depending on the mission that we will be carrying out. A valid way to give greater prominence to the plot, and allow the player to try his hand at missions that will take place in parallel over time. These two pilots will obviously have a different starship which I will mention in the gameplay part of the review. Since the game features a fairly large number of main and side characters, I have listed their names and a quick and simple biography below: Adi Gallia: Jedi Master of Correlian origin, she is endowed with great powers derived from the force and is a member of the Jedi Council. Being considered a skilled pilot, she was entrusted with the task of testing the new Jedi Starfighter prototype (the ship she will use in missions). Nym: Nym had a past as a criminal, but now thanks to his skills as a pilot and strategist, he is fighting against the Trade Federation who have occupied his base on Look. Nym leads a small pocket of rebels who intend to drive the trade federation out of the Karthakk system. Mace Windu: Mace Windu is the most powerful and important figure of the Jedi Council on Coruscant, he is the one who decided to send Adi Gallia on a mission to the Karthakk system, and is in the foreground for the fight against Dooku's separatist movement . Reti: Reti is a skilled mechanic and a trusted friend of Nym, he will be present in many missions that will face each other in the game and represents an excellent ally. Count Dooku: Count Dooku is a dark Jedi with a great charisma that he uses to command a separatist movement which also includes the Trade Federation. Its goal seems to be the weakening of the power of the Republic but its true purposes are shrouded in mystery (those who have seen Episode II will surely understand its real purpose). Cavik Toth: Cavik Toth is a young captain, ambitious and unscrupulous, allied with the Trade Federation; he secretly made a deal with Dooku to take over Karthakk's system. Introduction Jedi Starfighter, presents a plot that develops close to the events narrated in the film Episode II, but focuses attention on a fact that is not mentioned in the film: the dangerous alliance between Count Dooku and Captain Cavik Toth, an ally of the Federation of the Merchants. But to better understand the situation, I will briefly explain the background of the title in question. These are hard times for the Republic, the separatist movement led by Count Dooku is preparing for an imminent war, finding a powerful ally in Captain Cavik Toth, an ally of the Trade Federation. The count intends to take possession of the Karthakk system, particularly rich in raw materials, useful for financing his war against the Republic. Upon learning of this obscure conquest plan, the Jedi Council led by Grand Master Mace Windu decided to send Jedi Master Adi Gallia to Karthakk to help the rebel movement fighting against Toth and the Trade Federation. The leader of the rebels is the pirate Nym who fights to reconquer his mother base located on Lok, but occupied by the forces of the Trade Federation. The alliance between Adi Gallia and Nym will be essential to ensure the final victory over the dangerous Captain Toth and the terrible Count Dooku, who in the meantime have created a secret weapon with devastating potential... I won't tell you more so as not to spoil the plot of the title, narrated and illustrated by computer graphics sequences of great impact. Jedi Starfighter The title is divided into two distinct options, the first concerns the standard missions to be carried out to finish the game and the second concerns the bonus material that will be unlocked by proceeding and completing the single player campaign. The missions in the game are divided into 4 sections. The first concerns a sort of training where you can learn how to use every single command of the control system and all the features that the game offers. The other sections instead take the name of acts, each consisting of a certain number of missions to be completed. For each mission, during loading, the main and bonus objectives will be communicated, useful for unlocking very interesting extra content such as upgraded ships and secondary missions. In the various levels there are also hidden objectives which, if completed, will guarantee special bonuses. For each mission it will be possible to choose the level of difficulty (faciland, medium and hard) and the ability to play the game in cooperative mode using a second pad connected to the Xbox. A very interesting additional element is the awarding of medals if the mission is carried out by completing all the objectives, and guaranteeing excellent flight performance. The second option concerns the bonus features, i.e. a series of missions and space vehicles that can only be used after completing the campaign missions. The bonuses range from the use of the advanced Jedi Starfighter prototype to the multiplayer mode which includes a brand new level (which does not appear in the PS2 version) set on Coruscant where you can face Jango Fett head-to-head in two-player mode. Just to mention the massive presence of bonuses, we will have the opportunity to use vehicles such as the Tie Fighter and the X-Wing in the missions of the historical campaign, or use Nym's Havoc modified and with devastating firepower. As many other games have accustomed us by now, the space on the Jedi Starfighter DVD has also been occupied with the inclusion, again in the form of bonus material, of the artwork of the ships made by the developers, of some films taken from the programming phase of the title and two special movies showing two really interesting games: Gladius and Indiana Jones. Gameplay Jedi Starfighter is a decidedly arcade-style game that puts us at the wheel of a spaceship with which to face and complete the over 15 missions that the game offers us (excluding the bonus ones and those dedicated to multiplayer). The game will allow us to use two ships in particular, the new Jedi Starfighter prototype used by Adi Gallia and the pirate Nym's Havoc. The playability of the title is decidedly high, so much so that you are able to master the spacecraft in the best possible way within 5 minutes or even less, thanks also to the excellent control system, simple and intuitive. However, to make the best use of all the commands and advanced functions of the spaceship, such as dynamic targeting and control of support ships, there are some specific training missions. As I have already said previously, the gameplay of Jedi Starfighter follows the one already seen in its previous episode (Star Wars Starfighter), but enriches it with some very important elements which in some cases are essential and decisive for the mission objective. Using Adi Gallia for example, we will have the possibility to use four Jedi powers as secondary weapons: the force shield, the lightning bolts, the shock wave and the force vision. In particular, the sight of force is able to alter the passage of time, slowing it down and allowing our ship to move much faster, so as to be able to prevail even against a fleet of enemies. Jedi powers can be activated using the secondary fire key (B) and are available only and exclusively when the ~strength~ bar on the screen is full. Furthermore, the Jedi powers can be performed in alternative ways, by pressing the B key for more or less time, the effect is different, guaranteeing obviously different performances. As for Nym, he will have at his disposal additional secondary weapons ranging from missile bombers to self-guided proton torpedoes. A peculiarity introduced in Jedi Starfighter is the possibility of giving orders to the so-called wing mates, who will join us in numerous missions and to whom we can order to hit a target, escort a ship or cover us as we enter enemy territory. From the point of view of game situations, the title in question is truly spectacular, the variety of missions is great and will range from escorting important cargo ships to attacking and destroying strategically located enemy bases. For example, in one mission we will have to shoot down a wave of bacteriological warhead missiles aimed at a colony, while the Trade Federation will attack us with ships and submarines. This mission, especially at the beginning, is reminiscent of a classic from the past, the legendary Missile Commander; in fact, we will find ourselves committed to destroying all missiles before they impact on civilian structures. I can therefore say that the variety of situations and missions in which we will find ourselves are one of the strengths of the game. Multiplayer Multiplayer gameplay can be divided into two areas, the first being the ability to run the campaign cooperatively with another player.ocatore, while the second, present in the bonus sector, will allow you to try your hand at missions expressly dedicated to multiplayer. The missions in this case range from escorting an allied fleet to going head-to-head with Jango Feet (bounty hunter featured in Episode II) on Coruscant. In particular in the cooperative mode, once all the objectives have been completed, a special medal will be displayed in the mission screen. Graphics and Sound From a graphic point of view, the title in question presents a detail worthy of note, especially during the clashes in space where there are ships of very well recreated dimensions. In addition, many vehicles full of polygons and really convincing special effects are always present on the screen, which the game engine manages to manage in a dynamic and very fluid way. The transparency and reflection effects are splendid, as are the fog, and, more generally, the particle and volumetric effects. The ships are recreated with well-crafted textures and with an unprecedented wealth of polygons. Note the presence of the antialiasing filter, which minimizes the problem of jaggies on inclined and oblique surfaces. As for the sound aspect, the game offers us the most famous and epic motifs of the Star Wars saga, guaranteeing an exceptional soundtrack. A positive factor is the complete localization of the title in Italian, including speech, which adds a touch of atmosphere to the game. For example, during the clashes we will have the opportunity to listen to the comments and exchanges between the protagonists engaged in reckless actions. Conclusions Here we are at the end of the Jedi Starfighter review. By now you've certainly got an idea of what I think of this game (among other things I'm also a fanatic of the George Lucas saga). After analyzing all aspects of this title, with a decidedly arcade style, I can tell you that I have not found any defects whatsoever. The only one is related to the genre, arcade space combat, which some may not like. For the rest, the game is excellent in all respects, including that of longevity ensured by the presence of special bonuses that are really difficult to unlock. Jedi Starfighter proved to be decidedly superior to its progenitor, from all points of view ... in short, if you like the genre you will not regret having chosen it. Pros: Star Wars Playability to the stars Incredible bonus material Completely in Italian Excellent technical realization Cons: Some may not like space combat Materials: Preview screenshots of Jedi Starfighter Tips The saga continues With the worldwide launch of Episode II, LucasArts took the opportunity to present its latest title from the Star Wars universe to the public, the game I am about to review represents the new chapter in the series that began with Starfighter. Jedi Starfighter differs from the first title, mainly due to the temporal location: it takes place before and during the events narrated by Episode II, hanging up on the film in some sections but presenting different situations and characters. As for the game structure, Jedi Starfighter takes up the one already seen in its predecessor but enriches it with countless aspects that I will illustrate to you during the review.", "date": "2002-06-13", "grade": null}
