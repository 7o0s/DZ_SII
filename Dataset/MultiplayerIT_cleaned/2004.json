{"name": "Gravity Games Bike: Street", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gravity-games-bike-street-vert-dirt.html", "text": "Perfect on the poster, but... The first important aspect of this genre of games is certainly that of the modes. Those provided by the game are four: Quick Start, Career Mode, Free Ride and Multiplayer. Unfortunately, something seems to have gone wrong in the minds of the game designers who, instead of providing the game with a tutorial, necessary to enter the game mechanics, have built two practically identical modes: Quick Start and Free Ride differ exclusively because within the second it is possible to choose one of the bikers proposed by the game, one of the six (identical) bicycles and all the scenarios unlocked in the Career Mode, clearly the main mode made up of the typical goals that unlock the following levels such as, for example, reaching a certain score through tricks or explore certain parts of the level and collect certain items. These objectives are quite obvious and traced in a very evident way on the clich of the genre, but they do not appear to the player as well thought out or evident as those of certain other titles, with the result that he often finds himself completing objectives by pure chance without realizing why , or racking their brains for what shameless technique the programmers may have devised to make them do. Not perfect control The second fundamental aspect concerns the control system and interaction with the environments: BBG is a kind of mix between the environments of the saga of Tony Hawk or Aggressive Inline and the tricks of the famous skater or Dave Mirra XXX. The aim is to master the medium with respect to the environment in order to be able to access all the most remote parts or perform the most complex tricks, necessary for overcoming the missions. While trying to draw on all these titles, Gravity Games BMX can't help but combine everything in an incoherent way, without achieving the beauty or depth of the three-dimensional worlds of Tony Hawk, the style and aggressiveness of Aggressive Inline or the precision of Freestyle BMX. The environments, in fact, are quite obvious even if sometimes pleasantly characterized, but the control system is very imprecise and significantly penalizes the approach to techniques and environments. Not perfect control While navigating the simplest tracks or performing basic tricks is easy, juggling the most complicated bottlenecks or pulling off complex strings of tricks is really annoying due to the bad relationship between player commands and what happens on screen. Even the physics of the game is inspired by Tony Hawk without having the coherence: if the falls too fast, the preposterous bounces and the bad shots without the possibility of changing the viewing angle are the defective legacies of the most famous skater on the console, the system menu, the interface and many details such as blood, textual indicators or unlocking methods are real moments of plagiarism, traced too exactly to seem random. Moreover, what the Hawk saga had best done, such as the tutorials, the character editor or the link system between the combos, has been left out or omitted. Instead of stocking the game with ridiculous characters with practically identical and non-upgradable characteristics, the programmers could have devised an editor or skill advancement system worthy of the name. A point in favor of the game lies in the two-player mode, quite varied even if afflicted by the same mechanical problems of the single-player game and afflicted by an oscillating frame rate. Audio/Video Coming to the visual department, the game is presented in the low average of PS2 games, combining an obvious technological engine with a fairly appreciable characterization. The environments are quite large and with a decent number of polygons, plus they have the considerable advantage of not slowing down or flickering too much, except in the most agitated moments. The speech on the characters is different who, while boasting an ultra-realistic motion capture on paper, move in an awkward and unrealistic way and have inconsistent reactions with respect to the environments. The selection of songs made by the producers is instead discreet: taking inspiration once again from the greatest hits of the genre, Midway has hired two or three bands from the hip hop or new metal repertoire and, after grabbing a couple of successesthey of the most famous Distrurbed and Sevendust, he slammed the latter on the cover to give fuel to the advertising department. The music is therefore pleasant even if, as a consequence, slightly repetitive and reserved for lovers of the genre, with a pleasant jukebox option that optimizes its performance, while the effects and samples are nice and nothing more than the usual already heard. Definitely... Judging by the list of its shortcomings, Gravity Games Bike might seem like a horrible title. It is actually a game that with greater attention could have been even more than discreet, but which is decidedly mediocre as it is entirely copied from other much more deserving proposals: consequently even lovers of the genre will be able to find a simple distraction from titles of a very different caliber such as the Hawk saga, Aggressive Inline, Freekstyle BMX, Matt Hoffman BMX or Dave Mirra's XXX. While it doesn't offer anything innovative, all that GGB presents is a derivative and not nearly as good copycat of the aforementioned titles, plagued by rushed production and lacking even adequate debugging. Taking a look at the jumble of the rest of the Midway Sports Asylums line-up, one realizes the absolute attention to the commercial aspect of the titles, boldly carried out at the cost of a certain lack of quality control. Definitely... Pros: nice soundtrack and jukebox enthusiasts can distract themselves with a valid rent waiting for Tony Hawk 4 multiplayer in two Cons: completely derivative, practically a mixed clone bad control of the characters no tutorials or character editor predictable and quite repetitive Given the recent public interest in extreme sports games, Midway has recently expanded its lineup of sports titles by inaugurating the Sports Asylums series, a large container of all the titles that do not fall into the broad categories of football, basketball, hockey and baseball proposed by the American software house. Gravity Games Bike promises to take you on the saddle of the greatest BMX world champions and is part of this series. In fact, the title fits perfectly into the clich of the most famous extreme sports games, such as the Tony Hawk series, Aggressive Inline or Freekstyle BMX, with respect to which it shows that it lacks nothing in terms of ~cover~: selection of the most famous bikers of the world, a heap of tricks to perform, levels that include a series of missions alternating with progressively unlocking competitions, new metal and hip hop soundtrack, ~secret~ movies to unlock and a handful of extras for the more persevering. However, GGB betrays an extremely superficial production, capable on the one hand of making it a clone of more famous titles to the point of plagiarism and on the other of making it incomplete in many fundamental aspects, such as collision control or management. It is not a terrible title but which probably would not offer anything particularly interesting for the average player and certainly nothing new or valid for the enthusiast of the genre. But let's gradually get into the merits of the presentation, the methods, the control and the audiovisual department.", "date": "2002-09-26", "grade": null}
