{"name": "Brick Breaker Revolution 3D", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/brick-breaker-revolution-3d.html", "text": "The remake trend isn't going to end any time soon, and over the years it has spawned a number of valuable titles. In the specific case of Breakout, the 1976 arcade classic has already been the protagonist of numerous reinterpretations, and the product created by Digital Chocolate is only the latest to arrive in chronological terms. The reasons behind this success are clear: extremely solid gameplay, immediate controls and a level of difficulty that increases gradually. Brick Breaker Revolution 3D adds to these elements an unprecedented system which in the ~revolution~ mode (precisely) makes the stages ~open~ at the top and bottom, with the player being pushed to go up to reach the boss on duty but can also concentrate on the destruction of every single brick. All of this takes place in an excellently crafted, fluid and spectacular three-dimensional context, while objects fall from above that can give us a hand or make things more difficult for us... Brick Breaker Revolution 3D offers us a good number of different modes. The ~Revolution~ mode, which is the one that gives the game its title, sees us face stages which contain a brick capable of ~opening~ them up and down, with the consequent duplication of the wand. We can commit ourselves to eliminating all the bricks (also because some interesting ~achievements~ have been inserted which are based precisely on the number of bricks destroyed) or we can move on to the picture above until we reach the boss, a creature also made up of blocks of various types, more or less resistant. Once defeated, we will move on to the next stage with an increase in difficulty level proportional to the degree of skill shown. The matches are characterized by the massive presence of objects that spring from the destroyed bricks, and that we can collect to obtain advantages or disadvantages. The green objects are those to be collected, and their power is activated by pressing the 5 key: they can extend the wand and provide us with guns, lasers, missiles, bombs and anything else that can make cleaning the stage easier. They also affect the sphere, which can become on fire (sweeping away everything in its path) or grow larger, multiplying the impact power. Red objects are the ones that should be avoided, as they can make our view ~dance~ (watch out: if you suffer from seasickness, it's not a pleasant thing), accelerate the motion of the sphere, shorten the wand and so on. Finally, gray objects can hide one or the other value. The ~Classic~ game mode offers us a similar action with regards to objects and blocks, but limited to only one stage at a time, while the ~Time Challenge~ sees us destroying bricks to stop a timer through power-ups, with the aim of lasting as long as possible. As mentioned above, this 3D version of Brick Breaker Revolution makes use of well-crafted polygonal graphics, with the action always flowing smoothly and a series of truly spectacular effects. The use of colors is exceptional, and clearly characterizes the stages, while the effects of the objects, especially the ~negative~ ones, translate into truly surprising visual changes for the agility with which they are managed. The sound commentary is entrusted to a series of good quality electronic music pieces, with the only defect of not having an independent volume control.
