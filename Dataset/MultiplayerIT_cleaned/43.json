{"name": "Infernal - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/infernal-recensione.html", "text": "Good, bad, encore Infernal is a third-person action game with some very limited adventure elements that have as trump cards a spectacular technical realization and many heart-pounding shootings. The control system is the standard one: WASD to move, the mouse to shoot, both with the primary attack and with the one enhanced with the infernal mana, plus a key to aim and perform actions and the spacebar to jump (this if you keep the standard configuration, of course). The five chapters are set, in order: in an Etherlight monastery, in a factory, in a steel mill, on an aircraft carrier and in the secret Etherlight base; each of them is divided into various sections in which you will generally have to massacre dozens of enemies by solving some simple puzzles. The various sections are linked together by interlude sequences which obviously serve to develop the plot. Speaking of this, it should be noted that Metropolis Software has remained strongly linked to themes that it had already proposed in its other titles, such as Archangel but also Aurora Watching, so expect a tough and cynical protagonist with a good sense of humor, a linear plot, some rare twists, some strong impact themes that aim to give a certain depth to the whole and, above all, a series of dialogues that range from the pleasant to the improbable, making us once again invoke the assumption of some professional screenwriter to write the screenplays (can we call them that?) for video games. In fact Infernal has a good narrative material exploited rather badly which, probably, in the hands of another pen could have reserved many other surprises and taken on greater depth, developing some badly neglected ideas. A bullet aimed Where the title excels is certainly in the spectacular action. On a visual level, a superb job has been done, without making the fluidity utopian  indeed, the game at maximum detail went very fluid on all occasions, without ever showing an indecision in the framerate. It is rare to find products that do not meet the recommended requirements and this must be acknowledged by the developers, who moreover do not have the resources of much larger studios used to releasing incomplete products. But let's get back to us. Apart from the excellent three-dimensional models of the main characters and enemies, full of interesting details and nuances, as well as with a spot-on and inspired design, it is the management of lights and colors that fascinates and allows us to applaud the work done by the graphics. The first thing that catches the eye is the choice of using low color saturation, in order to create a washed-out image over which the lights seem to impose their dominion. The colors are not as bright as the lights are bursting and heavy, almost tangible in their incredible volume, creating nuanced environments with evident burns when you look directly at the light sources. To these we also add the numerous light effects of weapons, machinery, special powers and various other sources and we will thus have a different and very original compositional style compared to what we have seen so far. This just to say that a little skill is enough to make up for some shortcomings, such as poorly defined textures or otherwise repetitive settings. And instead, lost in the light, the imperfections tend to disappear and we are amazed several times as we look at spectacular views and landscapes. Too bad the bullets take very little time to get us back into the game. A bullet aimed In fact, the other big advantage of Infernal is that it doesn't leave you breathless. The pace of the action is not very fast, actually, but it is designed to make the shootings as satisfying as possible. The shot is close to the character's shoulders, as you can verify by opening one of the numerous screenshots accompanying the article, and the speed of his movements is rather limited. There are two methods of attack: the primary fire of the weapon in hand and a blow enhanced by exploiting the infernal mana. In case of need it is possible to resort to grenades (not very useful, in reality) and, as a last resort when the magazines of all the weapons are completely empty, it is possible to fight hand to hand (with very meager results). The weapons at our disposal are: shurikens, a pistol, three types of machine guns, a flamethrower, a welder (a kind of laser beam), a sniper rifle, a bazooka, a laser pistol and a strange pistol that shoots power. the colors are not as bright as the lights are bursting and heavy, almost tangible in their incredible volume A bullet aimedto During the adventure we will be provided with some demonic powers by our employer: the power to teleport for short moments and gloves to teleport objects. The first of the two consumes a lot of mana when used and, usually, is used to reach switches placed in positions that are normally inaccessible (for example, behind a grate). Later in the game this power will be upgraded allowing teleportation to first two and then three locations simultaneously. Another rather interesting power is the demonic sight which allows you to find hidden energy sources and mana sources, as well as showing the secret codes of the various doors (we know it... it seems absurd but it is true). Power power power The source of your power is the aforementioned demonic mana which allows you to perform enhanced shots as well as allowing you to use special powers. The enhanced shots are not only used to satisfy the ego of us players but have a specific function in the gameplay, which will become increasingly predominant as we progress towards the end of the game: they allow us to overcome the barriers created by exploiting the power of light. Precisely for this reason, managing it properly is central to not finding yourself without it in moments of greatest need. There are various ways to recharge your mana. The simplest is to sin, that is, in more videogame terms, to kill people (don't go and tell someone a lie because it doesn't work anyway). Each killed human character recharges the mana bar located at the bottom right. Another way to trace it back is to find areas filled with evil. Stopping in these places, easily identifiable using demonic vision, since they are circled in red, the mana will automatically recharge. However, we must pay attention to the fact that, on the contrary, there are sacred places, for example a church, which cause it to fall even without using any power. The third and final method of recovering mana is to collect hidden black orbs, which become visible using demonic sight. In addition to these, there are also blue spheres that recharge energy, always visible with demonic vision, and special spheres, both black and blue, which temporarily increase mana and/or energy by 50% (you need to collect three Of every kind). Power power power Energy is the classic health bar which, once depleted, marks the character's death. Obviously the blows of the enemies hurt and make it drop. The ways to regain it are the classic collection of medikits and, above all, the sucking of vital energy from corpses. How to do? Kill someone, get close to the body and, by pressing the action key, you will see Ryan suck their energy through the imposition of a hand. Simple and very choreographic method, especially at the beginning, but it can be boring when you are in the advanced stages of the game and hundreds of corpses have now been sucked. Pros and cons Infernal is a very good game that could have been a masterpiece with just a few more tweaks. The difficulty is balanced upwards and already gives a hard time at the second of the three selectable difficulty levels. The puzzles present are quite classic, but they serve to break up the action, which would otherwise be a continuous shooting; they range from pressing switches to having to hit explosive crates to bring down portions of the wall. Obviously the best ones are those that involve the use of demonic powers. Too bad that even these have not always been exploited properly, given that, for example, the triple teleportation is required in a single situation while the glove to move objects is completely forgotten in the last chapters. In fact, there are several poorly exploited features, such as the ability to climb fences or cover fire which is quite useless. Even the ability to crawl against the wall is used only once (when explained) and very soon you forget you can do it. Pros and cons The boss fights, on the other hand, are excellent. In each of them it will be necessary to fight intelligently trying to understand how to behave in order to win the battle. For example, the first boss protects himself with an energy barrier that can be crossed by demonic blows. Too bad he has lights at his disposal that can suck our mana. To take him down we must therefore first destroy the lights and then hit him when we have recharged enough mana. there are several poorly exploited characteristics Pros and cons Another shortcoming of Infernal is its relative brevity. The five chapters are exhausted in about ten hours, ttime which might even be acceptable if only there was some unlockable extra or some other reason to start over once you get to the end. It is also true that it is an intense product in which the developers have indulged themselves in distributing as many variables as possible, trying to involve the player with exciting and spectacular battles. Among others, how can we forget the fight against the mad doctor and the final one (of which it is better not to say anything)? In short, keeping faith with its plot, Infernal presents lights (many) and shadows (not very many, but they could be decisive for some).

The final vote wants to reward Infernal for all the good it has to offer and for how much some avoidable defects have not managed to affect the charm of an exciting game from the beginning to the end. If you are looking for an action-packed, spectacular and playable title, don't hesitate to buy it, you won't regret it. However, we advise you to read the review carefully, since some defects could be more decisive for you than they were for us. Pros Spectacular and stylistically interesting Beautiful fights with some bosses Exciting until the end Cons Doesn't last long Badly exploited features Why hire a screenwriter? To avoid certain ridiculous dialogues Good, bad, encore The Etherlight and the Abyss have always been in conflict over the dominance of humans. The former belong to God and the latter to the Devil, but all is not as it seems. The line between good and evil is blurred and when you take sides on one side or the other, you are often blinded to the point of making it inconsistent. In the role of Ryan Lennox, former Etherlight hired by a demon of the Abyss to recover a technology with extraordinary powers, we will have to go through five long chapters (plus a very fast introductory one) in search of the truth and, above all, of a way to stop a plan of domain with which one wants to deceive God himself. Will we be able to win this desperate war without ending up condemned to eternal damnation? Will we understand who are friends and who are enemies? But above all, will it be worth worrying so much?", "date": "2007-03-08", "grade": null}
