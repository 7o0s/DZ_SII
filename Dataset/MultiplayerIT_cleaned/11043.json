Bob Kane was the first to answer the call: he sketched his own Batman and refined its appearance together with his collaborator, Bill Finger. The rest is history: from number 27 of ~Detective Comics~ (which marked the debut for the Bat Man) to today things have changed a lot, but the character's popularity has never been questioned. The beautiful film directed by Tim Burton in 1989 marked its consecration, giving birth to a ~batmania~ of inconceivable proportions and laying the foundations for the great cinematic productions that would come later. Protagonist of various video games (who remembers the fantastic tie-in for NES?), Batman now joins a very special club, that of the LEGO series developed by Traveller's Tales. Alone against all Following on the heels of Star Wars and Indiana Jones, the Bat Man dresses in LEGO bricks and, on the notes of the extraordinary soundtrack signed by Danny Elfman, invites us to live with him a series of adventures that will see him face practically all of his most bitter enemies: from the Riddler to Poison Ivy, from Two-Face to Catwoman, from Mister Freeze to the Joker, passing through a series of lesser known opponents. With the inevitable Robin, the ~boy wonder~, at his side, Batman will find himself moving in the typical context of the LEGO series, which has also shown great qualities on Nintendo DS: we will therefore control the couple, passing from one character to another more by pressing the X button, just like in LEGO Star Wars and LEGO Indiana Jones. In this case, the developers were unable to exploit numerous teams to give each element a specific characteristic, and finding themselves alone with Batman and Robin, they had to invent something else on which to base the game mechanics. The answer was found in the costumes, which can be changed using devices within the stages: the basic uniforms allow Batman to double jump and Robin to walk on tight ropes, but there are numerous variations that make the two characters able to plant bombs, glide long distances, walk on metal walls, pass through acid unscathed, etc. Meanwhile, in the Batcave... If in LEGO Star Wars the starting point for the various missions was the Mos Eisley cellar, complete with characteristic music, in LEGO Batman we obviously start from the Batcave. From there we will be able not only to access the various episodes that make up the ~story mode~ of the game, but also to buy characters and extra items, customize the appearance of our heroes, visit Arkham Asylum, enter the Wayne mansion, etc. Smash! Slam! Crack! Although our heroes are equipped with the standard boomerang, in LEGO Batman the combat system almost exclusively involves hand-to-hand combat: the characters can perform their own punch and kick combos by repeatedly pressing the Y button, while B is used to jump and A to throw the aforementioned batarang. The back buttons of the DS are not used, while the use of the touch screen is limited to activating any bombs or scrolling through the images that make up the cutscenes: rather than finding ~hybrid~ solutions for the animated sequences, it was in fact preferred rely on a sort of ~silent~ slideshow, but full of humor typical of the LEGO series. Returning to the fights, it must be said that they certainly do not constitute the fulcrum of the gameplay, on the contrary they are more of a side dish to the actual action, which in this case is revealed in the activation of switches in different ways and in the collection of ~ coins~ which will then be used to purchase the usual extra characters and any customizations. In short, the new Traveller's Tales title is even more focused on the ~construction~ phases and on the puzzles that in sequence allow us to continue within the stages: which switch must be activated and how? Which swimsuit should I use, and why? These are the questions that arise when playing, questions that fortunately always find a rather quick answer and do not force us to painful pauses for reflection. Technical realization Compared to the other titles in the series already seen on Nintendo DS, LEGO Batman boasts improved graphics from various points of view: the engine has been strengthened and now manages to handle practically any situation without slowdowns or drops in frame rate, while the locations appear more larger and richer in elementsinteractive nts. Since close combat has never been a characteristic element of Traveller's Tales productions, one often finds oneself faced with some problems in collision detection, which fortunately does not affect the experience that much given the ~accessory~ nature of such stages. The characters are drawn very well and boast a decent set of animations, while the use of colors is always excellent. The alternative sections, in which you have to drive the Batmobile with a top view divided between the two screens, show a fluid but sometimes uncertain scrolling, and in general a design that leaves something to be desired: luckily these are very limited. There's not much to say about the sound: the music is that of ~Batman~ and ~Batman Returns~, and they are truly splendid, while the effects are average.", "date": "2008-11-19", "grade": "7.0"}
