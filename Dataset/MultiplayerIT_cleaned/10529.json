Nothing new under the sun so, no was it for the fact that the player is not called to step into the shoes of the hero of the moment, but instead into those of the benevolent (?) sovereign in need of services and spotless and fearless champions. Make yourself comfortable in your armchairs covered in human skin and arm yourself with tactical acumen, game vision and, above all, a lot of patience to restore order and happiness to the oppressed lands of Ardania. All seasoned with a touch of healthy irony and a taste for making fun of each other. Identity crisis If in the middle of the umpteenth instance of World of Warcraft, rather than during a mission of the latest Action-RPG that misunderstands you for postmen with aspirations as a zoophilic killer, have you ever wondered what it would feel like to be on the other side of the sky , Majesty 2 is just the title for you. In a sort of analysis session for MMORPG sufferers, you will be spectators, executioners and manipulators of the empty lives of heroes with no aspiration, other than to mow down enemies, accumulate wealth and, yes, level up! Majesty 2's classic real-time strategy setting is betrayed by only one - but fundamental - feature: by disavowing the canons imposed by the genre, you will not be able to issue direct orders to your units. The only way to direct the behavior of your armies is in fact in identifying an objective - a building to protect, a cave to raid, a minotaur to kill, marking it with a corresponding insignia (exploration, attack, defense and fear) and assigning him a reward in gold. The higher the reward, the more likely the goal will be considered by one or more adventurers. Depending on the guild to which they belong, a character may be more or less inclined to undertake a particular type of mission. Rangers, for example, prefer exploration missions while warriors love to devote themselves to tasks where the double T of ~unnian~ memory (~earthquake and traggeddia~) is king. In the more advanced stages of the game, it will then be possible to create real parties by combining up to a maximum of four members and thus having the opportunity to witness the most classic of situations, where a cleric remains in the second line to heal, while the mage debilitates the most powerful enemies and the fighters act as a ~tank~ taking care of all the dirty work. And there will also be the possibility of placing a young elf archer alongside an expert knight (as long as he is not a dwarf, of course) with the sole, mere purpose of... leveling up! If desired, we could also get off our privileged position of exceptional spectators and get our hands a little dirty to help our braves during the bloodiest battles, thanks to the use of both powerful and expensive special powers of almost divine derivation. Someone come and save me The simulated life of the heroes blends well with the more traditional part of Majesty 2. The player is given the opportunity to build a wide range of buildings, each of which, in one way or another, lends itself so much to replenish the coffers of the kingdom in terms of offering services or products that will then be purchased with the fruits of the labors of digital adventurers. Even with a minimum of participation, it is not difficult to become attached to the piles of polygons that animate the game world. Following the vicissitudes of a thirtieth-level paladin in an undead field, seeing him return to the city to buy more powerful armor and then head to the inn and maybe meet new fellow adventurers is a satisfying experience all in all, besides how funny. Although the developers have done their utmost to try to offer a wide range of game situations and opportunities, there is no doubt that the playful mechanics quickly exhaust their freshness and risk giving way to a certain basic monotony, just like the most other real-time strategy games on the market, for that matter. A difficulty curve from other times comes to our aid, capable of keeping even the most expert of players busy in search of the right approach based on the context offered by the current mission. In addition to having to pursue the different objectives necessary to conclude the level, it will still be important not to underestimate the defense of your installations. Managing the fine balance between attack strategy (perhaps seeking and then destroying the origins of enemy waves) and cover phase is made even more difficult by the exponential costdefense structures and the inevitable inertia of the heroes' response to our monetary solicitations. Moreover, the fact that the fees are deducted at the time the flag is laid out and not at the completion of the mission, means that in the most agitated moments entire estates can be squandered without any benefit and, indeed, causing the players to break the second commandment several times less laid. Graphics of yesteryear! Technically Majesty 2 certainly does not leave you speechless. On the contrary. Although the graphics try to exploit cheerful and lively colors, the paucity of the animations and the poverty of the details make us go back in time - apart from the rather current minimum requirements. The audio sector does nothing to improve the situation and is limited to offer anonymous and noteworthy music. That said, given the particularity of the production we feel like turning a blind eye to these aspects, above all thanks to a user interface that proves to be as clean as it is effective and intuitive, managing to make all game options available with just a few clicks of the mouse. Multiplayer is still an unknown: entrusted to the now famous Gamespy service, this last mode has proved to be full of potential and able to give that extra touch of unpredictability to make the game almost infinite.
