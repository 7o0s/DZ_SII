{"name": "Bad Day L.A. - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/bad-day-la-recensione.html", "text": "let's go around a bit The opening video shows a homeless man (a certain Anthony Williams) walking on a highway jammed with cars. The guy, with a sharp tongue and a spirit of survival, exchanges a few insults with neurotic and enraged motorists, before witnessing a plane crash that will spread a radioactive green liquid throughout the city. This is where the game begins: will we be able, in the role of the tramp, to foil the terrorist threat looming over the city? But, above all, will we be able to bear the repetitive missions and the drunken humor that pervades the whole game? from a designer/author considered an artist, it is normal to expect something new and amazing that goes beyond the mainstream trash. Unfortunately, in the world of video games, ego is not enough to create a good product let's go around a bit Taking the situation in hand and taking a few steps in the first level, we immediately understand that the game structure is rather linear. There is some hint of free roaming, some elementary puzzles to solve and some secondary mission usually associated with a primary. The visual style is cartoonish but, despite the undoubted charm, it lacks a lot in the animations, usually poor and inadequate to provide a description of the situations. The general impression, having passed the tutorial, collected the first objects and given a few punches to zombies and passers-by, is that there is not much to do on the crowded Los Angeles highway on which we find ourselves. Apart from the standard actions, a system for calculating relationships with other citizens has been implemented (represented by a meter at the top right of the screen): the more deplorable actions we perform, the more citizens will be angry with us (therefore they will stop giving information and will attack the character on sight). The relationship with the population, when deteriorated, can be recovered by doing some nice gesture (treating the wounded, putting out the flames on the cars with the fire extinguisher, putting out those on the people, treating the zombies). let's go around a bit Learning to fight is simple and fundamental to survival. We will be able to use hand-to-hand weapons and firearms, normally found from corpses, to knock down the enemies that appear in front of us. Together with you there will also be other support characters (for example a guy with an electric saw who enjoys gutting zombies) who will provide you with help in combat and in solving some quests. In short, the system is rather trivial but functional pity that the fun is missing due to some problems which we will discuss shortly. Why did this happen to me? So far so good, said the narrator of a rather prophetic film the problem is that what we have written is all that the game contains. Does the gameplay feel flat to you? Well done, you are right. Sadly Bad Day L.A. immediately manifests immense limits that are reflected in its structure. Let's take quests for example. These are few and very repetitive; usually they limit themselves to asking us to heal some wounded, save or eliminate zombies, reach a certain location and little else. The fourth time you need to go looking for people to treat, you want to go back to Windows to play a game of Prato Fiorito. Unfortunately, apart from variations of no account, there is little else to do. We don't talk about walking around freely. The explorable areas are very limited and, in any case, you soon realize that there are no secrets and therefore it is not worth slamming into fruitless searches. But is the game world at least interesting? Are there any interactions? What can be done? Each of these questions would deserve a chuckle, but since we are beautiful, good and good, let's take a little longer to illustrate what works and what doesn't work in the world in this Los Angeles without values. It doesn't work much. Apart from the setting itself, the rest is to be forgotten. The city is very populated perhaps too populated. Let's take a practical situation: we are on the street, we eliminate a couple of terrorists and we are about to do our own thing when, after a few moments the enemies reappear. But how? A moment ago that road with no access was empty, where did that guy with the machine gun come from? The wild respawn is no accident, but it is present in the game at all levels. Have you just eliminated some zombies by completely clearing a stretch of road? Turn around and you will see that someone will have reappeared from who knows where. Have you shot a terrorist behind a barrier? A few moments later there will be another one, probably dropped from the sky. The game designers have not bothered to disguise the respawn which, in the long run, becomes frustrating and eliminates any possibility of identification. It seems to be in front of un product for 8-bit systems, where there wasn't too much concern about giving coherence to the representation of the game world is such a thing still acceptable? Why did this happen to me? Definitely not in this case, where problem begets problem, since Bad Day L.A. it is frustrating (precisely because of the respawn) to the point of discouraging from going forward and the plot does not help since it is not exciting or interesting. Let's save ourselves At this point you may be wondering if it is at least fun to go around beating up passers-by. The answer is no. Here too the design suffers from significant problems. Firstly, passers-by are more resistant than terrorists (who have bulletproof vests). To knock one down with a shotgun, you'll need to hit it four times at point blank range. With the machine gun the situation gets worse, since the shots to be fired become a multitude. Let's not talk about melee ... spending almost a minute beating an enemy to see him capitulate is not the best and, above all, it is not fun, also given the lack of a feeling of actually doing harm. In the end we give up being bad because we don't get any satisfaction from performing certain acts (we know that said so it's sadistic but we can't help it, we are gamers and defenseless old ladies are our daily bread). The game designers have not bothered to hide the respawn which, in the long run, becomes frustrating and eliminates any possibility of identification Let's save ourselves Listen, dear Multiplayer.it editorial team, hitting others isn't fun... but will I at least be able to smash some stuff? Meaning, will I be able to go around blowing everything up like in Total Overdose? No, dear reader, you won't be able to. Aside from a few fences to smash and a few cars to blow up, the most you'll get from hitting objects is for a cloud to appear and a sleazy sound effect to be emitted. System requirements To spin Bad Day L.A. in addition to a strong stomach and few pretensions, you also need a P4 at 1.6 Ghz or equivalent, a 3D card with 64 MB of memory and 512 MB of ram. To play it safe, get a 2 Ghz processor, 1 GB of ram and a 128 MB graphics card. Conclusions There is something that is saved in Bad Day L.A. apart from the style? Frankly not. It's hard to get fun out of it, it's hard to smile at Anthony's jokes and it's hard to get passionate about such a poor and at times silly plot. The only sequences that are saved are those shooters in which you have to shoot wildly using heavy weapons ... but even in this case it is not possible to cry out for a miracle. In short, without continuing to rage ... forget it and spend the money elsewhere. Pros The visual style The shooter sequences Cons Boring Silly Trivial The fall of the Gods? Bad Day L.A. it's like a child who shows what he's chewing: it creates an epidermal annoyance in the adult who looks at him, but finds the approval of the other children who start to laugh. In short, the latest effort by the acclaimed and constipated American McGee, who has only made two games since he set up on his own: American McGee's Alice and the one we are about to review (in Scrapland he only lent his name for of marketing, given that he has entered the project when the work is now complete), does not go beyond vulgar spite, linking in the visual style, to the vein of cynical cartoons inaugurated by the Simpsons. Unfortunately, an obvious stylistic choice corresponds to a silly product, paradoxically devoid of its own personality. From a designer/author considered an artist, it is normal to expect something new and amazing that goes beyond the mainstream trash.
