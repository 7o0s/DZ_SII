It was therefore a courageous choice by Ivanovich Games, which not only decided to develop such a game, but also adopted a rather permissive freemium model, allowing anyone to try the experience extensively and with few constraints. Downloadable for free from the App Store and Google Play, Cosmic Challenge boasts a long and demanding single-player campaign, in which standard races and elimination races are alternated, with further variants that are unlocked by progressing through the various space sectors available. The nacelles unlocked at the beginning are clearly the least performing, and this translates into a ruthless experience on the track, in which you have to memorize the track and face the curves in the right way, avoiding any collision in order not to slow down and lose ground, trying at least to finish in the top three. The similarities with WipEout are therefore many, even if in this case there are no weapons to collect on the circuit: a pity, they would have added a further element of variety. As for the freemium aspect of the game, there are the classic energy cells that are consumed with each attempt: there are five of them, but their recharge is relatively fast and therefore it rarely happens that you have to wait to play another game. Cosmic Challenge is a futuristic racer capable of combining a glance and convincing numbers Matter of touch As the developers who have experimented with this type of racer on iOS and Android will certainly know, the most delicate part of the job does not concern the graphics, but the balancing of the controls, which must correspond to certain criteria of precision and responsiveness. Cosmic Challenge allows you to use touch commands or to steer with the accelerometer, in both cases with manual or automatic accelerator and with the possibility of adjusting the sensitivity of the inputs. In the end both configurations work well, even if we would have preferred a touch option without icons on the screen, as in the driving games produced by Gameloft. The tilt proves to be more reliable if we want to ~brush~ the curves, gradually acting on the steering, while the virtual buttons from this point of view are clearly less delicate, although by memorizing the circuits it is possible to become competitive even in this way. Once familiar with the controls, the Cosmic Challenge experience literally takes off and refreshes thanks to the strength of its numbers, with further features to unlock and a very simple to use track editor. The technical realization does not disappoint expectations, guaranteeing a smooth scrolling of the tracks, a discreetly made effects and a good design for the nacelles, but obviously the stylistic comparison with WipEout does not hold up and on more than one occasion there is a lack of personality. Fortunately, some circuits manage to amaze with loops, rotations and vertical curves, adding panache to a visual sector that appears a bit monotonous and lacking in variety at first. On the other hand, the sound should be reviewed, given that the musical accompaniment is rather anonymous.", "date": "2016-05-28", "grade": "8.0"}
