{"name": "Mega Man X Dive", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/mega-man-x-dive-recensione.html", "text": "We have seen, over the years, how the relationship between historical video game series and mobile platforms can be at least conflicting and the review of Mega Man X Dive only highlights another of these cases, even if Capcom's operation stands out, if nothing else for a remarkable care put into the service of a project that desperately tries to be a game, rather than a commercial operation. It doesn't quite succeed, because basically the over-simplification carried out on the gameplay makes this title something distinctly different from Mega Man, while also being a sincere homage to the series. On the other hand, it is difficult to expect something in line with tradition if it has to be structured to work with a touch screen and be based on the inevitable gacha mechanics, elements physiologically light years away from Mega Man. The result is something quite close to Super Mario Run as an operation and adaptation, but with the aggravating circumstance of substantially missing all the basic elements of the traditional gameplay of the series and at the same time adding other new features that are completely foreign to the classic atmosphere. Flashes of Mega Man remain almost everywhere, mainly in the reconstruction of the levels (here made in 3D, but very faithful to the original scenarios), in the characters and in some typical situations of the various chapters, but in the heart of the action it is difficult to find something of the original gameplay, which was based on the difficult challenge, timing and perfect mastery of the controls, all things here largely watered down to obtain, essentially, a completely different experience. A very strange story Mega Man X Dive, a gameplay scene To justify collections of characters from historical series and with their own chronological sequence, gacha games often defy all logical rules and Mega Man X Dive is no exception. However, the strangeness here is also combined with a nostalgic recollection that manages to be nice, mitigating the senseless minestrone effect into something at least close to the player's memories. The story tells of a random protagonist who, while playing Mega Man X, gets sucked into the screen and finds himself in a place called ~Deep Log~, which collects data and files of all games. Something strange is happening to the Mega Man series, as a concerned Rico tells us exhaustively, because someone is replacing game fragments and messing up the order of levels, chapters and bosses for some mysterious reason. It's up to us to investigate, playing the various fragments of various chapters and trying to put things back in their place, in the meantime collecting characters and customizations. Gameplay between action and collection In Mega Man X Dive special weapons and abilities can be conquered with the gacha system The game recovers the structure and dynamics of the original Mega Man, but in fact empties them of their fundamental characteristics to return a very simplified action shooter. It's still something more challenging than many gacha games devoted to auto-play, but for a series that has always made the high challenge rate its defining characteristic, this watering down process is quite upsetting. At least, the need to dodge shots by jumping or ducking remains, some platform element that forces you to jump or stick to the walls and also the presence of bosses in the sign of tradition, but the automatic aim substantially modifies the classic gameplay, in addition to the simplification general in level design. All this is also a direct effect of the interface, given that the touch screen controls (well studied, but still uncomfortable compared to a traditional controller) necessarily require you to allow for a greater margin of error and a lower pace. The other major change is given by the introduction of the gacha system, which determines a progression of the character capable of further modifying the challenge rate. The ultimate meaning of all Mega Man X Dive is the collection of as many characters as possible, to be obtained through the classic summons that require the investment of in-game currency (and therefore lead to micro-transactions). Everything therefore becomes a race for the most powerful weapon and equipment, which can still be applied to any character, making the levels with fire and automatic aiming increasingly simple. New aesthetics, but with classic references In Mega Man X Dive, customization is everything The graphics of Mega Man X Dive are completely redone in 3D, with the game taking on the classic ~2.5D~ structure now common to many modern action and platform style productions. There is a convincing artistic directionentity behind, which leads to an excellent reconstruction of the classic levels and characters despite the fact that the abandonment of the bitmap is always a bit traumatic for traditionalist players. Well supported by a good character design, the gacha system also works because it's nice to immerse yourself in the huge cast of characters that characterizes the various Mega Man series, always bearing in mind that a game of this kind must also leverage fanservice (from this derive the inevitable waifu with even skimpy costumes, in any case linked in some way to the lore of the series).", "date": "2021-11-18", "grade": "6.5"}
