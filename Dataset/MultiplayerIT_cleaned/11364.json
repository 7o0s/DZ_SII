{"name": "Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/crisis-core-final-fantasy-vii-recensione.html", "text": "Crisis Core The choice of Square Enix was undoubtedly courageous: the story of Crisis Core is a prequel to the adventure of the original Final Fantasy VII, but instead of focusing on the protagonists of that story, this UMD tells the vicissitudes of a supporting actor, of course , but of extreme importance in the narrative mechanics. Those who have played Final Fantasy VII will certainly remember Zack Fair, Cloud Strife's mentor, whose tragic story was told through the memories of Cloud himself: Crisis Core clarifies precisely these backgrounds. At the beginning of Crisis Core, Zack is still a second-class Soldier, personally trained by one of the most famous first-class Soldiers, Angeal: friendship with the latter will lead Zack to cross paths with two other Soldiers of considerable importance , Genesis and Sephiroth. In this prequel the player works for the Shinra Corporation, and thus the curtain will begin to lift on the dramatic events that will evolve in the apocalyptic adventure narrated in the three CDs of the original PlayStation title. We will then discover how Zack became a first-class Soldier and how he met Cloud Strife but above all the very sweet Aerith Gainsborough, and we will witness the transformation of Sephiroth from a heroic soldier to a psychopathic killer, in a whirlwind of events that will culminate in the legendary sequence at the Reactor of the Mount Niblehim. In truth, Crisis Core offers an ascending narrative process: the pace is gradual, with a really slow beginning that gradually tends to evolve into a story full of twists and turns with extremely dramatic tones: although it is now known, the story of Crisis Core is told in an exemplary way, emphasizing especially the daily life of Zack, to then stage the tragic nature of subsequent events with chilling naturalness. Reworked at certain times to favor the introduction and characterization of some characters (Genesis, above all) the plot offers an even more in-depth characterization of characters who have now entered the history of video games, often proposing them in a completely new and disorienting light: Sephiroth who jokes with his friends is as heart-pounding as the first appearance of Aerith or that very ordinary and shy soldier destined to become a practically legendary hero. Crisis Core therefore fully hits the target, telling the background to a beloved story without distorting or alienating it, touching the strings of the more sentimental with directorial choices that demonstrate, once again, the skill of a Square Enix in top form that succeeds, when she wants, to be more sincere and less commercial. Metamorphosis of an RPG An expert observer will immediately notice a certain similarity to another Square Enix production, Kingdom Hearts: the similarities are actually not limited to the third person setting, perfect for the action system of the title, but also to some graphic elements such as the incredible expressiveness of the faces during the cutscenes, or the fluid and cartoonish animations. The attention to detail in Crisis Core remains very high throughout the experience. Although some locations suffer from a certain flatness, others are striking for their complexity and visual spectacularity, especially those outdoors and, above all, the settings taken directly from the original title, reconstructed for the occasion to allow for a ~free~ exploration: in these cases strictly affect the ~nostalgia~ effect and fans will immediately recognize places such as the Sector 7 ghetto, the church of Aerith, the building of Shinra Corp. or the village of Niblehim complete with Shinra Mansion. In most cases, however, the itinerary to follow to reach one's destination remains extremely linear, with sporadic ramifications of the map, a value that limits dispersion while maintaining a perhaps too rigid approach. The fights take place without interruptions of exploration, and the transaction is almost immediate: these are not real random encounters, as they are positioned in precise points on the map which, if crossed, trigger the battle. In these cases the three-dimensional engine of Crisis Core gives its best, proposing a variable amount of enemies that attack Zack from every direction, making use of magic and special shots if necessary. On these occasions, the game runs extremely smoothly without noteworthy slowdowns even in the most chaotic and pyrotechnic clashes: the skills that are used in the advanced stages of the game make use of large quantities of luminous and particle effects that repeatedly fill the screen, while the player directly controls Zack to dodge and counter-attack in real-time. Very few uncertaintiesze of the camera, which only rarely chooses questionable angles to frame the frenetic action of the fight. ... the plot offers an even more in-depth characterization of characters who have now entered the history of video games... Metamorphosis of an RPG However, a Square Enix production is nothing without an up-to-date soundtrack. In this case, it was hard to repeat the success of Nobuo Uematsu, who with Final Fantasy VII had given us some of the most beautiful songs ever composed for a video game. His successor, Takeharu Ishimoto, has fortunately done an excellent job, producing a multitude of music tracks that manage to naturally echo the style of maestro Uematsu and the PSOne title. The unreleased songs are valuable, but there are excellent remixes of the tracks heard in 1997, which further amplify the nostalgia effect we have already mentioned: in particular, One Winged Angel cannot fail to stand out, in the film version made for Advent Children. A particular mention deserves the dubbing: the actors chosen to dub Crisis Core are mainly those already used to lend their voices to the same characters in Advent Children and Dirge of Cerberus, thus maintaining a pleasant solution of continuity. The general quality is excellent, with appropriate and natural acting, a little subdued in the case of some characters, such as Angeal and Genesis, but over the top for the rest of the main and secondary cast. Revolution of Final Fantasy VII? Crisis Core distances itself from its temporal sequel on the playful side, proposing a system that expertly mixes the most classic features of Final Fantasy VII with a more modern and effective combat and management system. Exploration, as already mentioned, is a minor element in Crisis Core: it is mostly linear, interspersed with the canonical fights and cutscenes that develop the plot. Essentially, the game proceeds through a series of chapters during which Zack will have to reach a certain destination or solve tasks, making his way through enemies or interacting with secondary characters on duty. The player near a save point can still access a menu where totally optional missions are listed which can be undertaken for money or objects of various kinds: although extremely repetitive, essentially based on the exploration of a location and relative annihilation of certain monsters, the three hundred proposed missions prove to be a diversion for the enhancement of the character and equipment, but above all to ensure the possibility of playing quick games, a real boon for anyone who chooses a portable console. The player with just a few minutes left can turn on the PSP, complete a mission and get back to work. Although optional, the missions still allow you to get your hands on objects of undoubted value, especially the Materia. Since the days of Final Fantasy VII, the mechanism that exploits these magical crystals has not changed: Zack can equip a variable number of Materia, and each one allows him to use skills and spells, or enjoy bonuses of various kinds. Then, in combat, the player quickly selects the Materia to be used and activates it by pressing the appropriate key, using the necessary MP or AP, taking care to dodge enemies or weave magic with combinations of basic physical blows. Each Materia can be enhanced and merged with another, to obtain ever more powerful and effective ones: this refers us directly to the Digital Mind Wave. Revolution of Final Fantasy VII? Comment The wait for this new chapter in the Final Fantasy VII saga was spasmodic. Expectations paid off? Yes, extensively: Crisis Core gives the nostalgic intense emotions, thanks to the splendid revival of the world of Zack and Aerith, thanks to a PSP in really great shape. Technically great with very few flaws, exemplifying Sony's laptop muscle alongside God of War, Crisis Core blends a powerful story with solid and captivating gameplay. Very entertaining fights, more than good longevity, an enormous amount of side missions that are at least as repetitive as they are commendable for the offer to casual gamers: an extraordinary quality package, which will appeal to fans of Final Fantasy VII and those approaching , for the first time, to the beautiful and dark world created by Squaresoft ten years ago. Unmissable especially for fans, but not only. Pros Technically great Well thought out combat and management system Beautiful storyline Cons Repetitive optional missions DMW is sometimes intrusive The mystery of translation Crisis Core is spoken in English, but the texts have been fully translatedamente in Italian: those who do not know the foreign language can breathe a sigh of relief.", "date": "2008-06-13", "grade": null}
