{"name": "MotoGP 14", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/133926-motogp-14-litalia-che-impenna.html", "text": "If there is a sector where the Bel Paese excels internationally, as well as in the kitchen and on the fashion catwalks, that of engines is probably the most envied and desired of all: just think of prestigious brands such as Ferrari, Pagani, Lamborghini, Ducati or the historic MV Agusta, whose simple names are enough to make enthusiasts of all latitudes and longitudes ~prick up their antennas~, whether we are talking about two or four wheels. This visceral passion for the combination of design and performance soon transferred to the thriving videogame industry, and it is no coincidence that the most representative Italian software house, namely the Milanese Milestone - founded in the early 90s by Antonio Farina - is more than specialized in producing themed titles. From the famous Screamer and SCAR of yesteryear we have in fact arrived at prestigious licenses such as those of the Super Bike, the World Rally Championship (WRC) and the exciting MotoGP, the latter recently returned to Italian hands after the parenthesis of the Monumentals Games and revived by the discreet MotoGP 13. Milestone's leap into the so-called ~nextgen~ represented an opportunity to refine, deepen and expand the dynamics and ingredients of the aforementioned chapter, effectively transforming MotoGP 14 into the best two-wheeled simulator available on the square, as well as the most complete product - despite some shortcomings - that the Milanese software house has ever developed. If you want to know more, just keep reading. MotoGP 14 is the most complete product that Milestone has ever developed In the heart of the competition The first surprising aspect of the new Milestone racing game is undoubtedly its vastness: in addition to proposing the three representative classes of today's world championship, namely Moto 3, Moto 2 and the queen Moto GP, where the vast roster of riders, bikes and teams enriches the career and the traditional grand prix / single championships, there are in fact different and exciting ancillary modes. But let's proceed in order. The complex and articulated single player career, as usual, represents the beating heart of the entire experience, offering a long and exciting growth path through the various power classes, starting as a classic ~wild card~ in Moto 3 - on the legendary circuit of Brno (Czech Republic) - up to the landing in the category of Valentino Rossi, Marc Marquez, Dani Pedrosa and colleagues. There is no shortage of traditional relationships with managers, rivals and teammates, as well as the possibility of being hired, based on the results obtained on the track, by more prestigious teams, which in turn will offer challenges of increasing difficulty (read better placements). The progression system works in pure Codemasters style, well represented by the very recent GRID: Autosport, although a little more refinement from the point of view of communications and, above all, the customization of the driver would not have hurt. Based on the objectives achieved - in the race or in the tests - XP points are obtained which replenish both a classic experience bar, linked to various unlockables such as videos, images, helmets, and pilots to be used in various modes, and the number of fans, a direct reflection of the appreciation obtained on the world championship circuits, naturally all under license and faithful to the real ones. In short, an abundant main course that is extremely flavored by scrolling through the main game menu, indeed a little cumbersome and anchored to dynamics to be rejuvenated. Real Events 2013 is the first extra mode available, a series of 17 challenges that projects the player into the heart of last season to retrace particularly exciting or overturning situations, a bit like in the FIFA series. In the first of the lot, for example, wearing the shoes of Valentino Rossi it is necessary to undertake the legendary ride of the Romagna centaur on the Losail circuit (Qatar) at night, where he was forced - after a mistake - to reassemble several opponents to hit the podium. This is a gem that fans of the world championship will certainly appreciate, also because each challenge is accompanied by original videos of the individual events. Challenge the champions offers a similar approach to the above modality, however this time there is a mix of challenges - real and fictitious - in which historical figures of the world championship are embodied, like Max Biaggi (his event under the rain at Austin), Mick Doohan, Carlos Checa and Loris Capirossi, naturally on board their respective and iconic racing cars. To these are added a classic mode against time and the inevitable multiplayer, both in local split screen - for two players - and online (subject to registration onon the RakNet platform), enriched by the ~Intertime~ novelty, where each track is divided into eight sectors and the winner is decreed on the basis of the records set on each of them. The picture of the extra modes ends with the one called ~Safety Car~, where aboard the new and very powerful BMW M4 you race against the clock in the world championship circuits. Although it is a mere surplus that leaves the time it finds, the highly questionable gameplay that characterizes it amazes: in fact, the car has a completely atypical and unrealistic handling, very bad when compared with the good things Milestone has done, for example , in the WRC saga or in MotoGP 14 itself as far as motorcycles are concerned. Falls with (little) style If a good job has been done from the point of view of the modalities and the general atmosphere, Milestone can be considered even more satisfied with regard to the gameplay side, where the renewed physical-dynamic engine of the title has placed further emphasis on the simulative properties and realism - with the necessary limits - compared to the previous chapter. We are therefore before an evolution rather than a real revolution, nevertheless, bearing in mind some small gaps which we will discuss later, the MotoGP 14 gameplay is undoubtedly solid and very pleasant, but at the same time also extremely complex, in particular mode with the options and numerous settings set to the maximum level of realism. Among other things, for example, it is possible to implement tire wear, penalties and disciplinary flags, damage to the motorbikes and even occasional technical problems (such as engine failure), while as far as driving aids are concerned, they range from the fundamental model physical (Standard, Semi-pro and Pro) up to various levels for the Traction Control (TCS) control unit, passing through the type of brakes (joint, automatic), the management of the rider's position on the hull, the trajectory, the type of change and the ability to enable flashbacks, in pure Codemasters / Turn 10 style and up to a maximum of six. The difference in the behavior of the bikes from the Standard model, however demanding, to the more simulative one is abysmal, especially as the power goes up, but with the latter a harbinger of great satisfaction if mastered with skill. The learning curve is therefore quite high, and being upside down in each corner, in Pro mode, is anything but a euphemism, given the need to manage numerous parameters on the trajectory (apart from the fundamental caution with brakes and gas) which is much more complex than the one that would be faced on four wheels. In short, world championship fanatics have everything they need to have fun, even being able to adjust the bike's set-up (suspensions, handlebars, gears and so on) manually or by asking the engineer on duty, who in a curious question and answer in the pits it helps to find the right feeling with the bike. If you add to all this the unexpected dynamic weather, a rather aggressive artificial intelligence (not under water) and the possibility of racing with a couple of really crazy helmet views in terms of sense of speed, the package can be defined more how ripe and solid. Unfortunately, however, not everything shines as one would like, and collisions, as well as excursions on curbs, gravel and grass, involve reactions of the bike that are not always realistic and coherent, sometimes leaving a bitter taste in the mouth also due to the questionable animations that accompany them . The weak point of Italian opera, as we will see in the next paragraph, is in fact once again the technical sector, despite the progress made which bodes well for the near future. On the right track If there is a parameter where Milestone productions have almost always stuttered, with the exception of the very pleasant WRC Powerslide, a purely arcade spin-off of the rally simulator, it is undoubtedly the technical one, afflicted by more or less marked problems that often place them couple of notches below the competition, generally with much higher budgets. Despite the logistical limitations and the rather accelerated development process of MotoGP 14, officially landed on the ~next gen~ version of PlayStation 4 (no Xbox One, at the moment), the technological step forward made compared to the previous chapter should be underlined, improved under numerous points of view. If on the one hand the polygonal models of the motorcycles and riders are therefore accurate and solid, especially enhanced during the beautiful replays - despite there being some lower quality textures - the same cannot be said of the circuits, sometimes bare and with little refined, where the polygonal complexity of buildings and staff, aliasing and vegetation leave more than a few doubts. Despite everything, the circuits offer an excellent sense of speed and depth of field, and even the asphalt, especially in rainy conditions, offers a satisfying show. The least successful aspect of the package is probably that relating to the animations, often robotic and not very ~harmonious~, especially during the most spectacular accidents or when you are thrown from the bike due to a driving error. It's a shame because when you're in the saddle, folds and body movements are fluid and well done. As for the possible graphic parameters in the PC version, unfortunately there is no reason to rejoice due to the rather small number; in addition to the ~High Quality Textures~ and the ~High Quality AFX~, from the appropriate launcher it is in fact possible to set only the resolution and the Vsync. This aspect has repercussions on the level of general optimization, which weighs especially on poorly performing systems, since even with a high-end PC, setting the graphic details to the maximum and in 1080p, there is some hesitation and stuttering, especially during the replays. The audio samples are little more than decent and don't offer the punch, depth and modularity that certain rhombuses should have, nevertheless it is generally a good step forward compared to the past. Curiously some sound effects are almost completely missing, such as those of accidents and contacts, while the soundtrack is quite forgettable. Finally, the netcode is good, which allows games up to a maximum of 12 players. Overall we are faced with a technically more than sufficient product and, above all, with an interesting basis from which to start for the next Milestone-branded projects.", "date": "2014-06-25", "grade": "8.0"}
