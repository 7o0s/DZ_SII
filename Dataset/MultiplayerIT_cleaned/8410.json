{"name": "Amazing Contraptions", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/106325-amazing-alex-amazing-contraptions.html", "text": "As everyone knows, the Finnish team Rovio has literally won the lottery with its Angry Birds franchise, capable of generating three sequels in a short time and above all earning the company a resounding success and - consequently - a disproportionate amount of money. Fortunately, Rovio didn't limit itself to depositing this fortune in a Swiss vault, but invested it in part to buy the intellectual property of Casey's Contraptions en masse, the Snappy Touch puzzle game released on iPad last year and now being brought back to us with a new name and the personal touch of the Nordic developers. Alex the ram Anyone who has had the opportunity to play the excellent Casey's Contraptions will not struggle to understand how Amazing Alex is in all respects the exact same product. The gameplay, the basic controls, the game elements, even the graphics have remained almost unchanged: Rovio evidently believed (rightly) that the Snappy Touch product was already decidedly good, and preferred to limit its work to a slight restyling and a labor filing process on the surrounding elements, in fact one of the weak points of the original title. It is of little use to make comparisons with the past anyway, given that Casey's Contraptions has been removed from the App Store to make room for this successor and also to avoid uncomfortable comparisons. In any case, Amazing Alex starts with the advantage of being available at an attractive price also for iPhone and Android systems, with Windows Phone, PC and Mac versions scheduled for the near future. The play structure does not need much explanation: the game is divided into 100 levels distributed in four locations, with each stage requiring the user to juxtapose the available elements in order to achieve a certain goal, preferably collecting all three stars in the process. It starts with really simple chores such as rolling balls in a basket, dropping a pile of cardboard boxes and so on, but as you progress the scenarios become more and more complex, leading to the construction of real Rube Goldberg: as in the original, the software does an excellent job of leading the player by the hand in the first few bars (indeed, even exaggerating the duration of the tutorials) and then leaving him completely free to express himself, to the point that there is no single solution to complete the internships, but rather you are encouraged to find variations and share them with other users. An extremely accurate work on the interface, on the control system and on the physical routines of the objects do the rest, making Amazing Alex a very pleasant and stimulating puzzle game, which like the best exponents of the genre is absolutely affordable on the surface but which at the same time hides a considerable challenge rate for anyone who wanted to delve into collecting all the stars. Of course, to appreciate Rovio's work you don't need to feel an idiosyncrasy towards trial and error logics, given that especially in the more advanced stages it is necessary to try and try again your gadgets many times before arriving at an acceptable solution. Finally, Amazing Alex makes up for the fact that it is graphically almost indistinguishable from Casey's Contraptions with a much more refined level creation and sharing department: the editor made available in the main menu is in fact simple and intuitive, and uploading one's works and downloading those of other users are both much more streamlined processes than in the past. All obviously to the advantage of a potentially infinite longevity.", "date": "2012-07-24", "grade": "8.0"}
