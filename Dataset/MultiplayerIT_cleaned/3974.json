{"name": "Un'espansione con i fiocchi riporta in voga Destiny 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/destiny-2-i-rinnegati-recensione.html", "text": "Destiny 2 has not been received by the public as expected. The vast majority of players, after succumbing to the temptations of hype and having finished the Bungie shooter campaign, found themselves with a title that could not satisfy their voracious needs, bogged down in a series of uninspiring raids and a support that, from the first few weeks, seemed to be going in the wrong direction. To weigh even more on this situation there was obviously the specter of the first chapter, a road that inexplicably seemed to have been traveled in the exact same way by Bungie. a mistake that is difficult to understand and justify and a mistake that cost Destiny 2 dearly, which found itself abandoned by the critical mass of guardians just a few months after its launch. The first, true expansion, however, showed that the ongoing work for a complete restoration had begun but it is only with the Forsaken that the recovery work has been completed. It was not easy to keep the trust of entire bored guilds by the reins, but those who resisted, as well as those who returned to take a look at the most recent contents, seem to have given a clean slate to the past, ready to reach out again to a game that, in terms of gunplay and atmosphere, has few rivals. The Forsaken then brings as a gift everything people wanted and desired, starting with a new area, new single-player missions, new weapons and above all new long-lived content. The light that can't go out To restart the players with the right attitude, a strong emotional boost was needed that would act as a fuse to rekindle the passion. A jolt caused by a tragic and devastating event capable of affecting anyone who had ever taken Destiny 2 in hand. Bungie has never been particularly skilled with this franchise in creating unforgettable or particularly charismatic characters except with Cayde, even used several times in trailers for push the second chapter and inserted here and there in the singleplayer missions to give further depth to the plot. Hitting him meant knocking down a symbol but at the same time hurting the most irreverent and playful soul of the production: a move as simple as it is ingenious. So the new narrative arc starts from a nefarious event and evolves quickly by harnessing the player in a mini-campaign lasting about six hours that will see us set off to hunt down Uldren Sov. It is interesting to see then how Bungie did not limit itself to basing the whole story on a single event but how it instead pulled the strings so that other twists and surprises suddenly sneak in, giving new and indispensable emotions. We will then go hunting for the Barons, mini bosses to defeat based on interesting and dynamic fights, particular and without a shadow of a doubt stimulating for the players, instead used to usually following missions where shooting at everything that moved without using too much the brain was the is the only requirement necessary for their completion. The design of the same is also good, while not making a miracle cry, enough to distinguish them very well from the rest of the rabble and not give them that idea of simple elites that we often happened to see in many games of this genre. In the same way, even the new alien race, which is not so new since it proposes a modified aspect of the fallen, manages to distinguish itself from the already existing ones, thanks to new attack patterns and unique special abilities. Of course, public events also return to accompany you, set in two new breathtaking settings. In a diametrically opposite way, light and darkness merge respectively in the Dreaming City and the Twisted Shore, incredible and evocative visual works, perfectly set in an aesthetically stunning crown of planets. For each NPC that leaves us, even of moderate importance, new ones come to take their place, also made this time with care and with the due narrative background, with interesting facets to discover and mysteries to solve. In short, an excellent job from the point of view of PvE and single player content. PvP lovers, arm yourself and play in the new mode There are no big news for the Crucible, with the exception of course the usual updates relating to maps and balances brought as a gift by Forsaken and if it weren't for the new Gambit mode we could quickly move on and let you discover the various changes to the equipment for yourself . Azzardo instead really deserves some time because it is the PvPvE mode that has been waiting for a long time and which sees groups of four players compete for the final victory in an arena where enemiesi of different races and opponents will try from time to time to put a spoke in our wheels. You must therefore kill the MOBs, collect the dropped orbs and go and bring them back to the collection point to summon the final boss and defeat him. In all of this, the interventions of the enemy faction will be crucial because they will prevent the players from working smoothly and will slow down all the farming phases. Instead of having a chaotic management of invasions and assaults, Bungie has well thought of timing the attacks and giving very small windows during which to carry out the invasions, which transforms what could have become an extremely chaotic mode into a delightful and fun toy. a not bad added value to a PvP sector that until the 2.0 patch had not managed to shine particularly. Interesting to see how now even players who are not particularly skilled in PvP can have their say in the Crucible, an excellent solution to give anyone a reason to play in all the available modes and thus always have nice full playlists. The whole issue related to the grinding and farming of resources also changes positively, now revised and reduced in number. A solution that players have been hoping for for some time. Hunting in the guild because the story continues We therefore just have to talk about the Raid, that scary end game mode that failed spectacularly in Destiny 2. We all know the mistakes of the past and making yet another content of this type wrong today would probably have sanctioned the definitive death of the project. The backlash instead comes right from here, with a huge, demanding and even fun instance, a demonstration of strength and ability by the Seattle team not recently. But it's the whole ecosystem of things to do at the end of the campaign that works, with small tasks related to the narrative arc, something that has never been seen in this chapter, with a complete area to discover, daily missions and all that you would expect, excellent for leveling up and approaching the CAP. But there are also the new infusions, now much more difficult to make due to the new weapon perks and a return to a more hardcore vision regarding the harmony and coordination necessary to defeat the raid bosses. In short, a work to be promoted in the round without a shadow of a doubt, with small improvements still possible (especially from the point of view of balancing) but which can be easily ignored given the amount of quality content to which it is possible to dedicate oneself.", "date": "2018-10-31", "grade": "9.0"}
