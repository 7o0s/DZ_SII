Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. It is now useless to talk about the extraordinary success of Angry Birds, only the curiosity remains to understand how Rovio can still effectively exploit a franchise that has given it so much satisfaction and continues to dominate the charts on the App Store, Google Play and Windows Phone Marketplace. With Angry Birds Go!, downloadable for free, we wanted to play the card of the Mario Kart-like arcade driving game, a clich that various development teams have resorted to over the years but which has produced results that are not always extraordinary, on the contrary. In the specific case of this title, we start from a precise concept, with different characters (each with a characterizing power) to be unlocked as the tournaments are completed, an energy system typical of freemium productions (but which becomes less pressing as that we get new birds, since each of them has five stints, reloadable over time or using hard currency) and a compilation of scenarios that is not particularly rich or varied, but which draws liberally from the classic iconography of the series. Starting from the traditional slingshots, which represent the expedient with which Rovio has solved the question of the perfect start: you have to pull back the vehicle, fixed to the rubber bands, and wait for the countdown to reach zero to launch the kart and let it enjoy an extra cue compared to the opponents. The rest is a matter of trajectories, precision and a bit of luck... Angry Birds Go! it is simple and immediate, has an excellent technical sector but lacks variety Watch out for IAPs! Angry Birds Go! can be downloaded and played for free without problems, just wait for the birds' energy to recharge when all the characters are ~tired~. The problem is another: in addition to the default kart, other vehicles are available, with higher performance but for a fee. Well, Rovio has culpably ~hidden~ the price of these items and the risk of buying them unintentionally is high, especially for younger and inexperienced users. An update is urgently needed to clarify the ~non-free~ nature of certain items. Lost birds Each of the tournaments featured in the single player campaign of Angry Birds Go! (by the way: a multiplayer mode should arrive soon to add a little spice to the action) presents four different types of races and the direct confrontation with a boss in the best of three rounds, a boss who then joins our stable and that we will be able to use during the races. The first type of race is the traditional one, with a certain number of opposing riders, to be won by crossing the finish line first. Then there is a time attack based on an increasingly tight time limit, a direct challenge on three levels of difficulty and finally the variation on the most original theme, i.e. a race in which you have to collect as many fruit as possible on the track before arrive at the end of the track. The element of grinding is expressed in the development of our kart, which must be enhanced in terms of speed, acceleration, grip and resistance thanks to the coins earned with each victory. Sometimes it is necessary to repeat some races to collect the money needed to get that particular improvement and be able to be competitive against one of the bosses, and this actually leads to quite a few times on the same tracks, very aesthetically pleasing but at the same time quite simple and limited in terms of design. Repeating the same events in itself is not a big problem, but when each tournament offers the exact same situations then the thing actually begins to get boring and the lack of comfort on the gameplay front (we reiterate: very simple and basic) does not help. In short, in the end Angry Birds Go! it certainly does not pose as a bad product and will certainly make many converts, but from an attentive and scrupulous team like Rovio we would have expected greater attention to determining factors such as the variety of the action and the facets of the gameplay.", "date": "2013-12-14", "grade": "7.0"}
