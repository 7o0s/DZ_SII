{"name": "Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter 2 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-advanced-warfighter-2-recensione.html", "text": "The sequel to the famous Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter, which delighted many Xbox 360 users a year ago, has been available on the shelves of all shops for a few days, so much so that in a short time it was one of the most played titles on Live and achieved success amazing with the Game of the Year award from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), an honor also obtained in the past by sacred monsters such as Halo 2 and Half Life 2. The plot of this highly anticipated sequel starts south of the border of the United States United States of America, in the Mexican town of Juarez, with a plot that takes place over 72 hours divided into three parts: each chapter of the game corresponds to one day. The action is then equally divided between the USA and Mexico, straddling the district of Sierra de Chihuahua, El Paso and Ciudad Juarez. The Ghost Task Force is once again ready for action! l Cross-Com 2.0 and the new possibilities offered by GRAW 2 The gameplay is in many ways similar to that already appreciated in the first Advanced Warfighter, with improvements and additions that polish and perfect the game mechanics. It is therefore still possible to hold your breath while sniping, collapse to the ground, roll, choose the fire rate between single shot or burst, change weapons through the digital cross and approach behind cover with the possibility of peeking over. The zoomed view of the sniper has finally been made slightly faster than in the prequel, allowing you to follow enemies as they move, while the autonomy of the helicopter assault machine gun has thankfully been increased, making it more difficult to possibility of sending it to overheating. One of the most important news, however, is the enhancement of the Cross-Com supplied to the special Ghost troops. Cross-Com is a viewer constantly connected to the satellite that can give a lot of information to the soldier in real time. If in the first GRAW this viewer was mostly used to signal the presence of enemy hostilities, the available weapons and the most important battle information, the Cross-Com 2.0 is even able to show us through the eyes of our team members, of the armored vehicles that we command, or of the UAV spy satellite which, if directed and positioned above the enemies, makes them appear with a small red mark on the view. the Cross-Com 2.0 is even able to make us see through the eyes of our team members By pressing the RB key for a second, the view changes rapidly and you find yourself directly observing what is under the UAV, or what one of our comrades is looking at, who mounts a small camera on his helmet for the occasion. Through this direct vision it will then be easier to give them commands: to advance, move, attack, patrol or heal an injured comrade. Also in GRAW 2 it is possible to use a certain number of medkits to raise a wounded soldier, the novelty is that it is also possible to have Captain Mitchell healed, when necessary. By choosing a doctor in the team, he will have a greater number of first aid kits available, of course. The decision on the members of the team is very important: a grenadier is essential, if in the mission we have to face enemy tanks, or the sniper (a pretty and gritty girl) is important in an open territory and from the distant horizon. If we leave a dying team member on the street, he will soon die, and finishing the mission like this will no longer be possible to choose him in the next one. Team play makes the difference What has always characterized Ghost Recon is team play. Giving orders is essential and is part of a good chunk of its gameplay. Through the directional cross we can select who to give commands to: our soldiers, the spy satellite, an armored vehicle, a helicopter, an air attack, or the MULE. The latter is a new entry in the series: it is precisely an automated forklift that can follow us and allows us to change weapons and recover lost energy. The air strike is also new, although it has already been appreciated in the past in games like Full Spectrum Warrior and Mercenaries. In GRAW 2 there is the feeling of being inside a real war, rather than in a military action of a small special unit. In some points we have to simultaneously command our companions, the armored vehicle, a helicopter and the possible attack of the Fighter-bomber: a veritable arsenal at our disposal. Through the subjective view, once the target has been selected, we can issue instructions, always using the directional cross; pressing up advances to where we areindicated, backwards regroups and by pressing the LB key our comrades change their tactical attitude from aggressive to wait-and-see and cautious. Selecting an enemy instead they will start attacking him furiously until the latter is knocked down. Combining the use of Cross-Com 2.0 and the order system, in theory, it is also possible to complete a mission without ever moving the main character, doing all the chores by viewing the cameras and directing operations from the second lines. It's just a pity that when you just start to enjoy it, it's too late, given the excessive brevity of the single player campaign. Giving orders is central to this game and forms a large part of its gameplay Team play makes the difference It is not always necessary to send the troops forward, but it is highly recommended in some advanced levels where the battle becomes rather difficult, however, only if the difficulty level is set upwards. In other cases GRAW 2 is almost a piece of cake. UbiSoft has apparently downgraded the medium difficulty as easy, and the latter as super easy. With the default parameters GRAW 2 is finished in less than 8 hours, giving some small difficulties only in the third day, the last part. Playing with an easy mode it will instead be almost impossible to die, and the enemy AI will be decidedly slower and awkward, our aim too assisted and the enemy too imprecise. Our teammates perform very well in each case, showing an incredible sense of self-preservation not usual for an artificial intelligence. They hide, help each other, cover themselves, get around, but above all they communicate, always keeping us updated on the movements and number of enemies. The result is surprising, but between the doctor who treats us and the not excessive difficulty, unfortunately, it is the longevity of the single-player campaign that falls below the guard levels. Personality issue What is perhaps most lacking in GRAW 2, but in general in the whole series, is a certain amount of personality in the character and in the story told. The fact sheets on the life and history of each soldier are an appreciable job, but it would be more immersive to make them more alive through a story told in a more engaging way. The objectives of the missions are always clear, it is mostly a question of having to advance from point A to point B by taking out every enemy who appears in front of us. This feeling of lack of personality and epic drags on for the duration of the single player, up to the final, a bit disappointing. UbiSoft's attempt to make Scott Mitchell a credible character is almost entirely entrusted to our companions, who call him, praise him and continuously praise each enemy killing, like in a good action movie. Probably, however, what doesn't help, even in this case, is the relative brevity of the game, which does not give time to fully immerse yourself in Mitchell's shoes. Cooperation in GRAW 2 If it is true that GRAW 2's story mode is very short, it is equally true that the online multiplayer component has been greatly enhanced and made more varied than its predecessor. Once logged into Xbox Live, GRAW 2 literally splits into two identities. One is the one that sees us face a series of missions in the company of friends, up to 8 participants. The other is a versus title with 18 maps on which to face each other in furious deathmatches for up to 16 players. GRAW 2 is therefore a game that knows how to please many palates. The difficulty level of the co-op campaign, compared to the single player game, increases drastically, making it a titanic undertaking to be able to achieve the objective in less than 5 components. It is a real one shot - one kill. Setting in the options the lack of respawn (rebirth) in case of death makes the game much more electrifying and stimulating, as once mortally hit by the opponent it is not possible to re-enter the game, making us real puns ghost. To face the multiplayer campaign on the right foot, each participant must specialize in a type of soldier, as each mission always requires them all: machine gunner, sniper, grenadier. Technically, the level reached by the graphics in multiplayer has nothing to envy to that of the single player Cooperation in GRAW 2 If slightly injured, our character remains lying on the ground in pain, until a friend helps us by pressing the Y key. This action exposes him to enemy fire, so it is necessary to make sure that the area is clean before launching into a desperate rescue.or, running the risk that in the meantime our friend will be finished off by a lethal blow. The weapons available have been greatly increased and the military arsenal of GRAW 2 also includes military prototypes such as the Rx4 Storm rifle or guided missiles. Technically, the level reached by the multiplayer graphics has nothing to envy to that of the single player, indeed, in some situations, the latter is slightly lower than that of the online mode, which is extremely accurate for all the six cooperative missions available and the 18 versus maps. Multiplayer in all sauces As for the versus mode, in GRAW 2 it is finally possible to manage a clan through the appropriate options found on the multiplayer menu. Once logged in to the friends list, select the tags that we want to join the team and send the invitation, to create a real team to which you can give a name, an official uniform and a motto. In versus there are dozens of options and game modes: elimination is a classic deathmatch, in the territory you collaborate to prevent enemies from gaining control of some strategic points of the map, in the objective you have to reach some strategic locations without alerting the enemy while in battle mode you are divided into two teams that with the help of the CPU-managed AI must conquer some crucial areas. Compared to the first GRAW the maps are doubled, from 8 to 16 available immediately Multiplayer in all sauces Each of these modes can be tackled in teams or all against all, and it is possible to set the type of respawn, the time limit, the available weapons and the various restrictions as well as a myriad of options regarding uniforms, appearance and player options. In the prequel it was not difficult to memorize the enemy respawn points and after a while the identification of the opponents became slightly mechanical and monotonous: with the new rebirth system every character who dies comes back to life in a random point included in the area of influence of his team, all thanks to the management of numerous dynamic factors that manage to identify the best point where to respawn, moreover for the first seconds we will be invulnerable to enemy blows. Compared to the first GRAW the maps are doubled, from 8 to 16 available immediately. It should also be remembered that multiplayer in GRAW 2 is not only via Xbox Live but is also possible with System Link or with split screen for up to four players. Effects of war The graphics engine that powers GRAW 2 is simply massive and versatile. It manages to manage a considerable number of polygons and at the same time puts many and many graphic effects on the screen at the same time. The visual horizon has increased, and during the helicopter sessions there is something to rub your eyes when entire cities are shown in all their beauty, immersed in some of the most beautiful sunsets ever enjoyed in a video game. The frame rate is nailed to 30fps, resulting solid and reliable in every game occasion, without ever giving signs of slowdown or uncertainty. The eThe use of HDR is further improved, such as the dynamic shadows, which now move and project on any surface with a very convincing simulation of a day-night cycle that accompanies the mission. A detail that also greatly influences the gameplay as it will be more difficult to identify the position of the enemies in the midst of all this movement caused by branches, leaves and trees that move and project their shadows on the ground. The frame rate is nailed to 30fps, resulting solid and reliable in every game occasion, without ever giving signs of slowdown or uncertainty Effects of war The explosions have been enhanced and made truly spectacular: they create a convincing effect of light, volumetric smoke, a decisive shock wave and a camera movement that accentuates the sensation of displacement of the character that has no equal. Physics also produces secondary effects on its surroundings; cars blow up, objects and people are catapulted meters and meters away, spectacular chain reactions start. However, the excessive desire to add details and polygons everywhere has slightly decreased the quality of the textures, strangely subdued as regards the average of Xbox360 games. The audio sector is very accurate, and only the different sound effects produced by each type of weapon deserve special praise. The whole game is well dubbed in Italian, with good voices even if sometimes recited with excessive military emphasis which makes them slightly grotesque and comical. The main theme is the classic one that now characterizes Advanced War", "date": "2007-03-16", "grade": null}
