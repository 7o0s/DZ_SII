The Smackdown vs. In fact, Raw stands as the holy grail for any fan of Vince McMahon's federation, and undoubtedly the first impact with any episode of this franchise translates into dozens of hours of entertainment thanks to the multiple modes present, the many possible stipulations for each match , the huge roster (also made up of legends), the powerful editor and, last but not least, the online aspects of the experience. The point is that this ~feast~ is inevitably followed by side effects, in this case an ~indigestion~ which leads us to identify and resent the numerous similarities between one edition and another of the series, which basically copies from year to year itself and offers no really good reason to attract back those who have ~already given~. It is also and above all for this reason that THQ has decided to create something different, returning after the controversial Legends of Wrestlemania (always entrusted to Yuke's) to a formula capable of winking at the past, making old and new superstars available new in an almost unprecedented crossover, with a structure dedicated to simplicity and able to captivate casual gamers and nostalgics. Sports friends! The first moments with WWE All Stars unfortunately do not turn out to be idyllic, and the disappointment is great. The version of the game that we have had the opportunity to try, the one for Wii, is in fact characterized by a control system that to define cumbersome is an understatement, and which absolutely does not lend itself to use with the Wii-mote / Nunchuk combination: the assigned race to the d-pad (very convenient to press down on the directional cross plus the A button for a hit in motion!), the pin that is activated by shaking the controller and other even more bizarre solutions prove to be frankly unfeasible. In order to take advantage of at least decent controls, you must therefore use a Classic Controller: in this way the Y and X buttons allow you to launch fast or slow punches, the B and A buttons to make light or powerful grips, the L and R backbones respectively to dodge and parry the opponent's blows and finally the tiny ZL and ZR backbones to interact with the scenario (exit and re-enter the ring, collect objects, climb the pole, pin) or run. Combining the various buttons gives rise to numerous variants for the moves, allows us to perform the characteristic maneuvers of the character we control and finally to produce a devastating (however unique) super move, which becomes available when the relative bar is full and needs a few moments of loading before it can be used. The gameplay of WWE All Stars is very static, there is a clear division between the action inside and outside the ring, and unfortunately many dynamics appear not very refined. In fact, it is enough to try a match between three or four contenders to perceive the inadequacy of the collisions, which leads to even very frustrating situations in which it is never quite clear who our current opponent is, and the mediocre artificial intelligence of the characters controlled by the game , who often ~spell~ out of the ring or start hitting nothing rather than pin a wrestler to the ground. Once you have ~taken the measures~ to these limitations, winning then becomes a real piece of cake: just grab your opponent once to have him practically always at our mercy, performing moves after moves on him every time he gets up, with just a little attention to timing. In short, after a little practice you get over the cumbersome controls, the incomplete collision detection, the numerous ~locking~ problems when there are several wrestlers in the ring and also the fact that opponents often recover too quickly from maneuvers that they should at least wear them down, but it's not really fun. At most we are satisfied, thinking about how beautiful the classic WWF Superstars and WWF Wrestlefest were, both branded Technos Japan (the authors of Double Dragon, to be clear) and both based on the good old button mashing. For me... number one! Those who imagined WWE All Stars as a spectacular, immediate arcade capable of giving great satisfaction with every successful move will unfortunately be disappointed. The Wii version, however, lacks the multiplayer mode present on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Can we talk about a failure across the board, in short? Not exactly. From a single player perspective, iIn fact, the game well represents the needs of the average user, with the ~Path of Champions~ mode and the generational challenges of ~Fantasy Warfare~: the first sees us face a sequence of ten matches that culminate in a final battle at Wrestlemania, while the second compares wrestlers from different eras to determine who is the best in its category: Ultimate Warrior against Sheamus, Rey Mysterio against Eddie Guerrero, Mister Perfect against The Miz and so on. Completing each challenge unlocks the next, while for the ~Path of Champions~ the rewards are extra content for the editor. In both cases, the meetings are interspersed with numerous filmed sequences, old and new, which will undoubtedly delight fans. The structure of the title developed by THQ San Diego is therefore confirmed as ~lean~, with a good prize system that gradually fully reveals the excellent roster made up of thirty present and past superstars. The graphic style adopted, with the wrestlers deliberately ~exaggerated~ both in their physical appearance and in their abilities, has its own reason but is not fully convincing, and on the Nintendo console in particular it pays duty due to the lack of detail of the polygonal models, for the botched side elements and for a stable but not as fluid frame rate as on HD consoles. And the sound? Ups and downs here too: on the one hand the inevitable music of all the WWE wrestlers and the excellent choice of involving Jim Ross, Jerry Lawler and Howard Finkel as announcer in the commentary, on the other a disastrous management of the sound effects, as well as almost all of the announcements pronounced with a questioning rather than affirmative tone (stuff you wouldn't believe!).", "date": "2011-04-18", "grade": "6.0"}
