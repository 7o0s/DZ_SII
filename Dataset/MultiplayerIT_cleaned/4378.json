{"name": "The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-witcher-3-aggiornamento-ps5-pc-xbox-series-xs-recensione.html", "text": "There was a distant time, well before the controversial debut of Cyberpunk 2077, in which CD Projekt RED was one of the publishers most loved by gamers from all over the world. A kind of golden unicorn that put the enthusiast figure at the center of the stage, spoiling it with titles of great workmanship and submerging it with content at no cost. A company for gamers founded and run by gamers, who apparently lived for the sole purpose of satisfying their desires. That old CD Projekt has reappeared over the last few days through the majestic landscapes of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, polished through a substantial next-gen patch aimed at transforming the experience on PlayStation 5, on Xbox Series X|S and also on PC. A great free update designed to remake the look of Geralt of Rivia's most famous adventure, ferrying the marshes of Velen and the peaks of Skellige to the shores of the ninth generation of consoles, squeezing every circuit of the machines in order to get closer to the best versions available : not those just out of the factory, but those further refined thanks to the addition of appendices such as graphic mods. Forget about An Armchair for Two: this year Christmas must be spent in the company of Geralt, Ciri and Dandelion, having a drink with the Bloody Baron and resting under the warm slopes of Novigrad. The next-gen version of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is in fact a love letter addressed to fans, a casket willing to open up on one of the best video games of the last generation. But what is impressive is the fact that even today - almost eight years after the original launch - the epic of the witcher still manages to shine among RPGs set in an open world. Does this simply mean that it was an extraordinary title, or that the entire production of the genre has rested on its laurels? Know that it is very difficult to provide a single answer, even if we will try in this analysis of the next-gen version of The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt. The Witcher 3 seven years later Welcome to Velen, this time in the heart of next-gen, complete with ray tracing on console Our old review of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt had framed the final chapter of the CD Projekt trilogy as the best RPG for the eighth generation of consoles. The surprise, in this sense, is that if it had made its absolute debut in the early years of PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series, the work based on the stories of Andrzej Sapkowski would have risked winning the same primacy, probably established only by the Elden Ring . An odyssey, that of Geralt of Rivia, which leads the witcher to the four corners of a medieval world with dark and fantasy hues, while the hooves of the faithful mare Rutilia tread swamps overflowing with corpses and colorful fields in bloom. There are hundreds of hours of play made available by CD Projekt RED, which dances agile between the story of the search for the young Cirilla and tons of secondary activities, painting a picture that digs relentlessly into the darkest features of the human soul. In short, it is an experience that is forbidden to miss, even if usually one is distant from the classic tradition of Western RPGs. The developers have chosen as a canvas a series of vast open-world maps that become the scene of a unique narrative component, made up of total freedom and large interrupted bridges. It's up to the player to decide which track to pursue by carrying out investigations that sometimes end in a dead end, pushing him to beat unexplored paths and meet dozens of extraordinary supporting characters. Not to mention that, talking to a simple stranger or consulting a village bulletin board, you run the real risk of getting lost for hours in parallel stories with a strong emotional charge. Against these backdrops, when the dialogue gives way to the sword, the gameplay embodies the soul of the classic action video game, staging whirlwinds of slashing and explosive magical signs to annihilate terrifying monsters and humans often more evil than any beast. Between passive skills, very powerful decoctions, unique armor and silver blades, each player can sew a tailor-made combat system for himself, even if this segment has often emerged as the most criticized by fans. From the peaks of the Skellige archipelago to the most remote forests surrounding Novigrad, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is still today a mine of interactions that frescoes dozens of large and small stories with breathtaking panoramas. In this regard, we must not forget Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine, or the two great expansions that have marked the post-launch period, often consideredrate among the best injections of additional content out there. But if already in 2015 the title presented itself as a monument of the genre, the debut was marked by a long series of imperfections which, at the time, one still felt able to forgive the small and beloved CD Projekt RED. Only quality of life? The photo mode is at the service of the art direction: get ready to collect shots The first surgery of the patch aims to improve the gaming experience, putting the finishing touches to a formula already perfected over the years. This does not only mean enhancing the graphics sector but introducing new mechanics aimed at making many facets of Geralt of Rivia's journey more enjoyable. As if we were exploring an iceberg, we will start from the surface to gradually descend towards the most esoteric depths. The change that first catches the eye is the new default setting linked to the camera, which chooses to position it much closer to Geralt's shoulder completely eliminating the zoom-out effect that characterized the fights. CD Projekt stated that this type of view was ~born almost by chance~, but there is no doubt that it contributes to giving a younger look to the witcher's deeds, dangerously approaching the staging to that encountered in the recent chapters of God of War. It is not an imposition: it can be activated and deactivated in the options according to the different phases of the game, but it gives an aura of grandeur to the medieval scenography and radically changes - often positively - the approach to the combat phases. If the dense interface of the original risked too often jeopardizing immersion, now it is possible to select an option that allows the HUD to be reduced to a minimum by making it disappear entirely in the exploration phases, in order to make it even more cinematic Geralt's raids. If that weren't enough, you can always count on the photographic mode that can be activated by pressing both analog sticks, to immortalize the deeds and great victories of the White Wolf. It is an almost stylized function, which allows you to play with the classic sliders of photo editing programs, without adding anything else to the staging, such as facial expressions or particular poses. The new graphics, aided by the close-up camera, change the face of the experience Staying close to the surface, CD Projekt RED wanted to rejuvenate the world map, reducing the number of visible icons to facilitate the reading of the map, for example by hiding the tons of question marks that dirty it. According to the same philosophy, it is no longer necessary to use additional menus to collect herbs and ingredients for potions, which are directly transferred to the bag following a single press of the respective input. The refinements of this kind are too many to tell them all: it is finally possible to assign the shot to the pressure of the left analog, while you can count on three different levels of intensity for Geralt's walk. It's when you push the boundaries of gameplay that the update starts to flex its muscles, showing off details that rejuvenate the classic experience. One of the most impactful changes is the ability to use any Magic Sign without having to open the radial menu; if this might seem like a small thing, the reality is that it gives a new rhythm to the fights, transforming them into a waltz of fire and steel in which to indulge without interruption. Anyone who has faced the original The Witcher 3 at the highest difficulty levels will remember the Quen defensive Sign with love, indispensable for surviving the most demanding battles, but now it will be a simple piece in the mosaic of spells that can be intertwined without thoughts; just hold down the right trigger to have access to all the witcher's magical qualities, activating the most appropriate one with the respective front button. With the reduced HUD and close-up camera, the scenery becomes much more imposing The same goes for tools, too often underestimated by aspiring Witchers, who tended to ignore them due to the constant need to access the inventory to equip them. Now, thanks to a radial selector, it only takes a moment to wield a bomb and blast yet another lair of seedy Nekkers. Fall damage reduction shines among the most underrated inserts: in the past the unbeatable Geralt of Rivia broke his knees too easily, and the new solution completely changes the approach to level design. If in 2015 you had to ride for a long time to get out of the top of a hill, now you can go down without fear of losing hours of play. The attention dedicated to the behavior of the Rutilia mare deserves a mention, which is slightly more responsive especially in narrow spaces, for example when maneuvering at the exit of a tavern where a few cards have been won for Gwent. Dedicated to the most demanding players, on the other hand, is the new interpretation of enemy scaling, which aims to make any battle always challenging without transforming minor opponents such as the Drowners into unstoppable powers. It is important to underline that if some of these changes will also see the light on old-gen platforms, most will be reserved for the beneficiaries of the entire patch, i.e. PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X | S players. Cross save and compatibility By connecting your Gog.com account you can use the cross-save function, transferring the latest data saved in the cloud between one platform and another: just scan a QR Code that can be recalled directly in the save menu. But be careful: it is not clear whether this novelty is only compatible with the Complete Edition and the GOTY Edition, or is also available for the standard variant. In the PC orbit, the 4.0 patch will make all previous mods incompatible, so you'll want to make sure they've been updated to the current version before installing them again. The next-gen versions There are rare situations where ray tracing on consoles gets to flex its muscles There are junctures where the next-gen version of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt presents itself as quite a different title from the original. When approached with the new close-up camera, pop-up HUD, and all the tools to aid immersion in combat, Geralt's Journey borders on feeling like a game designed specifically for modern machines. The only shadows reside in the small smears dating back to the time of the launch, such as the dialogues always staged in shot-reverse shot, or the constant transitions to black that characterize the beginning of conversations and in-engine animated sequences. This is a legacy that absolutely does not dirty the work done on the aesthetic sector. Even before analyzing the different graphic modes, it is worth dwelling on the direct interventions that have touched the technical segment. Character models, for example, have been improved by handcrafting, often eliminating overlaps with certain armor sets; you can also see the finishes in the bodies and faces with the naked eye, not to mention that the same treatment has also been reserved for the aesthetics of some monsters. Shadows are now rendered in high resolution even outside of cutscenes, environment meshes are richer, even the skyboxes and weather have gone through a boost phase. The most evident finish, the one that is first noticed when starting the title, is the one that has impacted the vegetation, which is not only sharper and denser in the foliage, but decidedly more responsive to the influence of the wind. The developers have in fact focused on the graphic effects of the scenography, improving both those that manage the behavior of the plants and those that impact the water, a predominant element both in Velen and among the backdrops of Skellige. Finally, there is no need to spend words on the fact that the uploads are significantly shorter on the new hardware. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X can now count on two graphics modes, namely Performance and Ray tracing. The novelty, in this sense, is that both take advantage of AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.1 technology to produce a visual result in 4K regardless of the framerate thanks to upscaling, aiming for 60 fps in Performance and 30 fps in Ray tracing. The difference, of course, lies in the feature that gives the second mode its name: the Ray-traced console versions can in fact count on ray-traced global illumination and ambient occlusion; this means that the light sources and shadows of the objects - particularly in the interiors - emerge decidedly more substantial from the amalgam, however imposing a heavy tax on the frame rate and on the distance of the volumetric effects. The situation of ray tracing on PC is still different, the only platform that - in addition to supporting Nvidia's DLSS - also offers ray-traced shadows and reflections, two features that according to CD Projekt's own statement would have been unsustainable for next-generation machines. gen. This is a difference that can be seen above all in the boundaries of the reflections on the aquatic surfaces, which, although visiv", "date": "2022-12-12", "grade": "9.0"}
