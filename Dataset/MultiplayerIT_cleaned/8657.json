{"name": "Voglia di horror", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/100889-silent-hill-downpour-voglia-di-horror.html", "text": "In a context, such as the current one, in which software houses increasingly have their hands tied by demanding publishers and the fate of brands is proportional to box office results, it is now routine to see historical franchises being given development to external teams, often geographically and socially very distant from the ideological root of the progenitor. Silent Hill: Downpour willy-nilly followed this very path. In an attempt to revitalize the saga, victim of a profound image crisis following recent not too inspired episodes, Konami has therefore decided to entrust the development of the game to the Czech team Vatra Games, supervised by the historic Silence Team, true deus ex machine of the first chapters. The promises of sick atmospheres and scenarios of madness ready to inspire moments of pure terror have greatly increased the expectation for this title, but how much of all this does Silent Hill: Downpour really manage to give? Protagonists not by chance It is undeniable that a good trademark of the saga has always been the narrative sector. Since the first episode, dated at the end of the 90s, the brand has thrilled and thrilled players of all ages thanks to its liberal fishing from multiple literary and esoteric sources, as fascinating as they are disturbing. It is therefore very curious to note how this time the story of the Silence Team has not called into question divinities of the Cabala or scenarios of clear Lovecraftian mold, by virtue of a narrative plot more focused on the complex psychological scenarios of the characters, where visions of sinful pasts merge with a dark and dangerous present. It is Murphy Pendleton, a prisoner in a maximum security prison, the unfortunate who will satisfy everyone's desire for horror, accompanying us in his fortunate and ruinous escape to Silent Hill in search of answers to his visions and nightmares. While detaching from a concept of horror linked to occult legends and demonic presences and more focused on characters with deep and coherent backgrounds, the Vatra Games guys were good at avoiding deja-vu connected to setting terminology already known to the fans , alternating moments of more agitated narration with other purely psychological ones, where to feed the underlying supernatural thriller there are no names of divinities or particular cults but only and exclusively the sick minds of the protagonist and his supporting actors. One could say that, after all, that's all: the story of a man lost in the city of evil looking for answers about a past that he will only face in the final climax, but don't be fooled. Averagely pleasant, with sensible and at times almost alienating characters, the main plot is well structured, with unexpected twists and the usual dose of madness to give moments of total disorientation in the face of certain discoveries that will be made along the way. Although not decisive for the purposes of the story, the game also puts us in front of choices to be made in some topical moments, which will then impact on the ending that will be unlocked by finishing it. These are the reasons that easily demonstrate how the story is the strength of the product and that, more than any other playful aspect, will make you advance along all the game environments to discover what are the secrets that bind Murphy to the town and the his characters. Characterized by a good longevity and a well-interwoven story, with even 6 endings (of which the sixth can only be unlocked starting from the second playthrough), the Konami horror thriller has undoubtedly come closer, narratively speaking, to the glories of the past. Take this, not this one If fine words can be spent on the story, it is unfortunately difficult to do so on other factors, first of all the basic gameplay on which the backbone of the product revolves. The game structure is immediate and already known to action lovers of this generation; a third-person view with a camera behind the protagonist accompanies almost the entire journey, with rare fixed shots attempting to differentiate the cinematographic offer by proposing cuts so sporadic as to seem almost forced and out of context, a sort of unsuccessful tribute. Pad in hand, all that glitters is not gold. If it is true that the exploration of the game environments grows and becomes interesting as the adventure continues, the same cannot be said of the combat system, unfortunately the fulcrum of the product and a sore point. It is woody, imprecise and the result of a perhaps fragmented programming and marred by countless technical problems. Someone can naively rejoice in the face of this, almost galvanizing themselves thinking that such checks have been yesdesigned to make the experience more difficult and deliberately hardcore, but unfortunately the reality is quite different. The action part is repetitive, boring and without stimuli, with quick time events that now inevitably appear dated and often free, artifacts of a game design philosophy that was better left to the past where it belongs. With a camera that is not as precise as you would like in the fight sequences and an animation park that certainly does not help to understand the movement frames of the enemies with whom you are confronted; there are not sporadic cases in which the slow response of the commands and the execution of the moves lead to involuntary playful handicaps that ruin the combat phases. The wealth of white weapons, which are found along the way and which deteriorate when using them, does not improve everything, as the perception of the difference in quality and strength of one weapon compared to another is very minimal, thus leading to not giving a real sense in the search for a particular armament, an element that therefore appears more as a desire to lighten the survival part in an artistic way than a technical differentiation of the available weapons. One melee in hand and one fire on the back, ready to take out hordes of opponents. It's just a pity that the bullets are so rare as to make it practically useless to carry a rifle around, also because the aim itself is poorly done, and if the shots are already few, it is depressing to waste them against enemies who, due to lack of collision points, are not always hit as they should. A positive note must be said for the general lighting: always armed with a trusty torch, both light and then ultraviolet, the sections in the dark are beautiful, especially those in which you will have to advance only with a lighter, surrounded by darkness and constantly threatened by what might be around the corner. It's just a pity that these phases are present only in the very first hours of the game and rarely the fear of the unknown then corresponds to a real threat, but at least the intention must be appreciated. Playstation 3 trophies Silent Hill: Downpour offers 42 trophies in total. They differ in the standard categories, ranging from the easiest such as progressing through the story and completing side quests to the more complex ones, such as using certain weapons to kill enemies and unlocking all game endings. It will take more steps to conquer the Platinum. Unreal all too real It's truly amazing to find out how the whole game is powered by Unreal Engine 3. We wouldn't have been surprised if all this had been written 4 years ago, when programming artifices were the order of the day and Epic's technical tools they still had to be digested correctly by half the world's software houses. The problem, however, is that we are in 2012, and it is objectively intolerable to view for the umpteenth time this amount of graphic inaccuracies and technical deficits. From the first moments of the game, good polygonal models can be seen in the faces of the characters, but it is when they are put in motion that the facial animations show all their artistic deficiency. Jerky movements and the lack of expressiveness of the faces do not often make certain interlude scenes credible, with characters at times so unreal in acting as to seem almost out of context. It's a real shame, because the narrative prerequisites for making certain moments cinematic are all there, yet the physics of the movements and the dated animations unfortunately do not do justice enough. The game environments alternate with good frequency, leading to the exploration of a beautiful section of Silent Hill but unfortunately never managing to unleash who knows what visual enthusiasm, certainly victims of below average textures, annoying pop-ups, occasional flickering phenomena and frequent framerate drops that undermine an enjoyable browsing experience. In terms of artistic inspiration, it is necessary to mention the sections in the Otherworld, particularly sick and oppressive, with the feeling of being more in front of a well-made track than a real playful turning point. In fact, you will have to run at breakneck speed along the infernal setting in search of the safe goal, and it is precisely in these sections that you can see the best style choices adopted by the team, with inverted gravity parts, falling cages, wall monsters and much other, always chased by the void that never seems to leave the protagonist in peace. He will clearly not be the only one, even the monsters and enemies of the game will always be lurking along the adventure, a pity however that they are very few, with immediately intuitive patterns and not at all inspired on an artistic level, immediately losing the horror load of the first ones momentand soon becoming more of an obstacle to be knocked down with a club than an enemy to be feared. Puzzles and more A large amount of material to be recovered around the silent town will allow the playing time to be greatly extended. Sheets, maps, letters and writings that you annotate on your trusty portable diary will help to better understand what happened before Murphy's arrival, also giving some credibility to the surrounding setting and the historical background of the place. The quest system is also interesting, which will lead you to go far and wide in Silent Hill to complete the various additional missions, whether they are freeing the birds from the cages, finding medallions, controlling crazy police patrols and looking for movie films from the cinema. Scattered around the game world there will also be safes to open with codes that will be found around, perhaps taking advantage of the city's sewage system that allows you to go from one place to another more quickly. The puzzles are present, they are many and some even quite well thought out. Nothing transcendental mind you, but it is interesting to note how some of them involve and combine environmental elements with other exploratory ones, leading the player to think about what to do, perhaps using this or that particular object. A note on the soundtrack: it no longer sees the historic Akira Yamaoka at the helm but the young Daniel Licht, who, although he does not propose peaks of acoustic quality, expertly gives heavy atmospheres also thanks to the good use of ambient sounds and melodies with a vague flavor perverse, ready to recreate that industrial atmosphere that is so dear to fans.", "date": "2012-03-22", "grade": "6.5"}
