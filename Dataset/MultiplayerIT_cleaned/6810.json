{"name": "Sunset Overdrive", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/139654-sunset-overdrive-spaccate-tutto.html", "text": "Sunset Overdrive is the story of Insomniac who, after years of exclusives with Sony and the unsuccessful experiment of Fuse, has jumped the barricade by developing exclusively for nothing less than the newborn Microsoft console, Xbox One. It is also the story of The Player, as the protagonist is called in the subtitles of the game, whether male or female, catapulted into an absurd situation in which a multinational company, Fizzco, creates and distributes an irresistible drink on the market that transforms into mutants all the inhabitants of Sunset City, leaving to the survivors, the only ones who for some reason didn't buy it on launch day, the task of surviving, in fact. The Player, on the other hand, once created with a fast editor with two different body types and a copious series of faces and haircuts, wants to be able to escape from the city at any cost, forgetting everything that happened and the colorful characters that have divided into what are bizarre tribes who vie for the territory of the city fighting against the robotic armies of Fizzco, the soldiers and, of course, the mutants who are everywhere and by the thousands. Sunset City The irony that pervades the game is one of the most successful things about Sunset Overdrive, which is a disruptive pop comic, a very bright explosion of colors that are spread in posters on the walls of buildings, in giant writings that spring from KABOOM and cracks into the asphalt whenever you perform a combo or blow up a container of the offending drink or any of the dozens of on-screen interactive elements. It's somewhere between a celebration and a mockery of ~nerd~ culture with its fixations for comic books, sci-fi movies, metal music and all-out role-playing, with a group of survivors who gathers in a medieval papier-mch castle and who, armed with foam rubber swords, tries in vain to reconquer civilization. There are also technomaniacal Oxford students, perturbing and undressed Latinas, protectors of defenseless children and martial arts lovers who have shut themselves up in a museum of oriental culture guided by a general who elicits loud laughs when he appears on the scene, without spoiling any surprises. In this avalanche of polygonal confetti, the mechanics are an obvious reference to Jet Set Radio and many purely action free roamings released in recent years, from Prototype to inFAMOUS, which however do not in the least match the seriousness of the setting or the desire to narrate a a story that remains even more hinted at than the recent Dead Rising 3 which even ventured more different endings and some really crazy supporting actors. In a map divided into three macro areas and which is apparently as vast as that of Grand Theft Auto IV, the protagonist faces a series of main missions that lead him to try to defeat FIZZCO in some way, going from objectives that are substantiated for mostly in quests of collecting items, defeating enemies and escorting characters or things from one place to another. In short, variety is certainly not the main dish cooked by Insomniac. The action, on the other hand, is frenetic and fun, developed as it is horizontally and vertically with a more complex control method than it might initially seem and which requires continuous attention in order to chain ever more impressive scores and powers. In fact, you can move quickly to some strongholds along the map simply by selecting the arrival point, but most of the time you use the endless jumps that you can make, alternating with grinds or along light cables, sidewalks, edges of the roofs or even the facades of the buildings or the surface of the water as soon as the related skill is unlocked. The interactive surfaces are many, practically infinite, and your character does not automatically cling to them but always needs to press the relative button with the right timing, the X to hook on, alternating with the jump button to bounce from one side to the other and here too you have to keep an eye on where you land and the right moment to rebound. It takes a while to get used to it, when you do it you find yourself in complete control of the action, the only contraindication of the chosen system is that, probably aware of its lack of immediacy, the Insomniacs have opted for a balance which, even when accelerating with the turbo active when pressing RB, apart from a graphic effect and a slight boost, it never lets us reach breathtaking speeds, but we always manage to keep everything under control, removing that extra bit of frenzy it would have spoiled especially in the long run. In total, however, the game is spectacular and works for a large part, amusing funtil the end of the story (almost nonsense) which can be reached in about 15 hours and for all the time you want to dedicate to finishing the quests, almost all of which you go and destroy/collect, and to find the collectibles, without however ever reaching some form of real emotional involvement or real elation. Sunset Overdrive is a lot of fun, but it doesn't leave great marks on those who play and it hardly tries to innovate formulas already tried elsewhere and previously. Sunset Overdrive is a polygonal carnival where you can have hours of fun without losing your mind Overdrive tuners The key to all gameplay is at the top right, given by a bolt of lightning that fills up every time you play with ~style~ that counts as much as the power of the shots fired by the dozens of weapons, almost all crazy in pure Insomniac style. The lightning fills up to indicate four levels for each of which Overdrives are activated, perks linked to the different actions that the player can perform and which, for example, increase the hero's health by 10% when he grinds up to the first level of style, 20% at the second level and on up to the fourth. Up to six different ones can be combined, making our avatar, by performing the different actions and increasing the level of style between jumps, grinds and killings, become a real war machine with a set that can make him increase his power of one-shot weapons, for example, combined with higher vital points or increased damage for certain weapon types, rather than certain enemy types. In order for each overdrive to boost up to the fourth level, the many collectibles must be spent in the appropriate shops to be collected everywhere from shoes hanging from light wires, to toilet paper strips from lampposts, to FIZZCO mascot plastic puppets fluttering and many others, scattered almost everywhere and identifiable by buying the relative maps that leave only the panoramic points linked to the achievement of an objective hidden. Insomniac, therefore, has taken care to link the collection of objects to the enhancement of the character, which is very wise but which is thwarted by the fact that the game is far from demanding and that it can be easily finished simply by obtaining those improvements that the plot proposes in a natural way, leaving the perfectionists to score all sorts of insights, somewhat dispersing the potential of this system. All this would be further reinforced by what are called Enhancements, combined with the hero which, for example, cause his melee shots to generate lightning or tornadoes, or which cause waves of lightning to be created with each bounce. shock or flames or which, finally, make it more resistant to certain types of attack. These are unlocked with the story or the completion of certain missions and can be selected in up to five categories and one for each. When new ones are unlocked, a superimposed writing warns us of the possibility but, here too, having found those five that suit your style of play, you even forget you have them or go and explore others, since you do everything without problems. Even the rich gameplay, once unlocked the double jump and the water run, remains unchanged until the end and the way of navigating through the city becomes more spectacular only with more practice of the player, but does not evolve significantly in the mechanics nor in the parts that can be reached of the map which, unlocked in all its parts, is completely explorable after a few hours of play. Insomniac Arsenal As we have said, there are Insomniac's weapons ranging from explosive teddy bears, to the usual laser beams that propagate from one enemy to another or shoot fireworks that launch enemies into the air by setting them on fire. The team never denies itself and in addition to creativity it puts the usual levels of power between which you simply switch using weapons during fights. New devices are conquered with the quests, a memorable one is a robotic killer dog that follows a stuffed cat that the Player throws like a fetch stick, while most of them can be bought with cans from the shopkeepers who are found in each liberated outpost and who inhabit each sub-area of the city that unlocks as the story progresses. In reality, all too soon we find ourselves using no more than a couple of them, evidently more powerful than the others, so that only target hunters will be encouraged to upgrade others also because ammo and health refills are found almost everywhere. as well as the cans that act as a bargaining chip to buy them (the money is used to buy the hundredsia of crazy clothes to wear for pure aesthetic taste). In some missions it is necessary to protect the containers of liquid for the enhancers from the assaults of the OD, the mutants, and to do this one faces a horde-type mode in which both automatic and jump-activated traps must also be placed. A small diversion that is also found in those challenges that make up the gameplay after finishing the story and the subquests and that can be played one after the other by comparing the scores of your friends online, while obtaining weapons and additional pieces of clothing (there are dozens of them): there are also challenges in which to collect numbers placed on light wires and ledges within a certain time; episodes of a TV show in which you slaughter mutants; timed challenges or challenges related to the use of some weapons that are used in particular moments of the single player campaign. These also form the backbone of the multiplayer mode, Chaos Squad, in which up to eight players take on these challenges in sequence by moving from one part of the map to another (there is a cash prize for the first player to reach the area of the next challenge) continuing to upgrade weapons and get money and cans. A nice side dish but which we doubt will involve in the long run and once all the unlockable is unlocked. Sunset Overdrive is damned fun, but for that pleasure of soft and precise gameplay which, aided by the excellent graphics, sees hundreds of enemies explode on the screen in writings, bonuses, cans and dollars spinning in an orgy that leads you to play to collect items and doing sub quests all the while it literally flies by. More could have been done though, find some truly innovative element and avoid relegating the upgrades of other weapons to the achievement of objectives but rather to defeat more difficult and more structured bosses. Sunset Overdrive is often spectacular, however, apart from a couple of flashes and several hilarious moments it gives its maximum almost immediately remaining at the same level throughout, with gameplay variations distributed with a dropper. Xbox One goals At the end of the campaign and with about two-thirds of the sub-quests completed, we ended up with about 450 of the 1000 objective points available. Getting to 500 requires some cunning and some ~food~ goals that can be obtained quite easily. To get to 1000, on the other hand, it's a more complicated story because you have to collect the hundreds of collectibles and also the panoramic points which, however, cannot be identified on the map. You also put the games in Chaos Squad in multiplayer and it is understood that getting to the full loot will require no less than 30/40 hours of play (Sunset Overdrive has a counter of actual hours of gameplay between the menu pages). A city for grinding Great controversy has been made for the 900p and 30 frames per second with which Insomniac render Sunset City, the scene of the whole game. The resolution has been privileged, said the brave Ted Price, to favor special effects in post processing and the number of enemies on the screen, which is actually remarkable also because they are opponents who climb everywhere and who have artificial intelligence much more developed than the zombies of a Dead Rising 3, for example. The controversies, on balance, turn out to be completely superfluous, Sunset to see is an orgy of colors, explosions, painstaking animations for the protagonist and for the many enemies who also differ in number and powers in a satisfactory manner, especially in this start next-gen. The engine, among other things, puts on track the best textures seen in a game of the genre on Xbox One, both by definition and by implementation and this general care makes it extremely pleasant to wander around a city which, however, is populated only by monsters with practically no characters to interact with, except for small groups of fugitives to be saved who reciprocate us with a cash prize. Among exploding crates, airships that blow up, monsters and sparks, you have fun jumping everywhere with some micro slowdown only when the count of the elements on the screen becomes really prohibitive. The sound is no different with a great selection of punk rock songs and effects that distinguish weapons, enemies and environments. The game is all dubbed in Italian like all triple A productions published by Microsoft Studios. In short, overall there is perhaps no miracle, even for the light-hearted and deliberately desecrating style, but what you will see on your screen will fully satisfy your expectations of the new Microsoft console.", "date": "2014-10-27", "grade": "8.1"}
