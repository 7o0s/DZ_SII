{"name": "Stolen in 60 seconds", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/stolen-in-60-seconds.html", "text": "Stolen in 60 seconds, clearly inspired by the film title starring Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie, in Italy Out in 60 seconds, sees us in the role of a crime boss with the task of planning, in the true sense of the word, several shots against of banks, jewelers and shops of various kinds. Unlike what one might think, given the assumptions of an action game, Stolen is instead a title set on ~planning~, recalling with due proportions, the first titles in the Rainbow Six series that appeared on PC. We'll start with a simple map of the place we're going to attack, a map without too many details but with only the accesses indicated, therefore doors and windows. We will have to continue our criminal work by contacting our informant who, for a generous fee, will be able to report the fundamental news to us, first of all by showing us on the map where the most important precious objects are located, whether they are diamonds, money or jewels. This character will be decisive for the whole game by giving us all the best tips, also indicating how many minutes we will have to enter, carry out the robbery and escape with our fireball. However, our team does not stop at the informant; from time to time we will be able to choose which thief to recruit, each with their own characteristics and with their own percentage of the proceeds of each robbery. Every professional can be equipped with the right equipment, lock picks, passpartouts, drills, electronic scanners, just to name a few. Obviously each weapon will have a price and a weight that we will have to deduct from the mission budget and the physical abilities of our thief. After performing all these preventive maneuvers we will finally be able to get our hands on the actual map. All we'll do is trace the criminals' route on the screen of our phone, also indicating, each time we encounter an obstacle, such as a door, a window or a safe, which tool they will have to use. Once we have recovered the loot we will only have to trace the ~route~ back to the car and run away like hares. The management of this entire procedure is very basic and is based on the classic directional cross that is created on the keyboard of each mobile phone, or on the joypad for those phones that have one. Once the planning is finished, we will move on to the actual development of the action, during which we will be almost spectators, seeing the two robbers move as established by the previous conception. The possibility of using two robbers has the undoubted advantage of being able to divide the transportable loads and the tools to be used. If we take too long to carry out the theft, the police will arrive relentlessly. Technically the title developed by Herocraft is more than valid, resulting pleasant in planning on the map and with colorful and well-defined sprites displayed during the execution of the robbery. The few reservations towards Stolen in 60 seconds must therefore be sought in its very nature, which lead it to be more demanding than the average mobile game; it is not a game for a few moments to be clear, given that at least ten minutes are needed to successfully complete the entire action. And if we want to be honest, Angelina Jolie is also missing...
