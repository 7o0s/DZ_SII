{"name": "PC Basket 2002 - Palla al centro!", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pc-basket-2002-palla-al-centro.html", "text": "Today I would buy the Meneghin If you were already thinking of personally resolving the adverse fortunes of the Bulls or of taking Jordan's place on the Wizards bench, you are off track: PC Basket 2002 deals exclusively with European basketball and consequently instead of the now abused NBA championship, we will have the pleasure of competing for the victory of 6 national tournaments (Italian, German, French, Spanish, Greek and Turkish) for a total of about 90 teams! Furthermore, after reaching the pinnacle of success in their respective league, each team will be able to compete in one national cup, and two international European cups. As was to be expected, the database of clubs, players and substitutes, in addition to being disproportionately large, is also strictly faithful to reality. As in any good self-respecting manager, the player will shoulder all the responsibilities that are covered in a sports club, finding himself at the same time as president, coach, talent scout and so on. Each year it will be necessary to face one or more transfer campaigns in order to strengthen the weaknesses that emerged from the previous season, while at the same time taking care of market research which will allow the scouting of new talents. It will be our duty to take care of the corporate budget and player contracts, granting them bonuses and compensation, as well as naturally taking care of their athletic training, setting up schemes and strategies and providing for substitutions during matches. As you can see, from the point of view of completeness and complexity, this title has very little to envy to the more famous PC Calcio (to which it winks more or less explicitly with a name of sure impact) going to cover every simulable aspect and in my opinion conceivable way of seeing, like the Dinamic title. An interesting detail: it is of course possible to select your favorite sponsor among those available and although it is quite obvious to find the Demsoft or CiDiverte logos in the list, it is kind of recognizing those of well-known names such as Pergioco or Enervit, in addition to the ~usual~ Adidas, which now stands out proudly in any multimedia sports product. Technical foul? I hope you'll forgive the subtle pun (I must be feeling really sick). Well, how does this game appear in the eyes of the silicon fanatic, of the insane hungry for frame rates, bump mapping and full screen anti-aliasing and who wants nothing more than to break through the sound barrier with his GeForce 3 Ultra U.F.O. limited edition? Although, obviously, elaborate graphics and technical virtuosity are not suitable for a managerial title, it must be recognized that the PC Basket interface does not exactly represent the state of the art, at least from a purely cosmetic point of view; the menus are sufficiently tidy, clean and functional (and this is the important thing), but at times the graphics of the same appear a little too thin and in the long run tiring to sustain, also due to the intrusive colors (the shocking blue it was not too happy a choice). Suffice it to say that the options menu of many other games turns out to be much more captivating than the entire graphics of PC Basket... Being a substantially ~textual~ game, the expense of a little more care in this direction would certainly have 'other made the gaming experience more enjoyable, enhancing the good work that underlies the simulation. Even on the sound front there is not much to be satisfied with: some unimpressive musical themes and a set of sometimes annoying and over the top sound effects end up not leaving their mark. In short, on the technical side, more could certainly have been done, postponed to September. Conclusions If you are passionate about management, you are certainly good candidates to appreciate this all-Italian basketball management, provided of course that you are interested in the game of basketball. Certainly nice graphics, some extras on the history of clubs or biographies of the most important players would undoubtedly have increased the intrinsic value of a production that objectively we could have played very well in DOS half a dozen years ago (if someone else had thought about it ), but after all, how can we fail to praise the initiative of those who went to fill such an obvious gap, managing to package such a solid product in terms of content? And then, I finally had the opportunity to play the age-old Milan-Cant match to my liking, you want to put? Introduction It's always a pleasure to talk about young and rampant Italian software houses, especially in this case that asse are at the debut on the shelves of the first effort by Demsoft, published by none other than CiDiverte, already publisher of the year 2001 according to us by M.it. What are we talking about? Of a basketball manager, indeed THE basketball manager, since it is the first title of this kind that we see arriving on PC. Let's see what good it has to offer.", "date": "2002-02-27", "grade": null}
