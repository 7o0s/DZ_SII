While the situation is evolving rapidly, with Nintendo Switch which could open up new scenarios, Level-5 has already had the opportunity to take a new path last July. How? By developing a full-fledged canonical title for laptops, but on iOS and Android. And not just a title: let's talk about the series of Professor Layton, whose new chapter Layton's Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires' Conspiracy will soon (finally) also be available on the Nitendo 3DS family. We're back in London to help Katrielle with her puzzles. Oh Lady, Lady, Lady Katrielle Wanting to quote the Italian acronym of Lady Oscar, in truth, there are very few who party when Miss Katrielle passes. Around her, as a good self-respecting detective story, thefts and disappearances occur, and dodgy characters roam. If you have had the courage to discover Layton's Mystery Journey Katrielle and the Millionaires' Conspiracy since last July on mobile devices, you will immediately notice that you have a simple port for Nintendo 3DS in your hands. Level-5 has indeed launched the new character on smartphones, but we are still talking about the title that inaugurates the new generation of the series. Born on a portable console in the golden years of the Nintendo DS, it will continue its journey up to the life cycle of the 3DS, and we are sure that the detectives will not be slow to arrive on that little gem called Nintendo Switch. Either way, Millionaires' Conspiracy is exactly the same game it was last July. There are only two differences, starting with the unfortunately due technical downgrade of the title on Nintendo 3DS: the portable console has seven years of service behind it and several limits, although it manages to offer excellent cleaning of the image and as always shows the meticulous technical work done by Level-5 in its productions. So let's forget the anime-style cut-scenes at 1080p. of smartphones, and high definition in general, as well as the 3D effect of the Nintendo portable, completely absent. On the other hand, a positive side could be the return of the stylus on 3DS: even if in the end a similar substitute could also be used on mobile, the console title invites you to leave the tapping aside and remove the stylus to use it in the selection of objects of interest and zooming in on certain game environments. Platform you go, tool you find. Ah, these new generations With Layton's Mystery Journey Katrielle and the Millionaires' Conspiracy, Professor Layton's legacy passes to his young daughter Katrielle. Abandoning a character who has now become a real icon is never easy, but Level-5 has decided to take a risk and give the series a new direction, refreshing it right from the protagonists. The mysterious disappearance of the professor in fact guarantees the introduction of a completely revised cast of characters, and in truth, with the exception of the protagonists, almost completely forgettable. We must mention those most characterized: of course the beautiful and enthusiastic Katrielle, able when she wants to become serious and poised, her nagging assistant Ben, and finally a talking dog named Sherl, who represents the first real case of the detective and who snatches some smiles with his irreverent jokes. The plot behind the story is always the disappearance of Layton. Hoping to find him again (sooner or later, but more then than before) Katrielle opens a detective agency in the heart of London, promising her clients that she can solve every mystery (this is precisely the agency's slogan). The previous titles in the series have taught us that the London capital is made up of strange, bizarre and intricate cases: after a myriad of texts on the screen, which in more than one case risked boring us with the occasional futility, the game has finally introduced to the maiden's first real case. Nothing too believable, given that some funny guy had stolen the hour hand from the Big Ben tower. So off we go: stylus in hand, we questioned passers-by, examined shady types, solved secondary puzzles, until we caught the criminal. The narration proceeds thinly for about twenty hours of play, during which we will naturally also end up entangled in the eponymous Conspiracy of the millionaires; but it is always a question of many small disconnected cases, held together by the glue of the professor's disappearance, whereas the previous chapters rather offered a single macro-case to be solved in its many facets. The narrative splintering is reflected in that of the gameplay, eit will leave more than a few fans with a bitter taste, but everything is functional to Level-5's search for new ways that we mentioned earlier, capable of guaranteeing a more ~hit and run~ and less busy experience. Time will tell if this is a winning mechanism, and we will know soon, given that the next chapter is scheduled for 2018. We squeeze out the gray matter On Nintendo 3DS Layton's Mystery Journey Katrielle and the Millionaires' Conspiracy costs more than double the mobile version, it's true, but if you want to enjoy the adventures of Layton's heir on the two portable screens, the price applied is all in all proportional to a of absolutely discreet content. Taking into account the main puzzles necessary to continue the plot, the secondary ones and finally those that can be downloaded for free once a day via DLC, we arrive at almost 200 riddles. A significant offer, especially considering that some of them are truly brilliant and nice, that almost none of them are recycled, and that very few are subdued. The difficulty of each puzzle is indicated by the picarats: these are not South African lemurs, but the in-game currency, as well as the reward for completing each puzzle. Repeatedly failing the goal, the total gain will begin to decrease, but without ever reaching a real game over. With the accumulated money we will be able to unlock new customizations for the agency and clothes that can be worn by Katrielle, a true fashionable London lady who, unlike her father, never wears the same outfit twice. During the adventure, the Level-5 title will offer challenges always focused on puzzles, but with different bases, now stimulating logical-mathematical reasoning, now artistic-creative reasoning. In short, none of your brain lobes will ever really rest. And if you really need a little help, there's the on-screen hints option. After all, it's not like cheating... is it?", "date": "2017-10-05", "grade": "7.8"}
