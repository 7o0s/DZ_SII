{"name": "Call of Juarez - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/call-of-juarez-recensione.html", "text": "The Story of Billy and Uncle Ray After a short introductory tutorial we get to know one of the characters that we will be called upon to control in the unraveling of the events proposed by the plot. Billy called ~Candle~ is the first of these. A young boy who ran away from home to escape the oppression of his stepfather and returned to the city of Hope to find his fortune and rebuild his life. Unfortunately for him, things in his hometown are not going well. His own return is not awaited with much happiness by the inhabitants, violent people and given to the worst jobs, mostly riotous miners and crazy preachers. Upon arrival in the city we will have to get a weapon and ammunition to be able to defend ourselves from the assaults of the ugly thugs who roam the dusty alleys. From this simple and basic necessity kicks off a series of complicated events that will see Billy Candle transform from fortune seeker into fugitive. During the course of the story we will also be called upon to take on the role of Reverend Ray, Billy's uncle, an old preacher with a dark past and fragile stability. The stories of the two characters are destined to cross several times, constituting the intriguing plot that underlies the plot of the title. First person stealth western adventure? We immediately learn what will be some of the cornerstones around which the structure of the gameplay is built. Although the game setting and the interface are fully inspired by the most classic of FPS, we soon understand that there are several contaminations that make CoJ something more complex. The need to become familiar with the commands (in our case to reset them to make the various functions more accessible from the keyboard) derives from the nature of some tranches of the missions that are proposed. although the game setting and the interface are fully inspired by the most classic of FPS, we soon understand that there are several contaminations that make CoJ something more complex First person stealth western adventure? It is essential to know how to navigate between narrow passages or to accurately take the measurements to make precise jumps from one unsafe platform to another. Game elements more suited to an action adventure than to an FPS, but that's it and once you become familiar with the commands, things begin to flow without particular complications. The interaction with the surrounding environment relies on a robust physics engine, able to offer a good rendering of the behavior of the bodies present in the game. Some of the proposed puzzles are based precisely on the correct interpretation of the actions performed by moving the objects. A wooden plank placed like a swing on a suspended beam will need the right load to remain in a horizontal position and simultaneously maintain our weight during the passage. The art of silence During the first shootouts in which, willy-nilly, we end up getting involved, we discover other peculiarities of the game. A colored indicator placed in the center of the screen appears and disappears indicating the direction and proximity of the shots, more accurately simulating the senses of the protagonist. We also discover that CoJ does not want to offer us shootouts to the death, despite the well-fed army of enemies always ready to hunt us down for one reason or another. The Stealth component is soon felt, and it is easy to learn that in order not to succumb, you must first of all learn to hide, in an attempt to hit isolated and taken aback enemies. A well-placed kick or a sneaky punch can knock out an opponent more than a poorly fired gunshot. the Stealth component is soon felt, and it is easy to learn that in order not to succumb, you must first of all learn to hide, in an attempt to hit isolated and unaware enemies The sound of our footsteps and the sound of our shots do nothing but attract the enemy's attention and get us into a lot of trouble. Being able to collect the objects scattered around the map it is possible to transform a wooden chest into a weapon capable of trampling and stunning, a stone into a lethal headbreaker and an oil lamp into an incendiary grenade, excellent for flushing out hidden enemies. To further enhance the realism, the weapons have been made wearable: especially if used continuously, they can suffer damage due to overheating and leave the player defenseless in the middle of a shootout. Bullet time? Concentration! Those of you readers who remember Max Payne (come on, it hasn't been that long after...) can't have easily forgotten the ~bullet time~ effect, in turn inspired by the slow motion actions of theMatrix movie. This function made it possible to take advantage, in particular circumstances, of a special mode in which time was slowed down, however, allowing the player to move the viewfinder and shoot in real time, with the effect of hitting enemies before they could fire. Call of Juarez dusts off this concept in its own way by providing the mode of concentration. The protagonist can use this mode whenever he takes his weapons out of the holster. Suddenly time crystallizes, the view blurs and the crosshairs, which disappeared instantly, slowly appear on the edge of the screen; as they slowly approach the centre, we have time to make their position cross the trajectory of the enemy and fire, with an enormous time advantage. Among the weapons that we will have at our disposal there are also Indian bows and the whip with which Billy can hit enemies, move objects from a distance and cling to spurs and branches then using the leather string as a liana on which to swing. The controls are extremely intuitive, with the right mouse button we activate the object or weapon placed in the right hand, the same thing goes for the left button. Through the key used to activate the so-called ~concentration~ we discover another feature of the game. In fact, it is possible to zoom in on a target for greater shooting precision. In this case the view will be perfectly focused on the object under fire, leaving the rest of the field of vision blurred, exactly as happens in reality when you try to score by closing one eye and concentrating on the chosen target. The quality of the rendering of the characters and the workmanship of the textures used (remarkable those of the faces of the characters) find full realization in the graphics engine used in CoJ. The water and its transparency are handled excellently, as are the flames, which can be lit by the player and fed with the fuel from the lamps. Final comment It is necessary to spend the last words in an attempt to formulate a comment that can well frame the product we have analysed. Among the main defects that we have found is the control system, not always precise and difficult to manage subjectively. The physics engine, however well employed, leaves a little perplexed in the management of the fall of the ~severe complexes~; a crate abandoned or thrown over other crates struggles to behave in a completely natural way, rolling on itself until it reaches a state of rest and a fixed position. Furthermore, the control of the objects collected during the movements is not the most stable. In short, in the recent past of video games we have perhaps had more brilliant examples of physics management. Nonetheless, we don't feel like tearing down a game that still has several points on which an excellent gaming experience can be built. The ability to blend the style of FPS and Stealth reaches its fullest in the choice of the western setting. Realism harnesses the usual bravado of FPS forcing us to stealth more for reasons of the plot than the actual game. Those many typical elements of the imaginary of the old west, give the right atmosphere to a well-crafted setting also from a graphic point of view. There are many, many objects with which to interact (the possibility of setting fire to the paintings hanging on the wall and throwing them at enemies is spectacular). The realization of the natural elements, with an eye to the grass, made in a masterly way, close the list of amenities present. But what about the playability? Except for the initial difficulties related to the controls, everything goes smoothly, even in the management of hiding places (perhaps one of the most complicated aspects of the game, although it is recurring in the economy of the missions entrusted to us). The mixture of genres and the synergy of the many ideas collected here and there among the various titles of recent years will certainly not make CoJ a champion of originality, but we can certainly say that we are faced with a fun and enveloping product, which deserves for this a full promotion especially in the light of its highly competitive sale price. Pros The charm of the west is an excellent lever Respectable graphic design The game is varied and never monotonous Cons The use of the physics engine sometimes works against its own realistic intentions Not always intuitive controls Finally Call of Juarez For months the frequent rumors about Call of Juarez have divided critics and fans. Generally when there are such deep rifts in observer opinion one has to prepare for something from the vast pproportions, the catch is that you never know if it's positive or negative. Until the day you have the opportunity to try the full game, and make up your own mind. In an attempt to analyze CoJ we have taken into account the numerous aspects that this title touches by aiming for a single goal, to understand if and how much this game can make inroads into the hearts of players, snatching the actual possibilities of finding ourselves in front of an unborn best seller . For those who are only now tuned in, it is worth opening the article with a short introductory hat to better frame the title. CoJ offers itself to the public as a first-person adventure game with a western setting. The overriding elements of the game bring to mind FPS and stealth games. Nonetheless, both perhaps due to the chosen setting, which is certainly particular, and due to the willingness of the developers to stick to a realistic style, or perhaps just to make the title a little different from the closest relatives, CoJ does not present itself like a classic shooter, but like a reimagining of the genre that prefers thoughtfulness to recklessness in actions.", "date": "2006-09-26", "grade": null}
