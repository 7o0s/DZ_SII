The concept around which the entire game revolves lies in measuring the ~weight~ of the player's brain, a value that is established after having faced a series of mini-games divided into categories, which to be precise are: analysis, memory, algebra, intuition, perception. However, don't expect dozens and dozens of minigames, like some other similar titles; on the contrary, the count in Big Brain Academy unfortunately stops at 15, divided into 3 for each category. Not many to tell the truth, but evidently the choice was necessary to allow each game to be based on roughly the same evaluation criteria. Therefore, despite the fact that the available activities all appear in the eyes of the player from the first game, the variations of the same, the different levels of difficulty and the general good average quality allow this limit to be put in the background at least for some time. Hence, for example, we will be asked to count how many red and blue balls are thrown into a basket, to then say which ones are more numerous; or we will have to view the faces of some children on the screen, and then remember them later by indicating them among three similar images. Or it will be necessary to repeat a series of musical notes or objects in reverse, and again indicate the ~different~ scene among 4 almost identical ones, or pop balloons numbered from the lowest to the highest digit, and so on. Simple exercises therefore, all to be tackled with only the wiimote and limiting yourself to pressing the A button, but which in any case require some reflection and the greatest possible speed; yes because in the end not only the correctness of the answers are evaluated, but also the speed with which they were provided. And therefore improving, increasing the weight of one's brain and consequently the evaluation becomes a real challenge against oneself, and observing one's progress is a source of authentic satisfaction. The main modality, the exam, therefore requires you to face 10 exercises for each category in rapid sequence; but there is also the practice, with which to focus on a single test to thus also obtain a medal to keep in one's register. It should also be noted the integration offered with the Miis registered on the console, who become the ~students~ of the Academy; the results can then be sent to friends on your friend list via Connect 24, to compare them with each other. Party Boy Played in single, Big Brain Academy is therefore an appreciable product, but which sees its appeal fade too quickly; once the initial interest and the desire to discover its qualities have passed, the only stimulus arises from the desire to improve one's results, with the equivalent therefore in the best case scenario of occupying half an hour a day for this purpose. The hopes of therefore increasing the attractiveness of this Nintendo production can only fall on the multiplayer component; unfortunately, the potential offered by the concept has been little exploited by the programmers, who have created only one mode that allows the direct challenge between two friends at the same time, in a kind of race to the sound of exercises to be won by completing them in the shortest time. The other two modes see only one ~active~ player, in fact requiring the passage of the wiimote with the other companions (up to 8). A solution that takes away the rhythm and bite from the action, and in fact makes Big Brain Academy's multiplayer attractive for a fairly limited period. The technical aspect, as can be guessed, is certainly not one capable of making people cry out for a miracle, far from it; nevertheless the colorful style and the cartoonish trait of the drawing allow the title of the Kyoto house to appear pleasant and nice. 480p is also supported. The sound, rather minimalist, can also count on a series of sentences that come directly from the speaker of the wiimote; only in a game, however, this function represents an important component of the gameplay, while in the remaining part of the cases it is only a matter of brief incitements or indications regarding how many tests are missing to complete a session. The female voice of the Italian edition is unfortunately not much, too monotonous if not irritating. Comment Big Brain Academy for Wii is a product that is based on an interesting and challenging concept, but which puts too little meat on the fire to stand the test of time. In the face of a single-player mode that shows all of itself within an hour of play, a multiplayer component developed with a bit of reluctance should also be noted. However, Nintendo had the honesty to set the sale price at around 30 euros, a factor that is anything but dthe second floor and which makes Big Brain Academy a purchase that lovers of the genre can take into consideration, while keeping its limitations well in mind. Pros Fun tasks Stimulating, at least at the beginning Budget price Cons Few irons Multiplayer can be improved Reduced longevity The debut of the Big Brain Academy series, as many will know, can be traced back to about a year ago on Nintendo DS; perfectly at home in the Touch! Generation, the title developed by the same big N, however, struggled to find light in the genre of ~brain developers~, overshadowed by the enormous success of Brain Training and penalized by a lower advertising push. All this despite the fact that the two products were actually quite different in content. Now on Wii, in the (temporary?) absence of the awkward antagonist, Big Brain Academy tries its luck again by bravely holding the remote...", "date": "2007-08-01", "grade": null}
