{"name": "Driv3r - Review PS2/Xbox", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/driv3r-review-ps2xbox.html", "text": "These are the circumstances in which we realize that we are a bit like a dinosaur: an ancient and savage, and perhaps even despotic, beast of an era now closed in a semi-armored drawer. That is, when a video game awakens memories linked to those TV series in your mind that, ultimately, you carry with you as Linus did with his precious blanket. And so off, once again, to roam the streets of San Francisco by identifying with the then very young Michael Douglas; or reassemble on Magnum's Ferrari with a necklace of flowers around the neck; or even go back to being a guardian angel of Charlie... Well, maybe the latter not. Side effects deriving from too much TV and as many video games now on the back, the same symptoms that Reflections Interactive tickles in more than one circumstance with its new effort: Driv3r. We have waited a lot, too long for this official sequel to a game, which has reached the third chapter, which in the last generation managed to exalt the palates of critics and the public. After the magnificence of the first episode and the pinch of disappointment derived from the second, we therefore come to the turning point: when Driver meets the new generation. PS2 vs. Xbox. Fight! Having been able to test both console versions, we can certainly assert that the differences between the two are small. The control system favors the Microsoft home console in the car sections, above all by virtue of those triggers that are always very comfortable for any sort of racing game. On the other hand, Ps2 earns some points for the sections on foot, precisely due to the fact that the backbones of the Sony pad have less travel and are therefore more immediate for shootings or any action without a car. From the graphic side we notice a slightly more solid graphic engine in the Xbox version, without frame drops in the vicinity of explosions, which the Ps2 counterpart is afflicted with instead. Nothing else to report, however, if not these fussiness that certainly do not change the fate of the game on any platform it runs. Over and out. Excuse me sir officer, I just made a U-turn on a one way street. Why fine me? Driv3r fishes out of the pond of the previous episodes all the features that raised it to a higher quality level than its roadmates. In this new ludo-police incarnation, however, the gentlemen of Reflections Interactive wanted to go beyond the mere sequel with a high-sounding name, accompanying the 'on the road' mode with authentic sections on foot. In a remarkably rigid mission structure, our burdens will therefore vary from the most canonical of car chases to shootings of all sorts. There will also be more particular levels such as, for example, the second set in Nice. Nothing but a playful reinterpretation of the famous film with Mr. Cage Gone in 60 seconds, in which it will be necessary to go far and wide through the splendid French town in an attempt to steal a certain number of cars in a given period of time. Unfortunately, the lack of attention on the part of the coders partially nullifies the result of the more appetizing missions, which will in any case be in the minority compared to the flat levels, some, others absurd, which distinguish this third appointment with Driver. Drawing again the mission taken as an example, we see how concept and level design above the standard of the game are thwarted by some rather gross defaults. Indeed, the realization of the objective of this will consist in having to park the stolen cars in the trailer of a moving truck. At this point the problem arises. In other words, the excessive difficulty of getting the car into the 'beast' without any kind of help, considering the limited time needed to carry out the various thefts, added to having to go and fish out the truck every time the consequent frustration of starting over every time. Because in addition to venial errors like this one, and there are many others anyway, there are also purely conceptual errors. The so-called trial & error helps to clip the wings of a game with more problems than solutions, fortunately that from time to time some check point manages to lighten the load. Basically each mission will have to be repeated several times in order to memorize each crucial point in order to then be able to pass it, thus relying on a now outdated game mechanic. The so-called trial & error helps clip the wings of a game with more problems than solutions Anyone who has ever had the good fortune to come across the first Driver knows how fun, exciting and rewarding chases are. In this third episode of the saga, the raids are no less, especially if we consider the high AI of the cars and the vastness of thethe cities that will be the backdrop for our handbrakes. If in the first case we will have against such competitive cars as to modify the itineraries according to our moves, unfortunately the aforementioned backgrounds are as big as they are desolate. Seeing Miami reduced to post-nuclear-style traffic is, in fact, a little sad. However, nothing compared to the sections on foot, which prove to be a real cross for Reflections Interactive. Tanner without a car is like a fish out of water: few diversions available, so many problems in executing any movement and, consequently, also an aiming precision that goes to butterflies. It is of little use to set the automatic aim in the options menu, if not to sweeten a really too bitter pill. Pill that becomes even worse considering the AI of the henchmen who will stand between us and the end of each mission. Yes, the same artificial intelligence we sang the deeds above, in the sections without a machine it borders on semi-absolute zero. The enemies will do nothing but stand in front of us and then riddle us with shots squandering magazines after magazines, without the slightest reaction to our moves and without even following pre-established attack patterns. Furthermore, in 99% of cases, stealing a car from any individual will see a total non-reaction: the driver simply abandons the vehicle and goes away. Clearly more positive signals as regards the construction of the means of transport, which for the number of polygons, variety and physics applied to them is more than satisfactory. Indeed, we will be able to drive any vehicle with two or more wheels, but also aquatic boats; the level of detail settles on good standards, as well as the execution of the damages. Even the game environments enjoy a fairly faithful and detailed reproduction, even if, as mentioned above, the vastness has an impact on their population as well as on the graphics engine itself. We will have quite frequent drops in frame rate, and even more frequent will be the cases of decidedly annoying and harmful pop-ups. Presence of aliasing and animations of the characters to be reviewed negatively stuff a graphic sector all in all without infamy and without praise. Sound instead to be commended, and for a soundtrack composed of always relevant and catchy motifs, and for a dubbing in Italian that does no great damage. Just a note. English voice acting by a cast of professional actors such as Ving Rhames, Michelle Rodriguez, Michael Madsen and Mickey Rourke. In the Italian one? Federico Fontana. It is of little use to set the automatic aim in the options menu, if not to sweeten a really too bitter pill. Comment The stride longer than the leg. That's what it's about. Reflections Interactive was probably forced to push an obviously incomplete product onto the shelves, especially as regards the debugging phase. They had made certain promises and, in a sense, they kept them. This only partially honors them, because the result, which is what counts, is unfortunately disappointing. We were waiting for a new Driver with the attributes and instead it is a step back from the previous chapters of the series. The sections in the car are always fun, and it is from this that the English software house has to start again. Driv3r is a game with too many flaws but which manages, despite everything, to snatch a few hours of fun -provided you drive and not walk- and some emotion mostly given by exceptionally made computer graphics movies. A game therefore suitable for those who devour the genre and are never satisfied with it. Those who have never appreciated it will certainly not start from here. Pros: Great FMVs. Always fun car missions. Great variety of means. Cons: Absolutely insufficient walking section. Graphical issues directly affecting the gameplay. Level design not always inspired. Sometimes frustrating. Fell on black days Once again in the role of the shrewish Tanner we will set off on an adventure all bullets and blood, the ideal condition for our hero of the moment. Reflections Interactive has concentrated a lot of efforts to set up a direction worthy of the name and decidedly spectacular FMVs, all to absorb the player as much as possible in the context of its new production. It starts from the end as in the most recent author productions, and then returns to the dawn of the first crime with a flashback in perfect style. The result is undoubtedly excellent, and fully fills the absence of a solid and effective plot. The trigger-happy policeman will then have to improvise once again as a criminal, in order to join a gang led by a woman as beautiful as she is unscrupulous. Calita, that's the name of the femme fatale, will bring us oltking who on the margins of the law, also to visit three beautiful cities that will thus form a well-defined triangle of intrigues, uses and customs. We will be tossed between three countries at the antipodes of each other: Miami, Nice and Istanbul. We were talking about habits and customs, and in fact the softco of Newcastle has done its utmost in an attempt to faithfully reproduce every peculiarity of the aforementioned towns. The same cars will undergo substantial variations according to the location, complete with a sort of R5 in French territory. Given, in fact, the possibility of razing any type of vehicle to the ground, these will not be under license but as similar as possible to the real counterparts.", "date": "2004-06-29", "grade": null}
