It is a testimony and a warning that should not be underestimated and that Coffee Yao and the RedCandle developers wanted to package in the form of a video game, i.e. a means of communication capable of reaching a large and young audience. We have already reviewed the game in its PC version but let's talk about it again on the occasion of the release on Switch both to evaluate the quality of the adaptation, being originally a point and click adventure transported to the console environment, and to underline the importance of this little pearl that would risk ending up neglected in the indie tide that has hit the Nintendo console. To understand precisely the context in which the story takes place, you will easily find yourself looking for information on the ~White Terror~ and the period of martial law in Taiwan, learning a twist of history that in our parts is probably not treated much but that is of enormous interest. Even if only to be a spring capable of triggering this curiosity, Detention is a precious title, whose value goes beyond its purely videogame aspects, which to tell the truth are not even without flaws. At the end of the 1940s, Taiwan essentially became a hostage of the Kuomintang, the Chinese nationalist party which, having lost the battle with Mao Tse-Tung, retreated to the island and founded the Republic of China in stark contrast to the People's Republic of China. From then on, Taiwan becomes a sort of reality suspended between worlds, held together by almost forty years of martial law during which an incalculable amount of crimes have been committed against civilians. On this historical basis, which remains only apparently in the background, an introspective story is grafted and focused on the sense of guilt and the need to face the reality that still has an indissoluble double bond with the context in which it is inserted. An almost normal life We are in the 60s and Wei and Ray are two high school students. The regime extends its shadow over every aspect of life, but the two boys lead a more or less normal existence (as far as it can be in a context of this kind) punctuated by what appear to be the usual daily worries of two young people living most of their day at school. This until a violent typhoon arrives which forces the two to remain isolated inside the building, where events take an unexpected turn. Between the corridors and the empty classrooms, the cracks of a normality that is only a facade emerge, while the horror creeps into the places taking different forms, starting from the clichs of the genre but arriving in rather new territories for horror video games, which we can illustrate in detail so as not to spoil the whole experience, being based on the discovery of history. There is the usual endowment of ghosts and classic presences of oriental horror, which refers to the local tradition between legends, mythology and folklore, but they are mostly representations chosen to convey the real unease at the base of the plot, which has much more concrete foundations and it becomes increasingly terrifying the closer it gets to what is familiar and normal for protagonist Ray. The horror of Detention digs deeper than it might seem at first, also exploiting the code established by the genre but telling in its own way a narrative that is intimate and introspective but also full of references to the historical and socio-political context that the developers evidently wanted to bring out and spread their work with this. In this sense it is an almost unique experience, avoiding excessive hermeticism and on the other hand without falling into the caption when illustrating the surrounding scenery. And always in this sense it is also an important game, because it tells us a terrible historical truth by letting us experience it firsthand, in a way that would be impossible for other means of communication and without renouncing a videogame-form that nonetheless has elements of interest even as an adventure. An atypical adventure Detention falls within the genre of graphic adventures, even if it is a rather atypical declination with survival horror influences: with the action being framed laterally on a 2D plane, the game mechanics are obviously limited and this involves simple management of the encounters with monsters, which result in some basic ~stealth~ techniques. On the other hand, the strong narrative system and the low density of puzzles compared to standard graphic adventures almost lean towards a definition of walking simulator ibrido, something similar to Lone Survivor, to stay on the horror theme, with which Detention also shares the general approach. It is clear that the developers started from the narrative component to then build the game around it and the weakest part of the whole experience is in fact the purely playful element. There are creative and challenging puzzles, but in general it is difficult to find real challenges during the 4 hours or so required to complete the game, which flows away pleasantly (so to speak, considering the topics covered) thanks to its widespread narration and pressing. The sense of mystery remains throughout the first part and is played on a long-lasting twist, revealing the nature of the horrors in a final section that becomes more explicit, transferring the anxieties from a metaphysical level to a more concrete one but still maintaining high voltage. The Switch conversion works really well: although the original made heavy use of the mouse, the 2D scrolling setting made it easier to transition onto the console controls, which are very functional in terms of simply moving between locations and encounters with creatures but also in puzzles. The puzzles are obviously designed for the mouse and on Switch we find ourselves with the pointer to be controlled with the analog, but the solution does not disturb, also due to the obviously staid rhythm of these sections. Unfortunately, since there is no official translation (the one on PC derives from an amateur work), the Switch version does not have the Italian language and is therefore playable in English.", "date": "2018-03-09", "grade": "9.0"}
