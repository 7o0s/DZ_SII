Little, very little, as long as we are not referring to the version for the newcomer at Sony, which prompted us to return to the dusty tracks of the Kylotonn game to write down a new review of WRC 9 on PS5. Although the official simulator of the World Rally Championship is essentially the same, the developers have been clever enough to fully support the new DualSense with all its innovative feedback, in order to considerably improve the gaming experience and keep people talking about the product. . But let's start from the beginning... WRC 9 is not a revolutionary chapter, but we can't even blame it since like all sports titles it is forced to tell a ghost season, indelibly marked by the Covid-19 emergency. It was thus decided to work to perfect, rather than to distort, developing a game that will surely make those who expected more tangible news turn up their noses, while still keeping the attention of those looking for a rally game high It's been a long time since I bought one. After all, the choice of those who want to try similar experiences is not exactly difficult, given that at the moment there are two rally dims worthy of the name: the super simulative Dirt Rally 2.0 by Codemasters and the friendlier, but not so permissive, WRC. Considering that Dirt Rally requires a steering wheel for its most authoritative challenges, preferring the Kylotonn game for many is actually an obligatory choice. Reverse Although they are not masterpieces, WRC9 and its less distant predecessors have been able to build a very interesting driving model, in certain situations such as on asphalt, even better than its direct competitor. A result achieved without overdoing it, thus avoiding making the driving experience too elitist, but always and in any case for everyone. Even graphically, but very slowly, the WRC series has been able to improve over time, although in recent years it has lost some polish due to a graphics engine that shows more and more the weight of time. Furthermore, on PC it has never been a champion in terms of optimization, a feature that has paid off several times with votes lower than the average ones assigned to the console versions. Was it better with the new consoles? Nextgen Rally The PlayStation 5 version immediately shines in fluidity and video cleanliness. The 60 frames per second are seen on the screen and felt in the controls, while the image is crystal clear as never before, even better than it is possible to achieve with the same game on high-end computers. Naturally, it is still a port and not one of the miraculous ones: despite everything, WRC 9 for Ps5 is still WRC 9, with a number of details on the screen that are not exactly exciting, rather basic atmospheric effects, a rendering of the bodies of water that we can even define poor and modeling of the cars little more than sufficient. The sound, discreet in the effects, is instead practically identical to the previous versions. But despite its limitations, WRC 9 still conveys good sensations. The only thing that really doesn't go down, also present in the previous chapter, is this strange transparency effect of the windshield that mixes the shadows and certain details bringing out strange artifacts, completely absent when driving with the views outside the cockpit . For some it may be a minor flaw, but despite our love of the cockpit view, to avoid distractions we still decided to play with the camera on the bonnet. DualSense effect The real protagonist of this new version of WRC 9 for PlayStation 5 is undoubtedly the DualSense. That Kylotonn is not only the first driving game to take advantage of the innovations introduced by Sony in the new pad, but also the one that after the demonstrations of Astro's Playroom exploits it the most. Yes, even more than Demon's Souls, Spider-Man Miles Morales and Sackboy which are games produced by Sony itself. From this point of view, the work done is truly amazing, and manages to provide the game with an additional layer of fun, making this version unique in all respects. The functions of the pad in fact manage to reproduce three different feedbacks, and also quite well: it is possible to perceive the road surface, the state and the oddities of the gearbox, and finally to transmit the effort of the brake and the audacity of the acceleration to a great extent. These are not standard effects, but change according to the characteristics of the chosen car and its condition. Feel, for example, the brake hardening in the most extreme braking, or the jump of the gearbox when choosing onenew gear helps to communicate with the vehicle in a way never seen before, not even thanks to the powerful vibrations of the best steering wheel around.", "date": "2020-11-18", "grade": "7.8"}
