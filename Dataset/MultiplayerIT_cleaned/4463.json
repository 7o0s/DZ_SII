Many have also had commercial outlets. Just think of Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em and X-Man for Atari 2600, or the more famous and controversial Custer's Revenge, always for the same platform. Although they evidently aimed to sell for their pornographic content, they were all finished games, of a quality no less than that of productions with content for everyone. Let's say that in general there have always been developers who, for money or for fun, have delighted in creating more or less explicit works. Some of these have also made the history of video games (think of the Larry series or the older and anecdotal Softporn Adventure), while others have become the unspeakable secrets of the first gamers (we were stimulated with little). The point therefore is not that Milky Boobs has dubious contents, but that it has found a commercial outlet, despite being little more than a programming exercise gone very badly. To say, once the developers would have taken what they did and would have distributed it for free through some underground channel to have a laugh with the community, also because no one would ever publish it to them. Then they would go on to develop something else, or rather they would change jobs. Today Milky Boobs can afford, in the state in which it is, to appear in the largest and most prestigious digital video game store in the world, without anyone having anything to complain about. What sane baker would sell moldy yeast as bread? The system around Milky Boobs The game itself is disarmingly banal: it's a first-person shooter where you have to cool the hot spirits of a bunch of girls in bathing suits by spraying them with milky white (as a refined allegory). The substance is that you go around the two levels of which the game is currently composed, smearing with white liquid some ugly 3D models taken from some stock site, or made with some tool for a few euros, also equipped with an intelligence embarrassing artificial that leads them to run at us like zombies and get stuck everywhere. The challenge is obviously nil, just as the collision system is null and void: the gameplay is full of successful hits that do not produce any tangible effect and others that go amiss that cause real massacres... not to mention talk about those blocked by imaginary obstacles. How long does this wonder last? If you put in the effort you can see everything it has to offer in just over ten minutes. The two maps currently available do not have any particular graphics or level design. The fact that this pile of junk is still in Early Access is no excuse, because you only need a little experience with game development to understand that it's not going anywhere. Perhaps the promised two additional levels will be released sooner or later, but we don't think that, apart from extending the agony by ten minutes, they can do much in terms of quality. In short, we are faced with a kind of Big Rigs with boobs: a disaster that has no reason to exist. The problem is, this disaster is for sale. We did not mention Big Rigs by chance: at the time it caused a sensation that an incomplete product had managed to arrive in stores. It was a single case, but it became anecdotal. Today it is probable that what is proverbially considered one of the worst video games ever, would not only be able to arrive in some digital store without too many scandals, but would blend in with its peers. Many wonder where the problem is in having an online store full of junk that doesn't control what it sells. We are in the digital world, so there is room for everyone: obviously yes, but imagine entering a shop and finding yourself in front of shelves, from which you once took products, now full of excrement. The most obvious reaction is to go elsewhere, even if there may still be products there that interest you. You'll probably end up buying those products whose homes have enough money to afford a nicer shelf that doesn't push you away sensorially. Here, like it or not, this is happening on Steam and the data of 2017 have amply demonstrated it: the exponential increase in the offer of indies, characterized by a very low average quality, has polarized the attention of users towards the biggest productions, that is, those who can afford to spend on marketing by conquering the most important exhibition spaces. Of base the junk oversupply seems to have taken away from many the curiosity and desire to search and experiment, which is exactly what happened in the various App Stores and Google Play, where everyone can publish everything and the games that earn money are now only those who invest more in marketing than in development. The problem with Milky Boobs, therefore, is not that it is a disaster (you wouldn't have bought it regardless of our review), but that it is part of a system that is damaging an entire sector, that of independent developers. Simply, a title like Milky Boobs had to be denied access to any digital store. Add a thousand Milky Boobs and you have chaos. If we are here to talk about it, therefore, it is because Milky Boobs is part of a phenomenon that goes beyond the single video game and which is getting bigger day by day, doing enormous damage.", "date": "2018-01-15", "grade": "1.0"}
