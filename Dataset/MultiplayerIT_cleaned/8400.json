{"name": "Phantom Breaker: Omnia", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/phantom-breaker-omnia-recensione.html", "text": "For relatively unknown small publishers it is certainly not easy to make their way through the thick forest of the gaming market, especially in an era where gaming is more widespread than ever and prestigious releases arrive in such numbers as to eclipse even some of the most recognizable triple A To stand out in a similar situation, the applicable strategies can be counted on the fingers of one hand, so much so that it is often more sensible to avoid the main battlefield directly, focusing on more niche markets. This must therefore have been the idea of the publisher we are talking about today, because Rocket Panda Games not only chose to jump into the fray with a fighting game - a genre that is already hardly mass-produced, except in rare cases - but they even decided to do so by bringing life a classic from almost a decade ago that never made it to the West (except for a spinoff beat 'em up called Battle Grounds). Convinced of the goodness of the product, however, they didn't limit themselves to a remaster of its latest version, but they saw fit to dedicate themselves to a re-edition called Phantom Breaker: Omnia, rebalanced and with a handful of additional contents. We tried it, to understand whether or not this almost unknown brand has the potential to stand out in a genre already chock-full of excellent titles. Of course, you'll find our detailed answer in today's Phantom Breaker: Omnia review. Narrative and content: visual novel uber alles Phantom Breaker Omnia: The Omnia Style seemed a little too simplified for our tastes Curiously, considering how often this element is ignored in fighting games, Phantom Breaker: Omnia contains a decent sea of text, divided into a multi-chapter campaign. For heaven's sake, it's not some kind of epic narrative: the basis is literally a battle between teenagers that began due to a mysterious individual named Phantom, who grants them enormous powers through artifacts capable of altering space-time. Structurally, however, everything differs from the basic story modes seen in other exponents of the genre and more closely resembles the approach seen in works such as Blazblue, in some ways similar to playable visual novels. We didn't find the narrative very inspired or brilliant, really, but it's at least refreshing to see some effort from the developers - Gameloop and MAGES, to be exact - in an effort to create a decently crafted universe. It is therefore strange that this rather well-finished main campaign is not accompanied by other level contents, given that the alternative modes in Phantom Breaker Omnia seemed meager to say the least  Two characters from Phantom Breaker: Omnia The game literally only has Arcade Mode, Survival (called Infinite Battle), Score Mode and Time Attack as solo options, and even lacks any character challenges or tutorials. The mechanics of the game are then explained through static screens full of text, a system that certainly does not greatly favor the gradual digestion of systems. And ok, Phantom Breaker: Omnia has such an ease of execution that it is still quite accessible, but we are of the opinion that the total absence of two similar options still remains a not indifferent oversight, given the progress made by other exponents of the genre. For online lovers it's not much better, and you have to deal with the usual lobby system with ranked and player matches: absolutely nothing new under the sun. The roster, at least, is quite large, with twenty different fighters to choose from. Apart from L and M (yes, those are their names), which in effect are recolors with partially diversified moves, the choices offered by Omnia all seemed quite unique and inspired to us. The developers also claim to have partially rebalanced the title, only that since we don't have terms of comparison with the original, we sincerely have no way of knowing to what extent it has been retouched (not to mention that, as usual, it is almost impossible to accurately evaluate balancing a fighting game before launching). Gameplay: a thousand systems, easy easy Phantom Breaker Omnia: Ren is a simple man. A man with his fists in his hands The most distinctive element of Phantom Breaker Omnia is in all probability its atypical mix between complex systems and incredibly basic inputs, executable even by those who have never picked up a fighting game. Seriously, executing special moves in this game is tied to simple directions linked to a specific key (a la Super Smash Bros. or Granblue Fantasy Versus to explain it in the simplest way possible), and the combinations of hits are respectively aautomated, or extraordinarily easy to execute (the system is that of many anime fighters, with light attacks that are chained without too many problems to medium and heavy ones). However, when you analyze the mechanics on which everything is based, things start to become seriously intricate : Omnia contains systems seen in other fighting games, and re-proposed here to offer a myriad of offensive and defensive options to the player, starting for example with three styles available to each fighter with lots of exclusive mechanics for each one. To understand, in the original Phantom Breaker there were only two styles available, Quick and Heavy, while in the new incarnation an Omnia style was added, apparently designed for beginners; however, each choice has rather unique characteristics, which vary the approach to combat enormously. Phantom Breaker Omnia: Quick style vs. Heavy style, who will win? Those who love bursts of attacks and high speed, for example, will be able to throw themselves without hesitation on the Quick style, which not only offers the possibility of exploiting the burst bar (the equivalent of the focus or the super bar in this game) to speed up enormously own strikes or cancel normally uninterruptible moves, but also instant dodges in defense, autocombo, double jump and an interruption of opponent combinations. Those who want to focus on greater power with an emphasis on defensive precision can instead focus on the Heavy style, which allows you to perform perfect parries, enter an enhanced mode complete with temporary armor, and delay jump landings. The Omnia style from for its part it is a sort of mix between the two described above: it maintains various characteristics of the Quick, but instead of the normal super it offers a doubled burst bar, increased autocombos, a special homing attack when it is filled, and eliminates part of the other advanced maneuvers (such as overdrives for the ~boosted~ modes described above). In all honesty we found it a bit redundant compared to the other two, but it could be a welcome addition for those who can't figure out the additional mechanics of the other two styles. Overall? The gameplay is promoted. With this number of possibilities brought to the table, the fights are fast-paced and hilarious, and there is absolutely no shortage of spectacular moments. Indeed, they are too many because, if we want to find a weak point in the system, the only element that can really be criticized in our opinion is the finesse of the individual mechanics described above. The work of MAGES and Gameloop is in fact elaborate, but not very refined: the response windows of defensive maneuvers are sometimes too relaxed and this - combined with a general rhythm that recalls that of Melty Blood, but seems to be slowed down to be more readable by the player - can make some encounters more chaotic and random than intended. There is also a certain emphasis on ~clash~ - linked to specials with counter qualities - which, while being able to give life to sensational moments, only increase the general frenzy of the offensive when they lead to the activation of a certain tension bar (and to the significant increase in the damage of some maneuvers). In short, perhaps we are not faced with the most mathematically perfect and meticulously designed combat system in existence, yet far from us not to consider Omnia a valuable fighting game: it is still remarkable, and it is nice to see arrive on our shores after a long time. Technical sector and netcode: this is where the Phantom falls Phantom Breaker Omnia: Special Moves are easy to perform, but have multiple variations. Sadly, we cannot repeat the praise for the systems even when we move on to the technical sector, because, despite a clearly improved resolution and several tweaks to the graphics, Phantom Breaker: Omnia remains an outdated game that leaves much to be desired both from the point of view of the pure glance than from the artistic one. A pity: mechanically, the roster certainly does not lack personality, but it is really difficult for someone to stand out aesthetically among the available choices. The presence of a couple of ~guests~, such as Kurisu from Steins;Gate, is certainly not enough to shuffle the cards enough. The arenas, that wasn't enough, are equally uninspired, and apart from a couple of exceptions they are very bland. The graphics, in any case, can be safely overlooked. What really worries is the netcode, as Phantom Breaker Omnia sadly doesn't use rollback. To explain it in a very simplified way once again: the rollback netcode is a modern netcode that eliminates the typical delay of the classic delay netcode by ~predicting~ the players' moves and rewinding in imperceptible times what actually happens on the screenor. Nowadays, with the changes related to the pandemic and the sharp increase in importance of the online experience, it is practically a must for any fighting game that wants to survive for a long time, and Omnia seems to have completely ignored this. : We used almost ten years old source code to create the game, and it seems like they couldn't implement it for that reason... however we've seen stable rollbacks applied to much older games and to be honest, in this era of the genre we believe it should be a top priority, especially after some of the most important games of its type have finally embraced such technology (Guilty Gear Strive and Mortal Kombat teach). Unfortunately, we didn't have the opportunity to properly test the stability of Omnia's netcode delay during the review phase (there were very few players on the net); we fear however that it is not the case to expect miracles in this aspect.", "date": "2022-03-14", "grade": "7.0"}
