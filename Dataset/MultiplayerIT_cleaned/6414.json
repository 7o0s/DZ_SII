{"name": "Albedo", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/148354-albedo-eyes-from-outer-space-occhio-allalieno.html", "text": "Albedo begins with the most classic of accidents in a highly secret scientific laboratory called Jupiter, where strange space-time experiments are carried out. The protagonist, a rough guardian who in some respects recalls Duke Nukem (but the comparisons end there) wakes up in a basement after a few hours of unconsciousness and discovers against his will that a kind of alien invasion is underway. The atmosphere is great His employers probably didn't tell him all about the nature of the lab. His goal is to escape and understand what happened, improvising a hero in spite of himself. Despite the muscles, his main weapon will be ingenuity. Yes, Albedo: Eyes from Outer Space is basically a graphic adventure, although some images can be misleading. The player will therefore not have to go around the laboratory to shoot enemies with ever bigger weapons, but will have to explore the environment, look for objects, collect them and use them as needed. The game is structured in self-contained rooms, i.e. you reach an environment and solve all the puzzles before moving on to the next one. Only later in the adventure will more complex situations occur, with different variations to the formula, which will require you to return to rooms you have already visited or which will allow you to explore larger and more dangerous environments. The action scenes will also become more present. In reality, the first alien kills himself with his fists as soon as he exits the first room and even during the adventure phases it happens that he has to deal with small creatures that can be eliminated with makeshift tools. However, the further you go, the more you will have adequate defense tools, with dedicated FPS-like moments. Despite this there will never be a complete drift towards action and the adventure part will always remain predominant. So expect to find secret codes and combine items to the end. Interview with Fabrizio Zagaglia We had the opportunity to interview Fabrizio Zagaglia, author of Albedo. Here are his answers! Hi Fabrizio, can you tell us where Albedo comes from? What inspired you to make it? Albedo is a sort of evolution of a project born 15 years ago: ~Longy~, this was the name of the game (and of the protagonist of Albedo), it was a simple 2D game, created for 3/4 with The Games Factory which with Albedo shared protagonists, monsters, setting and the basic mechanics. At that time I was certainly very influenced by the recent Half Life, but also by many classics of the previous decade (Monkey Island, DooM and so on) and consequently these titles were also a source of inspiration for Albedo. As for the mood, however, you can find references to 60s sci-fi films and TV series such as Star Trek. Technique or design? Was Albedo born as a way to test your technical knowledge or as a narrative project for which you then started looking for ways to develop? I would say more the first: in the sense that the idea, the lore and the gameplay, albeit a bit vague, were already present in Longy and in the following prototypes, while the last one (now Albedo), made in Unity, had started mostly to experiment and test what I had learned about the tool in question, on a personal project... and reviving the old Longy seemed to me the most natural choice. Can you tell us some anecdotes about the development? Hum, so offhand I don't remember anything in particular... but I want to remind you that although I carried out the project mainly on my own, various friends and colleagues supported me in the production of content: for example Francesco Aloisi and Danilo Egizio they helped me producing graphic assets, Max di Fraia composing the soundtrack, Ivan Venturi producing and so on (without forgetting translations, dubbing and marketing). Without their help, Albedo probably wouldn't have come out for another four years! What advantages did you get from direct contact with the players? Was Steam Early Access helpful? From the point of view of the feedback on the difficulty balance, suggestions and bug reports has been very useful. And then it helped to create a bit of community and fan base (so much so that the localization of some languages was kindly made by the users of the game). What plans for the future? Good question! Certainly a lot will depend, data in hand, on the results of Albedo. Based on these I will evaluate ~what to do when I grow up~. Riddles what a passion But let's take a concrete example of how puzzles work. After opening a door with a fingerprint scanner, you find yourself in a large room with an alien beast inside that cannot be eliminated with the weapons and tools currently available. One of the puzzles What to do? The game suggests usmanages to throw him something to eat. By doing so, the alien will be distracted for a few moments by the proud meal, but will soon return to the fray. We just have to find some snacks to give him at regular intervals to buy time. We find some large slugs, which fortunately are happy to be grabbed and thrown at the monster. While the creature eats, we can explore the area and find a work hat with a spotlight on it. Unfortunately the battery is empty. Luckily we have a radio, quite useless in itself, but certainly equipped with charged batteries. Before taking them, however, you have to move the alien mass that covers their housing. The batteries obtained, we can revive and put on the work hat, which we will need to light up in the following environments, otherwise immersed in darkness. By now you should have figured out what kinds of puzzles Albedo offers. There is no shortage of codes to find and real puzzles to solve, some complex enough to pleasantly rack the player's brains. For example, in a juncture it is necessary to rebuild a pipe to make the water flow up to a conduit where there is an otherwise unreachable essential object. The problem is that the pipes are intertwined with other pipes and, therefore, the undertaking is not as easy as it seemed at a superficial glance. We have reviewed Albedo: Eyes from Outer Space, an all-Italian sci-fi adventure 50's interface Albedo's interface is quite cumbersome. In normal game situations it doesn't pose any real problems, as it is quite simple to master, although every action often requires more than a few clicks. The idea behind it is certainly that of replicating the classic graphic adventure interfaces in a more modern way, in which all the actions were performed by the player. There are also action sequences, but don't be fooled: it's a classic adventure In this way there are more possibilities of interaction with the scenario and the adventure part is certainly richer than the current average of the genre. It's not for nothing that old adventurers like us were delighted to have icons to do just about everything... except in a few situations. There are times when the game requires us to be quick. For example, in one phase you have to unlock a mechanism positioned underwater, with very little time available. Despite some extra moments that can be obtained if a certain action has been performed in a previous phase, it is enormously difficult to be as fast as one would like. Not bad, given that we are talking about rare moments and that, in general, once you have practiced with the icon system, you go on without major problems, but it is undeniable that they are moments that stand out. Another of Albedo's features that most amazed us is the graphic style. Presented as a 1950s/60s B-movie, it offers a remarkable visual richness, with beautifully done 3D models of the aliens and a clever use of lighting, which creates a surreal atmosphere throughout the game. Atmosphere also guaranteed by some gimmicks such as the interface of the crank options or by the insertion of some elements apparently alien to the context (do you get the joke?), such as the flying goldfish that populate one of the rooms for a few moments. In general, an excellent job has been done on the scenography and on the surrounding elements. The narrative part, on the other hand, is less incisive, with the plot appearing to be a mere canvas, useful only for proposing all the typical clichs of the setting and for creating amusing comedy situations.", "date": "2015-04-15", "grade": "8.5"}
