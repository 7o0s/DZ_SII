{"name": "No Man's Sky", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/no-mans-sky-recensione-nintendo-switch.html", "text": "In six years we have dedicated a myriad of articles to No Man's Sky, following its amazing evolution step by step. Through these writings, as well as in various video contributions, we have repeatedly recalled its controversial origins, drawn up countless lists of advice for old and new travellers, reprimanded live those who tried to kill the project without giving it a sacrosanct penultimate chance and, when we considered it necessary, we criticized the less opportune changes made to its game formula. But just as we began to think that there was nothing more to say about this game, here it is evolving again: in conjunction with the new and at times revolutionary version 4.0, No Man's Sky also arrives on Nintendo Switch. A miraculous port? No Man's Sky: Six years of ready-to-play content, now on the go Having seen it run quite well on the Steam Deck partially limits the sense of amazement of this new official version for Switch which, despite a less sparkling graphic aspect, can at least count on a more stable frame rate. On the Nintendo console, No Man's Sky runs at 1280x720 in handheld mode and 1600x900 when docked; in both cases the game aims for 30 FPS and maintains it just fine for a good part of the time. As expected, the game suffers most noticeably in outposts and when we get carried away with building bases too complex for the Switch hardware. Veterans will have to agree to build less, if they want to safeguard the fluidity of the gameplay; if this is not so important for you, know that even on Switch it is possible to disable the limit of pieces imposed by the game, here more stringent, allowing you to build everything you have imagined until the total collapse of performance. On Switch the game has less detail than on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions - certainly not the best of anti-aliasing - and the pop-in problems that have always been present in No Man's Sky are more pronounced here than ever. If you are looking for graphic dignity, it is better to avoid the television version. It is in its portable counterpart, thanks above all to the small screen of the console that knows how to hide the shortcomings by letting the colors vibrate to the fullest, that No Man's Sky for Nintendo Switch gives its best. Literally having the procedural and virtually infinite universe of the Hello Games title in your hands is a truly unique emotion, after all, a portable game of this magnitude has simply never been seen before. And as with The Witcher 3, at some point who cares about resolution and texture quality if the experience is any good. For a user with only the Nintendo console at their disposal, this No Man's Sky will not only be fine, but it will be the best No Man's Sky possible. Waypoints No Man's Sky: The new features introduced in the Waypoint update overhaul several aspects of the gameplay From a certain point of view it really is, the best possible. A few hours after the debut of the Switch version, the new patch that brought the game to its 4.0 version has arrived. While not focusing on new game mechanics, the No Man's Sky Waypoint update introduces small and large changes that mainly affect the balance of difficulty and equipment. Now travelers will have access to larger inventories, but there will be fewer technologies that they can simultaneously mount on aircraft, suits and weapons. Naturally this will destroy the perfect builds of players with older saves, but it should ensure a smoother experience for those who are preparing to restart now, just like Switch users. Waypoint also allows you to customize the difficulty in every aspect, from combat to resource collection, and it will be possible to do it even after starting the game; if you don't want to worry, you will find a relaxation mode ready where you will only have to think about enjoying the journey. A feature designed specifically for Steam Deck and Switch is the new and more frequent autosave, which allows you to interrupt and resume minimizing any losses. Waypoint, which also includes many other new features, is of course available on all platforms. Alone among the stars No Man's Sky: a huge game, on the smallest console! The single player experience of No Man's Sky has been perfectly replicated on the Nintendo console, however the same cannot be said of its multiplayer functions which are completely absent on Switch. This will be a hard blow for some, a non-issue for others. As nice as it is to explore the universe and build bases together with friends, or meet unknown travelers in the Nexus built by Nada and Polo, No Man's Sky is and remains above all an explorer gametive and traveling among its extravagant galaxies in complete solitude tastes different, not worse. After all, there are plenty of things to do, and many hours will pass before boredom sets in: No Man's Sky has an excellent main storyline and several stories to follow, it allows you to build land and submarine bases, customize huge cruisers and their different frigates, fight the growing number of sentinels, learn alien languages, trade resources, collect spaceships, upgrade your defenses and weapons, befriend pirates, explore abandoned stations, fight by skimming mountains and clouds or through a dense forest that it lights up and hisses when night falls. In exchange for the online, small consolation, however, we find touch screen support which proves to be particularly useful while tinkering with equipment and inventory.", "date": "2022-10-11", "grade": "8.3"}
