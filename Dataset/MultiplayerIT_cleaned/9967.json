{"name": "Gang Beasts", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/gang-beasts-recensione.html", "text": "For a game entirely focused on party game-style multiplayer action and possibly offline, it is really strange that we are only now faced with a review of Gang Beasts, considering that its first release dates back to 2014 in early access on PC and in the meantime it has arrived on all other platforms. Let's take advantage of the game's arrival on Nintendo Switch to analyze a product that finds its ideal location on the Nintendo console, given that the ability to play local multiplayer games ~on the fly~ and in portability represent a huge advantage for a product of this type. type. In addition to the fact that the user demography seems to fit perfectly into the target sought by the developers. Still, it took almost five years to be able to get your hands on a version for Nintendo Switch which, however, does not disappoint. At some point in the history of video games, someone must have realized that the ~wrong~ application of physics could work as an element of the gameplay itself. The biggest success born from this simple and weird idea is most likely Human: Fall Flat, a game that continues to go crazy also driven by the streaming phenomenon and videos on YouTube, but in the same category we can also include Goat Simulator and the more recent Totally Reliable Delivery Service and TABS: Totally Accurate Battle Simulator. The principle is typical of games that focus on the demented effect: complicating simple movements in order to stage, in a natural way, grotesque and irresistible situations. From Takeshi's Castle onwards, or Mai Dire Banzai in our area, the principle has always been infallible and the success of these bizarre video games proves it too. All this to say that Gang Beasts also takes advantage of this concept to apply it to the group multiplayer fighting game, with the consequences you can imagine. Gameplay: beating and precarious balance Gang Beasts, a fight on the roof of a truck There is no story behind Gang Beasts, a game that is based solely on its immediate gameplay to stage decidedly out of the ordinary situations. We don't quite know why, the characters we use in the game have almost no solid skeleton and love to dress up as animals or various characters, with obvious possibilities of costumes to unlock that offer huge different possibilities, all equally crazy. In practice they are what is technically called ~ragdoll~, with a little more consistency but with the same ~jelly~ movements that characterize these polygonal models. The game offers different modes to engage in but, in essence, it's always about surviving in potentially deadly situations while trying to take down your opponents. Above all, not to eliminate ourselves through missteps or loss of balance: things that are practically the order of the day if we consider how control is clouded by suitably distorted physics and the settings do everything possible to continually place us close to mortal dangers. Up to eight players find themselves in various levels made up of always very risky situations (a skyscraper under construction, a meat grinder with sausages swooping down from above and sudden openings in the floor, a Ferris wheel, a sort of arctic base on the ice, an aquarium equipped with a kraken, an incinerator, a cable car, and so on), in online or local multiplayer, to indulge in different game modes. Gang Beasts, a game moment on the edge of a chasm These are Melee, Waves, Gangs and Kicks, but basically they all revolve around the same concept: trying to make the others fall or push them towards some deadly obstacle while trying to avoid the same fate and fighting both with opponents than with controls. The various options offer good variations on the theme such as team play, throwing a ball into the opponent's goal or introducing progressive waves of enemies that add to the fray, but the basis of the gameplay remains the Melee. Basically, we have to control our ragdoll by punching, kicking and headbutting, jumping, grappling and trying to dodge blows, triggering chain reactions which, in large groups of players, lead to guaranteed laughs, especially since in most cases the ends battle tactics result in spectacular failures, with attacks regularly missing and backfiring. Advantages and disadvantages of Nintendo Switch Gang Beasts also makes us fight on the roof of a skyscraper Considering how many years have passed since the other releases, expect some additions to Gang Beasts on Nintendo Switch was not absurd, but evidently Boneloaf and Double Fine felt that the game was perfect in this way and have therefore re-proposed it identical to the other versions. It's not a bad choice, because many are likely to approach this game for the first time ever, but finding it after a long time without any changes is certainly a bit disappointing. On the other hand, on the Nintendo console it can take advantage of the intrinsic peculiarities of the hardware, or above all the possibility of being played in portability and the fact of being able to organize a multiplayer on the fly at any time also taking advantage of the tabletop mode, which is really of great importance in a game all about this kind of experience. Gang Beasts, a screenshot from the game It must be said, however, that the local multiplayer is much superior to the online one: not so much because there are technical problems with the latter, but because the lack of vocal communication and constant feedback really takes away much of the fun.Otherwise, it is certainly not a demanding game from a graphic point of view: the beauty of Gang Beasts has always been the fact that it uses an extreme caricature stylization to increase the comic effect, which results in a practically perfect conversion on Nintendo Switch, except for some inconsistencies on the performance front. In particularly agitated situations, the frame-rate does not remain stable, which was also found on other consoles although here it seems decidedly more frequent and visible. In any case, the Nintendo Switch version is essentially the same as we have seen elsewhere, for better or for worse, with its aesthetic that can't help but make you laugh but also with the same content that those who have previously played the title will know by now all too well.", "date": "2021-11-11", "grade": "7.0"}
