{"name": "The Walking Dead: All-Stars", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-walking-dead-all-stars-recensione.html", "text": "In principle, it can be said that any brand that can count on a significant amount of consolidated characters in the common imagination can work as a basis for a gacha game. So it is not surprising that we find ourselves in front of the review of The Walking Dead: All-Stars, evaluating a game that requires us to collect large quantities of survivors through the typical ~summoning~ system. It may easily seem like a low-level commercial operation, but it has its own perfectly justified logic within the mobile gaming landscape: however, there are some peculiarities that should not be underestimated in this Com2Us title, which demonstrate at least a genuine intent to put scene something faithful to the reference work and interesting for its fans, beyond the mere ~cash-grab~ which is still at the center of the production. First of all, an element of interest is the fact that the main source of inspiration is The Walking Dead comic and not the famous TV series, which is already a commendable feature because it also introduces more peculiar stylistic choices. Both the general design and some elements of the story can therefore be different from what many might expect, already representing elements of originality that contribute to giving a certain identity to this title, characterized by simple but impactful graphics, which recalls from near the dark tones of the graphic novel. Having said that, the narrative is still very diluted between the countless fights, therefore it is not really a pillar of the gaming experience, but if nothing else it stages unpublished events and connections that refer to the graphic novel especially with regard to characteristics and origins of the characters. The story is original even if it takes its cue from Volume 20 of the comic, and sees us follow a group of survivors intent on protecting a settlement and gathering more and more fighters in Buffalo, making some moves within the city and around this that correspond to the various levels of the game. Being an ~all-stars~ title, focused on putting together characters from different narrative arcs, however, we cannot expect a very logical progression of events: alongside the main episodes that open the various chapters of the game, the introduction of the characters takes place randomly through summons and rather bizarre cases can emerge such as finding two different versions of Rick Grimes within the team, for example. Idle fights and character collection The Walking Dead: All-Stars, combat images and management The characterization of the characters, the graphic style adopted and the setting are substantially the strengths of The Walking Dead: All-Stars, which for the rest is limited to proposing the classic ~RPG~ in idle style, essentially an AFK clone Arena. The gameplay is extremely simple, as it is practically automatic: we select the group of fighters to be deployed in battle and we limit ourselves to observing it as it collides with the hordes of enemies, through a system that practically does not involve interaction except for the possibility of activating special abilities at the right time, but this too can simply be automated. As usual, various options to increase the QoL, such as the possibility of speeding up the fights, must be unlocked by progressing in the game or by paying the ~VIP~ package, through the classic free-to-play scheme with microtransactions. The latter seem not to be too intrusive, with the game offering a good amount of rewards also in terms of currency for the gacha system, but it is clear that to get the rare characters it is necessary to resort to some purchases, as well as to increase the level of the fighters without running into a fatal grinding. The mechanism always remains the same, with some minor variations that emerge from activities outside the story, such as special events, the management of the survivors' town and, particularly interesting, the exploration missions. The Walking Dead: All-Stars, characters and fights in the game These offer a long sequence of clashes in which we can choose the path to follow between one fight and another through a map of hexagons with different challenges to undertake and selection of rewards and updates at the end of each fight, up to the final boss. There is therefore a certain variety of activities to undertake, but these are limited to proposing the same gameplay reduced to the minimum terms with some minimal variations on the basic theme. In a game ofin this genre, the management and progression of the characters obviously has a primary importance in the structure of the game, the meaning of which is the construction of an increasingly large and powerful group of fighters. Again, the mechanism is largely automated: it is simply a matter of spending the accumulated points in passages from one level of experience to another, with special skills and abilities that are unlocked accordingly. Also the management of the equipment is always automated, with the choice of the best weapons, armor and objects that happens simply at the push of a button.", "date": "2022-09-08", "grade": "6.4"}
