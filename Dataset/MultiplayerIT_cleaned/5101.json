{"name": "The Chant", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/the-chant-recensione.html", "text": "Fear, anxiety, restlessness, healthy terror: sensations and emotions of which the human brain never seems to be really satisfied. Proof of this is, limited to the gaming sector, the abundance of horror publications: loads of games capable of transporting users into narrow corridors, dark rooms, other dimensions, places inhabited by who knows how many and which horrors. The Chant, which we are talking about today, tries again. But it does so by shuffling the cards on the table. All the options we have mentioned, in fact, are now almost entirely part of the clich repertoire - especially when the developers abuse them without committing themselves to a minimum of inventiveness or originality. But The Chant is different: if the comparison is allowed, it tries the same operation that was typical of Midsommar in the cinematographic sector. There are monsters, but great attention, and this also in the gameplay, is paid to the spiritual dimension of individuals. In short, the search for inner balance could lead to crossing doors that should remain closed. The review by The Chant follows. We have explored and explored it well on PlayStation 5, and we are sure that it can easily arouse your interest. History: between spirits and prisms Jess meets the ~guru~ of The Chant The narration of The Chant begins ex abrupto. We are on an unknown island, precisely on the predominant promontory, and a strange ritual is in progress: this can be understood from the large central structure, which seems in all respects a dimensional portal, and from the presence of figures dressed in white, with I wear strange masks. Something goes wrong: in the middle of the procedure - perhaps aimed at summoning some strange being or power - one of the pregnant women runs away. The ritual cannot continue, the circle is broken: the woman's desperate escape does not meet a positive outcome, while strange forces begin to unleash themselves on the island. We then move on to the present, in our era: we learn that the protagonist is called Jess Briars, who continues to suffer the ~hangovers~ of a traumatic event that occurred several years earlier. Urged by an old friend named Kim - it seems that the latter suffered the same trauma in the company of the former, but we can't tell you anything else - Jess leaves for a few days of rest towards Glory Island, a very remote island, forgotten by the world, where those present dedicate themselves to a spiritual retreat led by guru Tyler. Kim has been living on Glory Island for several years now, in the company of others present with an equally turbulent or traumatic past behind them. But it seems that there is nothing more to worry about, given that prismatic science promises a total recovery of one's psychic dimension, as well as a significant improvement in inner balance. What better place, in short, to heal the invisible wounds of mind and body? Yet, from the start, something doesn't add up to Jess. The behavior of those present resembles all too much that of a cult; many places in the Commune, the shared village, are inaccessible; strange events begin to occur, until the real unleashing of occult forces on the entire island. The Chant is not an open world: its environments are reduced to some specific areas, within which the player will have to face the enemies present, find key objects or simply explore the surroundings to continue the narrative. Despite the limitations in size - the areas are really a handful, including wooded paths, the 'residential area' (known as Il Ritiro), the cannery and the mining area. But the context is managed well in almost all its elements and the sustained pace - combined with good narration and management of the dialogues, all in Italian also in the dubbing - do the rest. As a story, as a disturbing ~story~, The Chant performs its duty admirably, also because in fact the encounter between new age and horror is today a path little practiced in video games, and in any case much less known than others among the general public . However, if you simply want to scare yourself, this is not the right title. Comparison by comparison, it has much more pronounced gameplay than any Until Dawn or The Quarry, but sacrifices abundantly the moments in which you proceed with your heart in your mouth or jump off your chair. It's not necessarily a bad thing. Gameplay: Mind, Body, Spirit Situations ~on the edge~ will affect Jess's Mind more than Body and Spirit In its structure, The Chant is certainly a third-person adventure: it aims first of all at telling a story and does so according to a series of stylistic elements clearly drawn from the most well-known so-called ~dynamic adventures~ of recent years; oltre to the aforementioned Until Dawn, we remember among others at least The Dark Pictures Anthology. The system linked to the ~choices~ of the protagonist, for example, can influence the relationships between her and the other characters, as well as push the plot towards certain ramifications (nothing, however, that significantly encourages replayability); however, the QTE mechanics, the ~quick time events~ that require the player to execute a certain command at the right time, are completely absent. The Brass Token product is, in fact, even much more than this, a real survival that boasts a precise and marked gameplay, full of possibilities. What we are about to illustrate did not surprise us particularly from the point of view of the novelties - in our opinion, the main value of the production consists in the narration - nor from that of the solidity of the mechanics; however the game system never pretends to be anything amazing, and in what it has to do it gets along with dignity. The three main parameters of the protagonist, always to keep an eye on, are Mind, Body and Spirit. The idea is to keep them in balance, but it is possible to sacrifice one to enhance the others: for example, meditation (command X on the controller) decreases the Spirit in favor of the Mind. It doesn't make much sense to watch Jess go out of the blue, in the dark, in the woods, in Zen mode, but it works. The creatures of The Chant belong to another world, normally separate from ours It goes without saying that every parameter between Mind, Body and Spirit affects the surrounding world in a certain way. Supernatural events and monster attacks will put a strain not only on the girl's body (which must withstand the blows, and if the values of the Body reach zero it's game over) but also, in fact, her mind. Better then to avoid staying too long in the dark, or near creatures from other worlds: sanity will sink, leading to panic attacks. There are consumables with which to restore the values, three specific herbs that grow a bit throughout the island, but are not too abundant so we advise you to keep them aside in case of extreme need. Exploration in the dark To explore the darkness of The Chant is to defy the cultists The Chant Island is dangerous. Prismatic science has awakened, simplifying a bit, demons from other worlds. The latter can appear in various forms, infest the game environments with natural obstacles (such as giant plants) or take physical form through cultists and other creatures. Jess doesn't have to face them all to continue, but if necessary she can take advantage of certain consumables to make useful weapons, the most trivial of which use sage, the first weak point of the creatures. It is therefore possible to play them with thrashing with improvised natural-based mallets, and it works; other times you'll have to run away instead. Exploration of the surrounding world, however contained, is essential to continue in the main story; to overcome the limits of the environment, the developers have rightly thought of inserting a series of buildings even in places on the island where, strictly speaking, there shouldn't be any. Many doors are logically closed, so you will need to find the key, or in any case objects to combine in the inventory to provide a special access mode - for example a certain ritual symbol. Sometimes one gets the impression that The Chant wants to have a little too many arrows in the face of a smaller than expected bow; metaphor aside, perhaps it would have been appropriate to select only a few mechanics, and insist 100% on those, instead of spacing more than necessary. However, we are talking, better to repeat it, of a product that works and entertains overall, net of some situations that are a little less sensible than others.", "date": "2022-11-03", "grade": "7.5"}
