{"name": "Horse Life - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/horse-life-recensione.html", "text": "For all young women (or at least for many of them) there surely comes an age when they want a horse, probably with images of cinematic productions in mind such as ~A ride on the meadow~ or the more modern ~The man who whispered to the horses.~ Or will it be because we grew up on MioMiniPony rations? Whatever the reason, there are certainly many women who can claim to have dreamed of being able to experience riding stables. In any case, Horse Life is a title that intends to bring to life at least the idea of such an experience, certainly managing to bring out more than a twinkle in the eyes of a very young audience inclined to a veil of romanticism, also teasing a certain spirit of competition. To welcome us into the game we immediately find a relaxing melody and an elderly gentleman with a somewhat severe air who will be our tutor throughout the Horse Life and who, in fact, has a very ~grandfather~ air. After having created a profile among the three available and having chosen the breed of our future horse, among the three available in turn (French saddle horse, English thoroughbred or Arab), we access a short introductory film which takes us to the box a riding school, to witness the birth of a foal of the breed we have selected. Two years later, now an adult, he will be our playmate. A run on the lawn At this point we are ready to delve into the merits of the actual game, first of all discovering the places that characterize the environment of any medium-level riding school: the ~boutique~, i.e. a sort of internal shop where you can buy what is necessary for us and for the care of our horse, from food, to tools for the care of the coat, to saddles and equestrian clothing for our virtual alter ego. Then there is a Competition Center, within which competitions in their various genres and classes will take place, a theme that we will deal with later. The next environment to visit is the Monta Station, one of the focal places of the game. It is in fact the place where we will interact with our horse for what are probably the most important aspects for the success of the game: training, box, meadow and shelter. The box is, of course, the place used for keeping the horse, a place that we will have to keep clean by changing the straw, where we can feed it, brush it, groom it and wash it. Where, in short, we will take care of the aspects that will then affect the animal's statistics, i.e. happiness, shape and cleanliness. Happiness is actually much more easily influenced by the interaction we can have with the horse in the meadow, where we can cuddle it and provide it with treats. The refuge is the place where we can change our clothing and the saddle and check the trophies and diplomas obtained and finally, the meadow is where we can go for runs in the woods while maintaining the physical shape of our steed. Graduate and compete The training center, on the other hand, is certainly the focal part of the game, as it is essential to obtain progressive diplomas in order to access the corresponding competitive classes, just like in any self-respecting sports career. The diplomas start at the beginner level and finish with the champion level, obviously the highest level of difficulty. Each level will make us challenge ourselves with the three main disciplines of the equestrian world: dressage, obstacle course and cross. The first, best known perhaps for the shows offered by the Viennese riding school with the famous Lipizzan horses, consists of aesthetic figures that require great control over the animal. Show jumping is known to everyone, while cross is a course on open ground, usually in the countryside/forest, with a series of ~natural~ obstacles to tackle. A sort of equine ~off road~, we could say. Each diploma will allow us to access higher competitive levels, which will culminate with the national tournament. After the tournament tests, divided into the three disciplines, we will be able to compete in a single competition including all disciplines. Winning the races will earn us money to spend in the Boutique and a sort of reputation. The link with the training center and the diplomas is made very close by the need to complete a competitive circuit in order to access the next level of training, just as it is necessary to have obtained a diploma of a certain level to be able to access the respective competitions. Op op horse: a stroke of the stylus The game system is simple and intuitive and is very reminiscent of the Rhythm Game concept and completely entrusted to the use of the stylus, both to make menu choices and to controlI know the horse tight. To groom, brush and wash it, as well as to caress it, it will be sufficient to pass the stylus over the animal's coat in the direction indicated by the arrows, which normally coincides with the direction of hair growth. In the main stages of the game, whether it's competitions, training or racing in the woods, we will naturally have to ride our horse and guide it correctly in the various situations. To change the pace, increasing it to a trot or a light canter, it will be sufficient to press the stylus on the horse's rear, to slow down on the bridles. The various figures of dressage, as well as the changes of direction and the jumps are instead controlled by a series of sequences on the touch screen that we will have to follow with the stylus, touching the circles that will appear and dragging without detaching the stylus from the screen following the evolution of the circle in question. If we are precise in following the video tracks we will obtain executions of various degrees of perfection, if we are inaccurate we will run into errors, such as refusing a jump for example. Everything takes place in a rather intuitive way and the speed and complexity of the tracks to follow on the screen naturally increases in progression with our level of advancement in the game. One flaw, however, found is the extreme tediousness of the training phases. In fact, to pass one of the exams that will allow us to acquire the ability to perform the various types of exercises that make up a diploma, we will have to perform the exercise itself once for a test and then another four times to pass the exam. This becomes frankly excessively repetitive, I think two or three times would have been more than enough, especially on long and complex exercises. If you make a mistake in performing an exercise, you are forced to repeat the exam all over again, bringing the level of repetitiveness to the limit of boredom. Another flaw is the camera that switches to a slowed frontal vision when performing a ~perfect~, which creates some coordination difficulties in the case of immediately following executions. As far as the rest of the game dynamics are concerned, we are certainly dealing with a concept of a certain schematic nature, which however in the hands of a very young girl should be overcome by the competitiveness that is inevitably generated with the ~first in the class~ on duty, snooty at the limit of unbearability, a real pleasure to witness her frustration when we beat her in competition. As for the graphic sector, which wants to be as realistic as possible and detach itself from any concept of ~puppetness~, we must accuse a certain degree of woodiness with regard to the movements of the horses. Apart from this defect, for the rest the validity in communicating a good sense of movement must be recognized, as well as the ability to convey the atmosphere of a medium-high level riding school. The audio, including music that can be unlocked in the boutique to vary the library of songs to accompany trips into the woods, manages to be quite pleasant and suitable for the settings. The game isn't particularly long-lived, we must add, although there is some replayability if we want to top up the reputation bar and achieve a first place finish in all competitions. To add that once the game is finished you will have the possibility to unlock a mythological, playable animal, whose nature we do not want to reveal so as not to spoil the surprise. A good title, however, recommended only for young and very young, since we sincerely doubt that the target can deviate from this range and attract a more adult audience. An excellent alternative, in any case, to the various virtual tamagotchi a la Nintendogs that are populating the Nintendo laptop. Comment Horse Life is a product clearly intended for a very young audience, probably female. Taken from this point of view it certainly manages to be quite valid, thanks to its characteristics of realism which allow for an ideal approach, albeit from a strictly romantic point of view, with the reality of competitive horse riding. The sense of competition generated is good, the control system is very well exploited, along the lines of the most famous rhythm games. Except for a bit of woodiness in some movements of the horse, the graphics are generally appreciable, as is the sound sector. We can run into a certain feeling of repetitiveness but in general the rhythms are lean enough to keep us away from tedium, except for the training sessions which could have been shorter.Pro Realistic graphics Intuitive easy to use controlsApproach Fair replayability Cons Can be repetitive at times Woody animations Few horse customization options", "date": "2007-11-07", "grade": null}
