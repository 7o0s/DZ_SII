{"name": "Guitar Rock Tour - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/guitar-rock-tour-recensione.html", "text": "Undoubtedly rock still does a lot, but a lot of cool! Playing a guitar, drums or singing in a band performing in front of a flood of fans has a unique charm and attraction. If all this can be obtained live with sweat, practice, talent and luck, in that simplification of life that video games are nothing else, you just need to know how to press the colored keys more or less in time to succeed! You will become a star Thus was born a whole series of musical games in which the apex has now been reached with titles such as Rock Band and Guitar Hero which offer entire sets of reproductions of plastic instruments. However, the basis is always that of trying to simplify the performance of a piece of music. On DS we cannot fail to mention titles such as Ouendan and Guitar Hero On Tour. If the first reinterprets the genre by exploiting both the touch screen and the second screen in an ingenious way, the second goes beyond the DS by proposing a special peripheral, to be attached to the card slot of the GBA, which reproduces the ~guitar~ keys of the home version. In the first, therefore, the action is dictated by following strange trajectories on the tactile screen of the console, in the second, by holding the double screen in an original way, the attempt is to reproduce ~on tour~ the rhythmic deeds generally proposed on much larger screens. This Guitar On Tour does nothing but mix the two by creating a classic musical game with the GUI of Guitar Hero, complete with chassis and guitar strings, to be played however by wiping like crazy. To tell the truth, the title seems more like a way to ride the success of the much more famous title with guitar than anything else, but the final result is not bad at all and is well done and fun. But let's go in order, everything is more or less copied: graphics, title, game method, musical genre. It seems to be faced with the same title with a budget price and without discussed peripherals, and these are undoubtedly two strong points even if it almost makes you want to cry plagiarism ... The elimination of the physical colored keys has not limited the action anyway that manages to be complete, fast and satisfying. The principle is the same, except that instead of pressing a button, the stylus is moved to the equivalent reproduced in pixels. Long notes, sequences and chords, if played in time, load a special ~superstar~ bar which allows, by rubbing on a special lever or pressing - better - a key, to activate the classic score multipliers. The weight of success But it's not over. In addition to the guitar, we have also tried to reproduce the drums. The little game that came out of it is decidedly less complex and more limited than the guitar. Only three sensitive parts - bass drum, snare and cymbals - and only two ~bands of notes~ seem few, but still manage to make it almost unplayable with the stylus. This is because the sections to be pressed on the screen are too far from each other in relation to the speed of execution... However, it is enough to use the keys - cross for the snare, keys for the kick and simultaneous pressure for the cymbals - to make it very pleasant and definitely more enjoyable. It is a pity that the execution of the dishes is decidedly difficult even in this way. The three classic difficulty levels - from easy to expert - manage to put everyone to the test. The normal difficulty, for example, is perfectly calibrated to entertain without infuriating. In expert mode, on the other hand, the game gets really tough with seemingly impossible sequences, but which with a lot of practice you can hardly tame. Each song has, as can be guessed, a different difficulty and includes pressure sequences for the most part consistent with what our ears hear. The suggestion is to connect the DS to a decent audio system or use headphones at least since the miserable speakers are unable to transmit that part of the necessary energy. The game also has a fairly classic structure. There is the quick game mode, to strum or follow the rhythm on the unlocked songs, the career mode, which allows us to travel the world climbing the sales charts - be careful if you start with the guitar you cannot go back to the drums and vice versa - and the inevitable multiplayer with which to play together via wi-fi. The tracklist Fifteen songs in all ranging from ~smoke on the water~ to ~Girlfriend~, all covers and some even less famous than the average are the only effective limit to this title. Even if technically well done and discreetly sung, they are still few. The possible repetition is however mitigated by the various difficulties and by the possibility of trying the two instruments, but comHowever, a dozen more pieces - perhaps originals - would not have hurt. Finally, the images of our group struggling with the execution of the pieces scroll on the upper screen. The locations are varied and range from the classic basement to the London double-decker bus. As far as you can follow, what takes place in the lower screen is too excited to look away, the skits are done decently with good polygonal graphics and animated with few, but good, moves. All in all therefore, to be a ~poor relative~ of Guitar Hero, Guitar Rock Tour remains a product that perfectly hits the target it had aimed at, offering a game that does not require weird peripherals but still solid and fun despite a certain limitation of content and the impossibility, for economic reasons, of inserting original versions of the songs. Comment Guitar Rock Tour is a nice diversion and a great way to have fun with a DS. Its Low Budget nature, it is still a saga born on mobile phones, and Guitar Hero's poor relative occasionally peep out, but in any case they do not prevent you from having fun. In the end the only real big flaw is the presence of just fifteen songs. The idea of inserting both the simulation of the drums and that of the guitar is nice, even if the first is implemented only in a discreet way and is absolutely to be played with the keys. Pros Fun and immediate Use the DS in a good way Suitable for everyone thanks to the various difficulties Against Only fifteen songs Discreet only battery mode It almost seems like plagiarism", "date": "2009-01-05", "grade": null}
