More specifically, with the historic Secret of Mana and Chrono Trigger, still considered milestones in their genre today. From the graphic style to the design of the characters, passing through the dungeon crawler mechanics and the type of missions proposed, EA's game clearly tries to attract the attention of those who have loved the old Squaresoft pearls madly, and beyond. Moreover, he does it just in time, since Secret of Mana is now close to being released on the App Store, and that some unconfirmed rumors also want a port of Chrono Trigger on the horizon. Of course, Heroes Lore: Stigmata of Gaia was not born with the presumption of equaling the titles mentioned above, nor does it try, but with two long parallel adventures, a discreet narration and an online multiplayer mode, it wants to give JRPG fans something with to appease hunger. How successful was it? One story, two stories With a pleasant surprise, before starting the adventure the player is asked to choose between two different protagonists belonging to the two warring factions. In this case, more listless productions would be limited to a simple change of character, graphics and little more, leaving the narrative and the structure of the missions almost unchanged. In Heroes Lore, on the other hand, the point of view on the conflict, the enemies you meet and the objectives to be completed completely changes, thus favoring the possibility of being replayed twice. Once a new game has been started, it is therefore necessary to decide whether to impersonate Kei, a young and inexperienced inhabitant of Neo-Soltia, or Rits, astute and cold soldier of Askra; you are also asked to select a class from those available, predictably going to influence the starting statistics. Unfortunately, despite the excellent illustrations and lively sprites, both characters are very stereotyped, and in general even the dialogues with the various NPCs border on banality. Told through a rigid isometric view, the adventure alternates between game sessions in the city and in the various dungeons: in a rather traditional way, in the inhabited centers you collect new missions, make purchases or take care of your alter-ego, while at outside their borders, hordes of hungry creatures await you. Too bad the combat isn't all that fun. The enemies face each other in real time and making use of two attack keys, small and close enough to make it quite difficult to complete a combo. New spells and learned attacks can be arranged in a side column, adding a little more pace and strategy to more advanced combat. Whether you're in melee or not doesn't make much of a difference, since the auto-targeting system allows the character to directly target enemies within range. There is no shortage of very tough opponents, but the frequency with which healing potions are collected makes even the most powerful of bosses harmless. The interface then does not enhance the transition from one level to the next, and it is the player who from time to time must remember to access the menu and spend the accumulated experience points to enhance the various skills. Even moving in the various environments is not very intuitive, due to a not very precise and quite intrusive virtual stick, able to cover a large part of the screen and thus hide any objects or enemies. Heroes Lore also offers turn-based multiplayer, but much to our disappointment, the only times we were able to connect to the servers were practically empty.
