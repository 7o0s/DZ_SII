A game that in its simplicity manages to be captivating and to win over those looking for short but not too short game sessions and an intense (but not too much) level of ~addiction~. We're talking about Dinosaur Slayer, a title belonging to the ~tower defense~ in which we maintain a static position and we have to defend it from the onslaught of various waves of monsters. It's a fairly inflated genre that boasts titles of undisputed thickness, so it's not easy to be able to emerge from the crowd to conquer a niche place in the memory of Apple devices already quite crowded with applications of all kinds and values. In this case it seems that it is really worth keeping a free icon to tap every now and then to find yourself right in the middle of the action again. Pata Pata Pata SLAIN! The first thing that is impossible not to notice when starting the game is the very clear inspiration to the graphics of that PSP masterpiece that is Patapon. The colors, the backgrounds, the characters and even the conceptual dynamics of the game clearly imitate him and the result is anything but unpleasant and immediately manages to win the sympathy of the user. But it's really easy to discover that we are not dealing with smoke without roast: the graphics are really excellent and captivating, but the controls are also well studied and rather precise and serve the simple dynamics of the game well. The concept, as we have said, is elementary in its classicism: the screen is fixed, on its left we find our tower to defend which stands on a body of water at our feet. Instead, flotillas of monsters will appear from the right of the screen to fend off. With one finger you manage the raise of the crossbow with which to shoot our bullets, with the other you stop one of the skills that appear on the bottom and which generate different types of offensive weapons. And the game would essentially be all here: what made it fun was the clever addition of a series of elements that can revive the gameplay and give the player the sensation of an advancement of his character and the need to make strategic choices. At each level that you manage to pass, points are awarded which translate into gold coins that can be used to make upgrades. These allow you to increase the health of the tower, to improve the shooting ability of the crossbow which can, for example, acquire the ability to shoot multiple arrows or finally to buy the unlocking of spells that will have particularly devastating effects on the epic monsters that threaten the collapse of the defenses of the tower. If at the beginning everything appears very simple, one will soon have to realize that it won't be like this forever: going forward in the schemes it will be really crucial to make field choices that are sensible so as not to regret having spent money on an upgrade rather than in another. The increasing difficulty of the game can actually lead to a certain level of frustration, especially given that there isn't an option that allows you to go back a few patterns to try your luck again by applying different strategies. At each level passed, you are asked if you want to save, an advisable action if you don't want to risk having to go over different schemes already faced. Even the pointing system, which in any case works excellently, can take some time before being managed with the necessary precision: it remains essential to find the right position to use your fingers on the screen so as not to obscure parts of the visual. The absence of a noteworthy soundtrack (but there is support for iTunes) remains a detail that is lacking. The tested version is 1.2 App Store links", "date": "2010-04-02", "grade": "7.8"}
