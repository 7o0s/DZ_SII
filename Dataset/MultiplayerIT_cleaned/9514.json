This time, however, the developers of Perfect Cell wondered what an alien being could think instead, in the form of a sort of huge intelligent virus, locked up in the basement of a very secret military base and therefore rather furious with all mankind, seen as a race of jailers. So here, for once, the point of observation changes, an element that gives originality at least to the context of the story. Escape to victory Perfect Cell represents the perfect symbiosis between a classic puzzle game and a stealth title: the reader will probably find this combination strange, but it is precisely this particular fusion that constitutes the key element of the title in question. To escape from the secret military facility in which it is imprisoned for security reasons, the perfect cell must face a huge and vast number of tunnels, obstacles and enemies; however, the incentive that pushes the alien creature to go forward is very strong, as only the obsessive search for freedom can be. Naturally, the years of interdiction and of experiments conducted by the various scientists have provoked such malice and anger in the sphere as to explode suddenly, unleashing and raging with ferocity on the bodies of all human beings encountered along the way. The only way to interact with the alien organism and guide its escape is through the multitouch gestures of the iPhone: by touching a point on the screen, the sphere will move towards that direction following a straight line and creating a sort of tentacular tail (which makes it look like a Matrix-style ~cuttlefish~); in the presence of obstacles it will therefore be necessary to change the direction of the touch until they are overcome, all in any case in an immediate and intuitive way. To then solve particular environmental puzzles and press several switches at the same time, the cell can be separated into two or three parts, however linked by a constraint of minimum distance to be maintained; in this case it will be enough, starting from the position of two joined fingers above the original sphere, to swipe them at the same time in opposite directions and thus guide the separate sections. To attack enemies or break the most fragile walls, just swipe your finger quickly in the direction of the obstacle, thus transforming the fugitive alien into a biological projectile. Along the way to freedom, as already mentioned, in addition to the physical obstacles (characterized by the aforementioned walls but also by lasers and puffs of steam) it is possible to meet scientists and armed guards, very dangerous because by shooting they are able to affect the life of the cell; killing all the humans present on one of the 35 levels constitutes a bonus for increasing the final score, so much so that identifying them all will not often be an easy task (many are in fact outside the ideal escape trajectory). The same killings can be transformed into real puzzles, to be faced with different strategies and tactics to avoid the reactions of the surviving guards; in any case, completing a level at 100% will never be excessively frustrating, also because the lack of time limits allows for a more reasoned and aware approach. On the technical front, the work carried out is truly commendable: in particular, the fluidity of the movements in Perfect Cell is truly incredible, with the evil cell flowing away without the slightest slowdown, in a very accurate 3D environment (although things a bit dark); the animation of the dead guards and scientists, similar to sacks of potatoes dragged by the alien brute force, is a little less convincing but it is a truly secondary element within the context of the game. On the other hand, the light effects and textures are very well done; however, it is necessary to further specify that the technical aspect, although well cared for as mentioned, has almost no effect on the final evaluation of the title, precisely because the main interest is linked to the innovative combination of puzzle-stealth gameplay. Finally, the always welcome support for official Game Center achievements should be noted, now increasingly valued by the various developers.
