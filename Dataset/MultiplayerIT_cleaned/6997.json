{"name": "Vade retro", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/135069-wayward-manor-vade-retro-umano.html", "text": "Wayward Manor is the first video game signed by Neil Gaiman, a world-renowned writer who needs no introduction. Among his best known works of him we remember the comic saga Sandman and the novel American Gods. Since the realm of the fantastic is Gaiman's favorite playground, it immediately seemed like an excellent choice to invite him to write a video game. And the over three thousand backers who participated in a presale campaign with lots of Kickstarter-style rewards must have thought the same. After almost a year of takings and gestation, therefore, Wayward Manor has finally arrived, and it's a bitter disappointment. The first cold bucket came once the genre was discovered. It is in fact a puzzle game, which, in theory, shouldn't require great narrative efforts. Gaiman's pen therefore seemed a bit wasted to us, but we could also be wrong and be surprised by some unconventional gimmick. Then we launched the game and opened the options screen as usual. At that point we were once again puzzled. In fact, the only possible graphic setting concerns the resolution. We've never been fans of effects and mediocre graphics have sustained great games on more than one occasion, but it's strange that a video game with polygonal models doesn't support anti-aliasing at the very least. And then the suspicion that something had gone wrong during the making grew until, after the first half hour of play, it turned into a certainty. Yes, Gaiman is wasted on such a game, and so is our time. One hundred and twenty minutes later we then completed Wayward Manor, between puffs of impatience, yelps of impatience and sighs of sadness at the paucity of the whole operation. Moreover, the starting concept is also interesting. The mouse pointer is in fact a specter at the service of the house, with the task of driving away the humans who live there by scaring them to death. From these premises a delicious video game could have been born. Too bad it didn't go like this. Let's hope that at least the backer who won the dinner with Gaiman by donating ten thousand dollars for the project enjoyed himself. Wayward Manor is a puzzle game written by Neil Gaiman, but we can't think of any other positives Domestic cleaning Wayward Manor is divided into five chapters, each of which contains five levels, after which you access the final series which culminates with a confrontation against the game's boss. Each chapter is dedicated to a different guest of the haunted house. The purpose, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, is to frighten the host until he flees. Game levels are single screens that contain objects to interact with to scare the human being present. After a certain number of scares you unlock new objects to interact with and once you have accumulated enough heartbeats, the level ends and you move on to the next. Some of our traps are timed and must be calculated based on the movements of the humans present. Sometimes, however, we have to take into account the fact that there are two people in the room. However, everything happens with the simple use of the mouse pointer, and this in itself is appreciable. But the problems are many, too many. First, most of our traps are the same throughout the game. The bottle that falls from above is fine the first time, but seeing it again after twenty levels is disheartening. And that's not the only example. Furthermore, at the beginning of the game it is pointed out to us that we have a certain freedom in choosing the type of traps to trigger, but this is actually a result of the significant holes in the structure of the levels. In fact, most of the time we pressed a little at random on sensitive objects, and each time we caused a fright without even having understood exactly how. Not to mention that in certain levels the same trap can be repeated over and over again to scare the host, with a significant increase in boredom, the true specter of the game that hovers over the screens from the first minutes. However, the sloppiness with which the levels were designed has a second effect, this time more nefarious, and that is the possibility of blocking without knowing what we did wrong. In fact, sometimes it is necessary to follow a certain sequence in activating the traps, otherwise you have to start over. The imprecision in the collisions, the characters that fit into objects and the mediocre visual treatment only add to the atmosphere of decadence that pervades Wayward Manor . Do you think that the final levels are by far the simplest of the game. Just clickwith order on the various points of interaction to finish them effortlessly. We have never received a reward for completing a level. Even the musical tunes, pleasant at first, have ended up becoming cloying. The only relief came from the short length of the game and lines of text from Neil Gaiman. To justify its presence, since the main narrative does not offer any interesting foothold, animals have been placed in the levels. If we click on it, we read textual contents that give a little flavor to the levels, above all thanks to the lively phrases and the richness of vocabulary that distinguish them. But if the only merit of this game is Neil Gaiman's pen, why waste time with Wayward Manor when we can read one of his novels? The price, on the other hand, is more or less the same.", "date": "2014-07-21", "grade": "4.9"}
