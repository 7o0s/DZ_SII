This work may seem fantastic, I still remember a joke I read in an old paper magazine, perhaps Game Power: the journalist replied to something like ~they pay you to have fun~ with ~I don't make hard movies~. Here, this shrewd pun came back to my memory insistently during the hours spent trying Eat Lead. In an era in which the videogame is by now such a mass product that it is made for the most varied ranges of users, we are no longer surprised to find ourselves between a Giulia Passione and a Hannah Montana, perhaps with an ambiguous Stormrise blocking our exit. But when we step back in search of an escape we see the atrocious cover of Eat Lead... that's really the moment when we realize that video games can sometimes even be lethal. And it's not always Mario or Chris Redfield to save us. Not even a joke will save you To his detriment, it must be said that Eat Lead, at least, does not take itself seriously: Matt Hazard is in fact the protagonist of a series of video games which, after an excellent initial success, has become the victim of easy merchandising and the passing of the years. Now reduced to a constant spin-off, Matt experiences an inexorable decline ... until he is hired as the protagonist for a new action-game. In short, Matt discovers that pulling the strings of a Mephistophelean plan to assassinate him is a shady individual who will, of course, be tracked down and defeated. If the plot already seems ridiculous to you, you have no idea how ridiculous the motivations of the villain are. And no, there's actually no Matt Hazard video game...thank goodness. Almost like in a meta-game, Matt Hazard is our alter-ego in what wants to be an action-game along the lines of Gears of War or, to fly lower, Quantum of Solace: typical view of third-person shooters, ability to hide behind different structures, various weapons and limited close combat capabilities. Practically banality made action-game. The response to the player's commands is slow and bizarre, Hazard himself walks around the various stages almost like a drunk; the only interesting feature is the ability to move from one hiding place to another by pressing a simple button: a way to simplify a game which, moreover, offers practically no challenges. The enemies demonstrate the artificial intelligence of a hamster, often remaining stationary as a target while we patiently aim for a nice headshot, haphazardly hiding behind obstacles smaller than themselves and attacking us following pre-set and very untactical patterns. Basically you proceed by hiding behind an obstacle and targeting the various incoming enemies from there, among other things unlocking trophies on trophies: the amount obtainable in a single game is impressive, perhaps by performing the most banal of actions. The problems arise when, proceeding through the game, the level of difficulty undergoes an absurd surge in correspondence with the final stages: at that point, frustration takes over and our self-preservation instinct fortunately takes over, leading us to turn off the console before a deleterious hysterical crisis. Why suffer? Vicious Cycle has developed Eat Lead and ironically the name of the softco is already a whole program: joking aside, Eat Lead has far too many flaws Sloppy and poorly detailed textures are stuck here and there without the slightest aesthetic sense, in a jumble of surreal colors that clash with the presumed realism of a video game within a video game. The environments are literally artificial, having played something like Killzone 2 on a machine like PlayStation 3 one definitely expects more, in 2009, than a handful of polygons to shape tables, chairs and furniture. Simply, the 3D of Eat Lead remained in 2005. Not even the polygonal modeling of the various characters passed the test, of a banality and repetitiveness rarely equaled previously, animated in an inappropriate way: living dolls that move as if controlled by a puppeteer epileptic, the woodiness of certain animations initially elicits a smile, destined to become a grimace of disapproval. More or less the standard expression of a casual Eat Lead player after the first ten minutes: the dubbing, unconvincing and forcibly ironic, doesn't help, and the music doesn't help, a triumph of banality in the form of half a dozen songs reproduced in loop from the beginning to the end of the game. And the uploads take forever: we wanted to close the review on a note of color, forgive us.", "date": "2009-04-22", "grade": "4.0"}
