Sure, some drawings have sexy details, but there are no nudes and no explicit sex scenes. Hiring the right actresses for the film we want to make is essential We are sorry, but for your daily masturbatory activities it is better that you look elsewhere. Having clarified this detail, which has earned the game many negative reviews on Steam, let's try to understand what we are talking about. As the title suggests, Porno Studio Tycoon is a pure management software, in the sense that it attempts to simulate the functioning of the professional pornographic film market, reproducing it above all from an economic point of view. In short, despite the cheerful theme, we find ourselves more in the Hollywood Mogul parts than in the Hunie series. However, this is where the first problem comes in: the translation into English. Zitrix Megalomedia is a small Russian team, evidently with little funds available. Otherwise it is not explained why the texts were translated in such a crude way. Especially the part of the tutorial, one of the most talked about and essential for understanding the game mechanics, which are not very simple, is really bad. We are not on the side of Google Translate, but we are close. However, digging through the obscure sentences, you can get a first impression of the game and its key points. At this point we just have to start our first game and try to become the new Riccardo Schicchi of the planet. We have reviewed Porno Studio Tycoon and conquered the porn market: discover it with us A market in perpetual erection As already mentioned, Porno Studio Tycoon simulates the professional porn market. If desired, this is a limit, given that many sectors of the porn industry that are by now driving forces remain outside, but evidently it was decided not to disperse the resources available for development in a thousand streams, instead concentrating them on a single aspect. The right location can make all the difference There are not many customization options for matches. At the beginning you can choose whether you want to start calmly, gradually unlocking the different aspects of the game, or if you want to have all the options available right away. You can also select different levels of difficulty, which vary the initial economic availability, the number of actors that can be hired and so on. Once the game has started, you are faced with a map of the globe in which some nations are marked, with the relative demand for porn. The main markets are the USA and China, but there are also interesting secondary markets to invest in. The important thing is to understand what the public to whom we will try to sell our products wants and act accordingly. For example, if the US public likes actresses with big boobs in ~extreme~ films, this must be taken into account, otherwise sales will be low. And here we can mention another big limitation of Porno Studio Tycoon, that is the variety, which we will talk about later. Let's go back to our global market. Understood where we want to sell and what we have to try to sell, also getting help from the reports of which the game is full, both in written form and in graphs (initially there is little information, almost all indirect, but with the growth of the activity it will be possible spend money on detailed analysis done by professionals, which will help us orient ourselves), we can devote ourselves to making our own films. Clapperboard, si tro turn! To make a film, the first thing to do is to cast actors. In particular, the actresses are important, but the director and the camera operator are also very important, who can make the difference between a cheap product and a successful one. Each actor has preferences and skills, all related to the genres we were talking about in the previous paragraph. The game is full of graphs that illustrate the trend of the market and of our company Obviously the artists and female artists have different costs depending on their overall quality, which is evaluated in stars. During the casting phase, it should always be considered that you need to have the right number of men and women for the different scenes, because Porno Studio Tycoon does not provide for the possibility of shooting gay films (having been developed in Putin's virile and tolerant Russia, we are not surprised, since there are laws that prevent the dissemination of gay-friendly content). Solved the performer problem, you need to rent a location to shoot the film. So you need to position the actors according to the type of scene you want to create; if necessary, adjust the colors and focus of the camera with the Pornotron 2000 computer, to have sharper images and, if desired, you can take breaks to let the actors rest, during which you can make them eat, giving them more motivation. Ultimately, the important thing is to be able to shoot scenes worthy of the name, give a name to the video produced and launch it on the market. Depending on the quality of the production and the strength of the demand, more or less money will be made and slowly you will have access to new possibilities such as a professional editing room or casting agencies that employ the best female artists. The ultimate goal is to make money and conquer increasingly large market shares. In short, become the king or queen of porn! Poor lubrication Porno Studio Tycoon is a decent management software, but it has several flaws. The most obvious is the lack of variety. It's not just a question of the number of actresses and actors that can be cast, which is not very high, but precisely the type of products that can be made, which are too limited. Where will we sell our products? In short, a few hours are enough to discover everything it has to offer, ending up playing by force of inertia. The lack of variety also translates into a small number of surprises: the unexpected, fundamental in similar titles to challenge the player, are very few. The substance is that, including all the mechanisms that regulate the simulation, we end up repeating the same actions over and over again, with no desire to experiment with alternatives. From a technical point of view, the problems are also evident. The general feeling conveyed by the interface is that of a flash game, with transitions between menus cut with an axe. The logic with which the various buttons have been distributed is instead good, as is their integration with the graphic elements. If you don't follow the tutorial it can be difficult to understand some functions, but this is more a problem of player laziness than of the game. Less successful are the designs of the characters, which have an amateurish flavor both in terms of anatomy and colouring. They are not horrendous and, given that we are talking about a management system, they are not even fundamental, but much more could have been done. Instead, let's spread a pitiful veil over the music, which defining it as ugly is a compliment.", "date": "2017-05-15", "grade": "6.0"}
