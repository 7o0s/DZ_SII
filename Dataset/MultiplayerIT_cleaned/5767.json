The title developed by Stoic Studio is a small jewel funded on Kickstarter, released in 2014 on PC, immediately making itself appreciated by lovers of turn-based strategy. After a few months, The Banner Saga then arrived on Android and iOS tablets, where as we have seen it managed to appear quite well thanks to the adaptation work carried out by the developers. Two years after its original release, at the beginning of 2016 the time has become ripe to complete the list of platforms on which The Banner Saga is available: for a few days now, the game has also arrived on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, through their respective virtual stores. We therefore took advantage of the opportunity to return once again between Humans and Varl on the Sony home console: let's see how it went. The Banner Saga arrives on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One two years after its PC release There's a human, a varl, and a dredge For some additional general details on The Banner Saga, we refer you to the review of the PC version, limiting ourselves here only to remembering the essentials on Stoic Studio's effort, for the benefit of those who should only hear about it now for the first time. The protagonists of the story move their steps on a world populated by three different races: Humans, Varl and Dredge. The former are exactly as we would expect them, while the latter are giants created by one of the many gods who populate the mythology of The Banner Saga, strongly influenced by the Nordic one: it is no coincidence that the Varl's features closely resemble those of the Viking populations. While putting up with each other with difficulty, humans and Varl unite in an alliance to fight against the Dredge, managing to confine their common enemy to the far north after a great war. The adventure begins when the Dredge return to the charge, at the same time when the sun seems to have gone out and the world suffers from the cold: Humans and Varl thus find themselves once again on the edge of the precipice, forced to renew their alliance to deal with the threat. In terms of gameplay, The Banner Saga is divided into two parts: in the first we are shown a caravan that includes the protagonists together with their army, busy moving between the various places that make up the excellent setting, while in the second we drive the own forces in the fights carried out through a turn-based system. The decisions we make between one battle and another contribute to the definition of the story of The Banner Saga, outlined by the developers in its main features but influenced in detail by the choices made by the player during his game. These are decisions that are often not easy, where sometimes we have to choose the lesser evil even going so far as to decree the life or death of those who are with us. Playstation 4 trophies The Banner Saga has a total of 40 trophies, of which 1 platinum, 5 gold, 5 silver and 29 bronze. Many of them can be collected normally as the game progresses, but to collect them all you may need to complete the adventure more than once. For example, we find an objective that asks us to get a certain character unscathed to the end, while another can be caught by reaching a certain percentage of progress after a predefined number of days in the game. From mouse to pad On PlayStation 4, The Banner Saga remains exactly as we remembered it. The passage on the console was in fact delayed due to problems with the external team that had to deal with it, but the contents remain the same as we have already seen on PC and tablet. However, this does not mean that there are no elements to exploit: crossing the world created by Stoic Studio proves to be even more a feast for the eyes, thanks to the passage from the monitor to the television, guaranteeing an even greater impact to the drawn backdrops and parallax effects on which the caravan moves. After all, the excellent artistic vein of The Banner Saga had already been highlighted at the time of the first review, and the presence of larger screens allows us to appreciate it even more. However, increasing the number of inches also brings with it a downside, represented by the presence of a text composed of characters with dimensions that tend to be a little too small, inherited from the PC version where this was not a problem. So pay attention to the distance you will have from your TV, because you may find it difficult to read in some cases. Moving on to the controls, we must say that the system is presenton PC it remains the one we were most comfortable with playing The Banner Saga. The migration from mouse to pad does not prove painless: performing some operations proves to be a bit too cumbersome, making it difficult to get used to some steps even after having accumulated a few hours of play. As for the audio, the soundtrack signed by Austin Wintory always continues to shine, recently listened to with his compositions also thanks to Assassin's Creed Syndicate.", "date": "2016-01-19", "grade": "8.5"}
