{"name": "Moto GP'06 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/moto-gp06-recensione.html", "text": "Run Run. The structure of Moto GP'06 is the canonical one created by Climax. You create a rider from scratch, customizing his bike, overalls and helmet as you like, and throw him into the fray of the World Championship. At each grand prix, 4 skill points are won, which can be distributed as desired to increase the qualities that best suit your driving style. With the best results known drivers and additional tracks are unlocked, in mirror mode or from the road championships (called Extreme) available as extra modes, for a total of four tournaments. Each grand prix can be tackled with free practice, with qualifying or directly by launching into the race. For each route there are also challenges to overcome, i.e. individual tests, usually timed, which involve the distinctive and most difficult points of the various tracks and which, if overcome, entitle you to additional skill points. The approach is not the simplest, the Moto GPs have a nervous and precise behavior and, especially from the second level of difficulty, I will immediately be a good result to be able to finish the circuits in the leading positions, whereas at the easier level they can immediately obtain excellent placings. The problem is that even this incarnation of the Climax game suffers from an old vice of the genre, the completely approximate artificial intelligence of the opponents. In fact, the pilots line up along invisible tracks from which it is impossible to derail them and which lead them to run over anything that gets in their way. one can only be sucked into an exciting racing game, which calls one game after another until late at night Run Run. Usually it's us and our poor rider, who, as soon as he takes a bend with a minimum of extra caution, is unceremoniously thrown to the ground by the adversaries who remain bold in the saddle and do nothing to try to avoid a collision. The advent of the next gen could have been a good time to give a decisive turn to problems like this. In addition to the championships, the courses can be tackled individually and overcoming them immediately gives access to the extra courses of the road championships, even more spectacular and arcade-like. Among other things, the curiosity remains to know why the developers made the championships of the Extreme classes available only after the completion of the Moto GP, given that the easier approach would have greatly helped the approach to the game of those who have never had occasion to try it before. Once entered, however, in harmony with the driving model and having taken note of the skill of the CPU, one can only be sucked into an exciting racing game, which calls one game after another until late at night and which with Xbox support Live will massacre converts in the coming months. Author photography The images accompanying this article are an absolutely faithful rendering of the appearance of Moto GP'06 on any HD screen in circulation. The fact, however, is that from these photos you don't notice the problems that afflict the fluidity of the game in some situations and of Vsync, usually in the 90 curves crowded with riders who jostle to get out with the front wheel further forward. Moto GP, unfortunately, suffers from some frame rate drops in the most chaotic situations that plunge the heights of the magnificent 60fps towards far less glorious abyss. You get used to it, the fun is unchanged, but it's a real shame because certain glimpses (the wet asphalt and the menacing sky reflected in it are memorable ed) are breathtaking and, if the details on the track and of the stands are only partially improved compared to previous editions, the lights, colors and models of motorcycles and riders are the most realistic ever seen around. Different speech should be made for the audio sector, which offers a standard effects system, combined with a far from exciting musical selection, made up of second-hand techno and hard rock bases. Another partially negative note is that linked to the uploads that seemed to us very long on more than one occasion, up to 40/50 seconds between a menu and the start of a race. Goals In Moto GP'06 the by now canonical 1000 points are distributed over 24 objectives, each of them, therefore, full of satisfactions for those who want to increase their Gamertag. We must be careful, however, since to be able to unlock even the first ones, it takes some time, since they refer to the completion of the championships, for the most part. Comment Moto GP '06, in Climax's intentions, probably should have been Moto GP 3 multiplied by two, a true manifesto of their next-gen engine with more content, greater longevity, the rosters updated for the current season(finally!) and a technical sector to scream. The programmers have come close, and if on the one hand they give life to the sequel to what remains one of the best driving simulations on two wheels, on the other they get carried away by publishing a product with a few too many flaws. In fact, the 60 frames per second of Moto GP'06 are as impressive on the straight as they are uncertain in the most demanding corners, the loads are too long, and the artificial intelligence of the opponents is anchored to old problems of the genre. Having said that, the THQ title is an exciting game, with great longevity, and which will not fail to leave you speechless on more than one occasion, especially in front of an HD television. For anyone looking for a racing title to spend the summer on Xbox Live, Moto GP'06 is a must buy. Pros: Long and compelling Live success almost guaranteed Breathtaking motorbikes and centaurs Cons: The 60fps are too inconsistent Artificial intelligence that can be improved The debut of Climax on Xbox 360 also coincides with that of their new engine, designed to bring racing games to a level of realism not even imaginable before. A business card, therefore, but also the new exponent of a saga that marked the explosion of Xbox Live and which will now try to make its mark in a much richer and more varied panorama, but in which players do not forget the emotions try over the years. This is Moto GP'06, an enriched, pumped and shiny version of one of the most popular two-wheeled racing games out there. The photos of these months had made us wait for an unparalleled marvel, but, in fact, we found a fun and spectacular game in our hands, which, precisely on the technical side, shows its side to some criticisms that prevent it from reaching the qualitative peaks to which it could easily aspire.", "date": "2006-06-16", "grade": null}
