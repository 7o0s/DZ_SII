{"name": "Immortality", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/immortality-recensione.html", "text": "Marissa Marcel was a great promise of cinema. She made her debut in the world of advertising, like many actresses before her, before being cast in 1968 for the film ~Ambrosio~ by director Arthur Fischer, in which she played the role of Matilda. Unfortunately, the film was never released in theaters. In 1970, Marcel landed another role in the film ~Minsky~ by John Durick, a first-time director who had been Ambrosio's cinematographer. This film also never made it to theaters. Years passed and Marcel disappeared from circulation, until at least 1999, when she returned to the set of a new film by Durick, Two of Everything. Sadly, Durick's death stalled that film as well. Nothing has been heard of Marcel since then. In 2020, however, the films with the footage of the three works re-emerged. The Half Mermaid development studio therefore decided to scan them in high definition and create software to try to reconstruct them, so as to better preserve them and not let Marcel's memory die. Whether or not it is worth taking on the task of restorer of the three films you can find out by reading the review of Immortality, the new masterpiece by Sam Barlow. In the role of fitters Why were Marcel's three films never released? What we have given you in the previous paragraph are a good part of the information that the developers themselves are keen to let the player know before he begins his reconstruction work. They are very important because they contain some of the fundamental questions that immediately push you to evaluate what you are doing with a different eye. For example, it is inevitable to wonder why the films have never arrived in theaters and why Marissa does not seem aged a day when she reappeared in 1999. The assumptions themselves are intriguing enough, but starting the game you immediately realize that there's probably a lot more to discover, even if you don't quite know that yet. After all, something must have happened, otherwise why would we be here? As in Her Story and Telling Lies, Barlow's two previous titles, in Immortality the interface is really bare bones. Basically we have the tools to watch movies, rewind or forward them at different speeds (even frame by frame), stop them and select the details that interest us. The latter make us automatically jump to another sequence. It seems to be in an old editing room, in front of a moviola, with also the possibility of seeing the collection of uncovered clips, which can be ordered in various ways, and that of selected details. There is nothing more. Then, one of the shot clips opens, looks at its content and chooses which detail to click on: the face of an actor, a smile, an object in the scenario that is considered interesting, anything that is interactive, and one arrives at the clip destination, where the entire procedure is repeated. It is important to specify that the destination clip is not always the same, i.e. clicking twice on the same detail does not mean that you arrive at the same clip. There is usually a transition to a similar object. For example, clicking on Marissa's face is likely to take you to another clip with Marissa, while clicking on a snake used in Ambrosio may take you to a snake-shaped earring worn by an actress from Two of Everything, but there they can also be surprises. In this way the game manages the progression of the discovery in a particularly intelligent way, always giving us new clips to watch (in total there are about two hundred), but returning from time to time to the clips already discovered, in order to remind us that maybe we got lost for road something. An immersive experience Marissa Marcel was a promise of cinema Be that as it may, understanding the very few game mechanics is really very easy, also because learning how to manipulate clips is only the first step towards something that ends up captivating you in a total way. Because at some point you get lost in those decomposed images and select one detail after another, watching and replaying the same clips, until you're satisfied. Every sequence, even the most banal, always seems to suggest something to you, even if you often don't know exactly what. The perception is that of actually being in your hands the footage of three films that have never been distributed and of being in an editing room (after all, isn't editing the essence of cinema?). Yes, because the strength of Immortality is in its continuous stimulation, in making you actually feel in the role assigned to you by the developers, almost as if it were a film historian's task, to then change radically and transform itself, making it more central the investigative part. Movies are interesting to them Without even realizing it, you find yourself investigating an even greater mystery and trying to penetrate something secret and unfinished, which drags you even further into the vortex of research, making you use the tools given in an alternative way. Immortality at this point widens and makes you understand that the story you are watching is not only that of Marissa, but also that of Durick and other characters that we do not mention so as not to spoil the surprise. You know perfectly well that there won't be certain answers in those never-edited film fragments and you also know that you won't find a definitive solution in what is hidden behind them, but you can't help but be shipwrecked in this sea of images that begin to speak a different language to you, in a certain sense more videogame-like, right there where you begin to understand that the videogame is taking place above all in your head and that you have entered a kind of stream of consciousness which makes the images that appear on the screen look like gods ghosts of the unconscious; the fragments of something that we can imagine recomposed, but whose essence we will never be able to grasp. The found clips form a navigable wall in various ways You become the tool of the game and the game begins to reflect who you are. The details you have selected form a wall showing your intuitions, your attempts and, why not, even your specific interests. You understand that the chain of objects in front of you says much more about you than you would like to admit. You continue to play developing a strong attraction for the mystery hidden by those spurious sequences, however realizing that certain events will never really be explained because, despite having happened in front of a camera, they have shaped a life that has remained outside of it and have been determined by a force acting on it. Conclusions Some sequences are particularly evocative Too bad I can't go into more detail on what happens while playing, in terms of narrative, because it's part of the reason why Immortality is an absolute masterpiece, with Barlow once again proving to be one of the few authors capable of making people interact sensibly with the cutscenes, creating sandboxes that require the player's active participation to be fully appreciated. It must be said that the game exerts its spell on several levels, one of which is that of the fascination created by the material we are looking at, created with great care to give the illusion of being the footage of three films of their era. Therefore, in most of the sequences we can see the opening and closing clappers of the scene, some sequences are real auditions, others see the actors reading their lines together with the director around a table. Then there are television interviews, moments of celebration and private scenes, which serve as narrative links to understand some passages. The meta references are many Depending on the film, the footage has different textures and colors, creating a remarkable lifelike effect. Even the actors are all very good and partially perfect, starting from Manon Gage, Marcel's interpreter, really perfect in the role, up to Carlotta Mohlin, who gigantic every time she appears on the screen, whose role. The bottom line is that we see no reason why you shouldn't experience Immortality, other than perhaps outright hatred of the type of experience.", "date": "2022-08-30", "grade": "9.5"}
