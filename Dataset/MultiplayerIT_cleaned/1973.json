{"name": "Chessmaster 9000", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/chessmaster-9000.html", "text": "Chess for everyone. An astonishing thing about this title is the large, very large slice of public that this product could interest: from the person who does not know how to move a tower, to the one who, in order to fall asleep, goes over the openings studied at the time by the great Hungarian theorist Adorjan. Obviously learning to play chess from scratch is certainly not a simple and painless thing and there is no chess game, pardon, chess simulation that holds: learning the game of chess requires a lot of time, a lot of dedication and a lot, a lot of time; in addition of course to a lot of dedication. The first time you launch the game you will be asked to enter a new user profile. Each user profile will be characterized by your personal data and, above all, by your chess rating. If you do not know your rating, it will be possible to determine it based on the answers given to some very simple questions. Once you have set your level, therefore, you can choose the virtual opponent that best suits you. There are dozens of virtual personalities each with its own characteristics, the most ~fearful~, the most audacious, the ~slowest~ (in the sense that, if you deem it appropriate, Chessmaster will also simulate our opponent's Brainstorming time) the most acculturated (in the sense that he will be able to access the closures database for less) etc etc etc. For example, if you say you barely know the rules, and play a couple of times a year, your ~ideal~ opponent would be a freckled 9-year-old. Instead, claiming to be a by now experienced frequenter of the most exclusive chess clubs in the city, an expert and charming blonde could happen to you with an aggressive attitude and very cultured openings. Let's learn the game ... Have you never played a game of chess - or almost - in your life? There are no problems, as already mentioned above, even if you can fully appreciate some of the more advanced features only having several years of chess experience behind you, CM9000 provides a large section dedicated to the education and refinement of the willing Kasparov aspirants budding. A course divided into 21 lessons (complete with practical and theoretical lessons), suggestions on how to set up your mental attitude during games, an archive of the most important games ever played, ~one shot~ quizzes (which appear at every Startup of the game like Tips of Day) on how to find the best fork or checkmate in a single move and a lot of other documentation will be available to the player: both the more layman and the more expert looking for valuable suggestions to refine their technique by analyzing the games played and consulting the comments and evaluating the possible alternatives or, more simply, to satisfy one's historical and technical curiosities. Too bad that all this goodness is only available in English (the only thing translated into Italian, in fact, is the game manual), so if, for example, you plan to buy the game to introduce your little son to the arcane pleasures of checkmate, first make sure he's good at school in foreign languages. ... and we refine our technique. For experts, however, the real beating heart of CM9000 will mostly reside in the ~study room~ of their games and in the challenge mode which will have its peak in the Tournament which will allow us to compete against dozens of virtual players to get where no one had gone before: the legendary challenge with the now mythological Chessmaster. It is almost superfluous to point out how the algorithms used by the CM9000 combined with the enormous database from which they can draw information and the enormous computing powers of today's PCs, make attempts to beat our computerized opponents, at higher difficulty levels, real own titanic feats. Once you learn how to play, or once you get tired of the fact that at the highest level the computer is literally unbeatable, at least for us humans, you can connect to the free service provided by Ubisoft and challenge hundreds if not thousands of other human players, each with a pre-established rating based on the performance achieved during online and offline matches. In this way, finding your ideal opponent (no, you understood, I don't mean the one that is easy to beat) is extremely simple and fast. Check mate! As already made clear more than once, if you want to avvicinate in the world of chess or if you are passionate but do not yet have a copy of the previous Chessmasters then the purchase is a must. It is a pity that the title is not in Italian, so much wisdom will be usable only by those who have at least a minimum of familiarity with the Albion language. Of course, if you are only interested in playing a few games every now and then, the game will still be more than usable, but it would be a crime not to be able to draw information from the well-stocked virtual library offered by this title. However, it is useless to beat around the bush: the essence of computer chess, there is no doubt, is here before our eyes. At the ~consumer~ level, only Fritz 7 could compete with the Ubisoft product, but, at least in Italy, it is not easily available and it is certainly much less user-friendly than Chessmaster. Perhaps Fritz 7 has a more powerful calculation engine on its side than ~The King~ (the game engine implemented by Chessmaster) but, unless some of you with a surname do Karpov, this is really the least of our worries. However, if you are not interested in chess at all and are just looking for a title that can make you want: save your money, dedicate yourself to Tetris and put your mind at peace. For those who already have Chessmaster 8000 the dilemma is even more Hamletic. Will an even more powerful engine, the introduction of the new closing moves database, the 3D chessboards and greater compatibility with Windows XP be enough to justify the purchase? Look inside and answer yourself: the stopwatch has started. Chessmaster 9000. The front of the Chessmaster 9000 box immediately dispels any doubts: ~The most famous chess simulation in the world~. From now on forget the noun game except for the simulated game of chess. Then forget those ~nice~ titles inspired by the game of chess, which were in fashion a few years ago, where our pawns took on anthropomorphic features and came alive, giving life, during the capture of a piece, to nice skits that amused the first two times and bored for the rest of their lives. The maximum audio/visual graphical marvel that you will be able to experience playing Chessmaster is when you can turn over your beautiful chessboard, for the first in the history of the series, totally three-dimensional  and that's saying it all. But this is not to be considered a defect, CM9000 does not want to distract from its main objective: the simulation of the game of chess, let's see together how it wants to do it.", "date": "2002-10-19", "grade": null}
