Or is it an (almost) completely new game, unknown to most gamers and feebly preserved in the memory of only the less young? In the case of Pikmin 3 the answer is not so simple; because if it is true that the second episode appeared in prehistoric 2004 on the Gamecube, it should also be remembered that the latter was more recently republished together with the debut of the franchise on the Wii within the ~New Play Control!~ taking advantage of a very valid new interface via Wiimote. But it is above all the interminable production cycle of Pikmin 3 that has kept the name of a series that has been deeply loved by Nintendo users right from the start on the players' lips and on the pages of sector magazines. As many will know, this third release was in fact initially born on the previous home hardware of the Kyoto house, only to be diverted to Wii U further lengthening its development. However, the conclusion of this endless wait has finally arrived, in the middle of the hot summer of 2013. Those who do it themselves make for three Asking Pikmin 3 to take on the role of the killer app capable of boosting the hitherto disappointing sales of the new Nintendo console would be a huge mistake; in fact, none of the episodes released previously has even remotely crossed the milestone of 2 million copies sold, settling instead on good numbers but necessarily as a ~minor~ franchise of the Kyoto house. However, one can certainly ask it, as in the intentions of Iwata and associates, to be the first relevant game of a second generation of titles hopefully capable of quantitatively and qualitatively increasing a software park that has actually been too weak up to now. The plot that forms the background to the events, strong in an ecological theme that has always been present in the franchise, sees as protagonists three clumsy astronauts (Alph, Brittany and Charlie) from the planet Koppai, engaged in an extreme and desperate attempt to find somewhere in the galaxy a place capable of guaranteeing those food resources that are scarce in the native place due to population growth. A research that at the very last attempt leads to the discovery of the planet PNF-404, the same as in the previous chapters, which is actually our Earth of a distant future in which men have become extinct. However, this does not mean that it is an uninhabited place, far from it; in fact, the Pikmin live together with various species of hostile creatures, small half-animal and half-vegetable beings with different abilities but united by an extraordinary servility towards the protagonists. Although Captain Olimar, the hero of the first two episodes, does not represent the player's alter ego again (but this does not mean that he is absent...), the formula and structure of the gameplay of Pikmin 3 practically completely follows the one offered with the first two releases. A familiarity destined to reduce the learning curve to a minimum for anyone who has already had experience with the series in the past, even more so if with the Wii re-editions also characterized by the same control scheme via Wiimote + Nunchuck. In fact, in many ways, Pikmin 3 seems to reset these 9 years of distance from its predecessor while essentially keeping the original formula and the ~made in Nintendo~ strategic structure almost intact; the goal remains to explore the various areas numerous times, using the qualities of the different categories of creatures to collect fruit, solve environmental puzzles and fight enemies. Although initially you can only have the red pikmin, averagely strong and able to resist fire, as the game progresses you will also be able to control the yellow ones (resistant to electricity and can be thrown higher), the blue ones (the only ones able to enter the water), the gray ones (to break through barriers, armor and the like) and the pink ones (small and flying). Unlike Pikmin 2 however, here all pikmin races are born and can be ~enclosed~ in the onion, making their management easier and more direct. Pikmin 3 is a great refinement of the original formula, but something is missing from the excellence Pikmin at my service We were talking about fruit, because contrary to Pikmin 2 in which Olimar had to collect ~exotic~ objects such as batteries and floppy disks to resell, in this case the needs of the trio of protagonists are much more concretely linked to the need to feed themselves and their own hungry people. Scattered across the four play areas are a total of 66 different fruits, which once brought back to the space shuttle are squeezeduti and processed into juice then enclosed in flasks. Every single bottle is in practice a ~life~, translated into the possibility of visiting one of the game areas for another day; yes, because Pikmin 3 hasn't abandoned the concept of the day, which in a nutshell translates into a certain number of minutes that the player has available to perform the actions he prefers. In addition to the urgency of having to maximize the yield of the limited time guaranteed, this also affects the need to have all the pikmin in the recovery area or at the commands of a captain before nightfall; otherwise, any creature left alone will be doomed to a gruesome death in the jaws of some predator. Despite being so compelling and severe, the time limit never really represents an excessive source of frustration in the face of food supplies that are certainly not difficult to collect in abundance; rather therefore it constitutes a stimulus to optimize one's actions, losing as little as possible in dead times and concentrating one's productivity in the best possible way. It is therefore precisely in this key that what is undoubtedly the main and most consistent novelty of Pikmin 3 is inserted, or precisely the ability to control 3 captains simultaneously; although this possibility was present in a rather sketchy form in the second chapter, with the couple Olimar and Louie, it is here that it gains maturity revealing itself not as an option but often as a necessity. The simplicity with which you can switch instantly by simply pressing a key from one captain to another allows in fact to maximize ~multitasking~, i.e. the execution of different operations simultaneously even in totally different areas of the level; an intriguing and stimulating collaboration which, once mastered, leads to truly rewarding gameplay automatisms and solutions. In this sense, the touch screen of the GamePad plays a key role, expressing its greater usefulness in the possibility of tracing paths on the game map that the captain in question will go through independently, thus reaching the precise area that has been indicated to him . Although the management of automatic movements via the GamePad pauses the game, thus making it potentially and ideally feasible even through a normal menu on the TV, the use of the touch screen makes the operation much faster, more comfortable and more pleasant. The Wii U controller can also be used to recall previously collected hints, to view the map, your own ~collection~ of harvested fruit and the like. Finally, there is the possibility of using the GamePad as a real camera to take beautiful images from the point of view of one of the captains, to be saved or sent to the Miiverse. We have deliberately talked about the use of the controller in its ~support~ function; in fact, although it is perfectly possible to play Pikmin 3 exclusively with the ~paddone~, even possibly in mode with the TV off, the solution with Wiimote (better if Motion Plus) + Nunchuck is absolutely and indisputably preferable for convenience, precision and speed. As far as the management of one's own small army is concerned, the convenient option of making the group move around the leader (on GameCube via C Stick) has been abandoned; on the other hand, the ability to roll everyone to the left or right by pressing the relative direction on the digital cross was added, in such a way as to be able to escape from the most dangerous attacks. For the rest, however, the controls are largely identical to the previous chapters. 9 years is a long time Pikmin 3 will also be basically a game for the Wii, but graphically it really doesn't seem like it. Believing that a good part of the time that elapsed between moving the project to Wii U and its publication was spent by the team in optimizing the technical component is in fact more than legitimate when looking at the final result: it is above all the use of lighting and effects to be appreciated, but more generally it is the whole micro world that is more alive, detailed, brilliant and rich than ever. Considering the specific weight that the setting and its charm have within the entire Pikmin experience, this is an improvement of considerable importance that is appreciated during every moment of the adventure. Certainly there are some flaws such as lower quality textures (especially those of the ground) or some less refined models, but it is really difficult to complain about the graphics of Pikmin 3. The photo mode via GamePad then manages to return some exceptional glimpses, which case they're already filling up the Mii boardsJapanese verse and will certainly do the same in the West. Of particular value are the colossi, the enormous monsters destined to offer the most demanding fights but also the most rewarding ones. If therefore the Nintendo production is absolutely full of lights, unfortunately there are also some shadows that prevent us from reaching peaks of absolute excellence. The main perplexity is very simply linked to the amount of content present; in fact, there are only 4 areas of the planet that can be explored during the main adventure, to which a fifth is added which hosts the final fight which, however, for a whole series of reasons (which we avoid describing so as not to spoil the surprise) is shorter. it doesn't have to be approached in the same way and it doesn't contain fruits to reap. Although the four zones are decidedly large, demanding, well-structured and absolutely prone to numerous and repeated visits to be able to complete them 100% (the latter factor in any case not necessary to finish the game), it is inevitable to believe that the total is rather modest for a product with such a long development cycle. For veterans of the series who want to go straight to the end credits without collecting everything, in fact, about ten hours will be enough to watch the final sequence. A small disappointment which is then added to the actual quality of the final level, from our point of view decidedly subdued compared to the rest of the package. More generally, however, the level design could have developed with puzzles able to take greater advantage of the collaboration between the 3 protagonists, which instead becomes very rarely necessary. A note should also be made to the artificial intelligence of the pikmin; while their total dedication and submission to the captains' commands is perfectly acceptable, occasionally seeing some stuck on walls or corners of the stage unable to follow in the leader's footsteps is a bit annoying. Finally, some more attention could perhaps also have been paid to the development of the plot which, although completely marginal, is narrated almost exclusively via trivial and simple text screenshots. The extras deserve a description, divided into Missions and Bingo; the former, as can be deduced, are precisely short timed sections in which it is necessary to achieve objectives in order to obtain an evaluation in the form of a medal. Faced both in single and in local multiplayer, they are undoubtedly the ideal place for the more experienced to express their skills to the fullest, above all due to the fact that it is precisely here that the element of contemporary use of the three captains acquires greater value and importance . Among other things, the white and purple Pikmin make their welcome reappearance in the missions, directly from the second chapter, thus bringing the overall total of the races present in the game to as many as 7. Finally, Bingo is an exquisitely multiplayer variant for two users that mixes classic gameplay with the need to collect certain objects and fruits to fill a bingo-type card.", "date": "2013-07-22", "grade": "9.0"}
