We therefore arrive at the review of Car Mechanic Simulator for Nintendo Switch with the spirit it takes to become expert car repairers, after wearing our overalls and ready to get our hands dirty, fixing all the engines that we find ourselves in front of. Before opening the hood, let's remember that Car Mechanic Simulator is a brand that has already existed on PC for some years, the platform from which it started before arriving on portable devices and now also on Nintendo Switch. Historically, the Polish team Red Dot Games took care of it, which, however, passed the ball to its compatriot ECC Games for the creation of the additional versions. As we're about to see, the similarity to the game for Android and iOS makes Car Mechanic Simulator for Nintendo Switch an extremely simplified game compared to what's on PC, and therefore much less interesting. The gameplay: buy, repair, resell The cycle underlying the dynamics of Car Mechanic Simulator can be perfectly summarized with the three words you read above. In fact, our goal is to go around the barns looking for old and rickety cars, putting them back on track before selling them to raise cash and start the tour again. The activity at the heart of Car Mechanic Simulator therefore starts from the repair of the external bodywork, which can be done by rotating the right analog stick until rust and other imperfections go away. A practice that may perhaps only be nice the first time it is implemented, but which already starting from the fourth or fifth car becomes boring and rather an end in itself. A more or less similar argument should be made for the second part of the repair, which can be accessed by viewing the internal structure of the engine. In the view we are shown the pieces to be changed, with the possibility of entering the disassembly mode to remove them. However, you don't have to try too hard to figure out what needs to be removed, since it soon becomes clear that with a little button mashing it is possible to disassemble everything that needs to be disassembled, and then enter the virtual shop and buy the pieces that we have to replace. The only effort to make is therefore to remember which parts we need, before returning to the assembly mode to apply the reverse procedure to the one described previously. In the light of the above, it is really hard to identify what the playful component of Car Mechanic Simulator for Nintendo Switch is, in which even a decent progression system is missing: before getting our hands on more complex cars we will have to gain experience with at least a dozen basic models, even if in reality getting slightly more particular machines things change very little. Graphics and sound: hammer in the ears Graphically, Car Mechanic Simulator offers a decent representation of the cars we're repairing, at least for the Nintendo Switch screen in handheld mode. Once the external rust repair has been completed, it is possible to choose between the different colors made available to us, trying them in turn to decide which of them is the most appealing. The fact that this activity is perhaps the funniest one in the entire game is indicative. The inside view offers detail on the engine parts only, which also includes the drive shaft and rear end, increasing with pieces and build complexity as the car models we repair get bigger. The fact that we go from utility cars to sports cars unfortunately remains an end in itself, given that as already mentioned, it is enough to always press the usual button to disassemble everything without worries, thus ignoring the complexity of the car we have under the knife. In the internal view, the possibility of ~exploding~ the composition of the engine is nice, thus displaying all the pieces separately from the others. The zoom management needs to be reviewed completely, given that by rotating the camera you often end up leaving a part of the engine out of the frame, thus making it very impractical to view the parts from the angles we would like. Like a large part of Car Mechanic Simulator, the audio sector is also seriously insufficient: in fact, we always find the same music to accompany us, which in the long run is less and less bearable.", "date": "2019-03-04", "grade": "7.3"}
