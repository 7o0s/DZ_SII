{"name": "TOCA Race Driver 3 Challenge - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/toca-race-driver-3-challenge-recensione.html", "text": "The TOCA series made its debut way back in 1997, on PC and PSone, with the idea of offering an alternative to purely arcade racing games as well as strictly simulation ones. A winning choice, judging by the number of sequels that have been developed over the years, with the game arriving on next-generation consoles expected in July. The latest multi-platform installment, TOCA Race Driver 3, came out in 2006 and boasts on and off road racing as well as a large number of tracks and cars, with the usual gameplay splitting between arcade and realism in the most balanced way possible. For this PSP version, the developers Codemasters have not limited themselves to adding the word ~Challenge~ to the title, but have created a new career mode that makes challenges, in fact, its main subject. World Challenge The TOCA Race Driver 3 Challenge start screen allows us to try our hand at a quick game (with random parameters), access the ~world challenge~ mode, play a free race or a time trial. Where the latter corresponds to the various ~time attacks~ present in almost all racing games, the ~free race~ does not have the connotations of the single event, but can be configured as a real tournament in which races in sequence after selecting a vehicle from those available. We will be able to race on more than thirty real tracks (even famous ones, such as Silverstone or Laguna Seca) using more than thirty different cars, but to have all this choice we will have to deal with the mode that most of all characterizes this episode for PSP: the ~ world challenge~. It is a very particular alternative to the classic career, divided into five difficulty levels that must be unlocked gradually. Within each one, we will find a variable number of challenges that closely resemble the famous Gran Turismo ~licence tests~: we will have to follow a specific trajectory on the track, or stop in the indicated areas, or even maintain a certain average speed for all the way. Once these tests have been passed, we will move on to the standard phases, i.e. qualifying sessions leading to a championship that will become more full-bodied and complex as we climb the difficulty levels. The two multiplayer modes also act as a side dish, which allow us to challenge a friend by sharing the game (let's be prepared for long uploads, however) or organize challenges for up to twelve players, each in possession of a copy of TOCA. On the track! As mentioned above, one of the strengths of the series has always been the control system, also understood as car management: a mix that gives a nod to realism while granting leniency on more than one occasion. We will never be able to tackle the corners at full throttle, unless they are quite wide, and therefore we will have to manage braking in the best possible way. If we finish long, we'll have to take any escape route until we can regain the track, but we'll rarely end up blocked in such a way as to compromise the outcome of the race. A ~permissive~ approach, therefore, which on the other hand demands the maximum effort from the player to ensure that even a single overtaking is carried out: the opponents rarely make mistakes in setting the curves and have the only defect of never being unscrupulous, so we will have to find the best lines and cut every hairpin to make up ground or build an advantage. Other elements also appear under the sign of realism, such as damage to the car and fuel consumption, which force us to plan pit stops to be able to cross the finish line without having to push the car on foot. The controls on PSP have been optimized and allow extensive customization: you can drive in the most classic way, steering with the analog stick and accelerating with X, but you can also activate the automatic gearbox (to be managed using the back buttons) and, you can even flip the screen vertically, to control acceleration and braking with the analog stick while using the steering buttons. Technical realization The graphics of this PSP version of TOCA Race Driver are decent, even if they are far from representing the best that the Sony portable console can do. It is as if the developers had worked a bit with the handbrake on, to stay on topic, and one can realize this right from the animated sequences that introduce the various events, and which show off polygonal models so simple that they seem to belong to an older generation. Once on the track there is more quantity than quality, in the sense that detail is lacking, especially as regards the scenarios, but we have a large number of cars on the track at the same timeeach one displaying plausible behavior, sometimes even violent. If the construction of the cars is good, complete with a driver in sight who moves inside, the same cannot be said of the frame rate, which constantly loses shots and never reaches the fluidity of the best PSP racers. There is also a lack in the number of camera views, focusing on the first person ones while missing a rear shot at a certain distance. The sound sector can count on a large number of effects, with the rumbles reproduced in a rather realistic way and with some of the typical noises of a car race. Comment TOCA Race Driver 3 arrives on PSP and for the occasion Codemasters decides to revolutionize it by introducing a decidedly atypical career mode, made up of challenges that justify the word ~Challenge~ in the title. The gaming system is the same as always, tested, which sees an excellent mix between realism and fun, and which manages to bring out the best in the player: to win it is not enough to maintain a clean driving, you have to guess the right trajectory and cut the curves. So on the one hand there is excellent playability and an effective control system, customizable down to the smallest detail (you can even play with the PSP upside down...), on the other hand a far from spectacular technical achievement, in which the frame rate drops are ordinary administration and the level of detail is not the highest that has ever been seen in a video game, quite the contrary. More than anything, however, the doubts arise precisely about the ~world challenge~ mode: unlike a standard career mode, we will have to proceed ~on tracks~ and do what the game asks of us, venting the our desires about the car to drive or the track to race on. Ultimately, TOCA Race Driver 3 Challenge for PSP stands as a valid but atypical racer in structure, recommended for those who want to take a break from classic racing games. Pros: Customizable control system down to the smallest detail Good number of cars, excellent number of tracks Atypical career mode... Cons: ...maybe too much Frame rate subject to continuous drops No real career mode", "date": "2008-04-14", "grade": null}
