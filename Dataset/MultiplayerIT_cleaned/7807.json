Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. You will certainly ask yourself the question sometimes: what would you do if suddenly a zombie invasion really happened? The idea of barricading yourself at home is probably the first that springs to mind, but what if that's not possible? What if you find yourself in the middle of a road, riding a scooter, just as the undead are invading the city? The only way to survive would be to push on the gas and hope to be able to reach a safe place soon. These are the assumptions of Dead Ahead, the new horizontal scrolling endless runner for iOS devices developed by Mobirate, the team behind Parking Mania, and produced by Chillingo. The game can be downloaded for free from the App Store, in a universal version compatible with iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, and features short advertising screens that can be eliminated by paying 89 cents or left there, given that they do not limit way the experience. As you will have understood, in this title our goal is to last as long as possible, as in any product of the genre, trying to dose the acceleration of the two wheels we control to avoid too rapid sliding of the obstacles that arrive from the side right of the screen and that we must avoid at all costs, under penalty of game over. The control system is completely based on the touch screen and has two possible configurations which however fall within the same basic setting, which sees the right thumb responsible for determining the direction of the vehicle and the left thumb which can operate the accelerator and the button to open the fire towards the zombies chasing us and trying to grab us. After all, a pistol or a light machine gun is part of the standard equipment of any centaur... Run and shoot Let's say right away that Dead Ahead's biggest flaw lies in the lack of alternative options for the controls. Being forced to manage the direction of the bike with the right thumb automatically means covering a portion of the scenario, the very one from which the obstacles come, and therefore putting a spanner in the works on your own. Let's hope for an update that maybe offers an inverted layout. It must also be said that the approach to the genre appears a little too ~hasty~, with the games becoming too difficult too quickly and preventing you from being able to enjoy averagely long sessions of action. That said, the strengths of the title developed by Mobirate are numerous, starting with an excellent upgrade system, which involves the purchase or upgrade of new vehicles as well as new and more effective firearms. We start from the default scooter to get to enduro bikes, sidecars, choppers, quads, tourist bikes and even futuristic ones (with a clear homage to the feature film ~Akira~), while for weapons we will have a 9mm pistol, an uzi, a shotgun, a revolver, a light machine gun, a grenade launcher, an antique rifle, an assault rifle, a combat rifle and finally two girls who will automatically take care of shooting the zombies that are on our tail. Among the advantages of Dead Ahead we must also include the excellent pixel art-style graphics, full of characters who not only show off their jagged lines, paying homage to the era of 16-bit consoles, but also boast a set of animations rich and fluid, really convincing. Dead Ahead is an excellent endless runner, very well characterized from an aesthetic point of view", "date": "2013-06-01", "grade": "7.5"}
