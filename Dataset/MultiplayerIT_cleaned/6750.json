Making it now, after taking measurements for next-gen platforms with Black Flag, made perfect sense to us, although from a technical point of view the results have not lived up to expectations, with resolutions lower than 1080p and frame rates all the same. other than granite. While waiting for updates that at least settle the issue of fluidity on consoles, here we are, therefore, trying the game on PC, in the context in which the work of the French house can best express all its potential. There have been major controversies about Unity's performance on ultra-high-end configurations, in particular some complaining that they can't hit 60 frames per second even when using two GTX 980s in SLI. The review code arrived a little late and we therefore began the adventure coinciding with the release of the second patch (which should have solved part of these problems), without encountering the harshest critical issues and, on the contrary, appreciating the solidity of a system that even with AMD processors (notoriously less performing than their Intel counterparts, and not a little, from a gaming point of view) is consistent, devoid of those blunders that had instead characterized the launch of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag on the Windows platform . In detail Clearly the speech is commensurate with the graphic complexity of the game, which we can safely define as extraordinary, out of scale as regards the polygonal count and the objects moving simultaneously on the screen. There are sequences in Assassin's Creed Unity which are emblematic in this sense: strolling through the streets of a Paris ~besieged~ by its own inhabitants, gathered by the hundreds in a square or in front of one of the palaces of power, and then climbing to the top of one of the many splendid towers that embellish the profile of the French city, managing to see the same people in the distance from above and all the buildings in full detail, with no expedients of any kind to mask any defections. Inserting all this stuff and expecting it to move easily on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, whatever the resolution used, seems to us to be no small achievement for Ubisoft. On PC, where the only limit to performance is basically our wallet, the situation takes on different nuances and we need to think in frank and sincere terms: if you have a video card with less than 4 GB of RAM it will be difficult to run the game with dignity. even giving up the best presets. We found ourselves in a ~mixed~ situation, fresh from the purchase of a brand new NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 Jetstream but, at the same time, castrated (ouch!) by an AMD FX 8320 processor which on paper should offer superior performance to an Intel Core i5 high-end, but which in the ~alternative reality~ of gaming does much, much worse and acts as a real bottleneck. Sooner or later we will have to fix it. We were saying, a ~mixed~ situation but far from disastrous, indeed we honestly wondered if the story of the two GTX 980 in SLI was true. Without prejudice to the 1080p resolution and v-sync (which, activated or not, has little effect on performance, mysteriously), we observed two possible scenarios. In the first, keeping all the effects at maximum (therefore TXAA, soft shadows, HBAO+ and all the rest on ~very high~) and therefore without giving up anything, we gravitate around 40-45 frames per second, with peaks around 50 and plus in ~quiet~ situations and drops down to 30 frames per second when plunging into crowds. No moment of panic, no particular uncertainty. As mentioned, v-sync appears to have no impact on performance but turning it on helps eliminate the bit of tearing you notice during camera rotations, for example when syncing from a bell tower. Assassin's Creed on consoles has never run at more than 30 frames per second, which means that this of the 40-45 turns out to be a perfect size for the gameplay of the Ubisoft title, which doesn't really need a higher fluidity. However, there are a couple of tweaks to get towards 60 frames per second - just use FXAA anti-aliasing, turn off v-sync and set shadow quality to 'low'. In this way, you are playing at over 50 frames per second almost always without sacrificing the extraordinary visual impact of the game. The upcoming third patch, which will include an advanced tessellation function, capable of giving extra to surfaces, could further improve performance; however we wonder why the developers have not included, among the advanced graphics options, a slider to adjust the visual distance and/or one to increase or decrease the amount of people on the street, two elements that perhaps would have opened the doors of Assassin's Creed Unity even at mid-range configurations. Assassin's Creed Unity represents a step forward for the series, and on PC it's amazing to see Getting around Paris Having addressed the question of performance on PC, let's take stock of the general technical sector and the playful contents of the experience, which from whatever side you look at it stands as a step forward for the series. Paris is splendid, we have already said it, and in Assassin's Creed Unity it is rendered excellently, perhaps the most lively, dense and detailed city ever seen in a video game. We had no doubts about the construction of the architecture of the French capital, as this aspect has always been the flagship of the franchise; but in this case the extent of the scenery is astonishing, even more so because it is always visible from a distance when you reach a height to observe the panorama. The incredible amount of people who crowd the streets and squares have credible behaviors, there are situations that tend to repeat themselves (the pickpocket who flees, the criminal who threatens a resident) but they have been inserted into the context in a sensible way, creating a series of achievements that reward our intervention not immediately but after a certain number of times. It is not possible to explore the city on horseback, but there are the usual underground passages to allow us to quickly reach the opposite end of the map, and frankly the need for alternative solutions is not felt. Also because those who have always loved Assassin's Creed for its settings can only be fascinated by such a beautiful location, where moving around is a pleasure, whether it's walking down the street or running across the rooftops. Remaining in the field of movement, the work done by the developers in terms of motion capture is evident thanks to the support of a parkour expert, which makes Arno's animations much more varied and believable than his predecessors. What makes the difference is also the new control system, which starting from pressing the right trigger allows us to ~go up~ or ~down~ by pressing button A or button B respectively. This setting is not always successful, given that there are sometimes uncertainties, but the fact of being able to quickly descend from a building without necessarily taking a leap of faith is a very welcome novelty from a gameplay point of view. Returning for a moment to the technical sector, one cannot fail to mention the leading role played by a fantastic lighting system, which literally transforms the areas according to the time of day, and which enhances the transition from open to closed spaces so many buildings that it is possible to enter, for one reason or another. Promises kept There were specific requests that Assassin's Creed fans had made to Ubisoft so that the series could find its way back after the bastardization of some mechanics operated starting from Revelations and literally exploded in Black Flag. How many times have you died while storming a ship? Exactly, you hit the spot. From silent and lethal killers, over the years the Assassins have become Terminators capable of eliminating even one hundred opponents in combos without ever taking damage. A setting that cannot go well for many reasons, and which has been largely revised in Assassin's Creed Unity, in this sense a return to the origins for the franchise. Altair didn't go around teasing crusaders and leaving behind a mountain of corpses, but he knew when to fight and when to hide or run away. In the new episode, in the same way, facing a group of enemies often results in death, due to a less called parry mechanism and - finally! - of an artificial intelligence which, although not very advanced, puts aside the polite wait for one's turn in favor of a more aggressive approach, with opponents who seek the lunge at the same time and who therefore offer a non-trivial challenge; even more so when firearms are involved, which with a couple of successful shots prove lethal. The advancement in the adventure and the unlocking of new skills (a positive element in itself, with a view to a progression that was often taken for granted and thrown away immediately) unfortunately makes it less difficult to save one's skin, but at least the 'intentioninitial goes in the desired direction. A differentiation of weapons was clamored for and this too was introduced, albeit timidly: choosing to wield a mace means being able to open up the defense of tougher enemies, focusing on power instead of speed, for example, while taking up a rifle in place of the gun implies having to use it instead of the sword, thus giving up some possibilities in favor of others (the greater range of bullets, in primis). The fact of having to opt for a specific approach is in itself a pleasant novelty and we hope that in the future this aspect will be further explored, approaching the experience of some action RPGs. Another request from the fans concerned the variety of missions, and it seems to us that Ubisoft has implemented this need by limiting the boring follow-ups to a minimum (and, if necessary, making them less rigid) and by inserting new types of quests, such as ~investigative~ ones ~, which we found very entertaining and different from the usual, together with all the possibilities of cooperative multiplayer matches, which become exciting when the group is a little close-knit, with combined actions in which an Assassin distracts a guard and another cold shoulders, for one thing. This type of co-op, in particular, corresponds to an idea that many fans of the series have been cultivating for some time and replaces competitive modes that frankly had little given since their introduction, with Brotherhood. From our point of view, the only thing Ubisoft has culpably forgotten to do is give meaning and depth to the climbing sections. With an extraordinary profile like that of the Paris of the French Revolution at our disposal, the developers could have transformed each climb into a small puzzle, similar to what was done in the first episodes of the series, forcing us to take alternative routes, perhaps to activate some mechanism or to learn new skills to be able to climb to the top of all the towers in the scenario.
