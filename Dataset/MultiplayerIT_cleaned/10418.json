It happens that suddenly all awareness disappears and it is no longer possible to tell whether whoever was in charge of carrying out that mission is good or bad, because the cause and the solution of the problem align and more than being all right, they all fall into some wrong. Dragon Age: Origins is like this, what has been announced as the spiritual successor of Baldur's Gate looks like a huge adventure, a prism that allows you to enter one of the many faces that compose it to get out of it every time in a thousand different facets, playing the role of characters called to a heroic purpose but imprisoned within a universe that loses the usual moral alignment of BioWare titles in favor of a complex of interpersonal relationships as amazing as it is vivid, capable of best telling the many dramas and the few joys offered by a world on the brink of destruction but still dominated by personal interests, greed and therefore by the tragedies of each individual. Long, fulfilling, deep and playable in at least a couple of completely different ways, Dragon Age: Origins is the pinnacle of a certain way of RPG, extremely classic and perhaps not perfect, but certainly wonderful and fulfilling. Origins The user enters the game four hundred years after the formation of the Gray Wardens, a group of fighters devoted to eliminating a plague due to ancient errors and made palpable by the arrival of terrible demons, capable of tearing the Veil that separates the two dimensions of reality and dreams and willing to dominate what is not rightfully theirs. Four hundred years later, therefore, at a time when the threat is regaining strength and preparing for a second terrible attack. This is the premise, because the beginning is in the player's hands: the six origins from which the title comes, are long prologues played aimed at presenting the protagonist who will put himself in charge of the adventure for the following tens of hours; two for the Dwarves, two for the Elves, one for the Humans and the last one for the wizards, who, regardless of race, are educated inside the club tower from an early age, once they show the signs of their nature of the Magi. After spending a dozen hours playing them all it's amazing how BioWare has assembled narrative and gameplay in such vast quantities just to give users a choice, leaving so many not to see the expulsion from the dwarven city of Orzammar of the fratricidal young scion of the royal family or of the union with the gray guardians of the other archetype belonging to the small but strong species, the one belonging to the plebs, subjugated with his sister to the wishes of a local squire, to whom he acts as a henchman. Honor and revenge, social redemption and a sense of predetermination of one's life, all themes that can be found, among others, accompanying a magician in the initiation into a life imposed on him, or following in the footsteps of the elves who, divided, are still partly subjugated in human cities where they are considered inferior and partly free in the forests, in search of their roots. Difficult to say which is the best, probably the noble Dwarf stands out for the complexity of the background that is created, the City Elf for the Shakespearian flavor and themes and the wizard for the visionary, dark and distressing atmosphere. Never has the beginning of an RPG been better in our memory. Ferelche? After completing the path of origin of your character, you will find yourself fighting a battle that will change all the cards on the table; the first in a long series of twists that constantly upset the player's approach to the world of Dragon Age: Origins. Virtually every inhabitant of Ferelden seems to be hiding something and is always ready to betray others, to go over to the side of the strongest or even flee in times of need. On the other hand, they are dark times and the incredible game world created for the occasion by BioWare manages to exude the horror of a new scourge throughout the course of the adventure. The Canadian software house has in fact decided to leave the now abused universe of Dungeons & Dragons aside by proposing a completely new scenario with its own history, geography, religion and racial composition that do not pale in the slightest in front of the enormous literature related to D&D.We always talk about fantasy, many of the archetypes of the genre are respected, but already starting from the historical past of each race present in Ferelden, we find large and important differences compared to what we are used to reading: a sort of variant on the theme summarized by BioWare with the terms dark heroic fantasy. Humans are the chosen race, superb and able to forcefully hold the reins of the known world by exploiting a highly repressive religious apparatus, ready to ghettoize any being with magic and with an omnipresent army represented by the templars; the dwarves, locked up in their fortress in Orzammar, try insistently to maintain the status quo of an anachronistic caste system incapable of holding off the revolutionary impulses of the exploited and subjugated commoners. The elves close the trio, a race persecuted and enslaved by both humans and dwarves. Torn away from her native land by centuries of wars and invasions, she boldly tries to escape her own extinction by aiming, on the one hand, for greater integration with humans in the most ~modernized~ cities and, on the other, to rediscover her own lands of origin to live in a hermitic state away from a world on the brink of disaster. This is enough to make it clear how deep the universe in which the player will find himself immersed is and which he will be able to fully understand only by dedicating himself to a meticulous research through the adventure scenarios and spending hours upon hours chatting with the hundreds of non-player characters scattered across Ferelden. The codex is excellent from this point of view, a sort of diary that can be accessed from the quest management screen, and which allows you to collect all the documentation concerning the game world, conveniently divided by type. We will therefore be able to deepen our knowledge of the culture, the individual characters encountered, the enemies, the most important objects and so on. Each item has its own slot so as to stimulate a real research in the name of collecting and is updated frequently according to our actions, for example by deepening a dialogue with a character and discovering something from his past. Going back to the quest screen for a moment, it must be said that it is rather classic and a bit reductive with the possibility of making only one mission active at a time and seeing the completed ones. We would not have minded having something more in-depth with perhaps the conversation history or some additional details useful for completing the missions. Three ways to play Dragon Age: Origins The way the gameplay is structured, replayability is given not only by the narrative implications but also by the different possible ways in which to approach the clashes. At the Easy difficulty level you can afford to occasionally change between your characters, almost always playing in real time except against bosses or in the most agitated situations. Normally it is better to start thinking about using strategies and alternating real time with tactical pause. The last two difficulty levels impose a planning of the clashes, the choice of each single skill to use for each of the four characters and many hours spent thinking about how to balance the team; in return, the depth obtainable is unmatched, a true single player cooperative. fundamentalist RPG But we finally get to talking about gameplay with a fundamental disclaimer. All those who, like the writer, were dumbfounded at the time of the announcement of Dragon Age: Origins due to its destination console as well as PC, afraid of having yet another role-playing game purified from the deepest, most difficult and maniacal, they can calm down because BioWare's new RPG is absolutely fundamentalist and without any compromise (at least on PC; but there is a dedicated box for this). Let's start with character creation. As mentioned at the beginning, it will be possible to choose between humans, elves and dwarves; all have access to the three available classes, warrior, thief and wizard, with the exception of dwarves who, not having stable connections with oblivion, are insensitive to magic. We will therefore be able to work on individual statistics, starting from a first setup that tries to meet the peculiarities of the class. At our disposal the classic strength, dexterity, will, magic, cunning and constitution which we can then enhance from level to level (the level cap is set at 20). The same goes for skills (two points that can be spent in the creation phase and one point every five levels) ranging from crafting (herbalist, creating poisons and building traps) through training that allows you to unlock higher level talents, to arrive at skills related to pextortion or pickpocketing. The talent system completes the personalization of your avatar. This is divided into various schools depending on your class: for example we will have elemental magic, those related to entropy or creation in case you choose a magician, or combat tactics with shield or two-handed weapons in the case of a fighter or proficiency in two-weapon combat or ranged combat if you choose a thief. Each of these schools has various skills divided into four levels of growth and range from passive enhancements to those that can be activated with a permanent or single charge duration. But it's not over yet because every 7 levels it will be possible to spend a point of specialization in one of the four advanced classes available for each archetype. For example, the magician can become a healer, or a blood sorcerer, while the warrior can become a templar or berserker and still the thief can specialize in being a bard or an assassin. The peculiarity of the specialization system is its being directly connected to the game world: in order to have access to the power-ups, in fact, it will be necessary to unlock them during the adventure, buying very rare and expensive books, interacting with certain non-player characters or deepening the bond with the companions who have joined us in the course of the adventure. Companions! Dragon Age: Origins in being a role-playing game in the old BioWare tradition, obviously can't help but offer a party system of incredible depth. We will face the missions for most of the time in a group of four characters, chosen from the numerous that we will collect during the journey and always available in the camp. Their management is totally at the player's discretion: we will be able to equip them according to our preferences, manage their level growth, but above all chat with them and organize them on the field during fights. Through an influence system linked to our behavior during the adventure, these companions will begin to have ties of friendship, love or antagonism with the avatar, unlocking certain dialogue options and even permanent bonuses on their statistics (as well as allowing specialization learning as described above). The interaction is total: we will be able to hunt a companion, sacrifice him during a mission, even kill him in the camp. There are no restrictions on the player's agency. But the bulk of the management happens in the course of the fights. Here it will be possible and indeed essential, in combination with the tactical pause, a crucial element of role-playing games of a certain thickness, to move and use each skill of the controlled characters in such a way as to face and win every battle. Dragon Age: Origins is in fact a very difficult title, and already at the normal difficulty level (the second of the four available), each fight is able to bring you to your knees if it is not handled with due attention. However, it is always possible to make the characters more or less autonomous through a very well thought-out system of tactics that will allow us on the one hand to choose the type of behavior of a character (aggressive, at a distance, defensive and so on) and on the other to choose real if/then routines through some tree menus: you select the action to be performed in response to a given condition. For each character there are a selection of pre-set tactics to make life easier for less savvy players, but it goes without saying, it is so obvious, that on higher difficulty levels it is essential to perform micro-management of the characters, especially those with magical abilities. In the end you will find yourself sweating much more than the proverbial seven shirts during fights with the toughest enemies such is the tension for an unsuccessful tactical move, but the satisfaction of seeing after long minutes dozens of dead on the ground and their own characters bloodstained with a symphony orchestra that triumphantly underlines your epic deeds, hardly has any other videogame comparison. Did we forget something? Probably yes, there is just too much to say to describe a game like Dragon Age: Origins. The game map is quite large, with numerous locations that are unlocked depending on the quests tackled and continuing in an adventure that will hardly keep you busy for less than 70-80 hours. A small note should then be made towards the inventory which, despite the presence of filters to categorize the content, could certainly have been better structured: in the more advanced stages of the game, when you have purchased div", "date": "2009-11-02", "grade": "9.5"}
