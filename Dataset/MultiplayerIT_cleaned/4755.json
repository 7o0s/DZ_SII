It is a puzzle game inspired by the life and works of the Bohemian writer, who lived at the end of the 19th century and is famous for having written stories such as ~The Metamorphosis~ and novels such as ~The Trial~. The protagonist of the adventure is Kafka himself, engaged in a sort of journey (real or imaginary, we'll find out later) punctuated by a series of visual puzzles, not all accessible in the same way or characterized by the same interpretation. It is probably for this reason that the completion time of the game can vary significantly, substantially lengthening the time if you get stuck in the interpretation of a puzzle. In any case, we're talking about a very short and dry experience, but at the same time fascinating and full of a particular atmosphere, where obviously citations from the author's works are wasted. To grasp them, however, you will have to sharpen your eyes, literally: on the iPhone the texts are tiny and the possibility of enlarging them using the pinch to zoom leads to unwanted advances in the dialogues. Man or insect? The story of The Franz Kafka Videogame is divided into four acts, each consisting of a sequence of puzzles and essential narrative elements, which make up a picture in many ways similar in style to the stories of the Bohemian writer. It all begins when a woman goes to Kafka to undergo hypnosis and thus try to eliminate the anxieties deriving from her nightmares. Dropped into his patient's subconscious, K. is faced with an interactive graphic composition, the common denominator of the puzzles in the game, and must find a possible ~solution~. In the very first case it is a question of moving some pieces of the scenario in order to draw the shape of a rabbit, but the solutions found by the developers are varied and sometimes bizarre. In fact, we will have to decipher maps and messages, identify interactive elements that at first glance seem to have a single function and which instead hide something, find the right sequences for activating a device and so on. The structure is therefore dry and linear, although some puzzles are rather obscure at first: since there is no interpretative key, the first problem to be solved is in fact that of understanding what needs to be done, and only then striving to understand how to do it. Implications that give satisfaction when the proverbial light bulb finally lights up, and which are effectively supported by the touch screen controls, precise enough to guarantee the resolution of the puzzles without systematic limitations. However, the great protagonist of The Franz Kafka Videogame is the atmosphere, shaped by an elegant sound accompaniment and by a truly pleasant and peculiar graphic style, which we hope to be able to find again soon in new productions, perhaps more far-reaching.", "date": "2017-07-28", "grade": "7.5"}
