{"name": "Strategia intelligente", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/87028-darkest-hour-a-hearts-of-iron-game-strategia-intelligente.html", "text": "Darkest Hour tells us the most dramatic moments of the twentieth century in a strategic key through two scenarios that take us from 1914 to 1964. At the center of the scenarios are the two world wars and the starting point is the event that triggered the first Great War, namely the assassination of Franz Ferdinand of Habsburg-Este at the hands of the Serbian student Gravilo Princip. But in Darkest Hour not everything is already decided. States can behave differently from what happened in reality, interacting based on reports, diplomatic decisions and obviously based on the player's actions. In short, it is also possible to avoid the escalation of events as reported by the books even if it is difficult to avoid the conflict. The diplomatic situation is in fact tense and there are several opportunities to unleash the desires of some states and lead them to unleash a chain reaction. A dense network of pacts, alliances and frictions that is capable of involving, at different levels, practically all the over one hundred nations that animate the title. The evolution of Hearts of Iron 2 Developed by a group of paid modders and based on Paradox's Europa engine, like Hearts of Iron 2 of which it is an evolution, Darkest Hour not only improves and increases the diplomatic component and the interaction possibilities of the artificial intelligence, which are evident from the increase in CPU-managed diplomatic interrelationships, but it allows us to choose the experience we prefer by presenting itself in 3 variants. The basic version is fully compatible with the mods for Hearts of Iron 2 but offers few differences compared to the predecessor, the Light version instead implements almost all the new features at the code level and is partially backwards compatible, while the Full version implements all the new features but is incompatible. In any case, confirmations have already come from the community that the most important mods are being converted for this incarnation of the series which apparently has already convinced fans. In addition to this, the title offers a complete localization in Italian which includes the tutorial, essential for newbies and to quickly discover all the news, and even includes the historical quotes that appear during the uploads. Being a statesman Although it is possible to experience the title almost as an adventure, playing a head of state who moves between the coils of history, Darkest Hour is obviously a complex title, capable of offering a considerable challenge and crammed to the neck with possibilities. First of all we have to consider resources, transport and dissent which respectively manage war capacity, speed in moving troops and solidity of power. And immediately after that we find the technology that allows us to develop new technologies and is fundamental in various situations, as in the case of the atomic bomb, to guarantee us an advantage. But each of these items is then divided into sub-types such as the specific resources that are needed to support the different military strategies or the type of government adopted which obviously has pros and cons. An important part of the title concerns diplomacy which is also influenced by economic policies, such as the free market, and by the status of the provinces that are under our control. And the economic issue goes deep with the possibility of changing labor policies and introducing money in the event of a deficit. All of this is obviously focused on being competitive on a military level. Even a nation that aims at democracy and the free market will sooner or later have to defend itself or attack and therefore will need metal or oil and will have to deal with its own military organization which depends on the composition of the troops and on the competence not only of the graduates but also who we have placed in command of ministries and armies. Each army will then have to be used wisely and in combination with diplomatic management that does not force us to operate on too many fronts. Furthermore, strictly military variables such as the composition of the army, the presence of aviation, the type of terrain, the weather, morale and so on must obviously be considered. A place in history As anticipated, artificial intelligence is the pride of this sort of stand-alone expansion and automatically adapts to geopolitical situations and the player's actions. The wealth of reactions is truly impressive and they are almost always coherent and credible answers. Certainly there are some defects, such as exchange agreements that provide for concessions in exchange for nothing, but the result is undoubtedly of excellent quality with nations that act considering the relationships of the secret departments, the economic advantages and the need to concontrol of some territories perhaps in view of a large-scale war. And all this is combined with a clear increase in interaction between the player's actions and the historical elements which are obviously present and mark the passage of time but offer us the possibility of intervening. The title is in fact squeezed between the grip of absolute strategic freedom and the need to remind us of the historical atmospheres of the 20th century. But Darkest Hour manages to juggle this squeeze quite well and although the limits obviously exist, they are perfectly masked and the spell holds . The Full version, in addition to making the interface clearer, revolutionizes the maps and introduces even more variables that give us the possibility to intervene coherently on a wide range of events. In fact, we will be asked to take a position on the Comintern, if we use one of the nations that oppose it, or to purge the army of incompetent graduates, something to be seriously considered before unleashing a big war. And these are fundamental details that together with the soundtrack and the numerous historical events drop us in the middle of the most violent century in human history. Unfortunately, while some music is incredibly spot on and recall both real and cinematic atmospheres, there are some that are a little too slow for a title of this type that must arouse strong emotions while being limited to a strategic map. But the result is undoubtedly commendable for a product made by a group of modders.", "date": "2011-04-13", "grade": "8.8"}
