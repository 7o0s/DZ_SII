{"name": "Doodle Jump", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/71846-doodle-jump-salta-che-ti-passa.html", "text": "There are games that offer different modes and focus on the variety of situations, others that put you in front of a simple and one-way mechanics. Doodle Jump belongs to this second category, that of ~perpetual platforms~, or those platforms in which you have to jump higher and higher and with only one life available, trying to establish an altitude record before falling down. There are several applications for iPhone and iPod Touch that offer the same type of action (see PapiJump or the poetic and very Italian Star Ride), and in all cases we end up quoting the term ~addiction~. In fact, the moment you enter the mechanism of the game (and it takes about two seconds to do so), it is difficult to stop at the first game and not try again and again and again until you reach areas never seen before. There are no stages or different levels that must be completed: it is a single climb against the backdrop of a scenario that gradually offers different colors and visual elements, as well as increasingly difficult pitfalls to avoid. Tumbler To distinguish itself from products of the same genre, Doodle Jump first plays the card of aesthetic uniqueness. The character we control is in fact a weird alien who seems to have come out of a child's drawing album, colored with crayons and animated in an essential way. To reinforce the concept, the background is practically a squared notebook that develops vertically and on which we find platforms of different types: at the beginning simple support bases on which to bounce, then they give way to mobile and elusive versions. Sometimes there are elements that add a touch of variety to the action, such as springs (which allow us to make a much more powerful jump than normal), propellers (which automatically transport us up for a few seconds) and a series of enemies ever more cunning. The latter can be avoided or eliminated using our character's ~spit~, which can be activated by touching the touch screen in the direction in which we want to shoot. Another peculiarity of the product developed by Lima Sky, in this case however not very original, concerns the control system, entrusted completely to the accelerometer of the Apple device: the jump is automatic, but we can direct it by tilting the iPhone left and right, with good precision and without any problems whatsoever. Four stir-fry Despite its simplicity, Doodle Jump doesn't give up on the trend of the moment, i.e. storing scores on online rankings that involve comparing our results in real time with those of players from all over the world, or with our friends. The term ~real time~ has never been more appropriate, as the game (literally) marks the height reached by other players on the screen, so you can see it clearly and get the motivation you need to do better and finish higher. up. The technical realization satisfies our needs, and accompanies the unique graphic style with a fluid scrolling without uncertainties, which makes the platforms scroll at great speed. The sound sector is made up of a series of nice effects even if they are far from spectacular, therefore it does its job discreetly but does not give us the possibility of using a personal playlist to keep us company between one jump and another.
