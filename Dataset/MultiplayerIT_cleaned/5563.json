Having such a clear identity is in some ways a good thing when you want to export niche titles to the West, but it also exposes you to the risk of always proposing the same mechanics so as not to disappoint the fans and, at the same time, to deal with a budget never too ambitious. Working on Trillion: God of Destruction, the developers instead showed that they finally wanted to create something different and mixed new elements with a proven formula. A strange mix came out of it, which pits us against a monster with a billion health points (yes, twelve zeros) and asks us in no uncertain terms: how much are we willing to endure to complete our mission? Our verdict on Trillion: God of Destruction, a JRPG that tells no lies about its true nature Revenge of the Fallen In Trillion: God of Destruction we start with an introduction useful for framing the setting: the universe, or rather, our dimension is divided into the three canonical worlds, namely the Heavens, home of angels and God, the world of humans and the Underworld, or the Underworld, which gave refuge to the Fallen after Satan's rebellion against divine power. However, when everything suggests that a new chapter of the eternal conflict between angels and demons is about to be consumed, the harmony of the Underworld is disturbed by an ancient threat: the God of Destruction, an unpredictable being dedicated to chaos, who seems to be moved only by his insatiable quest for worlds to consume. Zeabolos, former Overlord of Wrath and third Great Overlord of the Underworld, is thus forced to come to terms with a foreigner with mysterious powers in order to have a chance to defeat the enemy. At this point the plot begins to revolve around two fundamental points: the need for the Fallen to acquire enough power to reset the monster's insane amount of energy and the acceptance that the sacrifice of some is essential to continue. All intermediate steps are therefore eliminated: there is no journey to grow the characters, no subjects to defeat and no allies to conquer by setting aside the rusts of the past. The fight itself is a solitary moment, for the enemy exudes a miasma that makes it impossible to bring more than one challenger near him at a time. The narrative thus focuses on the relationship that develops between Zeabolos, rendered helpless after the first encounter with Trillion, and the six Overlords subjected to him who, one after the other, are forced to face the enemy only to make the task easier. of the next candidate. In this way, the developers did not have to give up the long visual novel skits, where the characters are characterized according to stereotypes dear to the genre, with ambiguous situations in perfect harem game style and a few jokes capable of snatching a smile. Overall, they are dialogues that only aim to make it more difficult to accept sacrificing the girl on duty and, all in all, they succeed in their intent. However, there are far too many repeating situations and filler scenes that randomly follow each other during training. An aspect that in itself is not too annoying, but a narrative variety of a much higher level would have been needed to support the game system we were faced with. The routine that wears out the minds The situation of perennial threat at the base of Trillion: God of Destruction seems to have put the guys of Compile Heart in front of a pressing question: how to make the characters grow if they can't practically leave the house? The Underworld should indeed be vast enough to offer dungeons and monsters in quantity, but this time the developers have decided to mix things up: why not earn experience points through training in which the player has to do absolutely nothing, except check that fatigue does not accumulate too much? But there's more: the experience thus gained assumes a marginal role if the sim component is not taken care of properly, pampering and interacting with the trained Overlord to increase the so-called Affection Points, which are fundamental in battle and replace health and magic points while supplies last. It goes without saying that this is a rather controversial mechanic, which winks at the free-to-play ~otome~ of dubious quality of the mobile market and which ends up being indisputablelly repetitive already after a few hours. Even the interaction with the ~waifu~ is reduced to the bone: the bulk of the affection is produced automatically and the player just has to rejoice in the face of the rare choices available to him and catalog which ones they are, among the hundred prizes of one special coin-operated vending machine, the gifts best suited to the tastes of each Overlord. Fortunately, the game is not all here: the Valley of Swords offers a fun diversion with its distinctly roguelike mechanics and allows access to a good amount of extra experience and rare items. Even here, however, despite the procedural creation of the dungeon, the setting is always the same and, together with the low variety of enemies and the randomness of the loot, it soon becomes rather boring. The god of destruction The heart of the gameplay of Trillion: God of Destruction, the only part that holds the shack together, then turns out to be the dear being to whom the game owes its name. This is where all the strategic component of the title resides, which does not stop only at choosing the right movements on the battlefield. In fact, the clashes against the sworn enemy of all worlds take place after a set time interval, during which the monster takes a nap to aid digestion and allow the player to train properly with the ~amusing~ means at his disposal . As already mentioned above, this hard training does not serve to defeat the god on the first attempt, but to allow the current candidate to inflict the greatest number of damages possible and, through a special ring, pass on to his successor enough experience to arrive prepared to a new awakening. The fact that this relay foresees the death of the defeated Overlord is, in fact, one of the most successful elements of the title, which traps the player between the desire to proceed and the desire not to resign himself to defeat. Once this fate has been accepted, however, one enters the order of ideas that each clash of the first game is both the tutorial and a way to complete the game. In this sense, understanding which are the most useful skills requires many sacrifices because, despite the differences in character, once on the field, the fighting style of the heroines is a bit too similar. A problem that can in part be remedied with some seals, but those that change the use of weapons are far too rare to affect the overall feel of the game. The skills themselves are poorly balanced, and after a few tries it's easy to figure out which skills are more useful and avoid the others altogether. Even so, the battles against Trillion, however, guarantee a good dose of movement: chaining skills to move around the board is essential to maintain attack bonuses while avoiding enemy blows, which are always very painful. Even at this juncture, however, there is no underlying repetitiveness once you understand the attack patterns, a sign that perhaps the amount of blows needed to knock down the different forms of the monster is really exaggerated. PSVita trophies Trillion: God of Destruction has 36 trophies, including platinum. Of these, 19 are hidden and related to the story, including possible offshoots and alternate endings. The visible trophies, on the other hand, are obtained by completing game actions and they are all quite easy, even when they take some time to obtain. Like the completion of the game itself, reaching platinum is a great feat: in fact, a good dose of dedication and aptitude for grind is needed, given that more than one game is required to obtain all the trophies. The return of old problems Among the ups and downs of a game system that is not without flaws, Trillion: God of Destruction does not even lack a good dose of bugs and technical problems. In addition to the innocent delays in updating the Affection Points within the menus, during battles it is the artificial intelligence that has some uncertainty: against the second form of Trillion, for example, the two spheres on the ground do not react the same way to the approach of the player who, while on the right side he cannot attack from behind without becoming a target, on the left he manages to act practically undisturbed. Similar problems also arise with the movements of other followers, which in some circumstances appear to have a rather confusing movement pattern. Compile Heart then confirms its lack of affinity with the frame rate, which drops dramatically during some attacks. Given the genre, the fluidity is still acceptable. Other confirmations come from the excellent character design, the work of that Kei Nanameda who had already worked on Mugen Souls, and from the imagesin computer graphics that accompany the most significant dialogues, always very accurate. Finally, the localization (in English only) should be reviewed which, despite an ad hoc patch, continues to present rather trivial text errors and a dubbing with some filler line of dialogue inserted at the wrong time.", "date": "2016-04-20", "grade": "6.8"}
