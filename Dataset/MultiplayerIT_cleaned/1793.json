Only by pressing a fire key will the cordless unit establish the connection again. In this way dead times, loading and so on will not affect the autonomy of the appliance. The supplied software then guarantees the possibility of setting customized profiles for all your games, in order to configure the numerous keys for the most suitable use for every need. The joystick's performance definitely lives up to expectations: the rubber base gives the grip stability and safety without damaging the underlying surface, and the joystick sits firmly and comfortably in the hand  the only drawback, its shape, which is certainly ergonomic , but alas only for right-handed users. On the stick head, within reach of the thumb, we have four fire buttons plus a mini analog stick, generally used to move the pilot's view; then there are the aluminum trigger, perhaps not too sensitive, and the other five buttons. As I mentioned earlier, the Freedom also has the controls usually assigned to a second additional peripheral, i.e. a throttle control for the speed and the joystick that can be rotated along the horizontal axis to control the pitch. In essence, therefore, with a single peripheral you can maximize all the fundamental controls of a flight simulator, but not only. In addition to some aviation-related titles, we also ventured into an atypical simulation such as Mechwarrior 4 Mercenaries, obtaining remarkable results, except for the tendency of the rotation and flexion movements of the stick to get confused and add up if you don't pay attention to how moves it. In conclusion, the Freedom 2.4 is undoubtedly the current spearhead in the range of Logitech gaming peripherals, with a not too high price, which makes it really attractive for all simulation enthusiasts.

No, it's not an advertisement for a car, but for Logitech's latest cordless joystick, the Freedom 2.4, ready to make your head spin. Aggressive in look, practical and solid in feeling, complete in functions, this joystick contains a large number of controls in a single product and stands out for the undisputed practicality of the wireless system. Right from inside the box, the Freedom 2.4 knows how to draw the attention of the passer-by with a gritty and captivating design, in the black and metal colors that distinguish the recent line of Logitech products, and a compact appearance, fully confirmed by the facts once the box is opened. 'packing. But it is once the box is opened that satisfaction reaches its peak and the anxiety to try it in action becomes irrepressible. Installation couldn't have been simpler: once the drivers are present in your system, connect the Freedom 2.4 to the USB port and it will be immediately recognized and made available for use. For the more fussy I would also like to point out how the number 2.4 present in the product name has to do with the technology used for the realization of the wireless system, which transmits precisely at 2.4 GHz. In this way the joystick avoids creating any interference from any other wireless devices on your desktop. In our tests there were, for example, both a mouse and a Logitech cordless keyboard and there has never been any type of problem related to mutual interference between these devices.", "date": "2003-01-24", "grade": null}
