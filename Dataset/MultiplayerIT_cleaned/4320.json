This definitive edition natively includes not only the base game but also all the DLC released so far, which enrich the roster of ten extra characters: Darkseid (initially reserved for pre-orders), Red Hood, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Starfire, Black Manta, Hellboy, Atom, Enchantress and Leonardo of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. A graft of content not to be underestimated, which arrives in conjunction with a new advanced tutorial, a set of unpublished objects and an increase in the level cap to 30, complete with an additional slot for perks. A world without heroes The Injustice series is set in a parallel universe where Superman has lost his mind after killing Lois Lane and the child she was carrying, deciding to turn the world into a totalitarian regime in which no crime can be committed anymore. However, the extreme limitation of personal freedoms does not meet the favor of Batman, who together with a handful of ~rebel~ heroes creates a real resistance with the aim of bringing the Kryptonian to his senses, by hook or by crook . At the end of the first episode, Superman is defeated and imprisoned in a special detention facility with kryptonite-based systems, but a new threat is about to hit the planet: Brainiac, the collector of worlds. After having devastated Krypton, whose only survivors are Kal-El and his cousin Kara, the synthetic villain wants to do the same with the Earth, and to stop him the Bat Man will have to resort to any resource. The spectacular plot of Injustice 2 is told within a solid and consistent single player campaign, full of high quality cinematics, enhanced by an excellent Italian dubbing that sees the presence of Marco Balzarotti in the role of Batman, Matteo ~Nathan Drake~ Zanotti as Superman and Riccardo Peroni as Joker. As per tradition, throughout history we alternate in command of various heroes, each moved by different motivations, also following a subplot that sees some villains team up to support Brainiac's action. The developers could have used gimmicks to justify the ability of some fighters to stand up to opponents much stronger than them (Batman himself is a simple human being, yet in the game he confronts cosmic-level creatures without major problems), but beyond this narrative simplification, the title of NetherRealm Studios is confirmed as truly enjoyable and spectacular, especially for those who follow the DC universe. The arrival of evil There are many innovations introduced by Injustice 2 compared to the first episode of the series, not only in terms of roster but also in the gameplay mechanics, further refined and consolidated. The underlying style is clearly that of the ~Mortal Kombat school~, with many references to clarify the matter right from the start, but above all the developers have managed to give this sequel a well-defined personality, which is clearly seen in the technicalities that characterize the various maneuvers at our disposal. Each fighter has a wide repertoire of moves, but it is also possible to exploit the scenario in many ways by acting on the back buttons: there are objects that can be thrown at the opponent, areas against which to hurl the enemy and interactable walls, which can be break through where a loaded shot is used, giving life to a very painful sequence that finally transports us to another area of the setting. The icing on the cake is represented by the specials, which can be performed as soon as the relative indicator is full: these are moves with a great visual impact, which often and willingly involve the launch of the opponent into orbit and a powerful crash to the ground, possibly accompanied by missiles or optical rays. Two quick examples: Batman ties the opponent to his grappling hook and has him carried into the sky by the Batwing, which targets him with machine guns and rockets as it falls; or Superman, who throws punches so powerful at the enemy that he literally flies, and then stops him and crushes him to the ground from miles up. Getting the right time for the special can make the difference during a match, since we are talking about a maneuver capable of inflicting substantial damage. For those wondering, yes, Injustice 2 can also be played well using a simple DualShock, although ~charge~-style moves work dodgy with the analog stick (or even the d-pad, for that matter).o), while we didn't notice any particular problems with the crescents. It goes without saying that an arcade stick can make all the difference, especially if your ambition is to become competitive in online multiplayer. Structure and outline Among the advantages of Injustice 2 there is undoubtedly the richness of a structure that does not rely solely on the campaign to offer the bulk of its contents, but includes an arcade mode (the Combat Simulator) with different endings for each individual character of the roster, as well as a wave mode (Survivor) and an endless survival (Senza Fine). To these options is added the rich (but not very varied) Multiverse mode: a set of single player campaigns that exploit the expedient of alternative worlds, which has always been one of the narrative pillars of the DC universe, to involve us in sequences of fights with different degrees of difficulty, made more interesting by particular modifiers. The various events of the Multiverse appear and disappear within hours, thus offering always different ideas to those who want to try their hand at new single-player challenges; but the charm of this component also and above all lies in the continuous unlocking of skins and aesthetic objects that draw on the history of each hero or villain, for example on specific sagas, to allow us to modify not only their appearance but also their abilities: a brilliant intuition, which combines the passion for superhero comics and the desire to add further depth to the experience. For those who want to test their skills against other users, there are both local and online multiplayer, with single games or tournaments that we found very entertaining and supported by an infrastructure that is up to the situation, both in terms of matchmaking and of latency. Naturally, the launch of the Legendary Edition will repopulate rooms that over the months had experienced an inevitable emptying, also to the advantage of those who own the standard edition of the game. Playstation 4 trophies The Legendary Edition adds twelve additional Trophies to the standard edition of Injustice 2. The only Silver Trophy is obtained by reaching level 30 with any character, while the rest of the achievements are linked to the new characters in the pack, with special conditions victory for each of them. Legendary content As written at the beginning, compared to the original version, the Legendary Edition of Injustice 2 natively includes all the downloadable characters, a new tutorial and a new level cap. The extra fighters are decidedly fascinating and boast peculiar characteristics that will make you love them madly. We have already talked in abundance about Sub-Zero, but from the Mortal Kombat roster we also find the powerful Raiden, while the legendary Hellboy and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles act as special guests, represented in this case by Leonardo but ready to intervene during the matches in various ways, especially in the context of special moves. For both characters narrative references are wasted: Hellboy's victory pose sees the demon man created by Mike Mignola make flaming horns appear and then chase away some infernal creatures who have come to claim him, while Leonardo shows up to the fights wearing a raincoat it hides the appearance of an anthropomorphic turtle. The characters of Starfire (the disruptive space warrior belonging to the Teen Titans), Black Manta (Aquaman's nemesis), Red Hood (one of Batman's most interesting enemies), Atom (a hero capable of shrinking and at the subatomic level) and Darkseid, the lord of Apokolips. The latter is undoubtedly the most fascinating figure of the lot, just look at the casual pose he takes to fight, keeping his fists crossed behind his back and treacherously hurling his lethal Omega rays.", "date": "2018-04-02", "grade": "8.7"}
