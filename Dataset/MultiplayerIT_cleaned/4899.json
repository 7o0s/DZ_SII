{"name": "Dio delle citt", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/182724-city-mania-town-building-game-dio-delle-citta.html", "text": "~Extend the streets to connect the buildings!~ ~Build a factory to produce raw materials!~ ~Use resources to upgrade houses and increase the population of the city!~ It really seems that the genre of simulations has also made school on mobile devices, creating a very popular and accessible trend, especially for casual gamers. City Mania: Town Building Game, the latest title from Gameloft, is no exception and focuses on the same mechanisms, giving us a city to manage as we wish with the aim of expanding its borders as much as possible, increasing its population and productivity. During the early stages, the game takes us by the hand, basically showing us what our tasks will be and how to complete them in the best way. Do roads connect all places? Are the production lines of the factories being put to the best use? Do we have sufficient police forces to control the various neighborhoods? The progression is very linear, but in the event of problems, it is just as simple to see a warning (for example: citizens are dissatisfied with excessive pollution) and implement the necessary countermeasures to resolve the issue and continue pursuing the growth of the city; all by referring to a simple, readable and well organized touch interface, but at the same time much more responsive and precise than many other mobile games of the same genre. City Mania: Town Building Game is a nice and pleasant casual simulator, but without great novelties Ordinary administration While relying on a traditional structure, which does not introduce real innovations compared to other city simulations, City Mania: Town Building Game eliminates some boring dynamics (primarily the obligation to collect coins around) and allows you to give life to the resource production process practically without limits, beyond specific timers. After the first few hours, it therefore becomes clear that we will have to carry on our action in a piecemeal way, waiting a few minutes for the objects to be ready and using them to upgrade certain buildings; or, of course, take advantage of the game's hard currency to speed up processes and get an idea that we will inevitably end up paying for... in the literal sense of the term. The freemium aspects in this type of product are always very evident and the Gameloft title is no exception, distributing free cases and allowing us to obtain currency through the completion of various achievements, but then invariably cashing in if we wanted to complete an operation instantly, without waiting, to be able to enjoy a level-up or an important upgrade for the community. Then there is the matter relating to the characters, with various categories of professional figures (the policeman, the worker, the fireman, etc.) which must be unlocked as you go along (or you pay with real money) and which allow you to emphasize the effectiveness of some places. Small additions that make an experience pleasant and light which, however, remains linked to patterns that are now worn out and abused, especially for those who have already tried their hand at simulators of the genre several times. It's a shame, because the developers have done a good job on the technical implementation front too, developing clean and nice cartoonish graphics, as well as a very functional and reactive interface, as mentioned.", "date": "2017-05-03", "grade": "6.0"}
