{"name": "Tiger Woods PGA Tour 09 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tiger-woods-pga-tour-09-recensione.html", "text": "Almost two years after its release, it is clear that the resounding success of the Wii has been taken lightly by many developers, who perhaps did not expect such an impact and wanted to think twice before investing money and resources in the creation of titles designed exclusively for the new Nintendo console. Electronic Arts was perhaps the first production house to admit its faults, and for the 2009 edition of its sports titles it is trying to remedy. We have already had the opportunity to ascertain the quality of Madden NFL 09, now it's the turn of a classic golf simulation: Tiger Woods PGA Tour. Anyone who tried the last episode of the series knows that it was a mere conversion from PlayStation 2, with a control system that has nothing to do with what Wii owners expected for such a product. Well, things have changed... Everyone on the field with Lotti If there's one thing EA's sports series have accustomed us to, it's the sheer amount of options and modes available: truly a paradise for fans, who can literally play for months before getting bored. Tiger Woods PGA Tour 09 is no exception: from the start screen you can try your hand at a quick game (for up to four players), start a career, access nineteen modes of various types and try the Golf Party minigames or challenge an online opponent via the excellent EA Nation system. The developers have not forgotten the novices or those unfamiliar with the innovations introduced with this 2009 edition, so first of all it is better to face a simple but complete tutorial that shows us everything we can do once on the green, which also includes numerous advice on how to swing, which club to choose, how to determine the range of the shot and so on. The major innovation obviously concerns the control system, which now sees us control our character directly, holding the Wii-mote as if it were a golf club and making a swing that is reproduced on the screen in real time. The same system seen in Wii Sports golf, to be clear, but with much greater complexity and depth. Not surprisingly, less experienced players will be able to take advantage of the All-Play system (an idea on which Electronic Arts focuses a lot, to open the doors of its products also to the so-called ~casual gamers~), which shows the trajectory of the shots and acts also on the quality of the swing, going to smooth out any deficiencies in our execution. This is a pretty useful option to start with, especially it makes it much easier to put the ball into the hole when using the putter. At the standard difficulty level, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 09 reveals all its depth and complexity: no predefined trajectories, no assistance during shots... it's just you, the golf club and the ball. The swing follows the movement of the Wii-mote: you have to point the controller down and press B, then take the shot as if you were actually on a golf course. Everyone on the field with Lotti By pointing the Wii-mote at the screen and pressing the A button before shooting, you can zoom in on the area where the ball should land, possibly moving the ~target~ by pressing the B trigger. As already mentioned, the swing follows the movement of the Wii-mote: you will have to point the controller down and press B, then make the shot as if you were really on a golf course. The direction of the launch varies according to the position of the character (which can be modified using the d-pad) and the rotation of the ball, which can be achieved in flight by shaking the Wii-mote and pressing the desired direction on the d-pad. The shooting mode changes when you are close to the hole: in this situation the experience can be traumatic and often misleading, given that an indicator of the power of the shot appears on the screen, but the swing is carried out in a partial way, in fact as if you were holding the putter. Balls in the hole While it's fun to play directly in control of a champion like Tiger Woods, the new EA Sports title offers us a career mode full of substance, in which we can try our hand at an entire season of the PGA Tour, the FedExCup and the Tiger Challenge. The first thing to do, however, will be to create our character from scratch, using a very complete graphic editor: the possibilities are really many, and the interface works using the Wii-mote's pointing system. There's also a wide range of clothing choices, with some free and some requiring purchase, introducing an extra element of personalization.ization. Once our alter-ego has been created, we will be able to even modify his shot, solving any deficiencies in our swing through a series of corrections applied to the golf club. If the career mode already guarantees a certain longevity, given the number of competitions and events, the nineteen ~short~ modes only close the picture of a truly substantial product, which can take golf enthusiasts by the hand and really entertain them For me yes. To all this we must also add the local multiplayer modes (ie the Party mode minigames, this too a new idea and introduced in all Electronic Arts sports titles) and the excellent online mode via EA Nation. Challenging a friend or an unknown opponent is really simple and can be done in seconds by logging in as a ~guest~. If you want to participate in ranked matches and all the available options, you must instead register by entering your own identifying nickname. The interesting thing is that the obvious limitations of the Wii with regard to online are somewhat limited by the EA Nation system, which allows the addition of friends and the organization of challenges in a similar way to what happens on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, bypassing the cumbersome system of friend codes. During our test, we found an opponent very quickly and we were able to ascertain that the game runs without lag or problems of any kind, organized in such a way that there are no waits: we make our shots at the same time as the opponents, being able to see the trajectory on the screen of their hits but not their characters. The only problem is the lack of communication, as you can't send text messages during the game, and before it you have to limit yourself to pre-set phrases: too bad. Technical realization The excellent work done with regard to the control system is not the only technical innovation of Tiger Woods PGA Tour 09 compared to the 2008 episode: the game boasts better graphics, with more defined textures and above all with greater fluidity. An optimization work has probably been done, to meet the technical characteristics of the Wii without programming everything from scratch; and the final result is excellent, even if we are sure that much more can be done. The characters boast a rather rich set of standard animations, which also perfectly conveys the idea of the frustration that a bad shot can bring, perhaps when you are ahead of your opponent. However, the bulk is done by the locations, which are distinguished by excellent vegetation and the absence of problems in rendering the polygons. To accompany the action we think a good quality soundtrack (although far from rich in songs) and a series of quite realistic effects. Still from a technical point of view, unfortunately there is a very little ~elastic~ save system to report, which on the one hand allows us to save progress during a long game, to be able to resume it later, on the other it does not give us the opportunity to start other modes without deleting the save already made. In short, we have only one ~slot~ available... Comment Tiger Woods PGA Tour 09 is part of a series of sports titles that, in the intentions of Electronic Arts, should make better use of the Wii hardware, from all points of view. Let's just say that the goal was achieved without too many problems: compared to the 2008 version, the control system has been renewed and swings can now be made using the Wii-mote like a golf club, with direct movement correspondence. This is not yet a perfect solution, but it certainly represents the way forward for the future as well. And an excellent job has also been done with regard to the graphics, now much more fluid and enjoyable. Of the thickness of the game, then, it is useless to speak: starting with the career mode and ending with the minigames, this new Tiger Woods PGA Tour really offers a lot of substance, has an excellent online multiplayer and will make every golf enthusiast happy. So if you like the genre, don't miss it. Pros Direct control of the golf club Loads of modes Technically well done Cons Close shot control is not the best Close to zero communication in online multiplayer For golf enthusiasts only", "date": "2008-09-12", "grade": null}
