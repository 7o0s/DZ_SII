Instead of designing new works, we go back to the past, by recycling. In Frogwares' case, however, the Sherlock Holmes remake The Awakened was a necessity, not an easy cash pick. In the midst of a war, the company needed to keep working, produce something quickly and also with the support of fans, who invested in the Ukrainian company via Kickstarter. Sherlock Holmes The Awakened is the symbol of the resistance of a team immersed in the nightmares of war that decides not to be bent and continue to produce the entertainment works that we all love, transforming their difficulties into a product that can entertain people from all over the world. The whole thing was done in just one year, by the way, an incredible timing for a modern game, although this has conditioned the development of the project and led to a series of compromises. Was it good or bad? We talk about it in the review of Sherlock Holmes The Awakened. 17 years after Sherlock Holmes The Awakened Sherlock and Watson in the Port of London in Sherlock Holmes The Awakened Sherlock Holmes The Awakened is a game originally released in 2006 and then remastered in 2008, with the latter version still available on Steam now (so much so that we played it to compare with the remake). After seventeen years Frogwares returns to its work and takes up the central points of the plot, but changes various elements. First of all, Sherlock Holmes The Awakened stands as a sequel to 2021's Sherlock Holmes Chapter One, the open-map adventure set on the fictional island of Cordona. We will therefore not be a mature Holmes as in the original, but we will take on the role of a young Shelly, on her first real case together with Watson. The plot is part of this new narrative line of Frogwares and, in fact, during the adventure there will be references to our investigator's past. These are just a few hints: we would have liked a stronger link with the previous game, even if it is clear that the developers did not want to make the experience incomprehensible for those who have not played the last adventure. At the very least, the current Sherlock fits better into The Awakened than his 2006/2008 version. Holmes has always been, in all his versions, a bit particular, but this latest iteration presents us with a disturbed young man, with a past dotted with hallucinations and instability, and this has allowed the team to push more on the ~Lovecraftian madness~ background, which will bring the protagonist to the edge of the precipice. Even on a visual level, Sherlock will be consumed by what he will see, be it real or the result of nightmares, so much so that compared to the original, dream sequences have been introduced in which sinister places are visited, although not particularly terrifying. It is difficult to visually create what Lovecraft described in his stories, as they are often based on what is not seen, but we would have liked to perceive more of an otherworldly threat in these stages, which instead just ask us some very simple environmental puzzles within generic locations composed of floating rocks and little else. We may not be particularly tried by these sequences, but Sherlock will be conditioned by the irrationality of what he will see and only Watson will be able to support it. Another necessary change in this new version of Sherlock Holmes The Awakened is the characterization of Watson. The doctor and (for now aspiring) writer is not only Holmes's shadow, but he is his support. Frogwares has also tried to give him more depth, hinting at his past and using his war experiences to justify a small path of personal growth during the adventure. At the same time, however, Frogwares has not been able to create a strong sense of friendship between Sherlock and Watson, at least not as much as it did in Chapter One with childhood friend Jonathan. In fact, the small dialogues typical of the Cordona duo are missing, and the story of The Awakened is based above all on Sherlock's isolation from everything around him (reality above all), which goes in direct contrast with the explicit desire to strengthen the link between the two. Probably some additional scenes designed to deepen the relationship between the two would have helped. In short, on a narrative level, the novelties have ups and downs. The characters are more human and believable, and they are not just ~the great detective and his sidekick~, although each element still has little space and is never really explored. The adventure is enjoyable and runs smoothly, but we don't think you'll be that particularstrongly impressed by the events of The Awakened. Investigate after Cordona This was the port of London in 2008 Sherlock Holmes The Awakened Obviously it is not only the narrative side that has been revised compared to the original chapter. The gameplay is in no way based on the 2008 one, but is an amalgamation of all the mechanics presented in Frogwares latest games. In each environment we will have a series of clues to collect, with some objects to examine and characters to analyze for the creation of a profile. Regularly, the clues obtained will allow us to recreate the crime scenes in the detective's mind, who can imagine what happened at various key points: it's up to us to select the right passages. In some cases, to notice certain evidence in the environment or to dialogue with some characters, it is necessary to select the right clue from the menu. Again: some objects found must be further analyzed with a very simple mini-game in which you have to search a book by selecting a series of words from lists. The clues allow the events of a crime from Sherlock Holmes The Awakened to be created in the mind of the detective The case can only advance when the right clues are available, which must be added in the Mental Palace, which has slightly changed its structure, although in substance it is not particularly different from previous iterations. You always have to connect the clues and arrive at various solutions, even if in The Awakened there are no choices to make: the solution is always one and you cannot incriminate the wrong person unlike in Chapter One. Overall there is nothing really new in Sherlock Holmes The Awakened. Frogwares has taken the fundamental gameplay elements of the previous titles and incorporated them into this one, and therefore anyone who did not appreciate the pace and mechanics of the last games will find nothing here to change their mind. If, on the other hand, you are a fan of the saga, even in this case it will not disappoint you. We will also have to analyze various objects for clues in Sherlock Holmes The Awakened By now Sherlock Holmes, and more generally Frogwares, needs to change something, because the investigative structure is all too simple. You can easily proceed at random, without thinking too much about what is happening: excellent for those looking for a light experience, a little less for those who would like to engage their mind. However, we knew that The Awakened, considering the situation of the team, would not be the chapter of the revolution, but only a modern version of an old game appreciated. However, we can speak positively about one feature of the previous two games of the Ukrainian team that was not included in this game - the open map. Uninteresting in The Sinking City and absolutely useless in Chapter One, the open world has never been handled well by Frogwares which - due to production needs - had to completely discard the idea of including it in The Awakened. Well, we're happy about it because the game feels more streamlined and faster, with a series of investigative sequences in areas that are rarely interspersed with larger areas to explore for no more than a few minutes. In total, it takes no more than eight hours to complete the game. There are some non-mandatory secondary tasks to advance, but even if you want to get all the Trophies / Objectives, just reload the right chapter and play some sequences. A darker world Nightmare areas are more or less always like this in Sherlock Holmes The Awakened Frogwares tried to enhance the atmosphere of Sherlock Holmes The Awakened by changing the settings a bit as well. Obviously benefiting from much more modern technological tools than those of 2006/2008, the team has focused more on rain and light effects to create more horrific settings. We don't fall into horror, but at least we'll immediately get into the right mood. In directorial terms there were also clear changes: the team now favored sudden changes of shot and closer points of view to convey a sense of anxiety. On a purely technical level we are not dealing with a particularly impactful game, but there is a good variety of environments, which are not only dark and rainy places. The frame rate also remains fixed at 60 FPS, with all graphics settings maximized. Chapter One had flow issues in open areas and eliminating those certainly made life easier for developers this round.", "date": "2023-04-11", "grade": "7.5"}
