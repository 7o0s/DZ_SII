At least, this allows a direct comparison for those interested in buying only one (which is quite logical). We have already said in other areas how the evaluation of a racing kart is difficult to transcend from direct comparison with the usual Mario Kart, but this does not apply with the same mathematical regularity as regards the Sega game, in hindsight. The recycling of ideas already in the first chapter was not an annoying constant and with this sequel the Japanese publisher wanted to underline the initiative of his own path, even if on the idea of transformable vehicles, unfortunately for Sumo Digital, Nintendo arrived first with the last chapter for 3DS, even if it doesn't seem there have been any particular influences during the development. On the other hand, the interpretation of the transformational element is quite different here, where from an interlocking element in the classic gameplay dynamics it becomes a substantial modifier of the driving model, as well as a real feast for the eyes. In short, we can already ascribe a positive point to this Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, i.e. its ability to distance itself from the cumbersome initiator of the kart racing genre in this sense and thus consolidate its own series identity, achieved thanks not only to the iconic stature of the characters that are part of the cast, but also to a particular style in which the race in general is represented, which builds on Sega's solid foundations of genre tradition. Kart racing according to Sega While managing to distinguish itself thanks to a particular meaning of the racing game, derived from the publisher's long experience in the field, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed rather faithfully follows the typical canon of the racing game belonging to the kart subgenre. We therefore find ourselves racing with the characters taken from Sega's most famous series aboard customized vehicles and, in this case, transformable from cars to planes, motorboats and hovercrafts. The racing is enriched by the use of offensive and defensive power-ups capable of adding further variations to the game action, while the driving model is strongly based on the exploitation of powerslides, i.e. controlled skids when cornering which, based on duration and amplitude, give a momentary acceleration. Precisely the control of the vehicle, the sense of speed and the behavior of these are at the center of the gaming experience, resulting in a particularly fun and exciting combination, despite the chaos that can often emerge in the midst of racing, still decidedly influenced by a poorly strategic use of power-ups, in terms of attack-defense interlocking and balance of forces. However the fast pace, the intuitive and precise control and - in most cases - the good track design help to provide an excellent general feeling, typically from Sega racing, making the necessary proportions with titles from substantially different genres. There are numerous game modes between single and multiplayer, with in particular an interesting integration of different types of racing within the World Tour, the main single mode that develops by progressing along a sort of map complete with crossroads and clashes with ~bosses~ who then become, once beaten, unlocked playable characters. Basically, all the racing variants that in the previous chapter were found within the missions are condensed, in turn derived in part from the experience accumulated by Sumo Digital with its Out Runs (the drift-based challenge will be certainly familiar to those who have engaged in this series), in a mixture of gameplay elements that significantly revives the interest in single-player racing. On the other hand, the experience gained in this mode is also reflected in the characteristics of the vehicle that can be used in multiplayer, given that all progress is included in the player's ~licence~, which summarizes all the progress made. Completing single-player races and challenges in the three different difficulty levels unlocks characters (mostly from Sega's historical series but also some outsiders, such as Wreck-It Ralph from the animated film of the same name), badges (exclusively aesthetic symbols) and above all, experience points are obtained that can make us progress from one level to another, getting intothis way different trims can affect the base stats of the vehicle. Speed, acceleration, road holding, turbo and All Star (the definitive power-up, capable of giving a momentary personalized transformation while running) can therefore vary according to the profiles that are obtained by advancing from level to level, thus disconnecting the single character from a specific predetermined structure and expanding the possible combinations, to be exploited also in multiplayer. The latter, in addition to the various types of racing, also offers the battle mode, set in arenas and based above all on the use of power-ups and direct confrontation between the pilots. Be amazed, it's a shave The main innovation made on the structure of the first Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing is, obviously, the possibility of transforming your vehicle into different configurations, which substantially modify the driving model and the progress of the race. It is not a maneuver dependent on the player himself, but it is the track which, in some points, imposes this transformation, which takes place on the fly in a few seconds. It's actually quite a spectacular moment: imagine running very fast on a track, then suddenly you find a ramp and the road disappears, leaving room for the blue sky or the sea. At this point, the vehicle transforms in a flash, with a nice animation, into an airplane, motorboat or hovercraft, consequently modifying its behavior and the dynamics of the ride. It may seem like an unnecessary addition, but the way in which the driving pattern varies radically in driving a hovercraft with its typical inertial curve, a motorboat influenced by waves or water surface movements (very well done) or an airplane with the possibility of nose up and dive in the air it provides a substantial enrichment to the gaming experience. Everything, then, responds to the careful direction that the track design imposes in each race, with bits of purely Sega spectacularity that recall some of the most thunderous arcades of the historic Japanese house, such as Scud Race, Daytona or Crazy Taxi, although there is to record a certain alternation of ups and downs between tracks with a high adrenaline and spectacular content and others decidedly less interesting and fun. Of course, after the first impact, after a few hours the spectacular effect of the transformation is partially lost, which begins to return to the normality of racing mechanics, however an important variation element remains within the gameplay which also introduces some elements related to search for different trajectories and possible shortcuts, given the greater width of the ~track~ in the aerial and aquatic phases. Xbox 360 goals 50 unlockable achievements for 1000 points is what Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed has to offer achievement hunters, who given the amount of different races and single and multiplayer modes will find themselves working on several fronts to be able to reach the loot business suit. Combined with the game's own rewards system, which donates badges and game elements and puts them on display in the ~license~, this new chapter in the series does everything to inspire unbridled collecting. Sega-blue skies The genre does not usually lend itself to an impressive technical sector, not being pressed either by the need for photorealism or by the need for serious and spectacular scenographic constructs, yet the game stands out for an undeniable charm that bears the Sega signature printed everywhere. The stylistic features are all there: blue skies, suspended buildings, canyons and spectacular twisting tracks make up for a certain lack of refinement in terms of effects, probably cut to favor the speed of the action as much as possible. On the other hand, the scenarios cannot fail to move something in those who know the history of the brand: just look at the one of After Burner, the one dedicated to Sonic and the imposing one of Panzer Dragoon to understand how this is a purely Sega product, mediated by taste and the undoubted experience of Sumo in the racing genre. However, there is a certain discontinuity in the track design, which alternates spectacular experiences such as those mentioned above with other decidedly subdued tracks, both in terms of the scenarios and for the construction of the track itself, which tends to break the pace of the game too much. The audio accompaniment is also perfectly in the style of the publisher, with music taken from the series in question and effects that include the classic, enthusiastic voices sampled from 90s arcade cabinets. In short, it is not a monster of technique, but the scale of the production is perfectly commensurate with the typegame and fits perfectly, with a style that others can hardly boast, thanks above all to the mixture of Sega icons and arcade racing feeling of which the Japanese house is a master. Moreover, the production value is also calibrated with the price, set at an attractive price of 39.99 euros.", "date": "2012-11-22", "grade": "8.3"}
