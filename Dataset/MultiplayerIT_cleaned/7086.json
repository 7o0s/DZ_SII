Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. We have often had the opportunity to say that the experience of endless games is systematically limited due to the lack of progression, the single level that you try to explore as much as possible, the single game with the inevitable game over that leads, perhaps, to bundles of frustration for an unwanted bump just a few meters from the record. How many excellent, excellent endless runners would have gained points, quality and bite by switching to a level structure? We've always wondered, and Benji Bananas Adventures answers just that question. Published exactly one year after the first episode, the new title developed by Tribeflame and produced by Fingersoft, currently only available on the App Store (but we believe it will soon also be available on Google Play), takes the mechanics of Benji Bananas and projects them into a new direction, eliminating the endless connotation in favor of an adventure in stages with a hundred levels in which we are asked, from time to time, to reach a certain distance by jumping from one liana to another, collect a certain number of bananas or particular objects, perhaps to look for with a little attention in the background, but avoiding to finish the available moves. A factor, the latter, which effectively regulates the difficulty of the missions together with the freemium nature of the product, which materializes in the presence of a pre-established number of lives (five) which, once exhausted, are restored as the minutes go by or dipping into your wallet to make an in-app purchase. Benji Bananas Adventures adds a mission structure to the fun formula of the first episode Tiramisu the banana with a kiss The control system adopted by Benji Bananas Adventures is practically identical to that of the first episode and is based on the simple pressure of the touch screen: as long as we keep our finger on the screen, the protagonist monkey dives down and grabs the first available vine, while releasing the pressure, he abandons the grip and launches himself towards the void. To perform perfect swings it is necessary to calculate the times and distances well, grabbing the vines at their ends and trying to let them go before reaching too high, so as to exploit a powerful horizontal push, particularly useful where the mission involves covering a certain distance. When, on the other hand, the points and bananas are what interests us the most, the approach changes and we need to make a better selection of the ropes to grab, choosing those surrounded by the adored yellow fruit. The inevitable boosts, however obtainable almost exclusively for a fee, and the dear old cobwebs, which produce extra rebounds when the moves available to us are about to run out, create a little variety in the action. Unfortunately, the structural progression of Benji Bananas Adventures is not supported by a greater freshness in terms of gameplay and technical realization. In fact, the latter starts from the pleasant sprites of the first episode but without offering us adequately differentiated scenarios or substantial innovations, not even in terms of sound, while the playful aspect tends a bit too much to repetition where, instead, some remixes were needed to keep the 'interest. In short, the objective of the game can be said to have been achieved but it would have been possible to do more.", "date": "2014-05-31", "grade": "7.5"}
