After the excellent opinions obtained with MiniSquadron and the experiment made with EpicWin, a playful agenda that transforms one's appointments into RPG quests, the British developer took advantage of the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco to show everyone a new graphics engine on which was working for an anonymous racing game, quite promising in the lighting system and which at the time even had the ambition to surpass the work done by Epic with its UDK in terms of graphic rendering. If a few months ago these statements seemed rather pretentious, now that Forever Drive is out, many fans have discovered that the one that arrived on the virtual shelves of the App Store is not the graphic marvel they expected. Still, it's possible that iPhone and iPad users will find something better than a graphically impressive tech demo in their hands: is it a good game? Social competition The concept behind this interesting freemium game is summed up in its very title: Forever Drive is a non-stop, virtually infinite race that takes the player to cross one track after another without ever stopping. In this futuristic racing game with a top-down view, the aim is that of the classic arcade  la Out-Run, in which to reach certain checkpoints before the seconds run out, so as to recharge the time available and aim for the next finish line. There are no opponents to overcome in reckless head-to-head, but only several cars on the road whose sole purpose is to put a spanner in your wheels and induce you to lose the painstakingly accumulated score multiplier. If you are unable to reach the next checkpoint in time, you can start over from the same and identical point but saying goodbye to your score. As is to be expected from a freemium game of this type, the entire experience is based on the slow progression of your virtual driver and the amount of content that can be unlocked. Track after track, the points accumulated are converted into experience, thanks to which you can level up and unlock new cars, colors and plates, although through microtransactions it is possible to access exclusive content or to obtain the most coveted cars in a few moments and without the need to spend dozens of hours trying to slowly fill their piggy bank. The strong point of Forever Drive, however, is undoubtedly its social component, thanks to which the experience of the individual is strongly linked to the contributions of the community: each user can in fact create his own path through an intuitive editor, and once completed it is instantly sent to all other players: after playing it, they can use a simple voting system to influence the frequency with which it appears; since the order of the courses is chosen at random, a successful track is more likely to appear, while a bad one may even be excluded from the selection altogether. It is therefore obvious that the experience depends above all on the quality of the tracks created by the users, and if sometimes it happens to go through extremely entertaining levels, more often than not one comes across real horrors, built so badly as to make them not only boring, but even almost impossible to complete, perhaps risking ruining all the efforts made to achieve a high score. However, the developers wanted to give small incentives that encourage users to create interesting routes, such as exclusive content or decorations to unlock to embellish their tracks. Everything under control As mentioned at the beginning, technically speaking Forever Drive is far from impressing the player as productions of the caliber of Infinity Blade, Rage and Shadowrun did, but thanks to a discreet management of the lights and a graphic style that heavily recalls the universe of Tron, the Supermono game still manages to be very pleasant on an aesthetic level. However, it must be said that the merit goes above all to the neon color combinations, since the car models are rather simple, while the buildings and other decorations on the track fit badly into the road, giving the unpleasant feeling that the level is full of graphical glitches. On the other hand, the work done with the customization of the controls was commendable, since from the options it is possible to find almost all the schemes seen so far in the gui gamesfrom top-down for mobile devices: for example, it is possible to steer using the iPhone's accelerometer, arrows on the sides of the screen, a lever at the bottom left, or choose between automatic and manual accelerator. In short, even if the default setting should seem uncomfortable to you, it is very unlikely that by hacking through the options you will not be able to find a combination that is right for you. It's a pity that the game sometimes tends to become frustrating due to too severe collisions: touching another car means resetting your multiplier to zero, but often you will even have the impression of not having even touched the car next to you. If we add to this the traditional formula that unites freemium games and which relies above all on the repetitiveness of the player's actions, it is clear that a good portion of users could abandon Forever Drive in record time.
