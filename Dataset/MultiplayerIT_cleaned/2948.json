{"name": "PGA Tour 2K21: la recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pga-tour-2k21-recensione.html", "text": "Those of you who grew up with ~Tutti in campo con Lotti~ know well how much people of our venerable age care about a sport like golf. Shouting ~Spa-Ghe-Tti!~ we beat anyone with a stick. Pine cones, stones, grass, balls, everything in short, just to feel like expert golfers like the protagonist of that anime that amused us so much at the time. This desire to try to make Birdie or even Eagle has remained unchanged over the years and has grown through some more or less successful videogame transpositions, one above all that ~Neo Turf Master~ that we have played at least once in our life in the arcade under the house or in holiday at the factory cabinet, while the ice cream made our joystick dirty. The explosion of joy after having successfully concluded a hole (or a series) is something that only those who have experienced the above sensations can understand. With this state of mind we approached the review of PGA Tour 2K21 and, we must say, we were pleasantly surprised by the result obtained by the guys from 2K Games and HB Studios. The feeling that the title transmits once you take the field is one that leaves a smile on your face, recalling the sensations of the good old days, enabling you to concentrate on shooting with the right amount of firmness and with an interest in details necessary to get to the hole in the best possible way. The game of golf With our trusty golf bag full of clubs and hopes, we therefore ventured into the maze of rounds for the championships included in the game, which, as one would expect from a 2K title, are 4 and will help you climb the rankings to become the golfer number one in the world. It starts from the Korn Ferry Q-School up to the fantastic and famous PGA Tour, in which to face the best golfers in the world (for the occasion there are 12 licensed golfers). Each tournament will have its own holes, also licensed, and its difficulties, obviously increasing as you go up in level. One of the characteristics that is present only in the major tournament is that of being able to choose a sponsor to support us who, if we manage to complete the objectives given to us by the same, will allow us to unlock in-game currency, aesthetic objects or even rare or legendary clubs. Speaking of clubs, each of them has unique characteristics that make one or the other club more or less suitable for the great variety of holes and terrains available within the game. The thing we noticed is that, at least in the PS4 version tested, all this big difference is not so perceptible, especially with regard to shooting difficulty. Let's come right to the shot, the elusive swing so difficult to master in reality, and so faithfully reported in the 2K title. The controls all develop around the analog sticks and the back buttons, using the right stick (at least in the standard version, but there is also the left-handed configuration) to control the swing, the left one to choose the landing point of the ball and the desired percentage of power to apply to the shot. The back buttons will instead allow you to decide how and where to hit the ball, whether to give it a backward or forward effect (spin or backspin) and therefore also decide the angle of the same, allowing you to suffer more or less the influence of the wind . Other important commands are those set on the directional cross, used to choose the club and the type of basic shot, such as a splash if we are approaching the green or a chip if we are on the fairway and we have to try to get close to the hole. To hit the ball you simply have to pull down on the right stick and hold it until the indicator reaches the desired percentage, then give a quick jab upwards, trying to stay in the perfect shot range as much as possible, to see it land the ball exactly where you want it. More or less. Because as anyone reading this review knows, the journey of the ball is not all rosy. Naturally, other fundamental factors must be taken into consideration for the success of the shot: the wind, the height of the starting point, the landing point and the slope, as well as obstacles such as trees, bodies of water and bunkers. The on-screen aids help in this sense by showing the speed and direction of the wind, as well as the relative height of the points and the inclination of the terrain, the latter using a trick as old as it is useful, namely that of the dashes that move more or less quickly on the pitch towards the lowest slope. Once you get to the green, after a thousand vicissitudes and hopefully, at least on par, you will find yourselfhaving to face the last shots of the hole with the putt, the club that will allow you to send the ball into the goal. Here we have another aid that comes to the rescue to help in the finishing blow. In fact, by pressing the X key we can visualize the final trajectory that our ball would have, if we hit the power indicator precisely in the point indicated on the bar. This visual aid is essential but should be used sparingly because it can only be activated a limited number of times per lap, so our advice is to use it only and exclusively when you find yourself in particular situations such as fighting for one less point or if you really want to hit the hole from 30 or 40 yards. Finally, to help the ball enter the hole, you can press the square button to raise the flag. If all this seems complicated to you, know that you will still have a practice field at your disposal with lessons and the possibility of practicing with the swing, as well as a handy glossary of terms which never hurts, being all English. Small drawback: in our test, occasionally, it was not possible to perform a swing by simply holding the analog stick down. Perhaps due to a bug in the console port, we are not aware of it, but every time it happened we were forced to make a small semicircle backwards to be able to load the shot, causing the release of the shot to become lopsided many times. compromising the success of the game. Technique and customization From a technical point of view, PGA Tour 2K21 does its job, even if it fails to excel in any respect. The character models are well done but nothing to cry out for a miracle. The animations, especially those of the golfers, are quite accurate and the physics of the ball is very good, reflecting well the weight and the rebounds on the various surfaces it touches or where it finds itself rolling as well as the wind is also well considered by the algorithm physicist. The visual impact is respectable, with sometimes fantastic glimpses but unfortunately, sporadically, textures that are not in high resolution are noticed and the public, even if it reacts dynamically to the progress of the holes and in general is an addition pleasant, it is not exactly the maximum detail. Our custom golfer can be created from scratch with a good editor that will allow you to add the features you want, from facial details to body ones, even if perhaps something more could have been done just from this point of view, not being able to play too much on the proportions of the physique. You can also decide what type of clothing to have your character adopt, from hats to socks through belts and leg warmers, with lots of licensed items (Puma, Adidas, Polo Ralph Lauren to name a few). Another characteristic point of the HB Studios title is that of creating your own golf course. We start from the choice of the name to move on to that of the theme, that is the general setting that will surround our blows. We have mountainous, desert, flat, agricultural lands and so on and so forth. we can customize the amount of slopes, the water level, the rocks, the size of the green and the amount of bunkers, just to name a few of the possible actions in the very first menu that is made available to us. Once the main features have been chosen, we are placed in front of the real customization screen, which recalls the most famous video game creation engines with the possibility of really positioning and modifying any part of the field. You can add animals, plants, bodies of water, audiences, video transmission towers, bleachers and various structures, as well as change the time of day, latitude and altitude. In short, there is plenty of bread for content creators to chew on. Online and social The online content is what you'd expect from a 2K title, with fast matchmaking and the addition of a tournament section, here called online companies, where you can join one of the user-created companies or create your own, and Join or create custom tournaments to get in-game currency. Matchmaking works well. The games never had any input lag or any other server-related issues. Obviously it should be evaluated when there are many people online, but for now everything is fluid and fun. The possible matches are of 3 types: the classic 1vs1 called matchplay, the 2vs2 with the best score called Scramble and then a particular mode called Bet for 2 or 4 players which assigns a skin for victory to the winning teamcitrice and whoever gets the most skins at the end of the game wins. Of course, it is also possible to challenge a friend in a local game to have fun and maybe show off some created fields. Remaining on the ~challenges~ side, another interesting feature included in the game is that of rivalries. In fact, during the main tournaments we will be assigned rivals with whom to compete to achieve certain objectives. By completing the dedicated challenges we will have bonuses, mostly in the form of in-game currency, but also the possibility of being able to more easily reach the goals of the sponsors, sometimes really tough.", "date": "2020-08-20", "grade": "8.7"}
