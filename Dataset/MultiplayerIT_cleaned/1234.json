Of course this makes competitions more uncertain but it also gives some frustration. From here it is clear that Mashed is a title strongly oriented towards multiplayer (technically limited, as we will see later), given that the single mode appears easy and not very exciting, and in a rather questionable way, it turns out to be the only way to earn circuits and cars to be used in much more rewarding games with friends. There are also other types of competition, such as tests of speed and skill, against opponents who prove to be fierce, but rather prone to making mistakes. Frequently they commit compromising maneuvers not only for you but also for them or they engage reverse gear to wait for you and then end up off-road. From here we tend to look for the game with humans. The use of weapons is a must if you want to win quickly: machine guns, oil, explosive mines, are just some of the trinkets that you can collect on the tracks to defeat your enemies. This happens quite spectacularly, for example when you pelt a car with bullets until it catches fire and then explodes shortly after. Fun! Note on the circuits: although they don't shine in quantity, they offer a good variety of environments and situations, such as crazy traffic or dangerous turns and intersections (as well as cuts) in different (but not variable) weather conditions. But is it the game graphics? It's not just the video... The presentation of the game boded well for the graphics sector: a short film with excellent 3D models of cars engaged in races to the death. The thing that leaves a bitter taste in the mouth is the fact that the graphics of the game have only a pale resemblance to that of the video, showing us cars and tracks made discreetly but certainly not the latest fashion. The game engine, the famous (and now outdated Renderware) does its job decently even on not very recent machines but the show offered seems to be that of a title from 2-3 years ago. On the positive side we have the visual distance, which does not show clips evident and some good reflection effects but nothing more. Mashed's substance lies elsewhere. Cactus head! The sound sector is well suited to the game: car noises that are more reminiscent of toy cars (after all, this game is made by the Micro Machines programmers themselves), explosions, scuffs, and a whole series of epithets that you and your opponents can launch ( using the appropriate ~insults~ button). The game is all dubbed in Italian, with a deliberately demented tone but the voices you will hear during the offenses have the particularity of being so annoying and irritating that you immediately want to deactivate them. Much better to hear human opponents rail against you. Lastly, the absence of any music during the competitions (which would have helped the somewhat monotonous system) should be noted. Play online? No! Play LAN? NO! And here is the sore point that most penalizes Mashed: as for the console version we have the total absence of a real mutiplayer outside your machine. It is not possible to organize matches on the Internet or on the net but only by playing with a maximum of 4 people in front of the same monitor. Too bad because being the ideal title for competitions with other human opponents, the possibility of playing it only with people at home makes it ~mutilated~. It is not possible to organize matches on the Internet or on the net but only by playing with a maximum of 4 people in front of the same monitor. Play online? No! Play LAN? NO! Not everyone has 4 joypads and using the keyboard in more than two is impossible. The game possibilities offered are only two: all against all or in teams. As already mentioned before, races with friends are clearly superior to those with the CPU, becoming real wars based on improprieties and gratuitous insults. The system is always that of direct elimination based on the position on the screen. Be careful not to fall behind! Recommendation: if you want to reconcile friendships forget this game! [C] A frame from the presentation The CPU is running. tough if she runs alone [/C] comment Mashed arrives directly from the console bringing its immediate and fun playability, provided however that you play with opponents in the flesh, given that the singleplayer turns out to be just a mere system to lengthen longevity a little with the excuse of gaining cars and tracks . Too bad for the total lack of online competitions, which would have greatly benefited a title that is 90% enjoyable in company. Ideal for those who have a good number of pads and guests and are willing to pay full price. The others look elsewhere. Pros: Immediate and fun Good variety of environments and situations Not richede a ninja pc to run around Cons: Boring singleplayer Graphics not great Lack of LAN/online support The legacy of the myth We could define Mashed as the heir to MicroMachines V3, a game from which it takes the game dynamics quite markedly: weapons, direct elimination, varied circuits. A small evolution for a type of game that doesn't have many exponents on PC. After all, the programmers are the same and the team that wins doesn't change. Drive to survive! In many ways Mashed recalls that old glory that is MicroMachines V3, released years ago on PlayStation, in which dirty and bad races took place also thanks to the use of more or less lethal power-ups. The gameplay is very similar, with competitions of up to four opponents on circuits full of dangerous passages and objects, and filled with weapons of all kinds. Mainly the victory is obtained with the direct elimination of the competitors: in practice when one of these falls behind and ends up off the screen he is disqualified from the round, the last one remaining will win a point which is taken away from the others. With this system the races go from lasting a few minutes to long sessions, depending on the skill of the opponents. It should be noted that being at the head of the race you do not have sufficient visibility of the route and therefore you drive blind, often risking an inevitable mistake.", "date": "2004-07-29", "grade": null}
