The problem is that, despite the many reports of attacks and sightings, no one has yet managed to prove the presence of a structured criminal organization. For their part, the authorities of the cities located along the river have decided not to lift a finger to intervene in the matter, declassifying the attacks as ~isolated cases~ caused by small gangs or exaggerations by merchants. Of course, no special measures have been taken for safety. Finding out what's underneath and foiling the threat will be up to the player. The first thing to do, as per tradition as soon as the adventure begins, is to create a character. Unlike other RPGs, in Drakensang: The River of Time a different character corresponds to a different course of the adventure, with different missions depending on the class. The generation phase is very complete and allows those who don't want to complicate their lives too much to select a hero archetype, with the values already assigned, or to tinker with the points to be distributed to the various characteristics, in order to obtain a total personalization of the protagonist. Playing it will be easy to realize how the choices made affect the game. For example, it will be clear from the first dialogues of the introductory sequence that having social skills offers more communication options, with the relative advantages, while, to give another example, having no talent in alchemy prevents you from gathering herbs and other ingredients for the potions. The examples would be many more, but you should have understood that the initial points are not to be distributed lightly, but according to a precise schedule. Obviously it should be emphasized that the many choices and many variations in the development of the game make it replayable several times with different types of characters, always offering different situations. The importance of knowing how to observe The game system is very reminiscent of what was seen in the previous episode, but an enormous work has been done to improve it, work that has borne clearly visible results. In the first place, the explorable areas are larger and more geographically stratified, i.e. those who had complained about a certain flatness of the maps of the first Drakensang, here will rejoice in finding cities built on several levels complete with underground areas, or bridges that connect the banks of placid rivers flowing down from high mountains, all with no loading whatsoever (except on a few occasions). To simplify the player's life, a fast travel system has been designed that allows you to reach the areas you have already visited in a flash. Obviously exploration is central to the gaming experience and here, unfortunately, the lack of a key that underlines the hot spots should be noted. In reality, rather than a real defect, we can consider it the simple lack of a convenient option that can come in handy in the most complex environments. For example, in a warehouse it is not easy to distinguish the ~interactable~ crates from the others, since they are very similar objects, and you end up wasting a lot of time exploring the area with the pointer. The same could be said for the quests, because the more trivial secondary ones are not marked in the diary (such as delivering a package) which, if they are not dealt with immediately, risk slipping out of mind. But they are details, because otherwise the system works very well and after a while you get used to these small shortcomings and end up ignoring them completely. However, if desired, it is possible to make up for it by inserting personal notes on the maps of the areas. Hybrid system The combat system is similar to that of the previous chapter: the actions are performed by clicking on the enemies with the mouse and at the bottom there is the classic shortcut bar on which the skills and spells of the characters can be assigned. Depending on the level of difficulty, the fights can be more or less easy, but already at the intermediate level some can be really challenging, especially if you don't arrive suitably prepared. Things get really interesting when you are leading a large party and collide with other groups of enemies: it is in these moments that you need to show off a good tactical skill and put the knowledge of the controlled characters to good use, also taking advantage of the pause tactic that allows you to freeze the action and reflect on what to do. A bit like what happens in Dragon Age: Origins, moreover with the same level of general complexity, made possible by the flexibility of the hero growth system. Each enemy killed yields experience points that canor be spent on improving features. Accumulate a few 'experience points level up, as in any self-respecting role-playing game. Mountains springing from the waters From a technical point of view, the step forward compared to the previous chapter is macroscopic: The Dark Eye was certainly not admired for being particularly spectacular. Forget about ugly textures and vague environments because Drakensang: The River of Time plays a completely different music. It's actually amazing how visually striking a title from which nothing is expected. So here we are wandering through luxuriant forests and luxuriant meadows, or in dark caves where the light sources create superb plays of light, which give a dramatically romantic touch to the rooms. Even the models of the characters are well done and, while not excellent, some are well characterized even in the facial expressions, always in harmony with the character of the different 'actors'. Sure, we're not on the level of a Mass Effect 2 or a The Witcher, but we can't complain. Unfortunately, there are noticeable drops in framerate that can occur in some areas, especially city areas where the graphics engine has to manage a lot of data. In general, however, it is a huge step forward compared to what was seen in the first Drakensang, a step that brings the series closer to the sacred monsters of the genre such as Oblivion.", "date": "2010-06-29", "grade": "9.0"}
