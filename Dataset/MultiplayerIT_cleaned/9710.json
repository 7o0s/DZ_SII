{"name": "La citt del peccato", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/81695-fallout-new-vegas-la-citta-del-peccato.html", "text": "Version tested: Xbox 360Few other titles have earned the Game of the Year award like 2008's Fallout 3. Bethesda, in the midst of the skepticism of thousands of fans who feared a distortion of the saga and an all-action drift, has been able to build one of those experiences that mark a hardware generation and beyond, mainly thanks to a sense of adventure and storytelling that in some respects no one before had managed to express and in that way. A different experience, in which the plot failed to surprise with unexpected twists, precisely because any twist was entrusted to the choices of the player himself who, of course, cannot be caught off guard, but who in exchange was left with the feeling of being able to decide any among a myriad of possible alternatives. Obsidian, which has already lent its services to similar operations in the past, taking care of the development of the sequel to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic in place of Bioware, comes out this year with Fallout: New Vegas, and does so by providing a context different narrative which, dedicating the right amount of hours to it, turns into a nice new episode of the series, developed with a cumbersome aura of sacred respect for the original, of which it contains all the main characteristics and also some defects. Courier life The premises of Fallout: New Vegas are slightly different from those of the third chapter, in which the player was entrusted with the sense of bewilderment due to the rediscovery of a post-nuclear world that was starting to live again outside the vaults, i.e. bunkers in which a lucky few they had been able to find shelter from the radiation resulting from a conflict that had devastated the United States of America. In New Vegas, the world is already out and the player plays a courier tasked with transporting a mysterious chip to what remains of the Las Vegas Strip, or rather that legendary street dotted with hotels, casinos and variously assorted humanity: the city of sin, survived the bombings almost intact. During the delivery we are attacked by a strange group of people, whose gang leader wears a black checkered suit, who shoot us at point blank range, thinking they have killed us. A robot picks us up and takes us to a doctor, in whose house the adventure begins with the usual choice of race, gender and physical characteristics of the avatar to which we remain tied, as before, for dozens of hours of quests , shootings and explorations, which lead us to meet the members of the New California Republic and the Legion, the two largest factions that vie for dominance of the Hoover Dam that supplies electricity to the entire Mojave area and New Vegas. The structure is identical, with a series of experience points that can be invested to improve the skills most suited to one's way of playing, from physical strength to intelligence, up to luck, passing through the essential skills that allow you to unlock doors more easily closed or barred terminals with passwords to decipher. At the beginning, the sense of deja vu is rather overwhelming, given that in a few moments one understands that, if any creative freedom was left to the new developer, this certainly did not consist in the possibility of subverting the basic rules of a role-playing game that so much fortune had collected a few years ago. So here we find a hero who, when holding a weapon, does it with a shaking hand, since he still does not have sufficient aiming skills, and who in order to be able to sneak everywhere and convince the characters to give him the desired information he must develop the right burglary and dialectic skills, for example. Even the combat system remains unchanged with that mix, winning for the writer, between real-time fps and turn-based game, with action points to be spent in a bullet time mode, in slow motion, which allows you to target individual parts of any opponent's body, building a tactic that varies from the aimed attack to the head, up to the attempt to disarm or cripple the toughest enemies. In Fallout: New Vegas, among other things, apart from the contaminated animals, the most frequent encounters are made with armed gangs that compete for the territory, different in clothing and equipped weapons. Ghouls, i.e. humans exposed to radiation for too long, and other monstrous creatures born of the conflict, are encountered later in the game and play an exceptional rather than usual role. The protagonists of this new chapter are the human race and its, much controversial, moral inclinations. The Official Guide to Fallout: New Vegas! Multiplayer.it Edizioni is happy to participate actively in the launch of the game by proposingthe Official Guide also in a collector's version, to have practical access to all the quests, locations and objects scattered throughout the world of Fallout: New Vegas Rival gangs The most important novelty is precisely constituted by the relationships that exist between the various warring parties which, in addition to the two main ones already mentioned, include a series of tribes/bands/fraternities, the cities to cross, plus a couple of surprises related to the evolution of the plot. Different degrees of relationships and friendships can be maintained with each of them, which can also be influenced by wearing the characteristic clothes of each of them, leading the engine to manage a really great data complexity, but not without some consequences. It happens that you enter a building where you are greeted as vaguely friends and then, without having done anything in particular, you see yourself attacked in the first of the rooms you pass through. This does not detract much from the experience of an adventure made up of hundreds of quests, varied and almost never banal, and with a main story that leads to different endings but which, once again, does not allow you to continue playing after the end. Which is a shame, but it does bode well for future DLC that will enable this feature. Given the theme of the game, you can accumulate caps to spend in the shops playing BlackJack, with slot machines or with a gambling game called Caravan for which you have to build a personalized deck, buying cards around the Mojave. They are fun additions, but in the end the fastest way to make money is to loot corpses and houses scattered everywhere. The new possibilities related to the modification of weapons and the addition of travel companions to be put in the team, both animals and humans / mutated, have the same little importance. The modifications can be bought or built at the appropriate benches, but in fact the weapons that are around are more than enough to play without problems and the teammates have an artificial intelligence that soon makes them prefer the solo journey to having to wait for it find the right way to reach us on the maps. Furthermore, Obsidian has included a real tribute to old school RPG lovers, with the addition of the ~Hard~ mode, which forces the player to take care of feeding, watering and making his character sleep, who will not even be able to teleport from location to location, if the game were to assess that he would die of dehydration walking the intended distance, for example. In short, those looking for a good level of challenge and even greater longevity will find bread for their teeth. Xbox 360 goals The structure of the objectives has also remained unchanged, given that there are those related to completing a certain number of kills, rather than reaching certain levels of experience, plus obviously those related to the passages of the main quest and the various sub-quests. It's not impossible to make full loot, far from it, it just takes quite a bit of time. 2008Vegas Fallout: New Vegas evidently leverages the same engine as Fallout 3 to move the whole adventure with the same almost unchanged characteristics. A good HDR, evocative scenarios, but a quality of textures, models and animations that inevitably show the two years that have passed since the previous episode. That said, the game is still a beautiful experience, but it must be lived by remembering to save often, since it sometimes happens that the code crashes during a fight or immediately after loading an area. Just the uploads are one of the Achilles heels, given that as the variables and data uploaded increase, the waiting times become longer, even when installing on a hard disk, rather than playing it directly from the DVD. The audio sector boasts atmospheric music and radios that broadcast a mix of amusing stories and period songs on the surface, which however tend to repeat themselves rather quickly. A huge job has been done for the dubbing, since all the lines of dialogue are subtitled and dubbed in Italian. The quality of the translation is not free from problems, with pearls such as the ~Restrooms~ or the toilets, which on a couple of occasions become ~Restrooms~, but in the face of the epic nature of the enterprise it is, as for the technical problems, of a factor on which the fans will also be able to close both eyes.
