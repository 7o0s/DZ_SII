{"name": "Afterparty", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/afterparty-recensione.html", "text": "With Oxenfree, the Night School Studio team took everyone a little by surprise (as far as possible for a team made up of veterans anyway) but it is clear at this point that there is a precise project behind its productions, as we see in this Afterparty review. This is not a standard development team but a sort of production company specialized in interactive stories: adventures with a strongly narrative character if you will, but the setting chosen by the developers, which stands as a real stylistic code to this point, it is so based on the story as to reduce the normal purely playful elements of the adventure to a minimum, making them mere accessories within the central mechanism, represented by the dialogues and the possibility of directing the outcome through various choices that can influence the story progression itself. We can safely speak of a new derivation of the ~walking simulator~ in this case too, although the essentially 2D third-person and side-scrolling setting may suggest something different. There is probably a reference to classic graphic adventures in the atypical choice of framing and staging, which contribute to making Night School's style original and well recognizable and is further refined in Afterparty, while remaining substantially on the same line as Oxenfree . The latter relied on more settled situations and atmospheres, referring to classic teen horror suggestions to stage a story that then touched on deeper topics, while Afterparty goes to explore less traveled paths, abandoning known imaginaries to build an identity even stronger, but you can still see some common elements in the topics covered. There is undoubtedly more cynicism and much more social satire in this new Night School game, with sentimental relationships being treated in a more ironic and less romantic way, but common problems emerge between one and the other, here enlarged to a irreverent representation of life and death. Afterlife and hangover The story is extremely simple and equally absurd, but hides a series of themes that are explored through the continuous dialogues that fill practically the entire game time. Milo and Lola are two friends who have just finished college, but during what seems like a farewell party and welcome to ~real life~ they actually discover that they are dead (how and when will only be mentioned later) and find each other suddenly in hell. After moments of understandable absolute shock, the two best friends discover that there is a way out to return to Earth alive, and that is to defeat Satan in a drinking contest. Arriving late at the meeting with the demon who must direct them to their personal eternity of torment (the office is open from 9 to 18, on the other hand), they thus find themselves having an entire night to try to put the slowly, counting on the support of a talkative demoness-taxi driver and colorful figures they meet on their journey to hell, which at night apparently does not differ much from the earthly nightlife, except for the presence of wings and horns on the majority part of bartenders and customers. The first minutes of the game already establish the typical tones of the whole experience: macabre humor, social satire and a constant digging into the psyche and consciences of the main characters and the two protagonists in particular, who under the always ironic surface of the their exchanges often bring out a decidedly complex and stratified reality. They are two boys who fail to recognize each other in standard social dynamics, one shy and awkward and the other rebellious and always caustic in approaching others, who lean on each other to get by in adversity and find themselves accomplices in the greatest adventure ever lived before. As already happened in Oxenfree, here too the particular situation exposes the whole theater of relationships, affections and tensions that are hidden in their relationship and in that with others, but there are marked differences in tone and also in the topics covered. The constant humor must not mislead because Afterparty, between alcoholic parties and beer pong matches, also touches on profound, cerebral and almost philosophical issues, with a quality in the texts that is truly difficult to find in the videogame field, even digging in rich indie production and narrative adventures. Power to dialogue Afterparty takes the game mechanics entirely focused on the dialogues that already showed itself as the predominant element of Oxenfree to the extreme, making it becomeclearly the characterizing style of the team. The lyrics are all-encompassing, they invade every moment of the game in a constant verbosity that recalls certain comedies by Woody Allen, also due to the intelligent and profound humor that characterizes them. It is through these that the gameplay also essentially takes place, given that the action on the story takes place above all with the choices that are continuously made during the dialogues, capable of opening new narrative ramifications even starting from variations that are apparently minimal but which can have major repercussions. It is obvious that such an approach has consequences: the classic elements of adventure such as puzzles, exploration and puzzles are practically cancelled, with all the attention being paid exclusively to the story which takes place orally through conversations between the characters. Another important element to take into consideration, given this structure, is that both the dialogues and the subtitles are in English (at least for the moment) and considering the speed of the exchanges and the complexity of the texts, this could seriously undermine the enjoyment of the game for who does not have a good knowledge of the language. There are two elements of the gameplay that constitute particular digressions in the flow of the story: the drinks to drink and the ~pub~ games. Most of the settings that can be visited in Afterparty have one or more bars, to highlight the obsessive presence of alcohol in the story, which also has interesting implications towards the end. In these bars it is possible to order different types of cocktails that cause different effects on the personality of the protagonists, opening up new and particular choices within the dialogues, which can influence the unfolding of the story and open new paths. Mini-games, represented by ~beer pong~ (throwing a ball into glasses during a drink), rhythm game-style dance performances and building towers of glasses under the influence of alcohol accompany some topical moments of the dialogues and can change the outcome. In both cases, these are very elementary game mechanics, however closely linked to the system of choosing topics and answers. The possibility of changing the attitude of the protagonists with the right drink, however, opens the door to particularly amusing interludes, as well as allowing the deepening of some topics otherwise impossible to deal with, representing an ingenious variation to the dialogue system. A strange hell The hell of Afterparty is original, above all thanks to the mixture of tones and topics used. The representation of the afterlife as a place that essentially replicates the distortions and paradoxes of the earthly bureaucratic system and of capitalist and bourgeois society is not an entirely new solution, but it still gives rise to very spot on sarcastic and pungent jokes and situations. However, Dante's classic version is partially maintained and blends organically with the surreal vision, staging an afterlife in which the damned are subjected to terrible torments but only during office hours, being able to then spend their free time in the numerous clubs in around hell and assiduously using smartphones to communicate and send tweets (visible as comics walking near the NPCs). The fundamental issues of modern life such as personal self-assertion, finding one's way in a hierarchically set society and the importance of interpersonal relationships are fully found in this hell, which is essentially a picturesque continuation of earthly life with mythological implications -religious (the story of Lucifer and the war against God is mentioned several times as a founding act of the place and a great unresolved psychological question for Satan). On the other hand, it's not just about laughing: in its apparently facetious representation, rather disturbing moments are also staged and topics that are real punches in the stomach are treated, such as when the ~personal demon~ delves into memories and psyche of Milo and Lola, bringing out some tensions between the two or we find ourselves face to face with the more serious and fearsome aspect of the character of Satan and his demons. This is also a sort of training journey, and it is curious to note how the two protagonists find themselves resolving conflicts and unresolved issues in life only through this journey in the afterlife. The graphic style remains in line with that seen in Oxenfree, with a highly stylized cut that recalls cartoons and classic graphic adventures as regards framing and general setting. The streets, iexternal panoramas and the interiors of the hell of Afterparty are extremely colorful and suggestive, with a very original character design. However, what stands out the most in qualitative terms are the dialogues, recorded with a good cast of professional actors capable of giving a great personality to the various protagonists of the story, as befits a game that has its fundamental characteristic in this element.", "date": "2019-10-28", "grade": "8.3"}
