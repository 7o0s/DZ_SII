Just imagine: used to sitting in front of a monitor and studying statistics and solutions to advance within a classic RPG, he finds himself faced with a reduction to the minimum terms of the genre in question, which only requires pressing on a ~key~ to advance. In fact, not even that, since he still wants to go ahead on his own. Yet there is a logic behind such an oddity, which has even defined a canon, that of ~tapping games~, in which the interaction is limited to the frantic pressure and without too much gray matter support of the fingers on the touch screen. Daniel Hjelm's free game leverages above all on the most mechanical and addictive element of the role-playing game, i.e. grinding, which here practically becomes the sole foundation of the whole structure, pushing us to press like crazy to see the levels and stats of our unnamed hero. It is precisely an extreme simplification of the RPG, a sort of parody also highlighted by the way in which the progression in the game is illustrated: instead of moving within real levels, the action takes place in an always fixed shot that is modified by scenarios and new characters that follow one another and alternate live like self-propelled theatrical wings, a real staging that plays on the continuous search for the upper level without interruption, to the rhythm of a frenzied tapping on the screen, attacking, defending and activating upgrades. And, based on logical mechanisms that highlight the simplicity of the common human being, the system works, even if not for long. Tap tap tap, level change, tap tap tap, level change... a hard day in Tap Heroes: Idle RPG The magic touch The question is very simple: on the one hand there are the characters of our party and on the other the enemies to face in a continuous turn-based battle (or almost) follow one another without stopping. The player is required to touch the screen on enemies to attack or touch your main character to heal him, while occasionally it is possible to touch the various parameters relating to your fighters to increase their level, earning the coins required to implement these evolutions. The game continues even without player input (hence the reference to the ~Idle RPG~ of the title) but the touches on the screen obviously speed up the action and allow you to check all the grinding statistics. The party consists of a standard warrior, a wizard capable of healing and a rogue who attacks with a ranged bow, each of which has parameters such as strength, speed and salute to increase individually as well as other general stats for the whole group. No particular strategies are required in the combat system, it is simply a matter of pressing like obsessed on the enemy, taking care to touch your warrior every now and then to speed up the healing process, especially during boss fights. In the meantime, the levels pass and the scenarios change non-stop, while remaining essentially all the same in this bizarre meta-RPG theater. The psychological mechanism behind grinding is the driving force behind Tap Heroes, and it's surprisingly powerful. Although the first impression with the game can easily be frightened, given its absurd simplicity, it is easy to get caught up in the action precisely by virtue of its mechanical and carefree intuitiveness, even if the very little depth in the long term makes itself felt.", "date": "2015-03-12", "grade": "6.4"}
