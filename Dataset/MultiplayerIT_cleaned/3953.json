{"name": "FIFA Calcio", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/fifa-calcio-recensione.html", "text": "FIFA Calcio is an example of how it is possible to transform mobile games into real platforms, to be updated and even revolutionized through the release of full-bodied updates, which aim to keep the large active user base firmly in place and to arouse their interest thanks to the introduction of more or less important innovations, while leaving the starting system intact. The mobile edition of Electronic Arts football has exploited this possibility several times, with various ~seasons~ in which the developers decided to change some aspects of the experience, chasing player feedback rather than their idea of what a game should actually be like. football for mobile devices. In fact, the traditional setting seems to have been lost for some time, and although in terms of gameplay the rival Pro Evolution Soccer 2018 Mobile has shown that it is still possible to field a certain quality, the FIFA formula remains that of a simplified Ultimate Team, which avoids the effort and depth of real matches in favor of a much more immediate but inevitably dull and inconsistent approach. An element that unfortunately remains unchanged even two years after its launch, however net of some interesting news. The structure that you will find once the game has started is the same as always, with the possibility of trying your hand at leagues of increasing difficulty, participating in events and skill competitions, as well as challenging other players in an asynchronous multiplayer based on a curious system of highlights, in which the one who makes the most of the opportunities wins. However, a real-time multiplayer has been added, the Comparison mode, which is unlocked after completing a series of objectives and finally allows you to actually play against other users. Gameplay and structure Beyond the inevitable statistics updates, some changes to the technical sector and real-time multiplayer, FIFA Calcio broadly confirms the formula that we criticized so much at the time of the debut of FIFA Mobile on the App Store and Google Play, with little football played and many side elements that wink at the premium nature of the title, including unpacking, hard currencies and an action energy indicator that is consumed every time we face a new challenge. Fortunately, this last aspect is not limiting, given that we are talking about an abundant amount of attempts before having to wait for the recharge, while the whole picture of the achievements and the interface has undergone a redesign aimed at making the experience simpler and more engaging . The variety of modes and contents has never been a problem, but once again the situation precipitates when you take the field, to perceive the slipperiness of the controls and the basic nature of the artificial intelligence; especially during the first hours of the game, when it is possible to score even starting from midfield and shooting from outside the box. The default control system is the gesture one, to be deactivated as soon as you have the opportunity, since it forces you to move the players using a virtual stick on the left side of the screen, but to manage their actions using the index finger on the right side, touching teammates for passes and drawing trajectories for shots, while trying to press the button to run. The traditional layout is much, much better, with buttons for each action and a classic football feeling, although as mentioned it is not the case to expect a thick experience from the games. Having said that, it is also true that, accepting the obvious change of course with respect to the origins of the series on mobile, this FIFA Calcio is not particularly indigestible and on the contrary presents itself as a nice pastime to throw four shots at the ball from time to time. Furthermore, online multiplayer actually offers an extra gear and introduces a little freshness, relying moreover on a fast matchmaking system without particular problems. It is a pity that the recent changes have not improved a lot a technical sector, just discreet, and above all the sound effects that indicate the impacts on the field, some really horrible and out of place ~sticks~.", "date": "2018-11-14", "grade": "6.0"}
