The novelties present, in relation for example to the first incarnation, are represented by a greater complexity, variety and depth of the mini-games, aspects which in fact elevate this title to one of the games of greater caliber for Eye Toy. In fact, Sony's London programmers have included the fruits of all the work done in recent months in this game, trying to make their creation a product that can last over time and not just give away a few hours of play in company. Let's take Kung Fu for example, which, unlike its first incarnation, offers the player eight different stages, interspersed with some subgames, in one of which you will have to scream as loud as you can, to increase the power of your blows. Or again Mr Chef, in which we will first have to prepare sandwiches within a certain amount of time (combining and literally creating the ingredients) and then delight in a real culinary challenge with a chef, in different stages and with different tasks to carry out term, such as cutting zucchini, grating cheese and mashing tomatoes. Another noteworthy minigame is certainly the digital transposition of table tennis or Ping Pong, if you prefer, which after due practice, is certainly one of the games made better technically and more fun, also thanks to the excellent challenge to the difficulty levels taller. What about Goal Attack then? In the role of a goalkeeper we'll have to take part in various trials such as penalty contests, corner kicks, running or jumping training sessions and so on. We close our review (we'll let you discover the remaining mini-games by yourself) with Drummin, a very similar concept to what we saw in Eye Toy Groove, where you have to repeat a sequence of movements to the rhythm of the music, with the difference that now we will have to ~play ~ six drums. As can be seen from the description a few lines above, the distinctive elements of this new collection of minigames are above all a great variety and an excellent technical realization (understood as interaction with the camera), which make Play a better experience, both from alone than in company, compared to its predecessor. Technique, miscellaneous and possible From a purely graphical point of view, Play 2 offers the bare essentials in terms of complexity and variety, however enough to make the game schemes and menus captivating. Fully localized in Italian, it offers a good selection of music tracks, which obviously make more sense in related games, such as Drummin and Air Guitar. Sony's London programmers have also included many extras within their production, which represent a real additional business card and which highlight the considerable potential of the camera. Starting with the games room, divided into five categories for a total of ten games, ranging from the creation of colors on the screen to a real game of billiards. Instead, with the Sonic cam we will be able to drive a submarine with our voice, with the Spy Cam we will be able to detect the movements that take place in the room, and then take pictures, useful for example as a rudimentary surveillance tool, but created above all to show the ability to Eye Toy. Finally, it is possible to create your own cameo thanks to the appropriate wizard: the game will ask you to take some frontal and profile photos, and through a wizard it will create an avatar for you with somatic features very similar to your face. Comment Together with Sega Superstars, Play 2 represents an excellent reason to buy Eye Toy, especially in view of the Christmas period. If the predecessor only let us glimpse the possibilities of this peripheral, in Play 2 we are faced with various, fun and fairly complex mini-games, not to mention that the numerous extras present clearly highlight the potential of the Sony camera. Pros: Great camera interaction Varied and fun minigames Numerous extras Cons: Single player becomes monotonous after a while It will be the call of Christmas, ever closer, but after several months of complete anonymity, Eye Toy, an innovative peripheral produced by Sony, sees the light again with various titles of call, which fit perfectly with the Christmas spirit, which wants more people get together for example in front of a TV to play together. After the excellent Sega Superstars, it's Play 2's turn, the sequel to the first title sold bundled with the camera. If the prequel was above all an experiment aimed at showing alpublic the capabilities of this peripheral, with Play 2 we can say that considerable progress has been made, both from a technological point of view and from that of pure fun.", "date": "2005-11-22", "grade": null}
