{"name": "Afro Samurai - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/afro-samurai-recensione.html", "text": "The Japanese Middle Ages seem to lend themselves well to even bizarre stylistic revisions, as the subject of this game demonstrates. An afro-haired Samurai, with dark skin and with the voice of Samuel L. Jackson, perpetually with a cigarette (or something like that) between his lips, within a world that mixes the typical setting of feudal Japan with contemporary, all accompanied by high-level hip hop music: Afro Samurai looks like this, and this picture already demonstrates the originality inherent in the game and its possible potential, even for those who are not already fans of the homonymous manga/ anime by Takeshi Okazaki. In fact, Namco Bandai has shown that it wants to make the most of the license in question by putting on a remarkable level of production, basting a graphic and sound sector that already from the first presentations promised great things, and building a game structure alongside it which, although linked to the typical dynamics of the hack and slash genre, contains some variants of sure interest, at least on paper. The problem of Afro Samurai appears in the distance, since the first impact is impressive: the cel-shading used to recreate the original settings is extremely convincing, while the direction and dialogues, perfectly in the style of the mini-series, are worthy of a high quality production level. Credit must be given to Namco Bandai for not having simply tried to exploit the license for a botched product, but for having wanted to expand the world of Afro Samurai also in the interactive medium, creating an experience that has poignant moments and that in general remains imprinted for its particular atmosphere, but which unfortunately is not fully satisfying and fun, due to some defect inherent in the gameplay that undermines its long-term use. Number one and number two In the particular world of Afro Samurai, built on the model of feudal Japan but placed in an alternative context, where modern technology mixes with medieval architecture and costumes (a sort of steampunk with a Japanese background), fighting is the order of the day, and they follow each other unceasingly among those who aspire to domination. The object of the desire are in particular two bands, which are said to have divine powers, and which are intended for ~Number One~ and ~Number Two~. The former is the one who actually dominates the world, while the latter is its direct suitor. To become number one it is necessary to first possess the band of number two, since only the latter can challenge and possibly kill the ruler, taking his place. The result is a constant struggle for power, particularly for those in the number two position, since in fact they are challenged by anyone intending to move up this particular social ladder. Afro, so called because of the typical Hendrix hair, as a child he witnessed the killing of his father, at the time number one, by a fighter called Justice. From that moment his journey towards revenge began, which obviously passes through the conquest of the number two band until the final clash with number one. In between, a long series of fights punctuate the eventful life of Afro, whose impassive, almost apathetic demeanor denotes his unshakable determination to obtain revenge for the beheading of his own father. The plot of the game represents a sort of summary of the original script from which it deviates with some variations, staging Afro's hunt against Justice interspersed with fights with the ~Empty Seven~ clan constantly in fight with the protagonist, from romantic story with the assassin Okiku and from the various encounters with the other characters who stand in the way. The story is told mainly through cutscenes and often rather cryptic dialogues, which on the one hand increase the overall charm of the game, on the other hand can make it difficult for those unfamiliar with the original manga to understand the plot. In any case, the screenplay is remarkable, with often brilliant and decidedly adult dialogues, both for the colorful language used and for their being anything but trivial, with frequent psychological introspections that contrast with the jokes and the highly teasing tone of the alter ego of the protagonist. The latter, called Ninja Ninja and voiced by Samuel Jackson, is a sort of conscience of Afro with a cheerful and cheeky personality, opposed to the taciturn and dark character of the protagonist, who accompanies us throughout the game and which in fact represents a sort of narrator and commentator of the whole story. Adventure and action The game structure is made up of a mix of pure hack and style fightsslash and platform-like grafts, with our katana-wielding hero grappling with continuous mass attacks by enemies, and with phases characterized by jumps, climbs, runs and small puzzles to solve. In the midst of the action, Afro Samurai proves to be more of a button masher than a technical hack and slash, as the frantic keystrokes for kicks and sword attacks (light and heavy) prove to be sufficiently effective, despite the presence of a large number of possible combos. An alternative element that enriches the combat system is given by the ~Focus Mode~, which can be loaded thanks to the execution of the combos, which allows you to slow down the action with a nice slowmotion effect, and thus execute lethal blows, able to cleanly cut off the limbs of the opponents, eliminating them with a single blow. The further evolution of this skill is the ~Over Focus~, which prolongs the slowdown phase of the opponents allowing us to execute lethal blows in rapid succession, thus eliminating a large number of enemies with a few quick blows. The excellent animations of the protagonist and the scenography of the moves make the succession of clashes pleasant, but the small diversification of the enemies, and the substantial lack of tactics required for their elimination, takes the repetitiveness usually inherent in this genre of games to an extreme. A nice trick adopted by the developers to add some depth to the clashes is the ~Body Part Poker~, or a game within the game proposed from time to time by Ninja Ninja, which sees us engaged in the surgical selection of the limbs to cut off the unfortunate enemies, trying to complete the required sequence. The platform-style grafts are poorly amalgamated with the fights and generally subdued, which indeed can have a deleterious effect on the action, given the lack of precision in controlling the character (which becomes decisive when you find yourself jumping between platforms) , some uncertainty regarding polygonal collisions and the constant need to manually move the camera to get an optimal view. In this sense, the ~memories~ hidden within the levels to encourage exploration are of little use, given that in itself it is not a particularly enjoyable element. The repertoire of moves, both in terms of combat and platform moves, would also be large, but it never finds a worthy application within the game, just as the evolution of the character from level to level makes little sense, which allows for a further expansion of these movements but which the more complicated they become, the less they become feasible and useful within the action, especially during boss fights. The latter, which in a game of this kind should represent the exaltation of the fighting technique, in exhilarating and spectacular challenges, are usually resolved in a frantic race to stay out of the opponent's range of action, waiting to launch very short and simple attacks in the inevitable moment when the guard is lowered, which usually lasts so little as not to even allow the use of a combo. It's a shame to see how the total balance resulting from the sum of the various game elements shows these deficiencies, since the packaging of the product and the ideas inserted inside it are remarkable. Between pulp, hip hop and feudal Japan The aesthetic sector of Afro Samurai is the one that distinguishes him most, especially among his fellows belonging to the same genre. It manages to keep the anime atmosphere intact with an excellent, but not pretentious, use of cel-shading that always remains halfway between the semi-realistic of the scenarios and the particular caricatured characterization of the characters, filling the screen with soft colors and images very suggestive, thanks also to the medieval Japanese setting which always plays its part very well. All the cutscenes present are built on the game's graphics engine, so as not to create gaps between the purely narrative and action sections, resulting in a decidedly convincing interactive cartoon organic whole. Also appreciable are the directorial choices halfway between comics and exploitation cinema, which often show different scenes at the same time by dividing the screen into various sections, and always linger on the Grand Guignol details of the clashes, with copious quantities of blood flowing on the screen, in stark contrast to the seemingly facetious general style. The audio sector obviously deserves a particular mention: the English dubbing of the characters, which includes professional actors among which stands outSamuel L. Jackson, is of really excellent workmanship, and supports in an excellent way on the one hand the exchanges of jokes that are not immediate, but often deep and enigmatic between the protagonist and the characters who stand in the way, on the other hand he spreads various jokes and atrocities assorted in pure Afro (precisely) American slang, thanks to the constant contribution of Ninja Ninja's irreverent vision of Afro's adventures. The excellent original music, which succeeds in the difficult task of combining rap rhythms with the typical samurai environment, appropriately marking the rhythm of the clashes, is composed by none other than Robert ~RZA~ Diggs, the pillar of the Wu-Tang Clan, who in Afro Samurai he brings together the experience gained with the work done in Ghost Dog and Kill Bill, only to remain on the merits of the soundtracks. Comment Afro Samurai cannot be judged completely negatively: every element that composes it, except for the lackluster platform component, denotes a care and refinement that obviously go beyond the simple exploitation of the important license. The problem stems from the overall picture, since ultimately the game fails in what should be its ultimate goal: to amuse the player. After the initial enthusiasm in using the Focus Mode and the wonder in front of the scenarios and slow-motion animations, the tedium for the clashes that always turn out to be the same takes over, and the element that most pushes us to continue on the path is see how the story develops, rather than the excitement derived from the clashes. It would have been enough to make a more tactical approach to fighting and improve the platform sector necessary to achieve very different results. There is however something, in the atypical and strong characterization of scenarios and characters, which makes the game worthy of attention, even for those simply looking for a somewhat particular hack and slash.Pro The graphics and sound sectors are excellent Adult and interesting story and dialogues Focus Mode adds depth to fights Against Overly repetitive gameplay Poor tactical thickness of the fights Consistent problems in the platform phases Xbox 360 - Goals Afro Samurai contains 48 achievements for the usual 1000 total Gamerpoints. Some of these are unlocked with the conclusion of the levels, but many are linked to the particular performances to be performed during the fights, in particular as regards the ability to ~slice~ enemies in certain ways within Focus Mode. Still others require the discovery of ~memories~ scattered within the levels. Apart from the latter, which require a more focused effort, the others can largely be unlocked in the normal progression within the game.", "date": "2009-03-19", "grade": null}
