This proposes hybrid mechanics between tower defense and RTS, but shifts the focus from outer space to the mainland, where the protagonists are soldiers, tanks and mechs; the title could therefore only be Gratuitous Tank Battles. The mix works quite well and, also thanks to some interesting features such as the map and unit editor, this product has proved to be an interesting package for those who are passionate about the genre. First World War, year 2114 In Gratuitous Tank Battles the First World War has never ended and in 2114 tanks and soldiers of the last century fight alongside robots, mechs and assorted technological gadgets, with rifles and projectiles almost completely replaced by shields and lasers. Two armies collide on a battlefield in which the defenders will have to try to hinder the passage of the opposing forces, placing their units in a strategic way. In classic tower defense style, the map is small in size, with one or more paths that go from one side of the screen to the other, along which in particular points it is possible to place soldiers, turrets and various other elements. The initial phase, preceding the arrival of the opponents, leaves us all the time we want to consume the first supply of resources, to be spent on buying units. Once the ~Start~ button is pressed, hordes of opponents will begin pouring into the narrow path towards the end of the level, while our units will try to eliminate them by automatically firing once their field of vision is occupied by a threat. Enemies won't just follow the path, they'll constantly target anything that tries to stand in their way. For each of them that manages to reach the destination, a score will be assigned (different according to the characteristics of each unit) until a total objective is reached which will decree the victory of the invading army. If, on the other hand, the total time ends first, the defenders will win. During the fight, the resources available to the occupied team will regenerate automatically, so that new units can be placed and, if necessary, the ones killed can be replaced. On the other side of the fence The gameplay described up to now is faithful to the tradition of the genre, but Gratuitous Tank Battles enriches its dynamics by inserting some strategic elements. For example, it will be possible to order to attack specific targets, while it will be essential to verify the characteristics of each unit, characterized by strengths and weaknesses. The possibility of passing on the side of the attackers is interesting. In fact, Gratuitous Tank Battles in the Campaign mode asks you to face each stage also on the side of the invaders, completely turning the typical point of view of tower defense. It will therefore be necessary in a preparatory phase to choose the first units to be placed on the field, which can be purchased by spending the initially available resources, to then start the game and begin the siege. In the time available it will be necessary, observing what the opponent has fielded, to carefully select which forces to deploy because otherwise it will be practically impossible to be able to cross the defenses and reach the other side of the level and thus earn the total points of the final objective. Also in this case, specific attack orders must be given to your units, so as to be able to concentrate fire on a particular point. At the same time, the attacker will have to try to bring soldiers and vehicles that are worth more points to their destination, perhaps placing them side by side with others capable of defending them and providing the right support. An extreme example is the jeep, which costs no resources and is worth a lot of points, but has no weaponry! The developers have also included in the game the possibility of speeding up and above all slowing down time to observe in detail every event on the screen and thus learn the best strategies. This feature must necessarily be exploited in the more advanced levels to make strategically useful choices. In fact, initially we thought we were winning (especially on the defenders' front) by placing turrets and units without too many thoughts, but with the worsening of the level of difficulty and the expansion of the practicable ways, it becomes mandatory to stop the time to observe what was put on the pitch by the opponent and react accordingly. Unfortunately, reaching the end of what the developers offer, despite the high level of challenge, does not take much time and moreover it feels therea lack of a certain variety, entrusting the expansion of the experience with Gratuitous Tank Battles to the editor. Custom armies The real heart of the game, in fact, is found in the editing section that had already made its debut with the previous title, here expanded further. Everything present in the game can be freely modified by the user, starting from the levels, which can also be created from scratch, up to the individual units, to create a unique personal army, to show off and lead to victory in the excited online battles. A simple system linked to progress in the main campaign allows you to unlock additional elements that will reappear in the editing menu. Here it is possible to create new units by modifying their characteristics thanks to the different slots available to each one, in which to insert various skills. These affect specific statistics and characteristics, so that it will be possible to make each element specialized against particular threats, rather than capable of fighting from a distance, reinforced or significantly faster and so on, for a potentially infinite total of possible options. The developers' goal was to give the user the freedom to immediately enjoy battles populated by dozens of warring units, with explosions, bullets and laser beams filling the screen. Objective achieved admirably, accompanied by the desire not to confuse the player with upgrades present in endless quantities, focusing on elements reduced in number but easier to manage and, consequently, to balance. The artificial intelligence does its duty, adapting to what we will put on the field, also thanks to the possibility of using the units we have created. In this sense, blocking access to certain upgrades makes the progress of the campaign frustrating at times, putting us in front of levels that are impossible to overcome unless access to new upgrades has been gained. Also, as we grow up with us, AI never ceases to make our lives really hard. Then there is the option to share all our creations online, but not only. A sort of asynchronous multiplayer is also contemplated that allows you to upload one of our attack teams to the servers, with which anyone can decide to confront. In the same way, we very positively evaluate the aesthetic aspect, represented with a view from above that can be zoomed up to a few centimeters from the ground, highlighting the painstaking detail with which the various elements of the scenarios and the units have been designed, all made in two dimensions. The excellent fluidity and the high quantity of moving objects convinced us of the quality of the aesthetic sector, underlined by a truly successful sound accompaniment. In addition to effects such as explosions and shots that appear distant with the distant view and then increase in volume and presence as you approach the battleground, we appreciated the soundtrack, composed with a marked epic taste, strong in themes that seem to have been born directly from the pen by Hans Zimmer.", "date": "2012-06-22", "grade": "7.5"}
