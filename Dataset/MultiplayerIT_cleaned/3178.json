A few days ago Star Wars: Hunters was also launched in Italy, and we were therefore able to try out this tie-in in which you put yourself in command of a selection of Hunters to face battles four -against-four within different arenas and in different modes: as is the tradition for live service games, all this content will increase over time. Is the Force strong in Zynga's latest project? Let's find out in the Star Wars: Hunters review. The gameplay of Star Wars Hunters Star Wars: Hunters, Sentinel target enemies Basically, the gameplay of Star Wars: Hunters is typical of a competitive third-person shooter, although in the roster of characters there are also warriors specialized in close combat, who therefore offer a substantial variation on the theme of these mechanics. to shorten the distances in order to inflict damage on the opponents. The subdivision into classes, in reality, does not take into account this specific attitude, distinguishing the current roster, composed in total of ten Hunters (with an eleventh component arriving shortly), between Damage, Support and Tank: the former are precisely the most effective fighters for damage done, the latter have skills that allow you to heal and heal yourself, while the third absorb blows like a sponge. Once you take the field, obviously the type of character makes all the difference in the world and we got along very well with riflemen like the Stormtrooper Sentinel or the bounty hunter Imara Vex, very effective from a distance and equipped with special skills that allow you to target opponents with missiles or bursts of amplified power. Not to mention their spectacular Ultimates: at this juncture, Star Wars: Hunters takes the lead as one of the best mobile shooters currently available.Hunters specializing in melee such as the assassin Rieve, the Jedi drone J-3DI or the gigantic Grozz, while lending itself to more dynamic and interesting tactics, have instead communicated to us an annoying sensation of slipperiness which is unfortunately typical of competitive online experiences that include melee attacks, and which is emphasized by the touch control system, although precise and very well organized thanks to the automatic fire the moment a target ends up in the crosshairs. Modalities and contents: an open construction site Star Wars: Hunters, Zaina is an ineffective support unit in combat As mentioned in the opening, Star Wars: Hunters is currently available in early access and this clearly means that the developers are improving the experience based on user feedback, making the necessary balance changes and introducing new content every month at the same time, so characters, modes and maps that enrich the structure. At the moment, as mentioned, the roster is made up of ten Hunters while there are three modes, net of training and any variations on the theme: Team Battle, which is the typical deathmatch in which the team that reaches twenty eliminations in a limited time first wins; Control, a territorial stipulation in which you must conquer and maintain control of an area of the scenario by scoring more points than your opponents; and finally Hutpalla, a variant of Capture the Flag. Star Wars: Hunters, Grozz is a tank used to hitting hard Then there are the special events, in which the variations we have just mentioned find their place, for example the Baraonda which is a deathmatch with random characters, or the Escort, in which you find yourself defending or attacking a load that must a certain route to be conducted safely. The unlocking of the modes takes place based on the growth of our level of experience, this is also a traditional and well-tested solution. As for the maps, there are currently seven of them and they take up some of the most famous scenarios of the Star Wars saga: from the Ewok Village to a mix between Endor and Hoth, from the Podrace of Mos Espa to a couple of arenas that mix these references to support the action they will have to put on the field, presenting a relatively compact but effective design, which also includes refills for the energy with which to stay alive longer. Star Wars: Hunters offers precision aiming viaa button The free-to-play model of the game also follows classic mechanics but turns out to be quite generous, allowing us to unlock a large part of the roster already in the first hours and to access all modes for free, without waiting times, tickets or consumables to limit our desire to play: we will be able to do it for as long as we want, without constraints, and this can only be good news. After which it is also true that there is a concrete progression of the Hunters, which goes far beyond the aesthetic customizations ( although present in abundance) and takes place by obtaining points with which to enhance their special abilities, making them more effective in battle. At the moment it is not possible to buy these improvements, therefore the risk of pay-to-win drifts is avoided, but it will be necessary to understand if Zynga will decide to change something in the running by taking advantage of the ~soft~ launch. Technical realization Star Wars: Hunters, Sentinel's Ultimate calls four Stormtroopers in support On a technical level, Star Wars: Hunters stands as one of the best games currently available on the App Store and Google Play. The developers have in fact managed to mix the charm of the Star Wars characters, represented in this case with a cartoony style close to some of the most famous productions related to the saga, with a truly convincing visual rendering. In particular, the quality of the animations is surprising, often the first thing that is sacrificed on the altar of the netcode, and the ability to offer a consistent experience at 60 fps thanks to the many graphic adjustments present, which allow you to dynamically scale the resolution and reach compromises in terms of presets and antialiasing to get the performance we want on our terminal. Star Wars: Hunters, Utooni are a couple but work as a single Hunter The touch controls, as already mentioned, are almost perfect and do not regret the lack of support for controllers, thanks to a layout with dual virtual analog supported by a series of buttons on the right side of the screen for activating special skills and for the jump, with automatic fire when an enemy enters the viewfinder (can be deactivated if you are masochistic) and excellent precision. The sound sector is surprisingly one of the great protagonists of the action, thanks not only to sounds absolutely faithful to the imaginary of Star Wars, but also a selection of truly engaging music, orchestral in style, decidedly authentic and capable of enriching the experience rather than accompanying it anonymously.", "date": "2023-03-14", "grade": "8.5"}
