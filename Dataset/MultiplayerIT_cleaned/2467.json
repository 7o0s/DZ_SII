{"name": "Star Trek Elite Force Expansion Pack", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/star-trek-elite-force-expansion-pack.html", "text": "Something different than usual. Opening the box of any expansion pack of a random game, what is generally expected is an improvement of what was missing or poorly made in the original title. You want the story, you want the graphics, you want the variety of elements of the title, something had gone wrong and had to be improved. The Elite Force Expansion Pack actually betrays this expectation almost immediately, as it disappoints all those who had hoped for an extension of the single adventure of the crew... even if that's not exactly the truth. In fact, the single-player part of the expansion is present, but it is represented by rather particular novelties, which could only interest that slice of the players of the original title who are passionate about the Trekker universe. The player is offered the opportunity to explore the ship through a ~Virtual Tour~, which allows, in addition to wandering around the Voyager chatting with the NPCs present (from the captain to the hub...), to complete a series of mini -missions (teleporting objects, fixing parts, activating some elements) that we could define as ~working~. Nothing to do with the action and puzzles that had characterized the original title. That's all? Almost. In fact, in addition to wandering around the ship, browsing and interacting with all the electronic structures (also with the replicator and with our tricorder, with which we will have fun analyzing whatever comes within range), we will be able to go to the holodeck and activate ben ( ironic, make no mistake) four programs: the first two will be absolutely useless (the first is the peaceful representation of the relaxation place created by Neelix, the second the shooting practice room where you can hit moving targets), the third will lead us to a very short recreation of a telefilm much loved by Perish (captain Proton, where we will spend five minutes in black and white before reaching the end of the whole) and the fourth, perhaps the only suggestive one, which takes us to a Klingon outpost (evidently the natives are suffering from amnesia and have forgotten the good relations with the Federation). Summing up this part of the expansion, which represents the only real attraction for NON-trekker-addicts eager for Singleplayer adventures, the judgment cannot be very satisfactory: the fun of the Virtual Mode, valid only if you are interested in the spaceship , is rather weak, and the Holoadventures too short, and devoid of story, represent nothing more than a diversion. Naturally, things change if you are a true Trekker enthusiast (especially of this series, which has just seen its conclusion in America, as you can wander around the spaceship and browse through what is a perfect reproduction of the environments seen in the TV series, interact with the NPC characters is very atmospheric (although when you DO NOT have to talk to them for some specific mission assigned to you they will address you in a rather rude way), and graphically their representation is really splendid.As regards the missions you will have to complete on the various bridges, their daily life increases the feeling of really being part of the crew.To top it all off, there is also the possibility of collecting Holofigures hidden in some rooms of the ship, which however seems to represent something very marginal. this package from the point of view of the single player is a million dollar question. To clarify a little my impressions about this aspect of the game, I can only underline how in reality Raven have distanced themselves from the original project which had made people appreciate very much Elite Force. Elite was in fact a game ~for everyone~, or at least for ALL FPS enthusiasts. This expansion is instead advisable only to Trekkers, to those interested in knowing the Voyager in detail: and to the others? No, unfortunately not. And not even the presence of the original voice of Ryan (the interpreter of Seven of Nine, perhaps the most apt character from the series), which can also be added by downloading a patch from the network, does not represent anything interesting. Elite and Multiplayer The real strong point of the Expansion pack is actually, as happened for Halls of Valhalla (the Rune expansion reviewed in these same bytes), is the multiplayer. In fact, once the package is installed, we will have the possibility not only to be able to play some new maps (21), butperhaps using the new models present (even those of Captain Proton's holographic adventure... the best of all is that of ~burghized~ Tuvok), but above all we will be able to use some interesting Mods: Assimilation, Action Hero, Specialties, Elimination , disintegration. In Action Hero one of the players is randomly selected at the start, and is given more weapons, more health and more powers than the others. He who is kills the Hero earns five Frags, and it's not difficult to understand how much this can affect the final ranking in a relatively short time; however the same one also earns the title of Hero, and from that moment on he will be hunted by the others visibly. The Mod is certainly fun and original, but it brings with it a small flaw: after the Hero has spent some time killing, generally a much stronger character than the others is created, who easily gets the upper hand over his opponents (uhm , Holy Wars? n.d.Pucci). Mod Elimination is perhaps the weakest of the package: those who are killed simply can no longer participate until the end of the round and can only be a spectator. Of another charisma is the Mod Assimilation, certainly the most fun and original, which will tickle the palate of most trekkers. At the beginning of the match, the players are divided into two teams, one representing the Federation, the other the Borg: while the former try to kill the Borg Queen, the latter are committed to assimilating the various members of the federation, who thus pass on the side of the Borg, creating an ever larger group... What makes it all realistic is that the Borg are much slower than the federation, but they have the ability to teleport to catch the enemy by surprise. Disintegration is nothing more than the possibility of killing with one blow, and in this Unreal Tournament has been leading the way for a long time. On the other hand, the latest Mod, Specialties, is particular, in which players will have the possibility at the beginning to choose a particular specialty, having different abilities and different weapons. It must be said that the network game support is very well equipped, and luckily the BOT's AI is also worthy of note (it follows, as is normal, the Quake3 AI). Ultimately the Multiplayer part of this Expansion pack is done very well... but we still have some doubts. Yes, because the idea of paying 60,000 lire for what many other titles have offered for free with a download from the network is not at all attractive: even some new maps have been created by enthusiasts, and this says a lot about the quality, in some cases, than added. Conclusions As I mentioned before, the fact that this package was created for trekker enthusiasts and not, as was the case for the original title, for FPS enthusiasts in general, weighs heavily on the final evaluation of the product. In fact, unlike other dedicated expansion packs, the fact of offering practically only the Voyager Virtual tour (which, I recall for the umpteenth time, in Elite Force was decidedly excellent) limits the purchase target of the same. If trekkers will have no difficulty in appreciating such a choice (be careful because you have to be really passionate and eager to explore the ship), the others won't have much incentive to buy the title. Slightly different speech regarding the multiplayer offer of the package, which as we have seen is able to guarantee several rather relevant innovations; in this case the added value is discreet, even if the doubt remains that something very similar could easily have been found on the Net. Personally, the Expansion Pack has guaranteed me only a few hours of fun, and all born from the Online games I have could do: although passionate about the Star Trek universe, and the Voyager series, I was unable to fully appreciate the Virtual Tour and the small missions available. However, what I judged ~disappointing~ was instead seen as absolutely positive by my good friend Pittarello (of whom we were able to read a splendid preview of Neverwinter Nights some time ago right here on M.it). This in fact leaves ample room for interpretation of the added value of the Expansion Pack in question, even knowing the excellent critical skills of the aforementioned Pittarello, Trekker even more than I am. Ultimately the final judgment can only be left to you, because never as in this case personal expectations posI am valuing or not a possible purchase: I only hope that I have been able to offer you a key to understanding what is offered. And, of course, long life and prosperity. Heading for the unknown Elite Force, it is worth remembering, was one of the most popular FPS by fans of the genre during the last videogame season. With its captivating story, the interaction of the main character with the other characters of the Team, the absolutely intriguing background, an over the top graphic aspect (it was the first title to use the Quake3 engine under license), but above all with its almost perfect playability, it was able to satisfy the expectations of the trekker people, who until then had been able to enjoy products, inspired by the Star Trek universe, of dubious workmanship. But the real merit of the programmers was actually the ability to attract even FPS enthusiasts who had never been able to talk about the series to the title, giving them a product that was in some ways unique. The only defect of the title, which enjoyed a more than good multiplayer part, was the singleplayer longevity, as only a few days of intense play were enough to end the adventures of Captain Janeway and his crew. What better than an expansion pack to fix the shot? What could be more appropriate than other weeks of single-player gameplay, perhaps spent participating in another Voyager adventure? Unfortunately, and it must be said immediately, that's not what they must have thought of the Raven... In fact, as we will discover, the Expansion Pack (which doesn't even have a title) offers us something particular, but it doesn't have any element Noteworthy single player. We start the engines and set off.", "date": "2001-06-28", "grade": null}
