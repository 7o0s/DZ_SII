{"name": "Cooking Mama", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/cooking-mama.html", "text": "The belief that ~casual gaming~ is the death of video gaming is fundamentally wrong. The applications developed in this sense have been experimented for a long time in the arcade, and then moved on to the domestic environment with Nintendo DS and Wii. We start with the clear intention of conquering a completely new slice of the market, represented precisely by occasional gamers or by those who have never played a video game, but often we arrive at the result of satisfying even ~navigated~ users and anything else how unprepared. This is because there are many people tired of the usual genres, who want to experience something new. Products like Cooking Mama respond perfectly to this need, as demonstrated by the sales figures. So why not create a mobile version? The game has an extremely simple structure: we have a series of recipes available with various levels of difficulty, and we have to ~prepare~ them until we get a ready dish. This translates into going through a variable number of phases: to cook an omelette, for example, we will first have to break some eggs, then mix them, finally fry them. It is clear that the more difficult a recipe is, the more phases we will have to face, and the skill with which we will overcome them will then establish a final average score. On Nintendo DS, Cooking Mama based a large part of its appeal on the control system via stylus and touch screen, as is known, and unfortunately all this has been lost on mobile phones. The developers had to think of an alternative control system, which in games of this type is generally based on pressing the number keys rather than using the joystick. Let's say that the solution chosen in the end is something in between, that is, it uses both the joystick and the numeric keys depending on what is happening on the screen: if we have to mix something, we will do it by pointing the stick in the various directions in sequence, while for slicing we will simply have to follow the direction indicated each time. We can decide whether to prepare a recipe directly or just practice with its various parts. If we have any doubts about the controls, there is an entire section dedicated to instructions only Being a ~cook simulator~, it is clear that we are not dealing with a product with spectacular graphics: the developers' goal was to make a game with a simple but pleasant appearance. This mobile version incorporates the graphic elements in full, therefore the feeling is the same as the Nintendo DS version, with a good use of colors and designs that are always clear and easily distinguishable. Same quality, therefore, but unfortunately the same cannot be said of quantity: from every point of view, Cooking Mama on mobile is a heavily ~cut~ version compared to the original, with a very low number of recipes, unable to guarantee average longevity. The sound sector mixes music and effects in a nice way, with the latter which unfortunately can create slowdowns on some terminals. PRO Basic idea always valid Graphics faithful to the original Well organized control system... AGAINST ...but far inferior to styluses and touch screens Very few recipes Extremely short life", "date": "2008-06-16", "grade": "S.V."}
