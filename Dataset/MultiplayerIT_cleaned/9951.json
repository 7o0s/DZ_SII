This anonymous engineer, son of communist Russia and destined to die poor, had unknowingly invented Tetris, giving the world one of the longest-lasting and most widespread pastimes in videogame history. The success of tetris has been, and still is, so vast that versions readapted, inspired, recycled or modernized have been seen in all colors and shapes, more or less successful. In Denki Blocks! however, the concept of interlocking blocks is almost completely revisited, making a more reflexive and tactical approach prevail over the speed of choice that was typical of the original tetris. Fingertip blocks In every Denki Blocks puzzle! in fact the blocks present will have the particularity of moving simultaneously in all directions but only in the same direction, indicated by the swiping of the finger; therefore no falls from above, just an initial scheme, more or less complicated, in which to move all the tiles together with the aim of grouping those of the same color. In dragging the blocks to change position and cross them in the right way, you will have to interact both with the frame of the scheme and with the various spikes, obstacles and joints always present in different places. It will be necessary in this phase to pay the utmost attention, because a random meeting of two blocks of the same color will cause their indissoluble fusion, also definitively ruining the development of the puzzle solution; however you can always undo the last moves made by pressing the Undo button and in the most desperate cases restart the level using the Reset button. In the game you will gradually unlock 6 pages with 16 puzzles each for a total of 96 levels, a good number overall and able to keep you busy for many hours. The peculiarity of these puzzles, however, is certainly linked to the general degree of difficulty, which we could define as totally uneven. In fact, the schemes do not follow an increasing level as would be logical to expect but, with a certainly particular but not necessarily negative choice, they seem to be drawn in a completely random way. Thus there will be initial levels that will create more difficulties than some finals, or intermediate levels with extreme ease (or difficulty); this if on the one hand tends to destabilize the player, who will find himself facing the unknown with each new puzzle, on the other hand gives the title a touch of unpredictability, certainly welcome in an exponent of this genre. However, with the exception of some too intuitive schemes, the general level of challenge remains decidedly high. Therefore, to avoid frustrations (with consequent abandonment of the title), the developers of Denki Blocks! have implemented two ways to solve the puzzles: the first, dedicated to those who don't pay too much attention to the subtle and just want to move forward, involves simply grouping blocks of the same color in any possible way while the second, decidedly more challenging, will consist in joining tiles of the same color in well-defined shapes, suggested at the beginning of each level. In this case the difficulty especially in some schemes really grows exponentially but, in addition to unlocking new puzzles, the counterpart in case of a positive outcome will be given by a large prize in points. Further bonus multipliers can then be activated by joining the blocks and forming the same shapes for each color (up to a maximum of 4 different colors) or by solving the puzzles with fewer moves. Nothing to detect instead under the technical aspect of the game: everything works very well and the sensitivity and precision of the iPhone's capacitive touchscreen show for the umpteenth time that at least until today there is nothing better in this sense. The background music is unfortunately repetitive to the point of stress, but luckily the game supports the iPod function, leaving you free to solve the various puzzles by listening to your favorite songs. Then there is no any online interaction, not even limited to the simple ranking of scores and there are no further unlockable extra modes.
