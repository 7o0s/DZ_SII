{"name": "Saints Row: The Third Remastered", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/saints-row-the-third-remastered-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Saints Row: The Third Remstered arrives nine years after the original title bringing with it numerous technical improvements, but also a one-to-one reproduction of the contents which perhaps, given the era in which we play games, are anchored to now obsolete canons . As we anticipated during the reveal event, the technical innovations of Saints Row: The Third Remastered give us back a title that at the time was able to change the fate of a franchise, establishing itself as the most loved chapter and consecrating a certain type of humor which at that time was unrivaled. Even today, using most of the crazy weapons of this title is remembered as one of the best gaming experiences of the past generation. But let's see how Saints Row: The Third fared in our review of the PlayStation 4 version. Outdated humor We mentioned it to you: the story of Siants Row: The Third Remastered is identical to the original, as crazy and outspoken as it was nine years ago. Packed with hilarious and insane moments, it features one of the most surreal beginnings ever with the vault and city swooping scenes that still have us raising eyebrows, in a good way, at their genuine madness. On a technical level then, the game surprises for a shooting system that immediately proves to be optimal despite the years behind it, an indication of painstaking work done with the original title and which today remains more evident than ever. Even at the level of missions, the history of the Saints remains unchanged with the objectively most memorable part made up of a large part of the secondary arcs such as the missions of Professor Genki. Even the possibility of immediately having all the numerous DLCs is a quid that guarantees you an incredible amount of content, stuffed with some narrative arcs (above all the missions against aliens) as hilarious as the main plot. So where is the problem? The problem is that fans have played this type of mission for more than a decade also thanks to the titles released after Saints Row: The Third and often, we assure you, that knowing the title in detail, in these cases, does not it helps. The humor of Saints Row: The Third is then the most obsolete there is in a video game. Which isn't to say it's bad, just that it tastes like a warmed-up wartime soup. Another drawback is certainly the absence of the local coop, which although thanks to the presence of online multiplayer does not weigh so much, it remains an important lack precisely in consideration of the chaotic and over the top character of a title that also made sense played locally . Graphic solidity Where the game instead shows the usefulness of this remastered is on a technical level. The title looks good, remaining far from perfect, and indeed thanks to the incredible work done on the lighting and shadows it manages to give a natural charisma to the city of Steelport. The neon-rich areas, the port at sunset or the skyline at dawn are moments that you can enjoy with pleasure. The character models have also been completely recreated and now offer a remarkable level of detail (despite some minor hiccups, such as facial fuzz and hair, or rain). Some others, like in the case of Shaundi, are visibly different, but unless you're a purist it won't be a big deal. Even at the level of frames per second, the title is quite solid: on consoles it is possible to unlock the preset cap of 30fps, as long as you play it on PlayStation 4 Pro or Xbox One X, otherwise the base consoles will struggle a lot. During our sessions on PlayStation 4 Pro the title ran comfortably at 50+ fps. Where the improvements are most noticeable are in the explosions and in the models of the vehicles. We all know that much of the fun in Saints Row: The Third comes from being able to wreak havoc on the streets of Steelport, so explosions now offer visual gratification, and thanks to the overhaul of the vehicle models, they also provide great scenic transposition. . Whether you're taking out enemies in VR worlds or facing waves of enemies in horde mode, Saints Row: The Third will give you some memorable scenarios and that's a given. A simple homework Even in the outline the game remains a good job, but nothing more. The style is that of the first chapter, the artistic direction is the same, the interpretation of the characters too and it's not a bad thing, but precisely because we are at the end of the generation we would have expected more. An example is fast travel: absent in the original game, also absent in the remastered. We are not talking about a shortcoming to be underlinedred nature, but in 2020 can an open world title be lacking in fast travel? In our view, no. The package packaged by Volition is excellent in some respects, but in the substance of fun does it have a useful feedback? Again, the answer for us is no. We have arrived at a historical moment in which the homework is acceptable if done discreetly, but not justifiable for the purposes of a saga that would have needed more than a new chapter along the lines of the original Siants Row: The Third more than yet another revival . Finally, from such a basic remastered in terms of ideas, at least a consistent level of cleaning is expected, which unfortunately did not happen. Enemies will still spawn from behind you, helicopters will fall on your head, and yes, NPCs will occasionally have ~weird~ behavior.", "date": "2020-05-22", "grade": "7.5"}
