In fact, we are talking about a classic platformer with rooms with platforms, double jump, basic attack and long-range offensive. And being the protagonist a ninja it is not surprising that the close attack is carried out with a katana while the long-range offensive involves the use of the classic shurikens. But there is a difference compared to other titles of this sub-genre, relaunched by flash games and brought back into the spotlight by Super Meat Boy, and we find this in the puzzle dynamics which is enriched with a further and decisive parameter. In fact, the goal is not simply to get to the end of the level, avoiding stalactites and traps, but we are asked to complete each painting within a maximum of 10 seconds. This is a factor that makes ranged attacks, limited to just three hits, the key to numerous levels whose completion involves the elimination of the robots that populate it. In essence, the typical scenario involves throwing shurikens at enemies who are in the line of fire while, jumping from platform to platform, one proceeds to eliminate those quickly reachable with the sword. The concept of 10 Second Ninja is all here and here is where the challenge begins. A challenge studded with traps, seemingly unreachable enemies, stalactites that rain down on us, teleporters and various unexpected events or shortcuts that you need to take into account to perform the 10-second spell. In the first moments of the game the challenge even seems excessive but once you have learned the pattern of a level, test after test, the solution becomes clearer and, to complete the picture in relative tranquillity, you just have to get carried away with controls that are , like the gameplay, very essential. 10 Second Ninja offers us forty levels of pure action, all to be played on the edge of the second Time attack platformer Five keys are enough, including the movement keys, to exhaust the moves available to our ninja and the response of the commands is, predictably, excellent. But the levels, as in any game of this type, get more and more complicated. Some apparently easy jumps turn out to be less simple than expected between very large leaps, and therefore less easy to calibrate, and distances sometimes calculated with sadistic precision by the developer. And it is precisely when things get more complex that the addition of the timer becomes more cumbersome by raising the beats, the tension and the risk of error. Furthermore, those ten seconds that give the game its name are not the only obstacle to overcome in order to reach the hated Robot Hitler. To pass a series of levels you need a certain number of stars and one to three are awarded depending on the time taken to finish a painting. Unfortunately, getting one star in each painting of a series of rooms is not enough and it is necessary to earn at least two in some schemes in order to proceed further. And here comes the blow. For the second star, in fact, the timer does not go down by a couple of seconds but comes well below five, making the challenge decidedly hot. And things get even more difficult if the desire to get all three stars in each level blossoms in the player, for a total of 120 up for grabs, with the timer making another sharp leap downwards arriving at infinitesimal times. Imagine having to perform four or five actions, with obstacles and shortcuts, in two seconds, less than the time it takes to pronounce the title of 10 Second Ninja, and you've already got an idea of the effective challenge of a title that, if it doesn't ask perfection comes close. For this we advise you to tackle 10 Second Ninja starting from the reassignment of the controls because even that lost millisecond to pass from the restart button to the ninja's commands can prove vital. And it becomes even more so if the ambition is to exceed the set times, which is possible as already revealed by the world classics, which in a title characterized by such a strong competitive vein are indispensable. For the rest, the outline of the game is composed of a simple but spot-on technical sector, characterized by an ironic verve that brings us in front of a painted Robot Hitler, in full farcical style, like a giant head. Nothing mind blowing. We are not, this is immediately evident, in front of a masterpiece of pixel art. But in 10 Second Ninja it is the gameplay that takes all the attention and the outline, in this formula, takes on a relative value.", "date": "2014-03-13", "grade": "8.0"}
