{"name": "Moto Gp 2", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/moto-gp-2.html", "text": "Technical realization Moto GP 2 is graphically even better than its excellent predecessor. From such a well-established base one could only improve, and the THQ graphics proved to be really good, optimizing and enriching the graphic structure of the game with small details. The polygonal models of the bikes are now further improved, the detail of the details is much higher than in the past. The textures are of an excellent level, the Bump Mapping makes its presence felt on asphalt and makes it more realistic, the reflections of the sun on the motorcycle bodies are of considerable impact, really well done. The only flaw found is a slight slowdown in case of too many bikes on the screen on tight corners. The engine slows down a little, nothing serious, as there are no problems in normal situations. There are six views available, there really is something for all tastes. The first Moto GP was pure arcade, and simulation purists turned up their noses at that. THQ seems to have listened to their complaints, the simulation fidelity could already be increased from the Moto GP Online demo, but with Moto GP 2 the motorcycle driving and control system has been completely revolutionized. If in the first episode skids and skids were the order of the day, now you will have to adjust the accelerator, as the bike is much more sensitive than in the past. What makes the difference compared to the prequel is the introduction of four-stroke bikes, completely different means from the old two-stroke sisters. In addition to having double the displacement, the four-strokes are much more demanding to drive, the developers must be recognized that they were able to perfectly differentiate the new four-strokes from the old two-strokes, thus giving an additional sense of realism to the game. The commands are handled perfectly, in addition, they are totally customizable. The basic configuration is already excellent, the A button corresponds to the accelerator, while the B button to the brake. In any case, to better manage the bike, it is possible to accelerate and brake with the right stick, very useful if you prefer to dose the accelerator to the millimeter. Playing Moto GP 2 is extremely fun, however, unfortunately, the developers have introduced a very annoying feature. Slightly unpleasant events occurred on Xbox Live, namely the cheaters (people who cheat), cut corners and used various tricks to reappear halfway through the track, thus making very low times. In Moto GP 2, as soon as you touch the grass, tenths of tenths are added to the current lap time. A penalty in some cases really annoying. Thanks to full Live support, Moto GP 2 has excellent longevity. With the Online you will always be able to find new people to race against, thus guaranteeing an excellent duration to the title which, even offline thanks to the seasons to be faced, can offer hours and hours of pure fun. The sound department has been studied in detail, the roar of the motorcycles differ from each other based on the manufacturer and the type of engine, a step forward compared to the first episode which was a bit monotonous. The background music is pleasant and catchy, and there is obviously the possibility of using your own personalized soundtracks. Comment THQ is back on track with Moto GP 2, a game that is much more than a restyling or a simple upgrade. In addition to a greater number of bikes and tracks, the developers have renewed the control system, now more realistic, in order to satisfy the requests and desires of the simulation enthusiasts. Stunning graphics, high playability and full Xbox Live support make Moto GP 2 a must buy for racing enthusiasts, and highly recommended for all others, especially those who enjoyed the first, excellent episode.

Unlike in the past, before each race it will be possible to undertake small challenges on the track, able to give you experience points in case of success, these competitions will also be useful for making you get to know the track better.", "date": "2003-06-12", "grade": null}
