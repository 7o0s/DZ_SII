{"name": "Ultimate Fighting Championship", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ultimate-fighting-championship_a.html", "text": "Fight to know who you are! Americans, as we know, are a violent people, as evidenced by the death penalty, the Teletubbies and, last but not least, the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Maybe you got to appreciate something of the UFC thanks to some coverage by broadcasts like Target, or you remember the episode of Friends in which Monica's boyfriend signs up for that championship. Otherwise, just know that it is a tournament in which wrestlers from different disciplines can participate (Wrestling, Sumo, Jui Jitsu, etc.) and whose only rule is: there are no rules! The matches, usually very bloody (just take a look at the introductory video to get an idea), take place inside an octagonal ring surrounded by a metal mesh and end with the KO of the opponent or with his surrender, in usually due to particularly painful grips (called submission moves). The title of Crave Entertainment (distributed in Europe by Ubi Soft) therefore wants to recreate this 'sport' as faithfully as possible (excuse the hyperbole) and makes 22 wrestlers available to the player, faithfully modeled by their real counterparts in features and movements and ready to fight to win the UFC champion belt. The game modes available are more or less the usual ones you find in any fighting game, you miss the Team Battle while the Career mode is welcomed, in which you can create your own fighter (for the name I suggest Tyler Durden or Pietro Taricone^_^), assign him the fighting style you prefer and then start a series of fights/training. Each victory against a sparring partner will reward you with a bonus of points, with which you can enhance some characteristics of your athlete or 'buy' a combo or a hold. Be very careful in the distribution of this bonus, try to get a fighter with no weaknesses as the last fighter you will have to face is really a tough nut to crack: the referee! Self destruction is the answer From a gameplay point of view, UFC is immediate but at the same time complex, the controls are simple to learn and the combos are short enough; the complexity comes when it comes to mastering the use of counters. Like Dead or Alive, UFC in fact focuses a lot on counter-moves and often the matches are won by whoever takes the most advantage. There are different types of counters and they vary according to the position of the wrestlers. When they are face to face, a counter-move blocks the opponent's punch or kick and then ends in a hold or return of the blow. With your alter ego on the ground, topped by your opponent beating you up, a well-timed counter can allow you to block the punch and then roll onto it. If the bastard instead tries a submission move, a furious keystroke of the counters will make you escape from that move and, in some cases, will allow you to return the favor with a 'yield' counter. Self destruction is the answer The management of one's stamina is very interesting, in fact there are two energy bars: a blue one that represents your vital energy and decreases for each blow suffered or parried (obviously to a lesser extent), but also for each blow struck. It is therefore not recommended to attack with your head down by furious pressing of the joypad keys, much better to wait for the opponent to discover himself to punish him without tiring your fighter too much. The other bar, red, is always greater than or equal to the blue one and represents the maximum energy that the fighter can recover by refraining from attacks or stalling until the end of the round. This system turns out to be very apt in the economy of the type of combat that the game wants to recreate: the clashes can last a few seconds as well as they can last for all the foreseen rounds and therefore be decided by points. A draw is also contemplated. The things you own, they'll end up owning you... Graphically UFC rocks. The work of the Japanese team Anchor inc (confess it: you thought it had been programmed by Americans^_^) was exemplary, the polygonal models of the wrestlers are extremely faithful to their real counterparts also thanks to a set of splendid (almost photorealistic) textures including tattoos, special bandages, acne etc... The animations are also excellent (if we exclude the walk to enter the ring, a little too 'spread-legged' to not be able to object to the virility of the wrestlers), all rigorously motion captured and closely linked to each other. L'interaction between the two contenders is perfect; the holds are all plausible, arms and legs 'intertwine' with those of the opponent to form complex poses without the slightest unnatural overlapping of the polygons. The impact of punches and kicks on the other's body is of an almost gruesome realism; this thanks to a series of goodies such as the Bud Spencer movie-style sound effects, the unnatural movements of the head of the opponent who suffers a KO, the splashes of blood that accompany the most violent beatings etc ... from this point of view it's safe to say that UFC beats Tekken and every other fighting game out there. The only drawback is perhaps the representation of the public: a series of poorly animated bitmap stickers. Mind you, they don't clash at all, but the Dreamcast could certainly afford a polygonal audience, also by virtue of the fact that during the match the stands are not very well lit and in any case the camera tends to frame the octagon from above, leaving little room for the elements of cornice. Where's my mind? In conclusion, Ultimate Fighting Championship is certainly a quality title and free from particularly macroscopic defects. Perhaps fans of the various Tekken and Soul Calibur could turn up their noses considering UFC not very varied, after all the wrestlers all seem to look alike, the game arena is always the same, the moves do not reach high peaks of spectacularity. This is obviously because UFC wants to represent a truly existing discipline in the most accurate way, once this premise is accepted, UFC turns out to be an engaging game, rather long-lived (especially against a human opponent) and with original and intriguing game mechanics ... recommended to all . UFC! Rule 1 of the UFC: You don't talk about the UFC. Second rule of the UFC: you must never talk about the UFC. We choose to ignore the first two rules of the UFC so as not to end the review prematurely... 1", "date": "2000-12-26", "grade": null}
