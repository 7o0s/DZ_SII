{"name": "Wolfenstein: Youngblood per Nintendo Switch", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/wolfenstein-youngblood-nintendo-switch-recensione.html", "text": "Wolfenstein: Youngblood arrives on Nintendo Switch full of expectations, and after the review of the PC version we were really curious to find out if the words of the executive producer Jerk Gustafsson, who had defined this reduction as something miraculous, were true or not. Well, let's address the issue immediately rather than getting lost in chatter: structurally the game is everything, with its large freely explorable scenarios and the many enemies of various kinds to face on the streets of an alternative Paris of 1980 still under Nazi rule. However, even ignoring the very first version of the game altogether and analyzing only the 1.1 update, it is clear that in order to bring the experience to the Nintendo hybrid console, heavy compromises had to be made. The aspects that stand out the most in this sense are the frame rate and the resolution: in the first case, as could be expected, we went from 60 to 30 frames per second, unfortunately subject to quite noticeable drops during the most complicated situations, with lots of enemies and possibly bosses on screen; in the second case, instead, a dynamic system was opted for which lowers the definition based on the situation to keep fluidity as stable as possible, but there are times when it really goes down too much and the images you find accompanying the article, all captured in docked mode, they clarify how much has been sacrificed from this point of view. Added to this is the issue of asset quality, with many pixelated textures placed there with guilty carelessness (especially during cutscenes) and shaky management of volumetric mists and shaders: there are shadows that are applied on the fly on surfaces, and that appear and disappear when we move. There are also some too many difficulties in the asset stream (with objects that remain ~smooth~ for too long) as well as a whole series of gimmicks inserted to lighten the load on the GPU, see for example the jerky animations of enemies seen from a distance. In short, it is clear that we are not faced with a miracle, to return to the starting definition, and although we are convinced that Panic Button will further improve things with the next updates, as already happened with DOOM and Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, it is inevitable to conclude that at present Youngblood presents itself as a conversion perfectly in line, if not a little below, compared to the team's previous works. The concept is that, if you own any other gaming platform, there is no need to choose the Nintendo Switch version of this very valid shooter. Well, unless you need to use it on the go for some reason. Gameplay and structure Given the limited time available to complete and review Wolfenstein: Youngblood on PC, we approached this portable edition of the game also with the intention of verifying some gameplay elements that caused some discussion, creating frankly cloying controversies. The Blazkowicz twins, who travel to Nazi-controlled Paris to find their father, can boast a different approach to the action than in previous installments of the series. Primarily due to the cooperative nature of the experience, which even when played offline (with the companion controlled by artificial intelligence, therefore) always presents both Jess and Soph on the screen, with the possibility of collaborating in various ways, exchanging a sign of intended to obtain a momentary boost and act together to open doors, activate switches and so on. The co-op, strictly online, lends itself to the most varied interpretations: you can agree with a friend to complete the campaign together or open the game to any participant to receive support during the more complicated phases, or still opt for the Deluxe Edition and take advantage of the interesting Buddy Pass to invite someone who doesn't own the game (and who will have to download a free demo version) to tackle the missions with us. Furthermore, on Nintendo Switch, the traditional controls are added to those based on motion detection, which can be used both in docked mode, by pointing the Joy-Con towards the screen, and in portable mode thanks to the gyroscope. The second option works better, but ultimately it's a matter of adjustment and personal sensitivity. However, we were talking about the checks that we wanted to carry out for the occasion, and which revolve around the RPG elements introduced by MachineGames to differentiate the gameplay from the past. The two protagonists can level up, gaining power and resistance, as well as using gears and coinsof silver conquered on the field to unlock physical upgrades (health, armor, special powers, etc.) and to improve the weapons that make up the arsenal, which remain fixed in their respective slots on the traditional selection wheel. By mounting extended magazines, more performing barrels, sniper sights, stable stocks and so on, the effectiveness of every machine gun, rifle and pistol in our possession can be substantially increased, so as to be able to inflict significant damage even on armored soldiers. Can the difference in level with the opponents create the dreaded sponge effect? Yes, but only and only if we venture to face a mission with enemies much, much stronger than us, not surprisingly indicated with a skull icon. To give you an idea, we tried to complete the first tasks of the campaign and then, with Jess and Soph at level 15, we headed towards the gates of Brother 3, the last of the three terminals that the protagonists must unlock in order to destabilize the Nazi command. Well, although it was a level 20 mission, we managed to complete it without particular problems, so much so that we concluded that whoever talks about the sponge effect in such situations probably uses the wrong weapons (for example the shotgun from a distance) and/or does not he realizes that many soldiers have armor that needs to be blown up before they can be seriously hurt. In short, in reality, the progression system developed by the developers does not require grinding or place particular constraints on the completion of tasks, provided of course that you proceed with a minimum of gradualness and dedicate yourself to the obvious upgrades that from time to time time they become available. All this with a view to a very solid, frenetic and dynamic shooter system, which pays little attention to any stealth approach (usable only marginally, to knock out a few enemies before the alarms go off) but offers great emotions and an adequate degree of challenge, which however in cooperation with a capable friend could sometimes be trivial. Luckily there are different levels of difficulty that can be activated at any time and an unprecedented approach to the settings, the result of collaboration with Arkane Studios, which emphasizes exploration and verticality so that secret passages, windows, manholes and hidden areas can be identified, perhaps from reach on the fly to complete optional tasks that unlock in the middle of an expedition.", "date": "2019-07-29", "grade": "8.0"}
