As often happens, however, too much damage and we soon arrived at a situation that sees the release of many games that are dramatically similar to each other, more committed to devising new loopholes for in-app purchases than trying to offer gameplay refined. In this sense, the LONEWOLF here is literally a lone wolf that deviates from common practice and puts on the plate an intriguing play structure seasoned with a decidedly more honest sales model than most of its competitors. LONEWOLF offers a different and intriguing perspective on the subject of sniper games Lonely in the night shoots Just to immediately point out the differences with his colleagues, LONEWOLF is based on a true story which justifies in a rather convincing way the act of shooting with a sniper rifle during the various levels: the player's alter ego is in fact a mysterious hit man who is hired by a criminal organization known as the Assembly, but in spite of appearances between one assignment and another the real motivations of the protagonist will emerge. Nothing intended to revolutionize videogame narrative, of course, but the plot of LONEWOLF is pleasant and exciting enough and moreover it is narrated through effective fixed screens created with an apt noir comic style. Moving on to the game itself, Simon Hason's work manages to find an excellent balance between a rigorous shooter component and an unprecedented adventure nuance that gives the whole thing a decidedly particular taste. In fact, each stage presents an objective that requires the use of a little gray matter in addition to good aim: whether it is recognizing the person to be killed among many others, eliminating a target before it can sound the alarm or to take out an entire group of henchmen without them having time to realize what is happening, LONEWOLF encourages the player to think before shooting, while also managing to guarantee a remarkable variety of scenarios. The downside lies in a ~trial and error~ nature which can be frustrating both for the difficulty of the advanced levels and for the free to play mechanics that underlie the product: there is in fact an energy indicator that is reduced every time you try a mission, and in the most demanding stages it is easy to immediately drain your reserve by dint of attempts, finding yourself forced to wait for the reload time or to pay a few cents for an instant refill. However, LONEWOLF behaves honestly, and the highlight of the online store allows you to remove all advertising and energy indicators and access premium content for just 1.99. A negligible outlay that we advise anyone who is passionate about the game to consider, given that it exponentially improves a playful experience that is already taken care of in every aspect. As mentioned at the beginning, in fact, LONEWOLF deals with the matter of sniping in a truly competent way: in one's stalking one must take into account the distance of the objectives, the possible presence of the wind and other elements that could affect the trajectory of the bullets and make the corrections of the case. By spending the credits obtained by completing the missions, you can then buy new rifles, targets and accessories to improve your sniper performance. LONEWOLF also knows what he's doing when he engages in more typically shooter sections based on the use of a pistol, in which reaction speed must be preferred and which are very entertaining thanks also to a precise and satisfying control system. The roundup ends with a whole series of challenges and real shooting ranges that help increase the longevity of the product especially for those who like to aim for trophies and the top of the online rankings. Finally, the peculiar graphic design of the title is truly noteworthy: even during the gameplay phases, LONEWOLF retains an adult comic style that fits perfectly with the tone of the work, and which, while not stupendous with special effects, denotes various touches of class and a remarkable attention to detail.", "date": "2016-01-14", "grade": "8.4"}
