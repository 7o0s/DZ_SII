This Kinect Rush is no exception and, in staging settings and situations inspired by five Pixar blockbusters, it is enriched by the voices of the original voice actors of the films and an attractive graphic appearance, among the best in the library of motion sensor compatible games . Thus, Ratatouille, Up, Toy Story, Cars and the Incredibles are revived on the TV with a series of levels that are instantly entertaining, also giving the possibility of returning to the scene of the crime, improving scores and discovering bonuses and alternative routes, but with a experience that in the long run becomes tiring necessarily. A small playground The concept that holds together the stories to be tackled in Kinect Rush is the same as that of the recent Disneyland Adventures, namely that of recreating a playground, divided into thematic areas, in which to venture to enter the different levels: three for each of the films, progressively unlocked. The difference is that, whereas in the game dedicated to Mickey and Co. the park was huge and populated with shops and characters to interact with, here it is a small square that opens directly onto the different worlds in which to play, without the dozens of contents additions to the other title. In practice it is a connection through which to pass to kick off the adventures. At the beginning, among other things, there is a fun player scan function, which tries to recreate a Pixar version of the same, taking the basic features and adapting them to the cartoon characters and the style chosen for the avatar. The software is even able to recognize the colors of clothes and skin, making sure that the room is well lit, otherwise the skin color necessarily turns towards darker shades. As the title suggests, the levels, all made with extreme care from every point of view, are a series of races in which you have to hurry to reach the end, collecting as many gold tokens as possible. Based on the number of these, at the end of each level, special abilities and characters are unlocked with which to look for shortcuts or interact with objects that give further gold tokens. For example, with Buzz Lightyear, the robot protagonist of Toy Story, you can open chests with the laser that is unlocked as an upgrade, or in Ratatouille you can glide to reach the highest roofs with a cape that can be stretched out to form a small glider. Xbox 360 goals Like all Kinect games, Kinect Rush's 1000 points are certainly not impossible to achieve. However, this is not a very short-term task, because between skills to unlock and platinum medals to collect, the 15 levels of the game must be tackled over and over again. Coins and bonuses The roads are many, as are the actions required of the player, who must swim, jump, climb, dodge laser and missile shots, and then respond by hurling boulders or vegetables in what are in all respects simple battles with end-of-life monsters. level. There is therefore also a certain depth, which tries to limit the fact that all the levels can be finished in one afternoon (also because it is almost impossible to die and when that happens you only lose a handful of tokens among those accumulated), but the problem is that being a game in which you have to run, even if only swinging your arms without having to move your legs by force, getting back there to redo the levels to improve becomes objectively tiring. In short, the physical effort required to go into all the details necessarily passes through an activity designed for the little ones who, however, will limit themselves to enjoying the colors and the beautiful animations without going too far in discovering everything below the surface. It's fun to run on the roofs of Paris, avoiding old gentlemen who sweep the terraces, or swimming in the sewers while the rain threatens to overwhelm the boat with the supplies of small rodents; just as very nice are the situations in which you find yourself with Woody between the garden of a school and an airport in an attempt to save a toy and bring it back to its owner, or again with the tropical and city adventures of the Incredibles, rather than with the pursuit of the house of old Carl from Up, while trying to shoot down the airship of the villain Charles, the adventurer without honour. The situations that work less well are those of Cars in which, as usual, you have to reach out to driveForward with an invisible steering wheel to drift, collect coins and time jumps (later a boost is unlocked to finish tracks faster). By now it seems evident, however, that this type of mechanics wears out its charm after a few laps on the track. It can also be played in two, not online however, by completing all the acts, even by interacting and activating small couple puzzles. A small addition certainly nice from the point of view of the audience to which Kinect Rush is aimed. Comment Excellent graphic design beautiful situations and rendering of the atmospheres of the films If you want there is so much to do A little too short Running on the spot, even just with your arms, can be tiring The part dedicated to Cars", "date": "2012-04-12", "grade": null}
