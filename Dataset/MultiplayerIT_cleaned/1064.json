{"name": "Il Ritorno allIsola Misteriosa", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/il-ritorno-allisola-misteriosa.html", "text": "Developers Kheops Studio wanted to give us an interesting retelling of the original story A female Robinson Crusoe Just like her predecessors, Mina will have to learn to survive by feeding on what she finds and, drawing on all her resources and a good dose of ingenuity, she will be able to treasure the inventions and messages left by her fellow sufferers. However, she will not be completely alone in this undertaking: an arcane presence hovers over the island and seems to want to guide it in the right direction and, by rescuing a nice little monkey, Mina will gain a precious ally. His only possibility of communicating with the civilized world is represented by a sophisticated satellite device with a built-in telephone, which at the beginning of the adventure is useless: we will have to find a way to recharge its batteries. Creepy earthquakes tear apart the peace of the island but, apart from that, for a while Mina will have to resign herself to living only with her own conscience, the ghosts of memories that populate the mysterious island and no other noise except those of the sea. and the nature that surrounds her, in addition to the cries of her pet monkey, of course... and us with her. The plot certainly does not stand out for its originality and will not leave anyone breathless, especially those who have not read the book and cannot recognize themselves either in those places masterfully reconstructed on the computer, much less in the numerous quotations, but anyone can enjoy the sense of immersion and the spirit of adventure and survival that this title manages to arouse. An unusual combination: adventure and replayability For once, we are faced with a graphic adventure that is not strictly linear: in the guise of Mina, we will be allowed to roam freely on the island and rummage almost everywhere, solving the puzzles in the way and order we like best. In fact, many of the objectives can be achieved in several ways, through puzzles with multiple solutions, which is certainly not frequent in this genre of games and undoubtedly contributes to replayability - a system of points and bonuses guarantees a satisfied player and the possibility of constantly check your progress! The exploration of the island is quite exciting. Our first goal will be to refresh ourselves with what we find on the beach, to be able to recover our energy and then enter the hinterland more calmly. A diary will keep us constantly updated on Mina's most recent goals and discoveries. For once, we are faced with a graphic adventure that is not strictly linear An unusual combination: adventure and replayability The puzzles are strictly logical, they challenge the player to be creative and for this same reason their solution gives a certain sense of satisfaction: they are mostly based on the inventory, but on various occasions we will also have the delicate task of unlocking complicated locks or manipulate strange machinery. In the latter cases, The Return to the Mysterious Island certainly does not shine for its originality, but on the other hand we would never have thought that picking plants and fruits or repairing an old abandoned mill with makeshift means could be so exciting! The level of difficulty is variable but not excessive. No one will spare you a little pixel hunting: not that the numerous objects to collect and use are wickedly hidden in the game settings, but they are sometimes quite difficult to spot, partly due to the high level of detail of the scenarios and partly for the movement control system, which imposes repeated and nauseating all-round panoramas of every single screen so as not to miss anything. It is necessary to mention the fact that there are also time trials and there is the risk that our Mina will end up prematurely, but both ~setbacks~ will not cost the user unsustainable frustrations: the game allows you to retry indefinitely without having to start over or reload and, with two or three attempts at the most, anyone will be able to overcome the obstacle without major problems. The use of more or less improvised weapons is also envisaged for some phases of the arcade game, but always in the name of maximum simplicity and intuitiveness. An unusual combination: adventure and replayability Another peculiar aspect of The Return to the Mysterious Island is that the protagonist will be able to rely on a small local helper, after having saved and looked after him: at least, he will not end up like our television Merolone, left to himself on the last resort of the Isola dei Famosi, in the throes of mystical hallucinations and delusions of omnipotence! We will be granted the company of a little monkey who revit will soon be very helpful and will appear in the inventory like any other object, ready to be used if necessary, to reach otherwise unreachable points on the island or to carry out not so elementary tasks. The Jep monkey, in fact, would be worthy of the Togni circus: he always understands on the fly what to do to help us in every situation and even succeeds in feats such as weaving and fixing a rope ladder to create a rudimentary Tibetan bridge. Without her, Mina would probably be doomed on the island and, moreover, she consumes relatively little and no one forces us to clean up her toilet! The magic of the tropics on our screens The main menu, elegant and functional, provides the usual game options and a gallery of images and bonus movies. The interface is practical and intuitive, all operations are performed with the mouse: selections and interactions with the left button, opening the inventory menu and game options with the right. The inventory and its original management system represent the fulcrum of most puzzles, so much so that examining and combining objects has never been so engaging: the objects collected, which are countless and not all necessarily usable, can be divided into eight cards with twenty-eight slots, perhaps divided into categories. In this way, it will be easier to combine them in the appropriate window at the base of the inventory, in which they are added from time to time in the form of an equation, with question marks for the elements missing for the assembly of some tool or the ingredients necessary for the preparation of a nutritious meal. Each food or tool in our possession is described in detail and, later in the game, we will be able to examine them also with the help of a useful digital encyclopedia. Since the same objects can be combined in multiple ways and for different uses throughout the game, many of Mina's built tools can be disassembled, returning the basic components, or recycled. The inventory and its original management system are the core of most puzzles The magic of the tropics on our screens The pre-rendered graphics are a bit static, as often happens in adventures with a 360 panoramic view along the lines of Myst, but certainly effective: thanks to the realistic and very detailed reproduction of the fauna and flora of a tropical island, it helps to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the game. However, some backdrops are animated and it is pleasant to stop and observe the seagulls that circle above our heads, the fronds of the plants that sway in the wind, the insects that climb along the trunks of the trees or the menacing smoke spewed out by the volcano. The transitions from one shot to another appear quite fluid and the resulting feeling of immersion is natural and pleasant. Interlude films are practically absent and the progress of the plot is marked only by comic-style boards or, to be more precise, story-boards with sketches of Mina carrying out the operations ordered by us... as if they were the illustrations of a book, the ideal sequel to The Mysterious Island indeed! The musical accompaniment is perfectly on topic, even if very discreet, which still allows us to immerse ourselves better in the atmosphere of the island and in the solitude of Mina. The only voice that is heard for most of the adventure is that of our protagonist, which is absolutely appreciable. The sound effects are realistic and also provide useful clues for solving the game, such as when we hear coconuts falling on the sand behind us or try to combine inventory items. Beyond some negligible inaccuracies in the translation, the localization is more than good. Comment We are certainly faced with a sui generis adventure: almost devoid of dialogues and supporting characters or actual films, but rich like few others in terms of interaction with the environment and inventory. The result is an unexpectedly enjoyable and engaging game, which manages to guarantee immersion even without relying on a solid plot, overwhelming twists or exciting conversations. Surviving, exploring and experimenting will be the only concerns of the player, who will discover the joys and pains of life full of adventure and solitude. Few titles of this genre manage to evoke such a particular atmosphere and grant as much freedom of action, but it is clear that this is not a product suitable for everyone: it will only conquer the true connoisseurs of classic adventures, the most contemplative lovers of exploration and study of detail, as well as puzzles based oninventory, of course. An interesting diversion while waiting for the juicy adventure titles that await us for the new year, in short! Pros: Non-linearity Replayability Brilliant inventory management Cons: Lack of dialogue and cutscenes Lack of variety in puzzles A female Robinson Crusoe Usually, a vacation on a tropical island away from work and the hectic everyday life costs a tidy sum, but not for our heroine Mina who, luckily or unluckily, ends up there accidentally after a storm: all At the beginning of this adventure, we find her soaking on the shore of an unknown and apparently uninhabited island, although the shipwreck does not seem to have affected in the least either her vaguely gypsy charm, much less her insatiable appetite (to keep her on the island it will cost us tears and blood)! In reality, she will soon discover that other castaways have passed through there before her, since this ~Mysterious Island~ is none other than the one told in the homonymous novel by Julius Verne, the second adventure of the illustrious Captain Nemo returning from the exploits of ~20,000 Leagues Under the Sea~. Anyone who has read the book in question should not be surprised by the fact that the island escaped the devastating volcanic eruption that closed the literary story: the developers Kheops Studio, who inveterate adventurers and Egyptophiles will remember for the recent Egypt 3, wanted to give us a interesting retelling of the original story, assuming that the island is still there and that it still preserves all its mysteries... it will be up to the player to find out what they are and what happened to the good old captain.", "date": "2005-01-07", "grade": null}
