Imprisoned and transported to a maximum security facility, he does not give up even in the face of evidence and continues to fight for the freedom of his compatriots, targeting in particular Roderick Metze, an American dentist who joined the Nazi troops and who to Joe's eyes, he looks strangely familiar. The story of ~Gunslinger Joe~, as the character is nicknamed by his fans, is told through static comic-style cutscenes, narrated in Italian like the rest of the game but ugly in stylistic terms and substantially weak, if compared to the extraordinary sequences of Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus. Ready to go, the MachineGames team therefore produces a sensational own goal, renouncing a characterizing aspect of the experience (the narrative component, in fact) and avoiding delving into a story that would have deserved more attention; all with a view to a mini-campaign in three acts that is completed in less than three hours. The African American stallion As anticipated in the aforementioned Episode Zero of the Season Pass, each of the three characters of The Freedom Chronicles has one of the special abilities that B.J. Blazkowicz acquires in the second half of the Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus campaign. However, if in that case it was powers deriving from advanced electronic devices, in the expansions it is a matter of pure genetics: thanks to his athletic abilities, ~Gunslinger Joe~ is able to literally break through walls and knock down iron doors with his charge on the run, a maneuver that allows him to catch his opponents off guard and to find gaps where there seem to be none. It is a mechanic that in the base game offered alternative interpretations in terms of progression, while here it is applied in a linear way, but that's okay: the important thing is that the ~run & gun~ gameplay packaged by MachineGames is present throughout its frenetic spectacularity, with heart-pounding fights, racing at breakneck speed with two (different!) weapons in hand and a final boss fight that made us sweat. The three acts that make up the campaign of this DLC, entitled ~Captured~, ~On the run~ and ~Final Clash~, see Joe escape from the maximum security facility in which he has been locked up, escaping cruel Nazi experiments and certain death, for regroup and implement their revenge. Once out, on the streets of the city he finds himself facing hooded enemies in an attempt to get in touch with the resistance, up to the inevitable final duel with Metze in... foreign land. In addition to the native ability of the protagonist, the practical differences compared to Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus are in fact few: around the scenario we will find appendices to be mounted on weapons that will improve their performance, but the arsenal with which we will have to what to do will be the same, with the only addition of a powerful flare gun and some special grenades. Playstation 4 trophies The ten Trophies of The Adventures of Gunslinger Joe are obtained by completing the various parts of the mini-campaign at the different difficulty levels available, as well as by collecting all the collectibles around the scenarios, in this case documents and gold. Touchdowns The idea behind The Freedom Chronicles is interesting: to present three different characters, whose actions take place parallel to those of The New Colossus, and to divide between them the special powers that Blazkowicz acquires during the base game thanks to as many devices. Among the positive aspects of this set of expansions there is certainly the fact that they offer the same solid and spectacular gameplay that we loved in the original campaign; but the variations on the theme are few and in terms of duration everything is within the norm, if we consider a sale price of 9.99 euros for a single DLC or 24.99 euros for the entire Season Pass. In reality, however, having reused the settings and assets of the base game, enemies included, saving on the cutscenes (represented, as mentioned, by static images in a vintage comic style, but with a non-overwhelming style), would have allowed developers to insert a few more levels and perhaps focus on five hours, so as to practically compose an alternative campaign, considering all the downloadable contents. A longer duration would also have allowed the authors to study betterthe narrative component, fascinating but barely sketched: the clear proof of a not very inspired work, to which we feel like assigning the ~green light~ solely for the validity of a gameplay which, however, as mentioned, does not present significant variations compared to what already seen in The New Colossus. In conclusion... Wolfenstein II: The Adventures of Gunslinger Joe is conditionally promoted. The mini-campaign starring the athletic Joseph Stallion boasts the same gameplay as the base game, and this undoubtedly represents an advantage in the panorama of shooters, but the novelties are few: the innate ability to charge, borrowed from The New Colossus, a flare gun and some weapon accessories. In terms of narration (characterized by mediocre static images in a vintage comic style) and total duration, it would have been reasonable to expect something more. However, those who have not had a fasting experience of the frenetic run & gun of MachineGames cannot avoid trying all three DLCs of the Season Pass.", "date": "2017-12-16", "grade": null}
