Even the plate of television and competitive events is always rich, and this season will culminate with the European football championships, which will take place from 7 to 29 June in Austria and Switzerland. Waiting to understand if Italy will be able to repeat the success of the World Cup, thus emulating France in this particular statistic, UEFA Euro 2008 arrives on (almost) all the consoles, a simulation dedicated to this event. Don't be fooled by the name, under the hood of Electronic Arts' latest effort beats the heart of FIFA 08, refurbished, in order and with several pleasant additions oriented to online and beyond. Best football title currently available on the square? Find out with us. Live the football show with us! Everything that revolves around the game is projected at the continental event, with numerous historical recurrences interspersed with uploads and statistics appearing everywhere. In this sense, the first interesting mode is represented by the one that allows you to relive the qualifications for the final phase according to some starting scenarios, each with three objectives to be completed, one of which is the main one. For example, Scotland will be controlled against France in the fiftieth minute and it will be necessary to lead them to victory (and as an additional objective not to concede a goal) or Germany against Cyprus on nine to zero, with the imperative of scoring three more goals, just to further mortify the opposing team. Each objective achieved returns points, which accumulated allow you to level up and unlock other competitions, as well as take part in scenarios of the 2004 European championships, won by Greece. There is also the quick match, in which it is possible to play the usual friendly by choosing parameters such as the stadium (among the twenty-four available, including the Austro-Swiss ones) or the ball, and the professional configuration, already known to FIFA 08 players and which allows you to impersonate a single player for the entire duration of the match, enjoying a dedicated view and with the aim of maintaining one's role and position, as well as leading the team to victory. The professional configuration finds its explosion in the mode called ~Lead your nation~, in which up to four players can choose a national team and start a real career Live the football show with us! The professional configuration finds its explosion in the mode called ~Lead your nation~, in which up to four players can choose a national team and start a real career, which in twenty-five matches leads first to some friendlies, then to qualifications and finally to the Europeans themselves. The interesting thing is that each match includes a real-time evaluation of your player (if there weren't four humans, the rest will be controlled by the computer) and the aim is to obtain a high score in order to achieve the band of captain of your own team and level up to be called up for the European event. For example, if we choose an advanced midfielder, every successful pass or dribble immediately increases the rating, every turnover or yellow card foul lowers it. It is also very important to keep the right position in the field, indicated by some arrows that increase in number (up to three) in case you find yourself completely out of position. Based on the rating you get some points, which can be spent to upgrade your player. Even more interesting is the possibility of choosing one created with the powerful editor that the title makes available, in order to follow a career mode in which a complete stranger goes so far as to become the captain of his national team. For the more ~romantic~ there is the possibility of playing a European championship in a classic way with all the trappings of the case, starting from the real group stage (with the very tough one of Italy, which sees the presence of France and Holland) and surrounded by from a plethora of statistics regarding players, teams and trivia on the continental competition. Instead, moving the viewfinder to the online part, already a strong point of FIFA 08, the options of the previous chapter and its perfect management remained largely, with classified and non-classified friendlies, the possibility of creating championships, leagues or embarking on a career. We have not yet been able to test the presence or absence of lag because at the momentor test the game servers were not yet active, but we are confident since FIFA 08 from this point of view was practically perfect. In any case, everything present in the game is aimed at the so-called Battle between Nations, which ignites a real spirit of competition between the various participants in the game. Any game played, online, offline, in professional configuration or not, contributes to donating points to one's nation chosen the first time when starting the game (and which can obviously also be different from the native one). These points will be used to draw up an online ranking system, both weekly and general, which will establish which nation has won the virtual European Championship, which will expire on June 30, i.e. the day after the conclusion of the European Football Championships. Playing tournaments with weaker teams earns more points, as well as playing online against an opponent with a stronger team as characteristics. A single large cauldron in a positive sense, therefore, which increases competition and the desire to play for the title, especially for the more ~nationalist~ players. Great goal, Fabio The most positive news comes right when you take the field, where FIFA 08 had already made giant strides and was somehow untied from wanting to imitate Pro Evolution Soccer at all costs, proposing a different interpretation of a UEFA football match Euro 2008 starts right from this base and proposes an absolutely valid game system, where the reactivity of the players is improved, it is possible to perform in a natural way first passes and maneuvered actions, without colliding in a non-immediate response to commands. The variety in front of goal has also increased, and thanks to the ability to dose passes and crosses, the player enjoys extreme customization and variety. The physics of the ball has undergone further refinement, and its behavior appears even more credible in rebounds on the ground (well differentiated in case of rain) and during throws, the speed of play seemed perfect to us, slightly increased compared to the past but far from being schizophrenic and unrealistic. While playing, the real-time updates of the other games are also interesting rather than the indicator of the degree of fatigue. The last gem is represented by the personalized celebrations for each player: after each goal scored it is in fact possible to make one through the various configurations of keys available and continue until the other teammates reach you. In this sense there are the so-called ~final~ celebrations which are represented, for example, by a samba dance rather than an off-field lap, capable of ensnaring one's opponent even more after a scored goal. UEFA Euro 2008 starts right from this base and proposes an absolutely valid game system, where the reactivity of the players is improved, it is possible to perform first passes and maneuvered actions in a natural way, without clashing in a non-immediate response to commands Great goal, Fabio The technical sector has undergone an equal measure of improvement, starting right from the animations of the players, which seemed extremely convincing to us and which also positively influence the gameplay. We particularly appreciated those of the goalkeepers, who make their interventions extremely credible and varied, such as for example during snacks to deflect shots off goal or in the event of a blocked ball in two halves. The realization of the players is generally good, with some similar to the real counterparts (Buffon, Perrotta) and others a little less (Cannavaro, Gattuso), appreciable the application of sweat on the faces after a while from the start of the match or during the rain and in general the impact you have once you take the field, thanks to an often impeccable fluidity during the action (but unfortunately not in the replays) and a good general use of light and color saturation, which further improve the graphic aspect of the title. The construction of the stadiums is decidedly more alternating in quality, ranging from beautiful to barely acceptable. The audio commentary is once again entrusted to the Caressa-Bergomi duo, which works decidedly well, even if personally we would like to kill the good national Beppe (and his interlayer ~Fabio~), the choruses are excellent, customized for each team and faithfully reproduced even taking advantage of the different audio technologies that the game makes available. The flaws of UEFA Euro 2008 are all to be found in the longevity factor and in the lack of club teams which, however desired (since it is the official game of the European Championships), tend to reduce the number of competitions present and the desireia to play the title after some time. Similarly some of the online competitions, rather than the Battle of the Nations, will lose meaning after the end of the Europeans themselves, going to undermine the above factor. Finally, considering that the title arrives a few months after FIFA 08, at full price and that FIFA 09 will be released during the Christmas period, there are some reservations, even if the options related to online play and the improvements made to the gameplay are certainly important. Comment Here we are, one might say. In UEFA Euro 2008 you can finally breathe football air in every little aspect, starting right from that gameplay that has been improved in terms of player reactivity, animations, variety of maneuvers that can be done. It seems that the programmers have capitalized on a large part of the criticisms raised by FIFA 08, further updating the graphic detail and adding modes and options also closely related to online play, which already represented a strength in the previous chapter. However, the (intentional) absence of the clubs is felt in terms of longevity, but it is quite clear, in our view, that the football title to be played in the coming months and approaching the European event is precisely this. Pro Improved and varied gameplay Exceptional online Excellent technical sector Cons Absence of club teams Some competitions will die down after the conclusion of the Euros", "date": "2008-04-15", "grade": null}
