{"name": "Tetris Effect: Connected", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/tetris-effect-connected-recensione.html", "text": "In this review of Tetris Effect: Connected we resume the discussion left unfinished exactly two years ago, when Tetris Connect was released on PlayStation 4, which later also landed on PC. It was a game born from an absolutely explosive mix: the formula of one of the video games that made the history of the medium reviewed through the eyes of Tetsuya Mizuguchi, visionary genius creator of Space Channel 5, Rez, Child of Eden and Lumines. The result was a breath of fresh air in the puzzle game genre, a combination of very old and brand new that managed not only to convince, but in some ways to amaze and, obviously, to keep millions of players glued to the screen for hours and hours. At the time, among the few defects we found in Tetris Effect, we pointed out that the lack of a multiplayer mode was actually a pity: in retrospect it does not seem to have been a completely unfounded criticism, because today that same product is back on the market enriched of that much desired multiplayer component. Tetris Effect: Connected, this is the name of the new version, is presented as a launch game for Xbox Series X / S, also included in Game Pass. In addition, it is already available on PC and will be available for those who already own the previous version on the Epic Game Store, Oculus Quest and PlayStation 4 via a free update that will only arrive next summer. Tetris, music and lights Tetris Effect: Connected is therefore in all respects an exclusive console time on Xbox Series X / S. It's probably not one of those games capable of moving hardware sales, yet at the same time it represents one of the most interesting additions to Game Pass in recent weeks, especially for those who want to take a break from the big triple A or more challenging. However, knowing full well that you can start playing Tetris Effect with the intention of spending just a few minutes and then find yourself after a couple of hours wanting to play one more game... This new version largely replicates the contents of the first edition, which is why it seems appropriate to refer you to our original review to deepen the discussion thoroughly. In summary, it is a respectful reworking of the mechanics of the puzzle game known by practically anyone on the face of the earth, however refreshed above all by a remarkable audiovisual research in the so-called side elements. Those who have played Lumines in the past will find the conceptual similarities evident in the two works, both of which offer a mix between the flow of gameplay and that of music and sensational visual effects. In Tetris Effect, however, it is clear how Mizuguchi found further stimulus from the greater modern technical capabilities, because it is precisely in the graphics that we find a trip of effects, shapes, colors and lights that transports us between completely different settings and places, accompanied by the beat of a extraordinarily varied soundtrack that spans different genres with incredible simplicity. The levels are alive, they change and evolve during the games, and it becomes almost a shame to have to concentrate on the action and the tetrominoes that fall into the well instead of enjoying what appears on the screen. That's why playing Tetris Effect is a unique experience, a real sensory journey that has the flavor of the full realization of the Japanese game designer's idea. Multiplayer, finally As mentioned above, Tetris Effect: Connected keeps the single player content intact, such as the main Journey mode and the Challenge, made up of challenges based on specific rules. Compared to the first release, this version adds a robust multiplayer mode also divided into different modes, each capable of guaranteeing a different experience. The ~main~ and most articulated is undoubtedly Connected, which is to all intents and purposes a cooperative with a rather original cut. In practice you find yourself joined by 2 other players, each with their own well. The goal is to defeat a series of CPU-controlled bosses, depicted with the signs of the zodiac and each with unique attacks, by clearing lines of bricks. The variation on the theme lies in the fact that every now and then the three wells merge into one huge well, where each of the players can place their tetrominoes even in the areas ~owned~ by their teammates. It is a mode that generates interesting dynamics, with users who have to put aside the classic ~loneliness~ in the evolution of the game to also consider the actions of their teammates in this case. The other options aren't quite as original but still very enjoyable, they revealdoses on the contrary less demanding from the point of view of the time required to conclude a game and therefore more compatible with short sessions: Zone Battle and Score Attack are substantially identical in the mechanics and in the development of the challenges, but while in the first the players hinder each other by throwing one's eliminated lines into the opponent's pit and taking advantage of the ~Zone~, in the second one the clash is based purely on the final score, guaranteeing a more linear development of the matches. The last mode, called Classic Score Attack, has a more didactic purpose since it is based on the rules and mechanics of the original tetris: interesting to see what refinements of the formula have been made over time and how important they are in the final calculation , but probably bound to be ultimately too archaic for most people's tastes. To avoid clashing users with skills that are too distant, in ranked matches there is a reference score that can be increased or decreased depending on the results obtained, and which helps to cross compatible users. In the progression of the various encounters or by carrying out particular actions, avatars can then be unlocked, to be associated with your name to enjoy a small element of customization.", "date": "2020-11-17", "grade": "9.0"}
