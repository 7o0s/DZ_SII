Want to put responsibilities to keep in mind? Worlds to create, planets to design, civilizations to lead, cataclysms to launch and blessings to sip. Probably, at times, it can even be an enjoyable task, if conscientious scruples are avoided. This is the idea behind WorldBox - God Simulator, proposed by the developers (and publishers) of Maxim Karpenko as the ~ultimate god simulator~. Initially the title was released on smartphones, but has recently also been available on PC via Steam: all strictly in early access, even if - by virtue of the contents present and almost absent smudges - it already seems as good as complete. After having spent some time between the creative and destructive possibilities of what in all respects is considered a delightful crazy sandbox, we therefore leave you with the review of WorldBox - God Simulator. Gameplay: play god Here is the initial world, when you first start WorldBox - God Simulator In products like WorldBox - God Simulator (but in truth it should apply to all video games, not just sandboxes) the gameplay represents the heart of the experience. This concept is probably so obvious to the developers that they haven't put much effort into offering their offering to newcomers. Upon launch, WorldBox - God Simulator loads a new world, randomly, and delivers it to us: no explanations, no tutorials, just the toolbars to use, located at the bottom of the screen. A tutorial actually exists, but it's hidden somewhere in the settings: anyway, it just points out the obvious. That is, he explains that the newcomer's job is to be a god, and a god can do literally anything he wants. Specifically, it is a question of closely observing the world, modifying it as you wish: at a geographical-environmental level, introducing or eliminating various types of civilization, always according to the rich and curious options proposed by the editor. The gameplay, in short, consists precisely in playing god, according to seemingly infinite potentials. Although convincing, in fact, the experience of WorldBox - God Simulator meets its natural limit in this state of affairs: that is, in the proposal of maximum freedom free from any objective (apart from the Steam objectives, but those are another thing) . Simplifying: there is no plot, context, goal to be achieved. You can create everything or destroy everything, and the entertainment consists in this: in this, and in observing all the possible combinations between the game objects and the living beings present. It must also be said that the actions of the latter, once they reach a certain point, become limited: a civilization grows up to a given level of development, then either remains at peace as it is or declares war on the neighboring one. Any game will therefore end with the player himself who, bored and eager to start over, will destroy everything and everyone with his divine powers. Lots of content Biomes are not lacking in WorldBox - God Simulator Those that we have listed just above, on balance, are also the main defects of any sandbox: in WorldBox - God Simulator one can therefore only object, if anything, to the absence of any narrative ambition, or in any case the existence of a minimum useful campaign at least in exploring all the possibilities offered by the developers. Because there is really a lot of content, and it's a pity that they are simply thrown there by categories, leaving any stimulus to the initiative to the newcomer. One of the many menus of WorldBox - God Simulator WorldBox - God Simulator allows you to meticulously study every aspect of your game. How big should the continent that will host living beings be? Will it be enriched with beaches, rivers, seas, or with hills and mountains? How many races will inhabit it? Will the humans get along with the elves or will they immediately attack both them and the dwarves? The divinity directly influences many rules: one can decide to deny war conflicts and focus on diplomacy, or to favor even rebellions within the same civilization. The creatures almost always respond to a shared logic: placing a hyena next to a hen means observing a carnage in a few seconds. If you want, you can set parameters and custom rules in WorldBox - God Simulator Extremely rich and crazy, then, the possibilities offered by the divine powers: destroying everything and everyone always has a perverse charm. How, then, will a civilization be brought to an end? With a meteor shower or even better steaming lava? By sending UFO? By unleashing a gigantic crab capable of firing laser beams from its claws? A good pestilence can itself serve the purpose. The limits are precisely those of creativity. And also a bit of the editor itself, but the latter will be enriched in the future, because as we explained WorldBox - God Simulator is still in early access (and the developers also seem to welcome and listen willingly to the opinions of the community).", "date": "2022-02-06", "grade": "8.0"}
