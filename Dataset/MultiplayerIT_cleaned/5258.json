An old-fashioned roguelike, made up of procedural dungeons and a very high probability of death on each mission. This was accompanied by a series of very successful mechanics capable of further raising the bar of difficulty but also of bringing the title to a different degree of strategic value. Now the game also arrives on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita with the never too abused ~cross-buy and cross-save~ formula. Buy a copy of Darkest Dungeon and you will have the possibility to play where and when you want, with your save always at hand. Only your heroes will remain perpetually in the dark! Darkest Dungeons maintains its very bad and funny style unchanged at the same time Once upon a time there was a dark dark Dungeons It would be useless to stand here and highlight again a whole series of features that the original review of the title on PC already did very well. However, two of these are so peculiar that we cannot avoid taking them up again and deepening them. Darkest Dungeon doesn't do anything that no other game of the same genre hasn't already done in the last four decades. The strong point lies in the very way it brings these characteristics into play, with difficult but rewarding gameplay. Simple in construction and based on turn-based combat with a party of four heroes facing as many enemies in single file. The fifteen classes of heroes, corresponding to as many gothic-medieval stereotypes, are also and above all useful based on one's position in line. To understand: if you have a knight and an archer in your party, it will be quite automatic to place the first in last place and the second in first, otherwise it will be completely impossible to use one or more of the hero's skills. A simple and brilliant mechanic at the same time, which is enhanced thanks to one of the key elements of the gameplay: stress. Consider that your heroes are the classic RPG characters, with their own life points, their own mana and their own stamina (which is so fashionable now). Perfect, eliminate the second and third and replace them with a different value, this time increasing, which increases the hero's stress level, and therefore decreases his sanity inversely proportionally. This will be affected by every element in play, but it will be the fear of certain enemies or hits that cause heroes to fall arbitrarily from the front row to the rear. It goes without saying that this will upset the cards on the table during the clashes, adding a pinch of spice and randomness that will be resolved by moving the hero, at the cost of a very precious turn. Just sanity represents the first and most important element to take into consideration, probably even more than the life points themselves. This mechanic, original and ingenious, is what made Darkest Dungeons a small case during its development. Although it is often exaggerated and can lead to the death of the heroes from heart attacks (literally, it is not a figure of speech) it is undoubtedly a fantastic gimmick by the developers. As mentioned, there are many occasions in which the hero of the moment can risk reaching a state of madness such as to require treatment in a mental hospital, or seeking recreation in alcohol or in women, but the supporting element remains the darkness, the depending on the fundamental characteristics of the advancement. Imagine that your favorites are all eleven year olds who still sleep with the light on at night. This will force you to carry around dozens of torches necessary to keep the flame that will light your way through the dungeons well lit. The more this fades, the more the stress generated in the heroes will increase and the possibility that they will be surprised by the enemies in front of them. At the same time, the rewards in terms of loot will also increase given the increased difficulty of the clashes. It will therefore be up to you to understand when to take risks and when it will be wiser to remain in the light of the torch, always keeping in mind that the fate of a mission can be completely reversed even with a single clash. These remain the main features of what is not a title for everyone but which if accepted for what it is can give you many hours and lots of fun. The rest of the gameplay is absolutely nothing new. It's about buying items, upgrading village areas and your characters, and unlocking new abilitiesity, with the risk always around the corner of abandoning forever a hero you were fond of and seeing him end up in the cemetery in charge. Playstation 4 trophies The title presents the beauty of 53 trophies, of which 42 in bronze, 8 in silver, 2 in gold and the coveted platinum. Collecting them all will be a matter of time and suffering, especially since so many beings require losing high-ranking heroes or taking them to the end of dungeons close to exhaustion. A test more psychological than skill, in short. Original in this too, enjoy it! Big screen, small screen From a visual point of view the game is a small pearl. It is clear how the style used, two-dimensional and cartoonish, does not marry everyone's needs; but the artistic research is not questionable. Everything in the game suggests a very dark graphic novel in motion. Despite the lack of variety in the dungeons, each hero class is beautifully characterized as well as the enemies and you will hardly get tired of looking at such a design. Even technically it is not possible to make any notes on the title, which never misses a beat and which is almost totally free from bugs and glitches of various kinds. The type of progress helps and it would hardly be able to generate polygonal interpenetrations or similar events, but it's always nice to see such a successful cleaning and optimization job. On the PlayStation Vita screen then everything becomes a marvel, as often happens. Very colorful and very inspired, the title is perfect for small sessions around, made up of many satisfactions and a few bitter tears. The only sore point, despite the developer's desire to make everything as intuitive as possible, can be seen in the mapping of the commands. The title has a management of menus and features expressly designed to be used via mouse (with which it is possible to do practically everything in the original version) and the passage on the pad was not exactly painless. Despite the mapping designed according to the positions of the keys and elements on the screen, more than once you will find yourself wondering how the hell to open a menu that you see, but you don't know how to reach.", "date": "2016-10-05", "grade": "8.5"}
