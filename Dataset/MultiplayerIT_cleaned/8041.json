{"name": "L'ultima versione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/113887-dmc-devil-may-cry-lultima-versione.html", "text": "The reboot of Capcom's action saga has recently arrived on home consoles, sparking one of the most heated debates of recent times. The anger of some fans dissatisfied with the result is hitting Ninja Theory, guilty of having revised a brand judged by the Japanese parent company itself in need of renewal in its own way. However, there are not a few who support the success of the project, starting from the specialized press which almost unanimously promoted DmC Devil May Cry and from thousands of players who were enthusiastic about the exploits of the very young Dante. Finally, after a few days of extra waiting, PC users can also take a position, thanks to the conversion that arrived today on Steam. 60FPS DmC Devil May Cry is a real reboot of the series and as such it takes up several elements and then remix them and thus lay the foundations for a new saga. Dante, Vergil, an epic that tells of the eternal struggle between Angels and Demons are some of the aspects that refer to the original plot, but Ninja Theory has chosen to modernize the narrative background, introducing some interesting criticisms of Western society. Dante in full detail We will not dwell on describing the plot and characters, already amply gutted by the good Giorgio Melani in his very complete analysis, while we will focus on any differences and improvements of the PC version. The first important change concerns the technical side and at the same time is inextricably linked to the gaming experience. Let's talk about the support for 60 frames per second, the magic number that the Ninja Theory programmers had to give up on consoles in order not to take away space from the talented artists of their team, but easily obtainable on our much more performing PCs. The artistic direction is enhanced by high definition By satisfying the hardware requirements and, if necessary, giving up some aesthetic frills, you can enjoy the very fast and fun combat system to its full potential. The truth is that the difference is noticeable more with the eyes than with the pad in hand. The Battle System already worked very well in its console incarnation and doubling the frame rate certainly does not change the face of the gaming experience. There is therefore no leap in quality, although the gaming experience certainly gains in enjoyment thanks to the additional fluidity. As for the control system, despite being supported, mice and keyboards remain a highly discouraged option, while the far better solution is a good gamepad. In this image the textures are set to normal... Still Unreal Engine 3 The conversion appears successful thanks to the Unreal Engine 3, flexible and scalable like few other game engines. Thus we have a DmC Devil May Cry that runs smoothly on PC and lets you enjoy it which is a pleasure: fast, fluid and beautiful to look at. Here's the difference between low detail... The particular style adopted by the designers of the English team can stand out in all its glory thanks to the Full HD resolution and various filters. The graphic settings menu is certainly not among the richest, letting you select the refresh rate in addition to the resolution. For the latter it will be necessary to make some attempts in case your hardware is not sufficiently performing, so that the vertical synchrony does not block the framerate. Then there is a setting that mentions an elusive Graphic Quality, which can be set from Low to Ultra. By doing some experiments we understood how this wording - very little specific - allows you to change the quality of the rendering and the lights. Finally, there are three checkboxes that can be activated to further embellish the aesthetic sector of the game, namely Texture HD, Shadows HD and Antialiasing HD. Once again not very precise entries, unfortunately, but still small improvements that allow you to exploit at least part of the power ... and Ultra! hidden in our homes to bring out the best the game has to offer. If shadows and antialiasing do their duty, we really struggled to notice the difference between normal and HD textures, so much so that this is the sector that satisfied us the least. PC users like textures of a very different level and the quality, which varies from excellent characters to some low definition backdrops, certainly does not honor the gigs of RAM mounted on their video cards. For the rest there is little to opine: DmC is nice to see even on PC, with few differences compared to the console counterparts but remaining superior, albeit slightly, thanks to the better fluidity and a few touches smeared on an aesthetic sector dominated by the managementart. Support for Steamworks, with achievements and cloud saves close the description of this port. ... while in this on HD, do you notice any differences?", "date": "2013-01-25", "grade": "8.8"}
