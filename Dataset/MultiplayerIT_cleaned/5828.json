Although the term DiRT was included in the name, which for Codemasters sanctioned a controversial change of course compared to the first, highly appreciated titles dedicated to the unfortunate Scottish champion Colin McRae, the official press release left no doubts on the contours of the ambitious project, specifically designed to test the feedback from the ~hardcore~ community and build around it a title without compromises and commercial drifts. The first feedback from critics and the public were simply exciting, triggering a virtuous circle which in the following seven months of development blossomed into painstaking finishing work and of course into new contents, both embroidered on the opinions of users. Today, finally, we were able to get our hands on version 1.0 of the code and as it was for the launch on the Valve platform, the release from Early Access was also a pleasant surprise, enhanced by the highly anticipated announcement of a version for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, scheduled for April 5, 2016. Ruthless, adrenaline-pumping and rewarding: DiRT Rally is the racing that enthusiasts have been waiting for a long time Legends on four wheels The main menu of the British title is particularly simple and intuitive, a feature that can also be found in the screens richer in information, such as those relating to team management, the mechanical setup of the cars and the repair of damage. On the left we find the largest box dedicated to the career, while on the right you can access the various configuration items, the player profile and the organization of a totally personalized event, with the possibility of freely driving all the car models present. The beating heart of the experience is the aforementioned Career mode, a set of events that embraces both the single player and multiplayer components of the title. The competitions are divided into three distinct disciplines: the Rally proper, with the classic and very long stages; the Rallycross where you can challenge other opponents to ~catch~ and the Hillclimb, an exciting uphill race (timed climb) on the fascinating Pikes Peak in Colorado. In Championships, both customized and pre-set, artificial intelligence is tackled in the three types of competitions indicated above, starting from the championship defined as Open up to the Masters, which obviously has a greater number of events and a significantly higher difficulty. There is also the FIA World Rallycross Championship, the official world championship of the discipline that is unlocked only after reaching the Professional level. Online Events are instead a series of races organized by Codemasters divided into daily, weekly, monthly stages and special events; on the basis of detached times, which can be compared on a convenient world ranking, prizes in credits are won, divided into the basic, medium and top categories. From the appropriate menu it is also possible to search or create entire personalized online championships, where for example the duration can be set, deny or allow the use of assistance, external cameras and so on. The hard-earned credits on the track are needed to buy the cars, grouped into twelve categories: the largest group is made up of rally racing cars, which are in turn divided into subgroups by era (60s, 70s, 80s, 2000s and 2010) and engines, such as the R4, the AUTO KIT F2, the Category A and the infamous Group B, present in the 4x4 and RWD variants. These models are joined by specific cars for the Hillclimb, such as the famous Audi Sport quattro S1 PP and the Peugeot 205 T16 Pikes Pikes, and the more modern ones for Rallycross, silhouettes translated from common cars such as the Fiesta, Polo, DS3 and Mini Countryman. The garage includes around forty cars in all and there is no shortage of the most iconic models that have made the history of this sport, such as the legendary Lancia Fulvia HF, Stratos and Delta, the Ford Escort and the ever-present Subaru Impreza and Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. With the accumulated credits and experience it is possible to improve the level of one's own team, made up of crew chief and engineers specialized in the various electronic and mechanical components. Their contribution is fundamental in the critical repair phases between one stage and another, given that the better the characteristics in possession and the more effective the repairs that can be carried out in the middle are.z hour of time available. A simple management component is also linked to the engineers, since the employment contract expires after a predefined number of stages (32 or 40) and it is necessary to renew it in order not to be left without invaluable assistance in the middle of a rally. Ruthless Since the title was released on Steam, the British developers have constantly recalibrated the fundamental Force Feedback effect, modifying its dynamics and consequently also the driving experience offered. With the latest updates, also supported by the support for the Steam Workshop, where it is possible to download specific mods dedicated to your device, the result obtained is even more solid and precise, to the full advantage of involvement. The physical-dynamic model of DiRT Rally is not 100% simulative and there are some small ~poetic licenses~ in the behavior of the cars, however we are before the most profound and realistic product created by Codemasters in its long love affair with racing game, an important qualitative leap that will also have a positive impact on the software house's future productions. So although it is not the new Richard Burns Rally, the most popular pure rally simulation ever, fans of this discipline will appreciate the efforts made by the developers to make the performance of each surface credible, as well as the response of the cars based on the most intimate technical specifications and the stresses to which they are subjected. Tackling the ice of Montecarlo, the dusty gravel of Greece, the mud of Wales or the snow of Sweden, to which a specific simulation algorithm is dedicated, offers a significantly different and always demanding challenge, enhanced by adverse weather conditions and even by night, with real risk of finding yourself without the support of the lights even after a trivial accident. In this regard, the damage yield does not always seem to be consistent, however in most cases the cars respond effectively to the lack of a part or to a serious mechanical problem, giving a lot of satisfaction when you manage to finish a race without a wheel, with the suspension gone and the bodywork completely smashed. To add further adrenaline to the competitions there is also the risk of immediate retirement, which can be caused by violent impacts or by tumbling over the most inaccessible precipices. Although the use of a good steering wheel and the internal view is highly recommended, DiRT Rally can also be used with the joypad, provided you simplify your life by implementing the inevitable electronic aids, among which we find the automatic Launch Control, ABS, grip control and stability control. The difference in the driving experience between the two extremes is particularly noticeable, and it is enough to try to tackle the first meters of Pikes Peak aboard the extremely powerful Peugeot 205 T16 to perceive the influence of the assistances. As is the case in any self-respecting rally title, it is possible to adjust various mechanical parameters of the car before taking to the ~track~, from the brake set-up to the differential, via the suspensions, shock absorbers and of course the gears. Unfortunately, there is no possibility of intervening on the tyres. For those who don't want to waste time setting up their racing car, in the settings menu there is also a very convenient item connected to the Steam Workshop which allows you to download the best configurations for the track to tackle on your profile. Whether you let yourself be led by the automatic settings and/or use the electronic aids, DiRT Rally is still a particularly difficult product to master and the very narrow streets full of jumps, bumps, slope variations and sudden obstacles that characterize the stages always require a lot concentration and precision, not to mention the ruthless artificial intelligence, which when checking the times appears all too inclined not to suffer the ~side effects~ typical of the rally. In the wild lands DiRT Rally offers six distinct settings (Greece, Finland, Wales, Sweden, Germany and Montecarlo) for a total of seventy stages, to which must be added the very long Pikes Peak time trial, offered in two variants, and three official circuits of the Rallycross world, namely the English Lydden Hill, the Swedish Hoijes and the famous Norwegian Hell. Overall it is a good amount of content, even if two or three more scenarios, perhaps caught among the tropical or desert ones such as Australia, Malaysia and New Zealand, would certainly have been welcome. However, it cannot be excluded that the title could be enriched in forecastsone of the console release. From a purely technical point of view, DiRT Rally is solid and convincing, with the latest version of the famous Ego Engine in great shape. At maximum detail, the rendering of some paths borders on photorealism, where the practically infinite visual horizon is embellished with quality textures, refined shaders and high-level effects, with particularly effective particle and volumetric effects in enhancing the spectacular replay sequences. The lighting is also excellent, especially at night, which is at the full service of the gameplay. With our test configuration we obtained the sixty frames per second in any circumstance, and only in some glimpses of the replays, in particular with the shots from the helicopter, did any microstuttering emerge. The scalability of the engine is guaranteed by the gargantuan number of items in the graphics settings menu, among which, in addition to the more classic ones, we also find smoke shadows, advanced blending, shader detail and even advanced fog and ambient occlusion . Some routes are less refined than others and the crowd on the side of the track is not particularly rich in polygons, however the overall result is always extremely solid and pleasant. The car models are also excellent, especially in the interiors thanks to refined shaders that faithfully replicate the surfaces of fabrics and materials. The sound of the engines and the various sound effects linked to the individual components of the car, such as turbines and suspensions, are sublime, with a simply obsessive attention to detail. Finally, the Italian dubbing of the pair of navigators present is valid, although it is necessary to underline a curious bug that in some circumstances ~mixes~ the voices of the two.", "date": "2015-12-14", "grade": "9.0"}
