{"name": "Guerre comiche", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/159010-fantasy-war-tactics-guerre-comiche.html", "text": "On mobile devices there are special versions of extremely famous SRPGs: just think of The Banner Saga or Final Fantasy Tactics (which the Fantasy War Tactics present here recalls a lot, who knows why, in the name), but you know, iOS and Android users do not always are willing to fork over for a premium title. Hence the proliferation of Freemium for a genre which, it must be said, lends itself particularly well to the characteristics of the machines in question: the Korean Nexon has its say by finally launching a game that has long been widespread and appreciated in Extreme Orient. How can the operation be considered? Successful or not? From Korea comes a valid Freemium alternative to the great classics of the SRPG: Fantasy War Tactics! Many things to do Going straight to the point of the action, the various arenas are proposed in the most classic way possible, the canonical isometric grid, on which the player and the CPU move the individual elements of their teams in turn. There is really nothing new and original in the game formula, indeed an almost fundamental element is missing such as being able to independently decide the order in which to move one's heroes, but this should not necessarily be considered a negative point above all considering how many elements are involved, taken from this or that title and which together constitute a very rich panorama. Each hero has for example a ~move~ of the Chinese paper that characterizes him, and consequently he is more powerful against certain opponents, a type of terrain that benefits him, attacks from the flanks and from behind are more effective, placing two or more units close together you perform devastating combo attacks; and then again, all the various skills that must be learned and improved over time, the presence of a non-playable Lord who can intervene as support... All characteristics that outline a typical picture of Freemium and their plethora of objects to collect, present here in such numbers as to make their enumeration difficult. And with all these items, the things to do between one battle and another are equally numerous: level up the characters and their equipment, participate in the extra events (even PvP) that Nexon regularly makes available, organize expeditions during which the chosen character cannot be used but which yield numerous rewards... You will have already understood where we are going with this: do microtransactions, obviously present in abundance, ruin a regular but certainly fun gaming experience? Conquering the world The answer is yes and no, but tending to the negative option if you only have a minimum of patience. The game, with its system of achievements and rewards, seems to be very generous at the beginning, so much so that in the first hours of the game it will be easily possible to keep the party up to, and beyond, the strength of the enemies. Shortly after the first big boss, however, we notice the usual unnatural increase in difficulty designed to allow us to access the online shop, credit card in hand: fortunately, apart from some truly special items, everything else can be acquired in-game, and you will be able to replay the levels already faced, also taking advantage of a very practical option that completely automates the fight - an option that could also be abused, however, removing the whim of facing the battle - with the artificial intelligence that demonstrates a good level. In short, if you want to avoid microtransactions, the secret lies, as always, in the grind. This requires, as we said and as anyone who frequents the mobile scene knows, a certain amount of patience, especially considering that the elements that convinced us most about Fantasy War Tactics are the plot and characters. The story sees you in the role of a wizard, who if we can't define villain is certainly very, very ambitious, engaged in the conquest of the classic fantasy world, and immediately gets on the rails of a very pleasant humor, with strongly characterized characters, dialogues that they will be able to elicit much more than a laugh and some decidedly sui generis and funny situations. The same care has been reserved for the presentation of the package: the entirely 3D graphics are colourful, fluid and very clean, despite being weighed down more often than not by a whole series of spectacular visual effects, and above all it has the great advantage of being visible even on screens little ones. The style used is totally anime, very pleasant and well done, and the standard dose of fanservice is not missing, without ever transcending the limits of a product also intended for a very young audience. Little to say instead about the sound, rich as it should be with various effects, but with little music that is notthey stand out absolutely in nothing in today's landscape.", "date": "2015-11-13", "grade": "7.2"}
