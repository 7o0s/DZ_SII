After a few days without hearing from them, the search started and what the Russian investigators found made it difficult to explain the events: the tent, in which the boys camped urgently due to the worsening weather conditions and the snowstorm that it hit along the way, it was torn from the inside and the footprints found made one think of a sudden and uncontrolled escape that the boys made for no apparent reason. On their bodies, found at different distances from the tent, there were no signs of violence but, despite this, some had their tongues missing while others had fractured skulls or internal injuries comparable to those caused by a strong impact: on their clothes an inexplicable concentration of radioactivity was detected and, in the end, everything was archived by the local authorities of the time, as deaths caused by ~an irresistible unknown force~. If you are a fan of unsolved mysteries, the freezing winter of Kholat might be for you Walk, run and get lost The scenario is that of the cold and snowy mountains of the Urals and Kholat, in the Mansi language, the indigenous tribe of those areas, means ~mountains of the dead~: the incident of the Djatlov pass is narrated in the introduction of the game by the voice, deep and expressive, of the very popular Sean Bean who will often also accompany us on our walks in the snow. It is an experience similar to that lived with Dear Esther or Slender: The Arrival which, with this game, share many aspects in terms of gameplay. Your investigation begins near the station of the village which we assume to be Viaj (this information we know from true history, certainly not from the game), the last inhabited garrison before the paths that lead to the mountains where the horror took place, in 1959 , for Dyatlov and associates and, just after a few steps in the middle of unexplorable tracks and houses, the action will guide you to the first camp where you will find your only objects present in the whole game: a flashlight, a compass and a map. These camps will also act as a save and a fast passage from one area to another on the map. The character under our control will only be able to crouch and run for a limited time (on penalty of fatigue and vision impairment), turn on the flashlight and take out the compass or the map to try to understand where you are going, which is not easy given that the compass seems to work the other way around (will it be wanted by the developers or is north in Russia south?). The tension that is felt in the first minutes is remarkable but the pace is not so intense as to keep it constant and, as we continue our long walks in the snow, the anguish will give way to the frustration of loss of orientation combined with that caused by the numerous times that you will die due to the only enemy present, identifiable in a sort of orange demon, who certainly does not like meeting you and from whom there is no possibility of salvation, unless you notice in time of his presence and avoid it by keeping away from him: sometimes dying could take you back even half an hour of the game and be really frustrating. Kholat is not a terrifying horror experience and the various clues that you will find wandering around the area, not too vast, will immerse you more and more in the plot of the game so much that players more interested in mysteries will be able to immediately start formulating theories and putting together the various pieces of the puzzle, adding the aforementioned clues to the voices you will hear and to the ~spectres~ that will appear in front of you during your wanderings. You can also easily die by falling from rocky cliffs or due to an orange fog which, suddenly and for unknown reasons (go by theory!), envelops some areas to be explored. Graphics are not enough In terms of graphics, the game is really a feast for the eyes and flexes the muscles of the Unreal Engine 4 with a wealth of detail and splendid colors: you will stop several times to admire the changes in the light as you pass in front of the full moon reflecting in the water or finding yourself in the middle of the paths lit by flaming torches (but you will never know who lit them). The storms that suddenlyyou will be unleashed, the fall of heavy rocks, the narrow passages in the caves (which will often be the scene of your death due to the aforementioned orange demon who, at that moment, will appear right there even if at the next loading it may no longer be there) and all the other events that will happen around you will be very pleasant to observe but, at least apparently, absolutely unrelated to what Sean Bean's voice will tell you about, unless you want to give vent to the most varied theories to justify the reason for which, at that moment, the ~easy death~ actor said a certain phrase. The music is really effective, perhaps by far the best aspect of the game, especially the opening music sung by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn (well known for her performances with the Silent Hill saga), which envelops us with a veil of melancholy as if to recall the fate of the unfortunate hikers. As we said, the story develops slowly through the discovery of some notes that you will collect in a diary and which, as soon as they are opened, are recited by the voice of the character who wrote them; it is precisely on these notes that the developers try to leverage the player, so that he can interpret them in his own way by giving explanations and trying to understand how they are connected to each other. It will not be necessary to find the clues in a precise order, so much so that some do not even have to do with the accident. In fact, the plot is decidedly unclear, despite the effort put in place by the developers to try to give the player a completely interpretable experience from the beginning of the game, when you try to understand who you are; while they've pushed a lot towards the supernatural element, which will often seem like the only thing that makes sense, after completing the game in just over four hours, we're not at all sure how things actually went. We leave you to your personal interpretation to compare with those already present in large numbers in the forums. Certainly the attempt to exploit a historical mystery by giving an explanation through a video game is appreciable, but the frustration with the protagonist's inability to jump or climb to cross a very small rocky ravine, the aforementioned comparison with the orange presence that cannot be minimally faced, having to open the map dozens of times to figure out which way you're heading (since no path is traced on it but only the camps and the points where you find the clues are indicated) and, finally, the inability to save the game at will are the real limit of this game.", "date": "2015-06-14", "grade": "6.0"}
