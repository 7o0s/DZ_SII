The advantages are countless and from the first minute of the game you can turn your back on dry land and sail towards adventure. There is no doubt that the sea is the most intriguing and plausible element within the game: not only do lightning storms raise wonderful waves but also the calm sea, tempered by the sun or illuminated by the moon in the dark night represents a pleasant moment of escape. Nothing therefore prevents you from being a ~sailor by chance~ to the bitter end, although it could be argued that you might as well leave the cannons ashore, so here is a list of things to do to boast the title of pirate: smuggle, conquer, assassinate. All very educational, no doubt, but ultimately rewarding. Not all the sea comes to hurt The art of commerce extends to a variety of products, including slaves, to be sold of course to the highest bidder, learning which ports pay certain goods more than others. In any case, getting raw materials is not easy and involves the use of force (don't worry, we'll get there soon), it's just a pity that in the long run it turns into a simple routine, which you will automatically carry out to keep the chests full, losing soon the vivacity of the first robberies. However, immediately exclude the idea of giving yourself to the naval battle with the tub that Playlogic passes by default, which brings us to the quest register, the crossroads of Age of Pirates. On the one hand, in fact, nothing prevents you from giving your services to the many NPCs that crowd (so to speak) the islands of the game, while if you lose your bearings there is always the main plot waiting for you, without this necessarily having to represent the common thread of the adventure, which remains firmly anchored to the player's decisions. However, if you like a bit of narration, know that it will not be quite the same if you have opted for the blond-haired pleaser rather than the rebellious redhead (why can't a redhead be an employee?), even if their roads, who would have thought, are destined to cross. In one case or another, once you have decided to serve as captain for a governor, you will certainly not lack of missions to complete, among which stand out the escort, delivery or recovery of goods, a passage from a end of the world and many other activities between the illicit and the risky. In some cases you will have to deal with certain constraints, such as the time factor and which, if ignored, will reduce the promised cash prize. there is no doubt that the sea is the most intriguing and plausible element within the game Fifteen men on the coffin, as long as you're not in it Now that we can afford some extravagance let's consider the possibility of replacing those dead of sleep, who have so far cleaned the foredeck, by recruiting new members in any village, choosing among soldiers, gunners, sailors but above all officers. We can entrust the other ships of the fleet to the latter (you'll have to sell lupins before you get there, eh), which however cannot exceed four vessels in total. To ensure that all recruited cutthroats do not approach you in their sleep with a pillow in hand, it is a good idea to pay them at the end of the month; no, I'm serious, they really have to be paid. Furthermore, it could happen that you hire officers with a shred of morality, for which the activities we have listed above (conquest, assassination), do not represent reason for applause. Does everything sound exciting to you? It is or rather, it would be if the game had focused better on these aspects leaving out the rest, to which are added the unmanageable controls that take on water on Playlogic's galleon. Fifteen men on the coffin, as long as you're not in it Unfortunately, even after hours of play the keys still get confused, because the same main command takes on different functions depending on the game mode (too many, we repeat), ending up frustrating any attempt to get a quick response to the inputs, which in any case you will never get into the offshore sections. Although these are the most exciting, they are also the most complex to manage and on more than one occasion you will curse the game interface. It makes perfect sense to raise and lower the sails to control the speed of navigation, which must always take place with the wind in your favour, but the result is that every maneuver ends up being disarmingly slow, making you want to duck down together.me to the boat while you hold the damn button down. In this, Age of Pirates pays too high a price for verisimilitude, at the expense of greater playability. Nonetheless, the long chases and the calculation of distances, based on the type of ammunition with which you have loaded the cannons, amply repay the victorious player, although tired above all by the view on board the ship, from which it is easier to choose the moment suitable for making fire without being able to govern it sensibly, not being able to count on a wide view of the game. If only the developers had concentrated on allowing less approximate route orders to be given, perhaps with the possibility of entrusting a series of instructions to the crew, then the whole structure would have been digestible. It goes without saying that the total absence of a tutorial in a title so difficult to master and open to the player's freedom is an unacceptable lack of attention for a finished and complete product. This was however the main course of Age of Pirates, so let's help ourselves with the abundant side dish. the total absence of a tutorial in a title so difficult to master and open to the player's freedom is an unacceptable lack of attention But where do sailors go Needless to say, where do all those NPCs you meet once you set foot on land go? The third person view and the growth of your skills, which will directly affect your efficiency in the open sea, must not in fact mislead you: visiting cities is not only repetitive and boring but it also boils down to a dull and thoughtful play experience hastily. The non-player characters wander aimlessly as if in the grip of a senile failure of reason, animated to the bare minimum so as not to look like ventriloquist dummies. If it weren't for the missions that are just waiting to offer you, you would end up accessing the only buildings worthy of interest such as the tavern and the guesthouse through the appropriate menu, which you will do in any case in order not to traipse unnecessarily. Now, what to do with the crew in tow if not go to the boarding ships and ports, so as to justify a camera placed behind us: when the good star of the pirates lights up your fights you could in fact succeed in the complicated boarding maneuver, leaping on the enemy vessel with knife between teeth determined to bring back only the ship with its booty (enemies hanged, at sea or sold into slavery). Unfortunately, assaults as well as duels end up producing only a lot of keystrokes, not infrequently without much planning, with the aim of landing light, moderate and high-intensity hits (oh sure, you can shoot with a variety of shotguns and try the joker shot but you know how it is, by altering the order of the addends the result does not change). On paper it is a method that can retain a certain appeal but do not even think for a moment that you are facing Sword of the Samurai, here we are at the fencing school on the small field near the house. But where do sailors go Let's face it, we like naval combat so much that we would have gladly left these diversions aside in favor of efficient and non-redundant controls, so much so that even the ports we prefer to conquer them with cannon fire from the coast rather than go down to cut necks in person. Undoubtedly subduing an outpost is a feat, but think of how much it can benefit an aspiring pirate-imperialist to be able to manage the resources and construction of a commercial base. You got it right, we also find a touch of management in Age of Pirates, without infamy and without praise; it won't be of great depth but it won't be annoying either and it helps to immerse yourself in the shoes of the real Caribbean businessman. If you are one of those who like to hunt down your prey by calmly planning your moves, you will find that the single player experience offers many satisfactions; on the other hand you can always indulge in a little fun in multiplayer, comparing yourself in different competitive or cooperative modes, such as escorting a ship, although coordinating with your allies proves to be more difficult than it should be. if you are one of those who like to hunt down your prey by calmly planning your moves, you will find that the single player experience offers many satisfactions But where do sailors go It's a pity that a title like this, basically deserving under some points of view, should earn a place in the dubbing hall of shame, on which we cannot be silent: we can accept interpreters without personality but for no reason can we overlook the use of foreign dubbers for the Italian speech. If not even Half-Life 2 was spared from criticism, then Age of Pirates deserves the pillory. Beyond this, it enjoys little competition on the market and is therefore a good candidate for those who dream of adventures in open spaces. Unless someone wants to seize the opportunity and fill the gap. Final comment There is a good and healthy dose of freedom in Age of Pirates, above all the freedom to indulge in the exploration of the vast sea, sailing aimlessly towards adventure. When fate or the lust for wealth forces you to cross course with other ships, you will discover that the comparisons are real duels on the waves, where patience and foresight count. It is a pity therefore that the controls are so inefficient and frustrating and that the construction of a commercial empire must forcibly pass through action-adventure and role-playing elements unable to sustain the charm of the action that takes place between the oceans. A little more liveliness and a total dedication to the main aspect of Age of Pirates would have made it a small pearl, even if the melancholy sunsets and lonely seagulls open a pleasant summer window on the pressing winter. Pros A splendid sea Wide decision-making freedom Driving a galleon into battle is very rewarding Cons Terrible voice acting Mediocre alternative elements to the main gameplay Frustrating and confusing controls Piracy is not a crime It is strange that a figure like that of the pirate, who has now risen to the limbo of myth and legend, suffers from such neglect, it is almost a contradiction: in literature he ultimately remains marginal and within the videogame field there is no can certainly be considered inflated. To be honest today the only pirates a personal computer can boast of are those of Sid Meier, even if a lucky conjunction of marketing could launch the Age of Pirates here present to the attention of the public, which sails casually towards our monitors thanks also to the concomitant release in theaters of ~The Curse of the Dead Man's Chest~. Therefore, the big screen is always praised, although Age of Pirates still has more than one interesting aspect of its own, mainly sabotaged by the desire to put together too many styles of play that are not always adequately developed. On the one hand, in fact, it is an exciting strategic simulator of battles in the middle of the seas, in itself sufficient to keep it afloat, unfortunately interrupted by sessions that are a little adventure and a little RPG in comparison laughable, not to mention a hint of ~management~ barely comparable to the category. Fortunately, and it is its trump card, the Playlogic title does not force you in any direction, rightly defining itself as an open-end game. So let's not linger along the pier and set sail for that indefinite point on the horizon where the sea... all right, I'll stop, fire to the powder and high the Jolly Roger!.", "date": "2006-09-25", "grade": null}
