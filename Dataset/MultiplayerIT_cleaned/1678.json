{"name": "PcBasket2003 - La recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/pcbasket2003-la-recensione.html", "text": "Any Bloody Saturday Let's get to the actual game. You will have to manage any aspect of the life of a basketball club, both those related to sports management and economic ones. First of all you will have to choose a sponsor (which will join your team's name for the entire season) among some funny guys like Radio DeeJay or DemSoft itself. At that point all the possibilities offered by the game will open up to you. In the meantime, the management of the locker room; you will be able to decide from time to time which players to summon and of course the role and arrangement on the pitch, you will be able to entrust the team or individual players with a fair number of schemes (there is also a small section in which movies are displayed and you can create them new ones) and various indications. Then you will necessarily have to choose the training for your boys. You can choose 3 to a maximum of 3 daily sessions in which to focus on tactics (counter-attacks, perimeter play, etc.) or on athletic condition. You can train them in one-on-one, 3-point shooting or much more. If you need new players, you can find them in the appropriate section where you can search for one through special filters and put a scout on your tail. You can search for him directly by name and propose players or cash (or both) by proposing a meeting with the club concerned. Watch your budget, though! You can check it easily by checking income and expenses taking into account each entry. Naturally you will have access to various statistics screens with data relating to team and individual performances (which can also be activated through graphs). In addition to the national championships there are the National Cups, the European Cup and the European Super League, as well as the possibility of organizing friendlies. The game had some small technical problems which however seem to have been solved by the first patch (available on the DemSoft website) and now has excellent stability. The candies are finished The gameplay itself is quite convincing. The tactical changes during the games actually often give the idea of making some changes and also the 'chronology' of the game actions appears well paced and calibrated. The only thing that appears rather poorly studied is the fact that often the gaps between 2 teams in the score at the end of the game are really too large. Pass for the first game lost by 77 points, but then after an almost obsessive attention to detail and 2 narrow wins I won another one by 50 points and lost the last one by 39. Hopefully this will be fixed with a patch or , at worst, in the next edition of this title. In any case, continuing with the season, the situation has decidedly normalized, practically settling by itself. Unfortunately I witnessed another rather annoying bug (which seems to be fixing that too); the game stops automatically when a player is penalized for the fifth foul and until he is replaced, play cannot resume. Unfortunately playing in the German championship at one point meeting Bonn I noticed that a player was physically present 2 times (2 identical 'instances', not just the player, so much so that all the statistics - points, minutes played, fouls, etc - they go up at the same time) At that point when the player committed the 5th foul he was immediately replaced but the second 'instance' remained on the pitch blocking the resumption of the game without me being able to do anything. Conclusions In general, however, this PcBasket2003 really manages to entertain for what it offers, especially for the range of players it relies on. The simple implementation will probably discourage gamers who have very little to do with basketball but will certainly be appreciated by fans of this splendid sport. Pros: - Long-lived and fun - The first basketball manager (made in Italy) finally convincing - Large number of stats and options Cons: - A few bugs too many - Limited in career possibilities Software Brothers I rarely have to review an Italian production and I must say that it always fills me with a not indifferent parochial satisfaction. As you all know, I think the Bel Paese is far behind the rest of Europe (not to mention the USA and Japan) in terms of videogame culture. In Italy everything is more difficult; make a game, find someone to make it, and, no less, sell it. This means that the birth of Italian software houses is a very difficult and long process which often leads to considerable difficulties of various kinds. One of the youngest and most promising is undoubtedly quThis is DemSoft, almost at his absolute debut in the field but certainly with clear ideas since they have decided to concentrate almost entirely on this product. Certainly a demanding choice because, even if in Italy Basketball has an important following of practitioners and enthusiasts, it is already difficult (with the exception of the Champioship Manager) for the Italian people to get caught up in a football manager, let alone a basketball one. In reality PcBasket2002 achieved a moderate success both in terms of critics and in sales and the guys from the aforementioned Software House have recently given birth to the 2003 edition. Let's start as usual from what the eyes crave, or rather the graphic aspect of the title. Well, what can I say.. PcBasket2003 is a manager, therefore by definition more than meager in graphics. To be precise, it all boils down to menus and screens of static graphics of various types. Nothing more, nothing less, but basically that's all a manager needs. CM himself has never done otherwise, except for the newborn CM4 which also offers the possibility of watching the match with simple 2D graphics instead of the classic static screen. PcBasket will give you the opportunity to train 200 teams divided into 6 European leagues: Italy, Spain, France, Greece, Turkey and Germany. Let's begin to analyze the improvements and innovations compared to last year's version. First of all, an agreement was reached with LegaBasket which allowed programmers to use the real names of the players of 16 teams in our Serie A. Many leagues have been added and the possibility of changing teams in case of disagreements with the management. Furthermore, it is now possible for 4 players to play on the same PC and many Artificial Intelligence routines have been improved, with the addition of meetings between clubs to discuss the exchange or sale of one or more players.", "date": "2003-04-17", "grade": null}
