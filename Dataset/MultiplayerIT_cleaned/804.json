{"name": "Rag Doll Kung Fu - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/rag-doll-kung-fu-recensione.html", "text": "Style matters Already the movies suggest something of the general atmosphere that reigns starting Rag Doll Kung Fu: deliberately trashy and amateur to the core, they elicit more than a few laughs resulting surreal and absurd to the right point (some sequences are from anthology, other than the movies multi-billionaires of some ultra-pumped mega-productions). They look like the classic home videos shot with friends to have a laugh while watching them while sipping a beer, eating crap and swearing at each other. A real slap in the face to the aseptic and cold CG filmed sequences that have been infesting video games since the advent of the CD-Rom. But let's get to the actual game. At first you look at the screen disgusted and amazed at the same time. Who could have made such absurd characters? Great developers chase photorealism, does this game come with this kind of ultra-jointed puppets pretending to amaze? Yes. The first few minutes of the game are dramatic and will discourage more than a few players. You click with the mouse around the screen and on the character trying to figure out what to do. You try to follow the instructions given in the tutorial without being able to understand what our master wants from us. Meanwhile we observe the scenario that seems to come out of a puppet theater and sees 2D and 3D mixed in a rather ~acidic~ way. The colors look like those of an old photo, the various levels from which the environments are composed have different elements with different focuses, which suggest more a photographic composition than a video game scenario. And then there are the characters. Each click seems to correspond to some movement, maybe even launching themselves across the screen. But how to check them? Puppets The control system, in reality, is fairly complex despite being masterable in an excellent way. By clicking with the left mouse button on a limb of the character we control we will be able to move it to obtain various effects: by interacting with the legs we will be able to make it move or make it assume various positions (from the split to standing on tiptoe); by clicking on the hands we will be able to literally ~throw~ him around the screen making him make long jumps, or we will be able to make him collect objects and weapons; by clicking on the head we will instead be able to put it on its feet and make it do short hops. The basic problem is that to perform certain actions it will be necessary to make rather precise movements. For example, to eat a mushroom, click on the hand, bring the hand to the ground towards the mushroom, pick it up and drag it towards the mouth. We don't think it's correct to say it (and we'll soon deny it), but Rag Doll Kung Fu can essentially be considered a fighting game. But don't expect a clone of Street Fighter and associates. To hit your opponents you need to press the right mouse button so that arrows appear. By quickly rotating the mouse, the arrows will increase in thickness indicating the increased impact power of the blow, which will start when the button is released. But there are also other ways to strike; for example you can pick up a weapon and, by clicking on it with the left mouse button, perform a movement such that it ends up against the body of the unfortunate opponent; another way to remove energy from enemies is the indirect one, that is to exploit bombs or other passive weapons present in the scenario. To enrich the gaming experience there are decidedly strange situations. For example, you can make the character swallow many mushrooms so that he can fly in search of bright stars or butterflies. The only contraindication in doing this is that, if the swallowed mushrooms are too many, the character will start vomiting around the level. When it takes off, however, a series of decidedly acid effects will start to fill the screen and make our eyes roll. Contraindications Ragdoll Kung Fu is a game that cannot be placed within a precise category. It has platforming elements but it's not a platformer. It might seem like a fighting game (and so it seemed to us too) but who believes it given the game system? In some cases it might even look like a puzzle game... but it's none of that. Instead, we can consider it as a test of inspiration, a kind of pastime in which the developer has given his best by making full use of a technology (that of the ragdoll) exploited little and badly in large productions, in which it is only used as an aesthetic element that nothing entailed in terms of gameplay. Here, what is just a tinsel elsewhere becomes the fulcrum of everything, determining the most original game released in recent years. A real new experience that leaves spaceto the most varied interpretations. In some moments one gets the impression of being taken for a ride and of not really playing but rummaging in the developer's hallucinations; in other moments one has the impression of being faced with a brilliant work that almost requires contemplation. You can't even rely on the classic ~de gustibus~ because before trying it you won't be able to know if you'll love it or not, if you'll play it madly (a multiplayer mode is also available, perhaps a little too confusing... but, given the curve of general learning, all to be verified) or if you drop it immediately cursing the day you decided to download it from Steam. In short, Rag Doll Kung Fu is, above all, a way to play with the Rag Doll. Final comment Ragdoll Kung Fu will not receive a rating from this review. There is no point in giving it to him and, indeed, it would be almost a crime to do so. Thinking about what numerical value to assign to the game, I reflected on the fact that from 0 to 10 it could be given any vote while still managing to argue the reasons. It would make no sense to say that the game has bad graphics or that it has good graphics. Instead, it is necessary to make the concept of style preponderant and central. What's the point, on the other hand, of talking about playability when you find yourself fighting with a completely new and unprecedented control system? Is it more or less playable than what? At Tekken 5? To Super Mario Sunshine? to what else? If you decide to buy it, do it with the spirit of someone who is looking for something new and original, something they don't expect and that doesn't resemble anything they have already tried. If you are looking for discounted emotions forget it, you would only be greatly disappointed. Pros Original Has its own unique style Ingenious control system Cons Original Has its own unique style Ingenious control system Strange memories Initially, you are shocked. Before being able to understand the mechanics that regulate it, before being able to define precisely why some of our solicitations produce certain movements, before being able to enter the spirit of the most original game published in recent years, a general sense of estrangement it can strike the player accustomed to extremely tested and now considered classic game schemes (and which have not been modified for a long time in their structure... let's add). Rag Doll Kung Fu is a surprise in many ways. Its development is reminiscent of the old days of the eight bits where a single individual (in our case Mark Healey, a graphic designer who worked on the likes of Magic Carpet, Black & White, Dungeon Keeper and many others for Bullfrog before and for Lionhead then) made all aspects of a video game. There are still environments where this happens (especially in the world of freeware and shareware) but there are very few commercial titles made by a single person that can boast of a certain quality. Another peculiarity is the choice to distribute it only through Steam (Valve's platform), thus skipping all the classic distribution channels (ranging from shareware, still very widespread despite not being mentioned in Italy, to sale in shops).", "date": "2005-10-17", "grade": null}
