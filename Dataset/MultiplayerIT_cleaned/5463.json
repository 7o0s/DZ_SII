Hence, the release of Pixel Cup Soccer 16 on the App Store (and soon on PC) proves to be very welcome, even more so in a period full of important events such as the Copa America and the European Championship destined to glue many fans to their sofas . Pixel Cup Soccer 16 is a full-on arcade soccer game that lacks a bit of depth No fouls Pixel Cup Soccer 16 is a game that, as mentioned above, focuses on immediacy and ease of use. For this reason, the Uruguayan programmers of Batovi Games Studio have chosen to keep only the essence of the most loved sport in the world, removing all the elements of complexity or capable of slowing down the action. Therefore, in Pixel Cup Soccer 16 there are no offsides, much less fouls or free kicks: the only thing that can interrupt the furious exchange of passes and shots are therefore throw-ins, from goal or corners, which in any case only take a few moments to be archived. This immediacy is obviously also found in the control system, which is limited to offering the classic virtual stick to manage the movements of the players and two buttons respectively delegated to pass / change player and shot / tackle. Longer pressure on either side results in longer passes and more powerful shots. That's all. An extreme solution that makes Batovi's title absolutely inadvisable for sport purists or for those looking for an experience with a minimum of depth: on the contrary, Pixel Cup Soccer 16 represents instead an authentic pleasure for those who want to go back to the times coin-operated arcades and spend a few minutes in complete lightness. The rhythm with which matches unfold knows no moments of pause, and you can go in a second from your goalkeeper's goal to slotting the ball into the opponent's net with a bicycle kick. The most serious defect that we have encountered is undoubtedly linked to the behavior of the goalkeepers, often schizophrenic and capable of creating goals bordering on the tragicomic; although an improvement update of this aspect has been released, at present the situation is still far from fully resolved. Where perhaps more consistency could have been offered is in the animations, rather essential and limited, and perhaps by introducing a ~star~ player for each team capable of performing better shots than his teammates. On the contrary, in Pixel Cup Soccer 16 all the athletes are equal, and it is only the teams as a whole that present distinctive elements both in terms of quality and in terms of playing attitude. The latter are present in the form of national teams alongside a selection of club teams that ideally reproduce real teams (Tiki-Taka for example is, as you can easily guess, Barcelona, and so on). There are no licenses for real names, but considering the type of game it is certainly not a serious problem. The offer of available modes is quite structured, which in addition to single matches, training sessions and penalty kicks offers a series of different competitions and cups, although all a bit for their own sake and without a real sense of progression. Unfortunately, there is no real multiplayer, a rather serious factor for a sports title: the team has obviously received numerous requests in this sense and seems willing to introduce this mode in the future, but there is no certainty on the actual implementation and on the timing. Finally, moving on to the technical component, the name already suggests that Pixel Art is the master, offering a 16-bit style and a particularly pleasant cartoonish artistic direction, albeit a bit trivial and not very incisive in an absolute sense. In any case, it is a product that can be appreciated also from this point of view. The sale price is set at 2.99, certainly not a demanding figure but still higher than the standards of the App Store and not able to accommodate impulse purchases: it must be said that the absolute absence of in-app purchases deserves a praise, thus maintaining an experience consistent with the retro sources of inspiration also from this point of view.", "date": "2016-06-10", "grade": "7.6"}
