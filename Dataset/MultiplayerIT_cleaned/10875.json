This game doesn't need ~Once upon a time~ to be presented but ironically not everyone knows about Chrono Trigger and many will only get their first chance today to experience one of the greatest adventures of all time. Chrono Trigger is what is defined as a timeless classic, still today able to rival in quality and depth with more modern products, demonstrating that the usual clich about appearance that doesn't count is very true. And so, ladies and gentlemen, Chrono Trigger is a reality on the Nintendo DS. But if you've already played it and you're not nostalgic, feel free to close your browser. Stroll through time It is not easy to summarize the wonderful epic that is Chrono Trigger in a few lines, but we will try anyway, at least by telling how Crono, our young protagonist, met a beautiful blonde named Marle at the village festival and took her to see the attraction of childhood friend and scientist Lucca. Unfortunately, Lucca's latest invention doesn't work very well and Marle is transported to another era: and so Crono follows her to bring her back to safety, and right at that moment a temporal odyssey begins that will take our hero and his friends to travel from one era to another to hunt down an evil entity that threatens to annihilate the universe. Memorable the characters who will join our heroes, from the tender robot Robo to the swaggering cursed swordsman Frog, in an adventure so well written and designed that it leads to thirteen different endings, concluding it in various ways, perhaps experiencing the various changes that are possible bring to each age by acting in the past. And Chrono Trigger now enjoys not only the cartoon cutscenes that were a welcome addition to the PlayStation version, but also a brand new adaptation that corrects some inaccuracies of the original and more appropriately translates the expressions of certain characters, rejuvenating them and making them more fluid: unfortunately the texts are entirely in English, making the understanding of the complex plot rather difficult for non-English speakers. All the others however will also be able to enjoy a brand new ending, which finally builds a logical bridge between Chrono Trigger and the sequel Chrono Cross, released for PSOne years ago, to which it was connected, until now, in a rather nebulous way. The past is present Still today Chrono Trigger shows the muscles of a product so well thought out and structured that it appears young and lively despite its more than ten years of age. At the time the cartridge was practically revolutionary, and even today some mechanics do not appear naive or basic, but perfectly balanced and ingenious from the point of view of game design. The features provided by the additional functions of the Nintendo DS are very few, namely the possibility of viewing the actual game on the upper or lower screen while the other manages the menus and controls via touch-screen. Otherwise, Chrono Trigger has remained the same as it once was and still works wonderfully well, with its locations and dungeons to explore by solving puzzles (often through time) and fighting enemies, visible on screen and avoidable, with a non-existent transition between the battlefield and the playing area. The combat system is linear and intuitive, still perfectly functional in its simplicity yet full of elements that have been copied over the years, such as the combined attacks of the party members and the increasingly bizarre magic: in case you have deja-vu , the others imitated Chrono Trigger. In this edition for Nintendo DS, the game has an extra epilogue linked to an unpublished dungeon that clarifies some unclear moments of the story and a series of optional bonus missions, to these additions there is also the local multiplayer mode that allows you to clash previously captured monsters with those of another player: apart from the new dungeon with its ending (a must for bilogy lovers who will finally discover Magus' fate) the other additions are rather mediocre but the fact that they exist is undoubtedly a plus. The charm of vintage Square Enix's policy leaves us a bit perplexed: with the Dragon Quest trilogy technically updated to offer it to new players and a Final Fantasy IV totally reprogrammed in 3D, it is very unlikely that Chrono Trigger remained, pardon the pun, suspended in time. Yet not a pixel has been changed: Chrono Trigger is just like its SNES counterpart, so whatthe Squaresoft title could be considered a masterpiece, today it still defends itself very well but it certainly feels the weight of the years as regards animations and special effects, certainly made better in other products that fully exploit the capabilities of the Nintendo DS. Yet, despite its age, we are talking about a game that still offers one of the most imaginative worlds ever made, full of characters with a bizarre and captivating design (thanks to the artist Akira Toriyama, former author of Dragon Ball, in one of his best manifestations of creativity) and fascinating lands for all tastes; not to mention the musical accompaniment, the result of the talent of two of the most famous and loved composers in the world of Japanese video games: Nobuo Uematsu and Yasunori Mitsuda. And it is enough just to say this, to give the idea. Comment Considering the explicit praise or not in the body of the review, one would expect a comment that recommends its purchase without reservations, but in reality some criticism must be leveled: Square Enix has already been able to refresh from a technical point of view, more or less completely, products of a decade ago. It being understood that the graphics are not everything and that Chrono Trigger was already a masterpiece in 1996 and still remains so, it is sad to see how Square's efforts have been very few in the production of this port, which perhaps deserved more care. That said, those who have already played the Square masterpiece ten years ago and don't miss it can safely avoid it, all the others don't miss out on one of the best products in the history of video games. Pros Fourteen years and not hearing them Wonderful story and gameplay A new ending and several extras Cons It deserved a technical review Absent Italian translation", "date": "2009-02-16", "grade": null}
