{"name": "L'ultima difesa", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/132885-anomaly-defenders-lultima-difesa.html", "text": "Released in August 2011, Anomaly: Warzone Earth introduced revolutionary mechanics to the strategic tower defense subgenre, proposing an offensive approach in which the player managed mobile units on the map instead of towers, with a view to dynamic and strongly characterized by tactical elements. By pressing a button, it was in fact possible to pause the action at any time and change the path of the convoy, circling it in the role of a foot commander who had the task of releasing bonuses and upgrades of various types onto the ground. An original and effective formula, which has not surprisingly earned critical and public appreciation, and which has produced two more episodes over the years: Anomaly Korea and Anomaly 2. The latter has perhaps collected less than it actually deserved , considering the presence of the innovative mechanics relating to the ability of the vehicles to transform and therefore assume two different structures for resistance, attack and special abilities. Having explored the possibilities of the offensive approach in the strategic field far and wide, the developers of 11 bit studios have therefore decided to close the saga with a chapter that marks a sort of return to normality, and in which we put ourselves for the first time (multiplayer aside) in command of the alien towers, engaged in the last defense of their planet from the attack of the most dangerous race in the universe: humans. From the asshole side Illustrating how a classic tower defense works isn't complicated, and in the case of Anomaly Defenders we have a relatively linear campaign, made up of twenty-four increasingly difficult missions, in which the connotation of the scenarios, however, plays a key role. In fact, forget the ~corridors~ that you may be accustomed to organizing in other similar productions, because our human adversaries will sometimes be able to surprise us, changing the route of their incursions to attack and destroy the launching point, i.e. the last hope for the our race to survive by settling on another world. It is not a question of artificial intelligence, however: in that respect the work carried out by 11 bit studios disappoints, given that our opponents do not have that promptness that instead characterized human decisions in the previous chapters. However, it is impossible to organize the defense if not playing remittances, or waiting for the enemy troops to define their route and placing units accordingly. You can try to divert the attention of human beings by building resource extractors, devices that allow you to create and upgrade towers more quickly (together with energy, to be collected with a not so comfortable click every time we eliminate a vehicle), to attract them with a diversion and buy time, especially during the most complicated phases of each mission, when heavy vehicles take the field. From ours we will have a rich and multifaceted arsenal, with all those damned stations that in the past we used to curse and which now offer us their power instead, passing from the basic models to the more advanced and resistant ones, for a total of eight variants. To unlock them we will have to spend the technology points earned by completing the levels and proceed within an interesting tree structure, the ramifications of which can also substantially change our approach to battle. 11 bit studios closes the Anomaly saga with a ~normal~ episode, solid but not very inspired Too normal? To be the final episode of a rather significant saga in the panorama of strategic titles, Anomaly Defenders unfortunately presents itself in a sketchy way from a narrative point of view, introducing the story (the humans who, after years of harassment, decide to go and solve the problem of the invaders on their own planet, once and for all) but without delving into its aspects in any way. In short, what awaits us in the single player campaign is pure and simple gameplay, which this time is not accompanied by multiplayer modes but offers an above-average number of stages for the franchise. We cannot speak of a normal tower defense, given the interweaving of paths that also leads our strategy to be dynamic, to adapt quickly to situations and to make the most of the upgrades (which can be activated by clicking on each unit and spending part of the energy collection by eliminating opponents); however the revolutionary charm of the previous episodes inevitably ends up getting lost in a substantially traditional blend, which will make those who expected something new turn up their noses once againusual. Anomaly Defenders does not lack overall challenge and duration, especially in relation to a very accessible selling price, but the game seems to have been made with less care and passion than usual. Also from a technical point of view, given that the detailed settings and direction seen in Anomaly 2 are missing, and you have to be satisfied with design solutions that have basically already been seen, with the only positive note being a cinematic soundtrack, really beautiful and engaging .", "date": "2014-06-06", "grade": "7.0"}
