{"name": "Guitar Hero 3 - Recensione", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/guitar-hero-3-recensione.html", "text": "Sumptuous Track List To set up the Guitar Hero 3 concert, the developers have put together a series of legendary pieces, from rock to the most uncompromising metal, represented with special covers or with original songs, which this year are almost half. The selection is, without fear of contradiction, the richest ever seen in the series with songs in master version from sacred monsters such as Aerosmith, Rolling Stones, Living Color and Metallica, without forgetting those semi-unknown gems that have always been the juice of the saga ( to understand the difference compared to the past, just think that among the tracks to buy in the virtual shop there are pieces by Lacuna Coil and Kaiser Chiefs, which in past years would not have disfigured the main tracklist). The structure is always the same with the four difficulty levels on which it is possible to play the career, which consists of 40 songs divided into groups of 5 that must be performed perfectly to get the money to buy guitars, characters, clothes and songs. This time, the prize pool is unique for all difficulty levels and, while it is good because you can earn money for completing objectives with any setting, on the other hand the best ones will have to play even on Normal level to buy all items, since the money earned at one level is not enough. The balance has also been reworked, with the first two difficulty levels being more accessible than before, and with the last two making even the best sweaty and probably scaring the crap out of newbies. At an expert level, the three-note chords and the pull-offs and hammer-ons (legatos, i.e. the technique with which several consecutive notes can be played without ~strumming~), introduced with GH 2, are wasted right from the first songs and already from the first battle with Tom Morello you have to sweat the proverbial seven shirts. The most attentive connoisseurs of GH will be wondering what this ~battle~ is, and in fact it is one of the novelties of this episode, a novelty which, unfortunately, does not work very well. Every so many songs passed, you are confronted with a guitar hero (there are two real ones, Tom Morello and Slash of Guns 'n Roses/Velvet Revolver, and a fictitious one) who, before proceeding to the encore envisaged for that particular group of songs, challenges us to a guitar duel. Instead of the star power, which doubles the score multiplier in the normal mode, after a few sequences of well-chosen notes of this instrumental piece, you win weapons to hurl at your opponent (you make him jump a string, the vibrato lever or the 'amplifier) to disturb it and get the better of it. The problem is that it distorts the game and that it simply isn't very fun, also because at normal or medium level, the first one who starts throwing items usually wins, at difficult or expert level, instead, it's almost a lottery. The greater range of time that has been left to chain the hammer ons and pull offs helps, which makes the expert more digestible, but the feeling that, at times, impossible combos are hit by almost randomly pressing the keys does not escape. Which mortifies the best sensation of GH, which is to do exactly what the ears hear coming out of the speakers of the television or system. Another thing we noticed is that when you vibrate the notes with the lever to load star power faster, you get modulations practically always out of tune, or out of tune to be clearer. Which is rather annoying, especially when you find yourself performing them on historical pieces that are essentially wasted. Finally online After the excellent debut of the last episode, the cooperative mode returns, thanks to which two songs can be played, alternating between lead and rhythm guitar, or bass depending on the type of song. The most obvious difference is that now, after the end of a concert, there is no longer any distinction between the two players and it is no longer known how many points each of them brings home, which does not help to understand who needs to improve and in what. The career mode is also introduced, structured along the lines of the solo one, only which offers completely different songs for the encores. Some of these are among the best on the tracklist, with pieces by Red Hot Chili Peppers, Strokes and Beastie Boys, the problem is that to get them out, even to play them with a friend in a quick game, you must first unlock them in the co op campaign but you can't play it on Xbox Live. In short, if you don't have a friend to play with at home and with whom you can play your entire career, you can't listen to them, unless you play online, where they are still available. Yes, because the most awaited novelty of GH 3 is undoubtedly the online game that includes il co op, as mentioned, the challenge, the pro challenge (which forces both players to choose the same level of difficulty) and the battle, or the new mode that fights offline against the CPU, which however we believe will hardly receive a great success. The games we have played have been completely free from lag problems, even using the headset and talking to music while playing a co-op song, and it is certain that the longevity of GH 3, if we also consider the many download packages, which will be made available in the coming months, will skyrocket (on Wii it is not possible to download additional songs. While on PC and PS3, at least for now, there is no friend list support, so it is only possible to play against opponents random). New look Guitar Hero 3 has also changed the graphic style, more serious and stylish than the previous ones, with characters richer in polygons and with an excellent use of motion capture, which allowed perfect synchronization of the singers' lips on any piece. The only attributable defect is the noticeable slowdown of the game when the star power is activated, if there are many notes on the screen. In battles on the net, above all, this can have its weight leading to wrong notes at crucial moments. It is worth spending a few more words on the tracklist, which is truly exciting, also thanks to the success of the game which has undoubtedly inspired some of the greatest artists to indulge in this fun. Of course, hearing the voice of people like Steven Tyler or Mik Jagger coming out of your speakers, while climbing on the guitar, is a priceless feeling. As always, in the last set of songs there is a turn towards the most extreme metal to mangle your fingers by repeating  apparently  impossible sequences of notes ad libitum. Comment Neversoft tiptoes into the house left empty by Harmonix and does so leaving the jewel of the Activision house practically intact. There are some new features, which however do not always work, and the canonical list of music tracks, which this time is truly sumptuous. With an even more accessible base difficulty and a truly challenging Expert level, Guitar Hero III will give great satisfaction to the many enthusiasts who follow the saga with dedication, and who may begin to wonder if it's not the case to be more daring with the next chapter. PC, PS3 and Wii users, who have never played the previous episodes, can raise their vote by 1000 points (!) and rush to buy, even if the online modes of their versions are less complete than the console one Microsoft. Because Guitar Hero is an experience that any music lover should try. Pros The best track list of the saga Always fun The network game Cons that the co-op campaign is not allowed Some slowdowns Lack of real news PC version With this third chapter, Guitar Hero finally becomes available on PC too, where until now there were only freeware clones that were certainly welcome but of dubious quality. The port made by Aspyr of Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock is 99% identical to the console counterparts, both graphically and in terms of playability. The system requirements aren't very high, and even a medium-low-end PC won't present any problems. In the test configuration, Guitar Hero III ran smoothly at 1920x1200 without ever dropping below 45fps. Furthermore, since the game is installed on a hard disk, the loads are faster than on consoles. As far as additional downloadable content is concerned, it seems that this PC version doesn't enjoy the same benefits as its console counterparts, and still wouldn't be ready for release any extra songs. Unlike the other versions, the bundled guitar is not wireless and takes up the design of the Gibson X-plorer of Guitar Hero II for Xbox 360. Xbox 360 - Goals GH 3's 1000 points are divided into 59 achievements that will take quite a while to unlock. Mainly because some are related to the co-op campaign that cannot be played online and because many require you to complete the solo career on all difficulty levels, including those that involve buying items at the shop. To understand this, finishing the game at any of the levels leads to earning no more than a hundred points.", "date": "2007-11-21", "grade": null}
