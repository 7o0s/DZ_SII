Tested version: Xbox 360 Puddle seems to dictate the return of the old concept of downloadable game, as in the days of the first Live Arcades, characterized by well-defined contents and an immediacy that has been lost over time, almost as if to chase after the standard of the retail market even on digital delivery platforms. Ready to go, stripped of every frill, starting from every form of tutorial, the creation of Neko Entertainment betrays under its apparently superficial immediacy a profound gameplay that revolves around a simple idea: to move and slide a quantity of liquid through some intricate paths up to the end of the level, a philosophy of the classic platform set in an atypical puzzle-game. Watch out for waste The starting point around which, it should be said, Puddle revolves is that of influencing the movements of various types of liquids by not interacting directly with them, but by tilting the entire game scenario clockwise or counterclockwise through the use of two dorsal triggers: these are the only controls required. The levels develop around this simple and intuitive principle, through which we are called to guide various types of substances, all endowed with particular abilities and weaknesses as well as presenting different parameters of sliding and inertia on the surfaces. Starting with common water subject to easy evaporation, substances more difficult to manage such as molten metal at risk of condensation, unstable nitroglycerin, corrosive acid or flammable liquid will be added. However, the real protagonist of the game is the level design which offers a chain of tortuous paths full of obstacles specifically designed based on the characteristics of the liquid used, as well as presenting hidden shortcuts that are anything but easy to identify. The completion of each level focuses on being able to maintain a minimum amount of liquid required until the end of each path and based on a relationship between the amount saved and the time taken, you have access to medals that give access to unlockable extras. What is initially unsettling is the way in which the game catapults you into the first path without offering you any indication, all of this translates into an immediate understanding of the simple mechanics, simple but not flat or easy to metabolize, especially when doing it the masters will be the promptness of reflexes and the in-depth knowledge of the route. The average challenge level of Puddle is already on average high from the beginning, to this is added the impossibility of having an initial overview of the entire level before starting the ~race~ with our puddle and the absence of intermediate checkpoints, it follows that the game structure is strongly focused on trial & error (complete with a conspicuous count of attempts at the beginning of each restart), a feature that less patient players could be translated into premature frustration. To meet these needs there is the possibility of skipping the offending route by resorting to a real ~whining~, a solution which however precludes obtaining extras as well as being numerically limited, in fact after resorting to this not very honorable shortcut twice within the same set of levels you will need to complete previously skipped paths to be able to call upon this aid again. Even from this we understand how Puddle, despite its essential and simplistic presentation, is not a game that gives gamers too many discounts while giving great satisfaction to the more patient among them. Xbox 360 goals Puddle offers 12 goals for the standard 200 points. Completing the game with all 48 gold medals will net you just 45 points, split between two objectives. The other achievements can be obtained by finding shortcuts and through some pipes with liquid details during the boss levels. Essential enough To offer an interesting variable to the usual scrolling of the levels we think of some kind of bosses, represented by patterns marked by a countdown where it is necessary to fully exploit the peculiarities of the liquids to get the better of certain devices or peculiar situations on which we leave you the pleasure of surprise. Surely these well-balanced variants in their originality represent very pleasant diversions, however, always consistent with the mechanics and style of the entire production. The visual impact of Puddle is reduced to a minimum, where the scenario is always hinted at and thereand structures and the characters represented in the form of black silhouettes against the light, a choice that demonstrates its usefulness during the most demanding game sessions where the choice to give greater prominence to the structures of the levels in the foreground and in particular to the obstacles on the way they help the player a lot in managing the liquid. This does not justify a tendential poverty from a strictly technical point of view, where the rendering of flames and liquids appears anything but realistic, especially in the physics of the movements even if these dynamics are well functional to the excellent gameplay, while pleasant and never invasive it is the sound accompaniment. The ~Laboratory~ mode deserves a separate mention, a real space in which to freely experiment with the behavior of substances and eventually build new paths. Initially this space will struggle to demonstrate its potential since most of the items that can be used to fill the Laboratory must be unlocked during the completion of the classic levels but once you have a good amount of items available this mode can be an enjoyable addition which also benefits the already excellent longevity of the game.", "date": "2012-02-16", "grade": "7.8"}
