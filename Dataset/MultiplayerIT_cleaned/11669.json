{"name": "Holy Wars: Sons of Enoch", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/holy-wars-sons-of-enoch.html", "text": "In a period of rediscovery for mobile role-playing games, In-Fusio has tried to mix some of the typical elements of this genre with the classic mechanics of scrolling beat 'em ups. The result is precisely this Holy Wars: Sons of Enoch, basically an action game in which you have to move from one location to another to talk to the various characters, buy weapon upgrades but above all fight a large number of enemies, who also reappear after being eliminated. The early stages of the game see us wandering within the borders of our kingdom, with the invaders now upon us and ready to conquer: we will have to thin their ranks and defeat their commander to gain access to a map that will allow us to move to other areas. The fights are the absolute protagonists of the game, also because it is through the clashes that we can level-up the character: each eliminated enemy translates into a certain number of experience points, as in any RPG, and often and willingly releases weapons that we can collect and make our own. By opening the inventory, in fact, we have the option of choosing one of the swords or axes and assigning two of them to the available slots, changing between the first and second weapon during the action by simply pressing the 0 key. The mechanics of the clashes are rather simple, even if the developers have done everything possible to make it varied: repeatedly pressing the 5 key starts a different combo depending on the sword in use, while holding down the same key puts our warrior in a defensive position. By pressing in one direction twice in a row, we will be able to run and carry out a charging attack, which is really effective because it manages to break the enemy's guard. The functions of the inventory, otherwise, are the usual: storage of key items (which can be used when needed) and supplies, with an overview of the characteristics of the character. As soon as we get hold of a map, we will be able to move from the first location to the others available in the game, moving an indicator that can incur in the classic ~random clashes~ (from which, if desired, we can also subtract). The technical implementation is excellent, and allows this new In-Fusio product to compete with the best scrolling fighting games in the mobile sector: the characters are well designed, with a good level of detail and well done animations. The enemies tend to repeat themselves in appearance, even if there are some variations that improve the situation, primarily the bosses. The scenarios show good use of color and manage to be varied enough not to get bored immediately. The sound sector has a series of well-made music, which manages to accompany the various phases of the action in the best way. As far as the control system is concerned, there isn't much to report: very few keys are used, so you can play very quickly and there are no problems of any kind.
