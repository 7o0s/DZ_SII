To do this, in addition to directly managing the growth of villages and displaying his warrior skills in the field, he will also have to use the art of diplomacy to unite the various governors of the area by his side. In the previous lines, I have just described the gameplay of the new Settlers: an RTS decidedly influenced by titles such as Warcraft 3 and Kohan 2 in which, however, there are still some references to the tradition of the series such as, for example, the collection of various natural elements (iron, stone, clay, sulfur and wood), the care in designing homes and farms numerically adequate for the inhabitants of our village, the development of technology with the usual tree branches, the decisions regarding taxes (as you can see, the problem goes far beyond current events) and diplomacy with neighboring villages. For the rest, however, L'Eredit dei Re moves on coordinates much closer to the titles already mentioned: the presence of the immortal heroes (at most they can pass out for a while), a decidedly wider war component, the development of a plot all 'inside the missions themselves with sub-quests to be carried out that closely resemble the very recent strategic fantasy games. A small innovation has been inserted with regard to atmospheric agents: in practice, if for example we find ourselves on a mountain where it is snowing profusely, our troops will move with greater difficulty and therefore more slowly. Nothing transcendental but it still seemed legitimate to point it out. We are faced with a pleasant product which at times reaches excellent qualitative peaks but which in general suffers from a certain push and pull between the tradition of the series and innovative ambitions The final result of this alchemy then? In my opinion, we are dealing with a pleasant product which at times reaches excellent quality peaks but which in general suffers from a certain push and pull between the tradition of the series and innovative ambitions. Thus, with a simplified interface and a greater tendency towards action, it was decided to maintain a decidedly more staid rhythm compared to that of the latest generation RTS. The uniqueness of Heritage of Kings is therefore a double-edged sword: it will be able to fully convince you precisely because of its diversity, but at the same time leave both lovers of the saga with a bitter taste for how it was until the fourth chapter , and the lovers of the most immediate strategic games. New for the series is also the use of a completely three-dimensional graphics engine (modified and personalized version of the Criterion Renderware) which impressed me favorably in the field test both for its absolutely high-level visual quality (beautiful weather effects and light, the animations, the textures of the buildings that remained of good quality even zooming to the maximum) and both for a lightness in terms of hardware requests, now almost out of the norm. Even with a machine not far from the minimum hardware requirements, the game, with a good autosetting, did not present frame rate problems even in the most agitated situations. Other praises go to the sound sector, in equal measure for the melodious and epic medieval component in the right places and for the localization in Italian which, even if it does not reach very high quality peaks, proves to be dignified and discreet throughout the playful experience. The multiplayer of Settlers A component for playing in company (up to a maximum of 6 belligerents) via local network or Internet is also inevitable in The Legacy of the Kings. There are three ways to confront each other in the Middle Ages of Blue Byte. Conquest is the simplest type: it involves destroying the headquarters of all opponents. In Race for Technology, on the other hand, we will have to develop all the technologies available at the college before our opponents. In this case it will be possible to play in teams and better divide the research to be done. Clearly this is the most interesting mode for those who are more inclined to the management genre. Finally, in Scots Match, over the course of an hour of play, victory will go to whoever is able to win the most points, points that will be awarded for victories on the warfield, for research and for upgrading structures. Latest notes for the various game modes: if for multiplayer you will find a box ain this regard, I point out that the campaign unfolds over 20 missions that require a good number of hours for their completion (also and above all due to the staid pace we talked about previously). Same number of maps available for skirmish while unfortunately an editor is completely absent. Comment Legacy of Kings marks a clear distinction from the now classic saga of Settlers. The fifth installment of the series is decidedly different from its precursors and approaches coordinates more similar to titles such as Warcraft 3 and Kohan 2. Of course, the management of the villages is more complex than the two RTS just mentioned but the clear simplification of this is clear I wait to give space to the war component. The final result? A pleasant product that at times reaches excellent qualitative peaks but which in general suffers from a certain push and pull between the tradition of the series and innovative ambitions. Thus, with a simplified interface and a greater tendency towards action, it was decided to maintain a decidedly more staid rhythm compared to that of the latest generation RTS. The uniqueness of Heritage of Kings is therefore a double-edged sword: it will be able to fully convince you precisely because of its diversity, but at the same time leave both lovers of the saga with a bitter taste for how it was until the fourth chapter , and the lovers of the most immediate strategic games. Certainly, this Settlers has two objectively positive elements on its side: an excellent 3D graphics engine, capable of running without problems even on not too powerful PCs and a price ( 19.90) even lower than the average for a budget title. An aspect that is anything but to be underestimated. Pros: Good audiovisual technical realization Ultra budget price An RTS slightly out of the standard canons but... Cons: It may not be appreciated for this very reason Game rhythm too staid at times Fans of the series will certainly speak of ~betrayal~ Guys, how time flies! It seems to me almost yesterday when Settlers ran for the first time on my faithful Commodore Amiga and today I'm here to talk about the fifth chapter of the Blue Byte series. That it is the fifth ~settleroso~ title cannot be deduced directly from the cover of the game, given that the numerical reference has not been highlighted in any part of the packshot or even in the game itself. The choice was by no means accidental: Legacy of Kings definitely distances itself from the legacy of its prequels and in addition to presenting a completely 3D graphics engine for the first time, it has moved to coordinates closer to RTS such as Warcraft 3 and Kohan 2. But let's take a small step back now", "date": "2005-03-10", "grade": null}
