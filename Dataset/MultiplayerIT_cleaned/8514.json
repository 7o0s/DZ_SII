Kotomon ends up in the second category, having been developed by a new independent team formed however by veterans from Q Entertainment: the developers of Monstars Inc. show off in their curriculum pearls such as Rez, Child of Eden and Lumines, and it was therefore obvious that from their debut title on mobile great things were expected. Too bad things didn't go as planned. Stars that don't shine As a plump red alien, the player's goal is to lead a series of small spherical creatures to a sort of enclosure at the other end of the level, sometimes picking them up by the hand, sometimes throwing or calling them. There are spheres to roll and enemies to get rid of, and in general the impression is of being in front of a sort of mix between Pikmin and Katamari set in a fascinating space scenario. So far nothing to object, and indeed the conditions for an intriguing Q Entertainment-style game are all there, but as soon as you put your fingers on the touchscreen, all the developers' work collapses and breaks into a thousand tiny pieces. The main flaw, you may have imagined, concerns the control system: through a virtual stick on the screen, the player is able to move his avatar, while a simple touch allows him to launch an object or a creature previously collected. It is clear that the team's intentions were to make everything very intuitive and usable even with one hand, but the effect obtained is exactly the opposite due to a bad realization. In fact, the stick follows the player's finger throughout the screen, proving to be annoying and cumbersome in many levels: specifically, since the player is given too much freedom of movement, it often happens that the view is obstructed by the thumb, or in any case forced to reposition the finger for one reason or another. Being able to align correctly also presents an additional challenge when having to use your companions as projectiles, and the imprecision of the controls leads to repeated attempts. Already from the first levels it happens to die often due to an unfortunate mix between uncomfortable controls and a mediocre camera, and considering that a single shot is enough to leave us pens, it is easy to realize how frustrating Kotomon can become in the more advanced levels, when that is you're dealing with traps, lava, and other environmental obstacles. The aforementioned camera also proves to be a ball and chain in the search and collection of alien creatures, since the view too close to the protagonist often makes them invisible and difficult to find; add their tendency to leave you for a walk and Monstar Inc.'s game loses every ounce of appeal it has left. It's a real shame, because otherwise the game looks good, with a pleasant aesthetic and a sound component that goes well with the magical universe created by the developers, both in terms of music and sound effects that accompany the collection of items or the player's footsteps. In addition to the aesthetics, there were several interesting ideas at the base, and the possibility of rolling Katamari balls or going in search of small Pikmin-style creatures loudly ask for a decent control system and a better camera.", "date": "2012-05-28", "grade": "4.5"}
