Evidently attracted by the good earnings that can be made in today's mobile market, Ibra has decided to take over the ISBIT development team and to commission a video game that sees him (obviously) as the absolute protagonist: here comes this Zlatan Legends, a title that it has nothing to do with football played and in which Ibrahimovic is summoned by none other than the emperor of the universe to confront his alter-egos from parallel worlds in a sort of futuristic pinball machine... Humility, intensity, credit card The real or presumed delusion of omnipotence that Ibra has never hesitated to make public also emerges with great force in Zlatan Legends, which depicts the Manchester United player as a sort of semi-divinity venerated in all corners of the cosmos: a sweet treat for the fans more passionate than the talented attacker, but at the same time an ostentation difficult to digest for more moderate users, given that the title seems to take itself damn seriously without leading to a ridicule that would have helped to lighten the situation. Going to the actual game, Zlatan Legends is configured as an action game with a quite original structure: the goal is to reach the finish line as quickly as possible, kicking a ball within two-dimensional paths that develop in vertical. You hit the ball by holding down a finger on its position on the touch screen and swiping in the opposite direction to the desired one, with the power determined by the extent of the swipe; at any time it is possible to touch the sphere to hit it again and make it change trajectory, being careful not to touch the blue edges (which cause a momentary stop of motion) and instead aiming to ring combos by bouncing off the yellow walls, passing over boosts and collecting bonuses. A gameplay that is also valid - although fundamentally very limited and tending to quickly become repetitive - but which is literally drowned by the insane amount of gimmicks used by ISBIT to try to extort money from the user. There are all, absolutely all the systems that have contributed to making free to play such a mistreated category: energy that is reduced with each game, chests that contain random power-ups, double in-game currency rigorously extremely difficult to accumulate only thanks to one's own skills and - dulcis in fundo - many nice bottlenecks made on purpose to penalize ~normal~ users and pave the way for premium ones. All exposed through a spasmodic amount of menus, tabs and indicators that waste entire minutes between level increases, collection of resources and application of upgrades that little or nothing affect the gameplay itself, which sadly ends up in the background occupying a fraction of the time spent with the application. In short, ISBIT and Ibrahimovic should review what is the definition of ~game~, because it is certainly not what is offered by Zlatan Legends here. Even potentially interesting aspects such as the personalization of the protagonist and the possibility of competing with the times of other players sadly fade in the face of the little space granted to the gameplay in favor of completely accessory elements. It's okay that mobile gaming isn't charity, but we've definitely gone too far here.", "date": "2017-08-30", "grade": "5.0"}
