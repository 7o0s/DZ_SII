{"name": "Civilization", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/civilization.html", "text": "Let's get civilized Released in the distant 1991 on PC, Civilization proved to be an incredibly profound product for the time, offering the user the possibility of managing nothing less than an entire civilization, starting from its beginnings, in an attempt to bring it to dominate the entire surface terrestrial (and not only). The exceptional gameplay quality of Sid Meier's work, confirmed by two excellent sequels, has allowed Civilization to enter the Olympus of video games, guaranteeing itself the deserved merit of representing the paradigm for all similar products that followed its release . The decision to convert the title to N-gage, from this point of view, is more than legitimate: if you really need to fill a gap within a playful offer, it is right to do it with the best exponents of the genre. At the same time, however, Civilization brings with it a whole series of features that are difficult to manage via a handheld, making the risk of a game structure simply too cumbersome to be enjoyable concrete. Fortunately, after a careful analysis of this conversion by Gryphondale Studios, we can state that Sid Meier's masterpiece, albeit with a certain initial effort, can be played more than discreetly even on N-Gage. The control system has been designed in such a way that the directional cross moves the cursor while the keyboard is dedicated to movement in the eight directions of the various units and to the opening of the various menus: the presence of a whole series of shortcuts alleviates the inevitable cumbersomeness of a device that is definitely not suitable for the purpose, but which in any case performs well within the limits of its potential. On the other hand, some textual menus raise some more perplexities, sometimes unclear in illustrating the possibilities of interaction by the user. And effectively all of this Civilization for N-Gage assumes that the player already knows its playful mechanics, offering neither tutorials nor explanatory windows: an obstacle to report to all those who have never had anything to do with the work by Meier. The new advancing Having established the compatibility of Civilization gameplay with N-Gage hardware, let's now quickly deal with the actual game. As mentioned, the user can choose one of the 21 civilizations made available and then begin the long journey towards world supremacy: this goes through a whole series of factors including the exploration of the scenario, the construction and management of cities, the direction and support of scientific-technological research and obviously the control of situations of belligerence between one's own forces and those of the enemy. All punctuated by a classic turn-based system that gives balance and composure to one of the most complete play structures in the strategic panorama: the greatest strength of Civilization lies in fact in the extraordinary ability to embrace and harmoniously unite all these different aspects of running a civilization. A scheme that works perfectly despite the enormous amount of time that has elapsed since the progenitor's release and the anomalous platform on which he found himself this time. Passed the quality control regarding the pure and simple gameplay, Civilization shows sufficient merits to be promoted without reservations also from a technical point of view. Graphically, as can be expected, the title does not amaze with special effects or amazing 3D constructions, but presents a two-dimensional cosmetic as simple as it is functional and all in all pleasant: and despite the small size of the N-Gage screen, icons, writings and signs are always clearly visible and distinguishable from each other. The sound, on the other hand, is really reduced to a minimum, but honestly you don't even miss it. A final consideration should instead be addressed to the lack of any online functionality, justified by the developers as a consequence of the total inspiration from the second chapter of the series. Comment Civilization is a good conversion for N-Gage, both because it covers one of the deepest gaps in the console, and because it does so while remaining extremely faithful to the original game, adapting its structure as painlessly as possible to the technical characteristics of the handheld. Of course, the somewhat awkward and cumbersome aspects are not lacking in this incarnation of Sid Meier's masterpiece by Gryphondale, but all in all they are endemic defects not entirely attributable to the development team. However, what remains is a complete, deep and decidedly enjoyable strategy, capable of capturing for hours but also suitable for short game sessions in your spare time. Pro Deep and addictive gameplay Huge longevityFaithful conversion to the original Cons Some mechanical and uncomfortable aspect Rather difficult for beginners No online mode N-Gage, like the vast majority of portable and home consoles, is certainly not one of the most fertile soils for strategic titles in the strict sense, those that historically are the semi-exclusive prerogative of the PC sector. Leaving aside the products with a war background that deal with the tactical management of a team in a battle scenario (this is the case of Pathway to Glory), the lack of real strategic finds its main reasons in the differences between console and PC users and above all in the real abyss that separates the convenience of using a pad from the mouse + keyboard combo. In light of these facts, the presence of a name like Civilization in the latest N-Gage releases can only arouse curiosity...", "date": "2006-02-09", "grade": null}
