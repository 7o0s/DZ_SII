An excellent sequel, the conversions for several other consoles after the company's transformation into a multiplatform publisher and a less convincing third chapter exclusive to Xbox and PC helped keep the name of Crazy Taxi alive and well, which however has never been recovered for a new episode proper. Until today... Crazy Taxi: City Rush arrives on smartphones abandoning much of the original formula Crazy Taxi: City Rush is in fact the name behind which the return to the scene of the franchise is hidden after this interminable wait, this time placed in the hands of the English team Hardlight, already author of Sonic Dash and Sonic Jump. The ~problem~ is that it's free to play for mobile devices, and you control it like an edless runner. If you have recovered from the shock and have begun to breathe again with normal regularity, you can continue reading, with the knowledge that there is no way to make the pill sweeter: City Rush is an episode of Crazy Taxi very different from the previous ones , which attempts to adapt, or rather rework an ~ancient~ concept to the mechanics and logic of modern gaming. The most intransigent players loyal to the good old days will no doubt refuse to touch Crazy Taxi: City Rush even with a stick, for sure; the most curious, or simply those who for personal reasons have never known the original series, however, will be able to find in this SEGA production a pleasant, interesting title, certainly not disrespectful of their roots or vulgar. Also because Kenji Kanno, the ~father~ of Crazy Taxi, was involved in the development; and could a parent ever want the harm of his own child? Of course not. We were talking about the differences between this new episode and the originals, but let's start with the similarities first: obviously the taxi remains the protagonist, as well as the need to transport passengers to certain destinations within a set time, breaking any possible and imaginable road code. So if at a glance Crazy Taxi: City Rush doesn't seem so far from the progenitor, in reality it takes a few moments to understand how much the formula has been revised, starting with the control system. In fact, with a not too common choice, Crazy Taxi: City Rush can be played both by holding your device horizontally and vertically: this is because the input system requires the use of only one finger to drive your vehicle, even if ~ drive~ is not exactly the right term. In fact, the taxi accelerates automatically and it is not possible to brake, reducing the player's effort to only passing the lane of the roadway via swipe, exactly like the endless runners like Subway Surfers just to understand. To turn, however, the finger on the side of the screen must be held down for a few moments in the direction in which you want to go, while to stop the run once you reach your destination, you need to make a few quick taps. A swipe from top to bottom then allows you to make a 180-degree change of direction, while the only on-screen button allows you to spend one of the available turbos. The desire to keep the game formula as compact as possible, with an extremely short mission structure, has also substantially led to the elimination of the entire exploratory component: if in the past most of the fun was in inventing shortcuts and alternative ways to lead to destination its customers, here the possibilities for variation are practically eliminated. We were talking about the missions, each of which ~costs~ a part of the fuel available: once finished, to restore it it is necessary to spend diamonds, or watch advertising videos, or finally simply wait a few minutes. Diamonds and dollars are the two in-game currencies, which are linked to the possibility of buying new taxis, upgrading them mechanically (to go faster) or modifying them to an aesthetic one (to earn more money). By completing the missions you can earn both, but obviously, as often happens in the freemium field, by putting your wallet in your hand you can buy different quantities to reduce the effort and grinding, which becomes particularly noticeable with theand missions needed to unlock the other game locations. Spending some real money also allows you to eliminate the too invasive advertising in the game, which often interrupts the games with promotional videos. The graphic component is good, colorful and characterized by a pleasant style; adapts the soundtrack which, even without the peaks of the unforgettable contribution of the Offspring, counts on songs by independent American pop punk bands.", "date": "2014-08-06", "grade": "7.2"}
