This third episode however, it took both the insiders and the most die-hard fans by surprise: hastily presented at the end of February, it is now ready to be installed on the hard drives of PCs (the platform on which it was designed), Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The long introduction is divided into two phases: in the first, lasting a few minutes, the protagonist experiences a dream in which his vessel is boarded by a ghost ship; awakened from the nightmare he will land on the Crab Coast in search of a treasure together with his sister Patty, an acquaintance of Dark Waters. Once he reaches the chest, however, he will be overwhelmed by a dark skeleton (a ~Shadow~) who will steal his soul. Only a few days after the burial, the young son of the pirate Silverbeard will be unearthed by Bones, a former pirate who has also returned from the underworld. From this moment begins the insidious adventure of a new unnamed (the hero of the previous two episodes can still be met in our wanderings) who, as always in the opening bars, represents an empty shell to be filled. If the incipit arouses more than a few perplexities in its speciousness (and it is not surprising, considering the tradition of the Piranha Bytes), the story acquires bite as you continue in the main quest. We will therefore discover that the world has now been abandoned by the gods and that it will be up to the player to put an end to the threat posed by the Titans, while trying to recover the soul that was stolen from him. It is not necessary to have played the previous episodes to understand what is happening, even if the references to the past are still very strong and certain situations can only be fully appreciated by those who have followed the saga since 2009, the year of its debut. The plot is told through sharp dialogues filled with colorful expressions which, albeit in an unorthodox way, manage to involve the player, snatching a few laughs on more than one occasion. Once you set sail from the Costa dei Crabs you will be spoiled for choice of destination: in fact, there are seven other islands literally full of quests to solve and places to explore, as well as obviously dozens of enemies to knock out. The elements in common with the first two titles are numerous, even if it seems that with Titan Lords the programmers wanted to press the reset button (it is no coincidence that the choice to introduce a new hero marries this philosophy), while keeping some characteristic features on one side of the first chapter (such as the need to join one of the three game factions) and taking up from the other the good things that had been praised (such as the pirate settings and the irreverent plot) of the unfortunate Dark Waters. As mentioned, during the game it is necessary to embrace one of the three guilds that vie for dominion over the sea: that of magicians, guardians and demon hunters. Each of these brings a series of exclusive skills and armor that help shape a character in one direction rather than another, but the choice of one does not prevent access to secondary missions linked to those that had been decided to discard. Risen 3 revives the fortunes of the saga, addressing longtime fans The game world The Caribbean islands of Risen 3 are undoubtedly fascinating and characterized by truly enchanting views: the creativity of the graphic designers who have been able to exploit a common basic setting to create even very different locations deserves to be commended. There is therefore no shortage of ruins, caves, mines, castles and dungeons of all kinds - inevitable scenarios in any self-respecting role-playing game; however the designers have much preferred the exteriors, given that it will very rarely be possible to slip into any structure. The dimensions of the maps are generous, and it can take several hours to explore all of them. Fortunately, there are expedients that avoid tedious wanderings from one bank to the other: in fact, one can transform oneself into fast parrots or use teleportation portals (which must be activated in advance with special stones) which allow one to quickly reach key locations even if, at least in the initial bars, there will be a lot of work to do. The protagonist can run for short distances before depleting an invisible reserve of energy; unlike the past can inoother than climbing and swimming. The interaction with the environment is considerable, and as usual there will be a plethora of plants to collect, minerals to extract and chests to break into. The NPCs are mainly found in the two or three inhabited centers that characterize each island, and with almost each of these it is possible to dialogue; however, there will be characters scattered along the paths ready to provide us with secondary missions. Usually there are a couple of key figures to advance in the main plot: they will provide us with the quests necessary for the continuation of the adventure, but the player can easily avoid taking them into consideration right away, thus favoring the development of the hero. The nature of the missions is quite varied, even if some of them tend to look a bit alike: a largely forgivable defect considering the enormous quantity. To give the reader an idea, it is enough to know that, after about ten hours of play, the writer had completed about forty sidequests scattered between two of the eight islands of Risen 3, moreover without having yet decided which faction to side with. There are even small puzzles to solve that break the adventurer's routine from time to time. A few flaws too many The combat system is part of the long tradition of the German developer and is as always characterized by a strong action component and above all by the need to orchestrate the sequence of parries, dodges and attacks with the right rhythm, despite the fact that in Risen 3 the rhythms have been made a little less frantic and confusing. The commands are basic: the left click of the mouse allows you to launch a more or less powerful blow depending on how long you hold down the button; with the right you perform the parries while with a double pressure of the arrow keys you perform an evasive somersault. The possibility of combining the ~light~ sabers by chaining them up to three consecutive shots of increasing power, and of alternating the white weapon attacks with those of pistols and magic makes the fights very technical. Of course, those who prefer can also use a firearm as a main offensive tool: in this case the reload times have been replaced by a circular counter that fills up faster the higher the character's level. Especially in the initial stages you will notice a significant diachrony between the click of the mouse and the actual realization of the action on the screen: however, this lag tends to decrease as the level of the character increases, but without ever disappearing completely. It is a very precise choice that requires the player to carefully study, even in the most advanced stages of the adventure, the movements of the opponents in order to be able to circumvent them appropriately. Against some enemies, for example, parries will be practically useless, while powerful blows (which seem to be a legacy of the ~illegitimate~ heir Arcania) will be ineffective against others. In the combat system of the Piranha Bytes, however, there seems to be a flaw of no small importance: the evasive somersault is a device that always allows you to escape attacks, and even if you are hit during a rotation, there would be no effect on the health of the protagonist . Lacking a ~stamina~ bar that prevents unlimited use, it is clear that this unfortunate choice leads to the abuse of the famous ~hit-and-run~ tactic: you hit an enemy, walk away with a bicycle kick and return to hit. In principle, the most demanding battles take place when you find yourself surrounded by three or more opponents: in these, the absence of a block of vision on a single rival weighs negatively, with the result that often and willingly you find yourself leave alive an enemy who only needs one hit to fall lifeless to focus on one whose health bar is full. Fortunately, even in Risen 3 it is possible, if not absolutely essential, to be accompanied by a follower, controlled in all respects by the CPU, which one ends up using as bait to escape from the attentions of enemies. The supporting characters however do not have unlimited health and can be temporarily knocked out (but at the end of the fights they will regain consciousness). The artificial intelligence of the allies is one of the Achilles heels of the Piranha Bytes production: in fact, it happens too often that they remain stunned without rushing to help the player. Things go a little better with the enemies, represented for the most part by monsters belonging to the animal world, from which superfine tactics are not expected. The return of magic also deserves a mention: spells are initially accessible via ch scrollsand are exhausted once the spell is cast, but it is possible to make them permanent after joining a guild. As a control system we used the stainless mouse / keyboard combination, although it was also possible to choose the joypad which remains, in our view, a fallback choice especially considering the precariousness of the camera. RPG features In Titan Lords, as in Dark Waters, the character does not reach any level: the acquisition of glory points allows you to increase each of the eight abilities that distinguishes the protagonist in real time. Unlike Risen 2, which used a decimal system whereby each attribute could reach a maximum of ten points, in increments of one unit at a time, in Risen 3 the cap is fixed at one hundred in steps of five points: it appears clear hence the programmers' decision to effectively double the experience needed to achieve mastery, in line with the increase in quests. However, it's not enough to perfect your skills to have full access to all the moves. The parade with recoil for example, despite being a fundamental one, will have to be learned from the teachers scattered around the various islands, who however will require a large amount of gold to reveal their tricks. It is not easy to accumulate the precious doubloons: occasionally they will be found in chests or as a reward for some completed missions, but it also becomes essential to sell to NPCs what has been collected while exploring the map. The inventory, as per tradition, is unlimited and is divided into sub-categories for quicker consultation. To quickly inflate the purse, one might be tempted to give trophies of animals killed in battle or precious minerals: however, one must be careful because they could be useful ingredients for the creation of powerful artifacts. Punctual as in every episode of the saga, the possibility of forging weapons, potions and spells also returns in Titan Lords. Our alter ego is a potential handyman: it will be enough to learn the skills from the masters scattered around the islands. The programmers have decided to branch out in a perhaps even exaggerated way the crafting section: special knowledge will be needed to forge swords and other contact weapons, others to make firearms, still others to distill rum or grog which in Risen 3 represent the potions to restore life. The rewards of many studies are certainly satisfying as they allow you to change, even permanently, the hero's characteristics or to obtain unique weapons or armor. The stealth aspect works quite badly as always: on the one hand, to open the chests, the tedious mini-game identical to the one seen in Dark Waters is re-proposed; on the other, being discovered while trying to steal objects from homes does not lead to any practical consequences. Sure there will probably be a reaction from the guards who, however, in case of victory, won't rage on the stolen goods but will limit themselves to deducting a handful of glory points from the hero's booty; on the other hand, even if it were possible to knock out the NPCs (who can never be killed definitively) it would be enough to return to the place of the crime a few hours later to be welcomed as if nothing had happened. Some choices then reflect the moral inclination of the player, but it is not clear whether embracing the forces of good or letting yourself be tempted by the embrace of the lords of death could have an influence on the ending. A leap forward? From a technical point of view, the engine used is the umpteenth evolution of the Genome Engine which had debuted with results that were, to say the least, approximate in 2006: it was the heart of Gothic 3. The years are now weighing on the rump and, despite the commendable attempts, however often successful , to resolve its historical flaws, the general impact certainly does not make one cry for a miracle. Of course, in comparison with Risen 2 the new episode wins with a considerable difference, thanks above all to a greater depth of the field of vision and an optimization of the lighting system which on more than one occasion returns breathtaking panoramas. However, some gaps catch the eye and even the less savvy user understands that they are certainly not faced with a so-called ~next-gen~ title. In particular, there is a lack of polygons that could have benefited the level of detail of the world and above all of the characters who, although being more natural than in the past, do not completely mask some slightly woody movements. There are also some annoying bad clipping effects for which sometimes the fauna materializes on the", "date": "2014-08-12", "grade": "8.0"}
