Thirty years ago we impersonated the so-called God of Light, in the timeless battle of good against evil, light against darkness, in a platform that is difficult to forget, enriched by a very small management component that saw our benevolent gaze rest on our faithful to help them recover and thrive. Their faith would have been our strength, following a peculiar level-up mechanic that in Actraiser Renaissance is resumed and partly expanded, together with other additions that make this operation halfway between a remaster and a remake: graphically it was revised to make it more suitable for modern times, as well as the gameplay in turn revisited so as to enrich it and increase the total hours of play with new characters and secondary missions. Here is the review of Actraiser Renaissance. A God among men Actraiser Renaissance, the protagonist divinity grappling with the emissaries of the demon Tanzra The story of Actraiser Renaissance, for those who lived it at the time, starts from the same premises: the god of light is involved in a confrontation with the demon Tanzra and his six Guardians, a battle that leaves him defeated and forced to retreat its Sky Palace - a castle floating in the clouds. From here he can do nothing but observe Tanzra take possession of the world, dividing it into six regions that he will assign to their respective Guardians. It is only centuries later that the god, whose cult has been slowly fading, decides to be reincarnated to free the people oppressed by Tanzra and his subordinates, making his Faith shine again as before. The story is good or bad as we remember it, however, along the way, six new characters have been introduced: the heroes who according to an ancient prophecy will join the god in his decisive battle against the demon. Past and present, these characters are inextricably linked to the six Guardians. For one reason or another, each of them has a history with the despot who rules the region of reference and has no awareness of being the hero predestined to serve the god. They are people defeated by Tanzra or his henchmen, bent at heart to the point of not even being able to hear the name of these evil forces - they lend themselves to helping the population in minor skirmishes (which we will talk about shortly), but they refuse to definitively get rid of the nests from which they emerge, giving reasons that are all different from each other, but not condemnable for this. Dynamics are therefore created for which, in our work of rebuilding the faith, we will also have to ~unblock~ hearts and consequently the resoluteness of these characters, which we can then evoke if we need them during the micro-management phases. It is the addition that most expands Actraiser Renaissance, since it is linked to the whole path of construction and growth of the village with all the secondary missions that derive from it. Only when the character in question awakens his latent strength, let's call it that, will we be able to proceed with the second and final act which will allow that region to be freed forever from the Guardian who oppresses it. Old and new gameplay Actraiser Renaissance, the management of the village has been expanded with several new features What's new in the gameplay, then? Several things, but let's start with the one that has been maintained and, of course, improved graphically: the first act of each region allows us to inflict a first defeat on Tanzra and her forces, so that the population can begin to regain faith in we. From the central temple which will be built at the end of the above act people will start building and expanding the settlement on our directions. We will be able to tell them in which direction to build, within a maximum limit of boxes, and we will support them using our miracles to clear the path for them. For example, a well-placed bolt of lightning will clear away cluttered trees and rocks, while intense sun will dry up pesky swamps, expanding building zones. The inhabitants act on their own initiative, once they know where to build and the road is clear: whether it is houses, fields or workshops, they are fortunately self-sufficient in understanding what goes where. In addition to supporting them ~personally~, we can also rely on the our right arm, a cherub that can be used to protect the settlement in question with a bow and arrow, eliminating the monsters that will come out of thenests to try to wreak havoc. Doing so serves to restore the mana we consume for miracles, in order to free the territory, grow the population and proceed with the story - which, as anticipated, in Actraiser Renaissance is linked to that of the hero present in the region. In these mechanics, the game hasn't changed since 1990, other than getting a makeover to adapt to modern times. The requests of the citizens are real secondary missions to take on, which will reward us with faith, instead of experience points, contributing to our level increase and the resulting upgrades. Here the similarities stop. The presence of the unwitting heroes and their slow ~awakening~ path bring with them a new mechanic: the so-called tower defense. Once the inhabitants have come into contact with the new character, for one reason or another, he will be our armed wing in the skirmishes that will occur both along the plot and randomly if we stay too long in the settlement doing nothing. On the other hand, it's not like the forces of evil can stand by and watch us take back the lands piece by piece. To defend ourselves in such situations, the game allows us, gradually, to build defensive structures in limited numbers and upgrade them (this is important to underline before the battle begins): from here we can deduce the importance of developing the settlement, since the resources to fortify it are produced by the citizens in the workshops and the quantity depends on the quality of the buildings themselves. beyond the fortifications that have their own menu, what didn't convince us of this part was the fact that to improve the structures in the settlement we have to get rid of the old ones... by destroying them. Imagine doing this operation for the village at its maximum expansion and six times, as many as there are regions: in the long run, but not too much, the operation gets boring and doesn't prove to be very necessary since the level of production will be lower but we will still have what we need by bringing more patience. It's not a real management system, so the mechanics are extremely simple and all revolve around the same resource for building. Actraiser Renaissance, the first hero of the game Returning to skirmishes, once started it is not possible to build or upgrade defensive structures (forts, watchtowers, magic towers, etc.) but we are free to place palisades as long as we have them, blocking the passage of enemies who generally aim to destroy the temple. The conditions of defeat are variable, but the temple of the god remains one of the most sensitive objectives: it could happen that you have to protect certain structures, or characters, and in that case you adapt accordingly also based on the availability of the heroes. Clearly, the more regions we have reconquered, the more heroes we will have available to deploy on the field. The defensive structures operate by themselves when a threat enters their range, while the heroes in turn attack automatically but we are free to tell them where to move so that they can counter any threats also and above all based on the their skills. To give a practical example, magic-resistant creatures will begin to appear already in the second region, so the sorceress protagonist of that part of the game will be quite useless, prompting us to summon the warrior from the previous region. Conversely, the flying enemies are unreachable for the warrior, who will have to give way to the sorceress or even to ourselves: in fact, we can intervene directly with miracles, provided we have enough mana points to do so. Points that regenerate through bottles produced by the population even in the midst of battle. It is therefore necessary to know when, where and what to use in order not to risk being at a disadvantage. Actraiser Renaissance, skirmishes can be quite challenging if poorly managed These tower defense moments know how to be ruthless if they want, even at an average level of difficulty, and we can't distract ourselves for a moment without an army of creatures of darkness attempting to assault this or that building (or character). As the story progresses, the skirmishes of the region in which we find ourselves will become increasingly difficult, until the final escalation with a particularly powerful creature and against which we cannot intervene directly. Or rather, our miracles will almost have more of a numbing than harmful effector, leaving the difficult task in the hands of heroes and defensive structures. All while the rest of the minions run amok through the village, of course. Just like the deity, heroes can also level up and improve their statistics: just use them with particular tomes obtained as a reward from side missions, the necessary quantity of which increases level after level. Through the series of secondary missions that make up the story of the settlement and its hero, we will also get the spells to use during the platform phase. Before moving on to this other part of the game, a few words about the monster nests. In the original game, once the populace had gained enough confidence and strength, they could be directed towards the nest and would personally seal the entrance - effectively, destroying it. In Actraiser Renaissance this is no longer the case because the spawn is introduced, a sort of demonic ~device~ that the inhabitants are unable to destroy and for which they ask for our direct intervention. It will therefore be up to us to descend into the depths and start short battles in closed arenas with the aim of exposing the spawn and destroying it, while defending ourselves from other threats. They are short and even demanding phases in the long run, which give more depth to the relationship between the protagonist divinity and the faithful in their path of rebellion in Tanzra. Obviously, the destruction of the nests is also part of the list of side missions that are unlocked step by step, thus making them mandatory steps to force the Guardian of the region to expose himself in first person. Actraiser Renaissance, the god of light has something of a Warrior of Light Overall, except for the unnecessary step of having to destroy buildings in order to rebuild them better, we liked the new gameplay additions. The skirmishes always have different objectives and grow in difficulty both according to the region and within the region itself as the story progresses, forcing us to review the strategy from time to time. The destruction of the nests is enriched by the scrolling platform phase that sees us directly involved, while the addition of the heroes linked to the respective Guardian of the territory adds some depth and epicness to the story, thanks to a simple but varied narration in the different situations. Of course, the sense of redundancy is perceived and perhaps some passages could have been streamlined but, if nothing else, it reinvigorates what in the original were already long and boring phases. The micromanagement aspect that accompanies both the growth of the village and its fortification before the skirmishes is a small added value that keeps our attention span high while the story continues until the next act. A revamped platformer, but not too well Actraiser Renaissance, the platforming stages are the least convincing of the package The most painful note of the game, sorry to say, lies precisely in the actual action phases. The one where the god of light descends to earth and prepares to send the demons back from the hell they come from. At first glance they may appear to be scaled down to 2.5D but, in reality, everything is pre-rendered; this means that despite the rather smooth animations of the enemies and the protagonist, all of them look somewhat ~chipped~. It immediately catches the eye, for example, how grainy and low-resolution the model of the deity is. We find a similar situation in the stages, which on the one hand boast excellent lighting effects and on the other have a not too pleasant aspect, perhaps due to the fact that Actraiser Renaissance is also available for mobile devices. This may have played an unfavorable key role in an all too rough aesthetic, when compared to the much simpler and more pleasing to the eye management counterpart. Finally, it is impossible to remain indifferent in the face of a disappointing, jerky scrolling: nothing so heavy as to undermine the game and yet, considering that the backgrounds are flat and the 2D character sprites, however, quite patchy, difficult to accept when overall the The aesthetics - especially from the point of view of the portraits of the characters - is really very accurate. There is an evident clear gap between the two phases of the game, micromanagement and scrolling action, which at a certain point seems to be dealing with two different products. Beyond these non-negligible details, Actraiser Renaissance revises the gameplay also in this case: starting with magic and, more generally, from the moment we choose to descend to earth to kick some demon. We can take all magic with us", "date": "2021-09-28", "grade": "7.0"}
