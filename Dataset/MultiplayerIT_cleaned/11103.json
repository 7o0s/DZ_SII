How else to explain the fog of the original Silent Hill on PlayStation, way back in 1999? Being the first survival horror with three-dimensional settings, compromises had to be made and the buildings beyond the short distance were hidden from view, hidden by the fog, in order to offer a greater degree of detail in the visible elements. A ploy that had already been seen previously, but which in Silent Hill acquired a particular value: in addition to playing a ~technical~ role, the mist in fact recalled horror classics such as ~Fog~ by John Carpenter, and served as a characterizing element of that desolate and mysterious city through which the player had to move. A lot of time has passed since then, and the series (between ups and downs) has become a point of reference for those who look for certain atmospheres and situations in video games. Exactly one year ago, Konami then took a very important step, creating a mobile reduction of the game where there are very few titles that deal with horror themes on mobile phones. A successful experiment, although very distant from the mechanics seen in the console episodes. We return to Silent Hill, therefore, and the incipit of this second mobile chapter immediately makes it clear that it will not be a pleasure trip, on the contrary. In the role of a character who is in an obvious state of confusion, so much so that he doesn't remember anything, we will wake up in a completely deserted hospital and we will have to understand what we are doing there, as well as who owns the female voice that occasionally speaks to us, hidden in the darkness or in the recesses of our mind. The developers clearly wanted to create a sort of ~more of the same~, using the same mechanics of the first Silent Hill Mobile but adapting the technical sector for the occasion: loading between one screen and another is much faster, and allow for easier and faster exploration. The interface has also undergone some changes, for example it is now possible to open doors or take certain directions even from a certain distance, without having to take all the necessary steps every time and turn towards the goal. The pointer changes shape and color according to the interactable area, turns into a viewfinder for attacking if you have a firearm and can be operated using the 5 key. A menu with possible actions can be called up at any time ( look, touch, use an item, etc.), open the map, or save your game in the only available slot. As in the previous episode, the action is divided between exploration and puzzle solving phases, with the fights constituting only a marginal part. As mentioned, the game boasts a superior technical realization compared to the previous episode: faster loading, more detailed environments and a fade effect that makes screen changes much more elegant. For the rest, things have remained unchanged: there is the same interface (really ugly) and the same movement system with the arrows. The sound consists of some fairly good music, interspersed with long periods of silence that eventually leave room for some effects, unfortunately mediocre. Controlling the pointer using the mobile's d-pad is simple and intuitive, even if the low speed sometimes makes the experience slow and cumbersome. PRO Technically well done Great atmosphere Numerous and well organized puzzles AGAINST Very limited gameplay structure Slow and cumbersome action Mediocre interface", "date": "2008-10-27", "grade": "S.V."}
