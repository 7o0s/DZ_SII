{"name": "Eden digitale", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/90138-child-of-eden-eden-digitale.html", "text": "Versions tested: PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 Tetsuya Mizuguchi, although very young, has been in the video game industry since the early 90s: those of SEGA, of cabinets and arcades, having collaborated on sacred monsters such as the two SEGA Rally , as well as the SEGA Touring Car Championship, when he departed from AM 3 to start a small group known as AM Annex. Precisely starting from this title, Mizuguchi began to devote great attention to the world of Japanese house and techno, which even then boasted some of the most innovative and interesting exponents of the whole scene. Since then, the combination of music and gameplay has become increasingly tighter in the game designer's head up to the creation of real pearls, starting with REZ, in which digital visual art, soundtracks and audio effects are combined like no other other product on the market. Child of Eden is a shooter on rails and fits overwhelmingly into this vein by proposing itself as the heir to REZ, of which it takes up the mechanics, adds modern day cosmetics and, for those who have it, interaction thanks to Kinect. Eden In Child of Eden the story is a mere pretext: it is a question of saving Lumi, a virtual girl, a software that embodies all the wonders of humanity and of life on earth, by reproducing them within Eden, that same system that REZ was set in. In essence therefore, you have to go through five worlds, each with its own particular theme, always poised between technology and nature, in which to eliminate the biological or technological monstrosities that infect Lumi trying to spread the virus. Each time a level is completed, a number of stars are obtained, depending on the performance achieved, so as to be able to access the next world, with the need to repeat a stage in case one does not have enough, since in any case the stars are they accumulate after each game. To do this, the player has a burst shot available, which also serves to hit enemies and purple-colored bullets, the only ones that head towards the player to hit him, and a series of eight missiles with locks. By hovering the cursor over a group of monsters, up to a maximum of eight, they are all highlighted and at that point you can release homing missiles that eliminate them in sequence. As mentioned, Child of Eden is a shooter on rails, in which the player has only partial control of the camera, in which it is necessary to be able to identify the dangers within images that leave you speechless and try to distract the player , placing it in dream settings. Each shot, each explosion emits a sound that combines with the music, always beautiful, in the background, so that you get better scores both by being able to use the missiles always shooting eight, the maximum, simultaneously, and by being able to do it in time. Once the five worlds have been freed, a sixth opens up, a true quote from REZ, which is a sort of survival mode in which you can indulge yourself in making ever higher scores, in which the camera is practically blocked and in which you can concentrate solely on the pleasure of shoot and perform combos. Just the push to achieve better scores, the comparison in the online rankings and the unlocking of the many extras present, including videos, artwork and sound effects, rather than graphics, are the main push to increase the longevity of Child of Eden, which will not last. at basic difficulty level, more than five hours. This is the Achilles heel of the title, which requires the player total love for the mechanics and that desire to improve in continuous games. Probably aware of this, the team decided not to insert intermediate checkpoints during the levels, with the need to start a level over if you run out of energy, which can be recovered by hitting some blue spheres that they release after destruction of on-screen enemies. Xbox 360 goals After finishing Child of Eden, our tally was just over 300 points. To get to the thousand possible, you have to finish it even on difficult, as well as try to achieve all those objectives that require specific score missions or combinations of shots. In short, it takes some time and the desire to play it several times, but it is precisely the nature of the title that pushes us to do so. Interactions To understand the beauty of Child of Eden, you must at least get to one of the battles with the bosses at the end of the level, in the presence of which one cannot but wonder what limits Mizuguchi's imagination and his QEntertainment have. The images run away fluidly in a combination of lights and audio effects as in a virtual danceit requires affection from those who see it, but who can give enormous satisfaction. Child of Eden is also the best implementation to date of Kinect, the motion device for Xbox 360, with no lag and excellent precision. The basic control requires the player to use the right hand to lock the missiles, released by moving the hand towards the sensor as if to launch a ball of energy, while the left fires the laser burst, with the camera moving reaching the edges of the screen, then push. Euphoria, a bomb to be collected in the levels, is launched by raising both arms. That's all, so much so that the game can easily be played sitting down, even if, neighbors permitting, from standing you soon find yourself moving to the rhythm of the music while launching missiles and laser shots, feeling the closest thing to Mickey the magician in the broom scene from Fantasia. Played with the pad, Child of Eden is easier and less tiring, the mechanics are those of REZ and familiarity allows you to go through the different levels more easily without a doubt, but if you have bought Kinect it is difficult for you to abandon the two sensor cameras in favor of the controller, the experience that Mizuguchi has concocted is so much more fun, especially once you get familiar with the jolts that the shot has when you alternate the two hands to change the fire modes (there is also an alternative mode in which weapons are changed by clapping hands). The PlayStation 3 version Three months after its release on Xbox 360, we had the opportunity to return to Q Entertainment's wonderful and psychedelic Eden, this time to test the PlayStation 3 version that Mizuguchi and company wanted to keep warm so that it could take advantage of some exclusive features of the Sony consoles. Let's make one thing clear right away: those who hoped that the greater capacity of the PS3 Blu-rays would have enticed developers to add new material and additional content will be disappointed, since Child of Eden, for levels, music, movies and unlockable content, is exactly the same. same game that Xbox 360 users were able to enjoy early last summer. The news rather concern the control system, which replaces the immersive and successful Kinect interface with support for PlayStation Move, although it is still possible to use the traditional pad. While not allowing you to freely customize the control system, Child of Eden on PlayStation 3 offers the player two different input schemes in an attempt to please everyone: in the default one, for example, you use the pointing of the Move to lock the aim on one or more enemies on the screen, after which you can decide whether to hit them with the laser by pushing the controller forward or whether to use the secondary blow with a press of the trigger, while the Move Button allows you to enter Euphoria mode and clean up your opponents to a short period of time. In short, as far as possible the movements of the controller try to replicate the excellent work done with the innovative Microsoft peripheral, although in this case the sense of freedom and ~power~ that was possible to perceive with both hands is lost free ready to take turns. The Trance option allows you to activate the vibration on all controllers connected to the console, but even the latter, designed to give feedback to the player every time he fires or is hit, ends up having the opposite effect and looking like an element external, excessive, almost annoying, to the point that we preferred to do without it after just a couple of levels. The other exclusive novelty of Child of Eden for PS3 concerns the support for stereoscopic 3D, thanks to which you can immerse yourself even more in the colorful tunnels and fantastic environments of the game, while the long list of trophies brings back on the Sony console the same unlockable achievements of Xbox 360.", "date": "2011-09-26", "grade": "8.7"}
