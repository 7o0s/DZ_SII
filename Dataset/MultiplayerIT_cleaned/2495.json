{"name": "Warriors Of Might And Magic", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/warriors-of-might-and-magic.html", "text": "Condemned! Take any day of your life: they come to your home and tell you that you have been sentenced to death with the accusation that you are a necromancer, one of those terrible magicians who want absolute power thanks to their nefarious magical arts. . The problem is that you are not someone small, you are Alleron, captain of the guard and you also have to undergo the wearing of the mask of shame with a screaming crowd that invokes your death. A few more seconds, the trapdoor opens, you sink down, is it the end? Absolutely not, it is only the beginning of a very long series of battles with weapons such as swords, maces and offensive magic based on fireballs and thunderbolts through 9 long levels, divided into 20 zones, until you get to challenge shady figures such as the grand inquisitor (the one who sentenced you to death, but not the last enemy who is none other than). Graphics-sound Let's start from the beginning, i.e. from the computer graphics used to introduce the new 3do game: the quality is average for a Playstation 2, it's not a full motion video of the ones that mother Namco has accustomed us to but we certainly aren't at disastrous levels. What is really outrageous is the visual realization of Warriors Of Might And Magic, especially after an E3 based on screaming special effects and fluidity that always stops at 60 frames per second, as in the case of Capcomiani Maximo and Devil May cry and the usual well-known killer applications that respond to the name of Final Fantasy X, Metal Gear Solid 2 and Gran Turismo 3 (although there was a lot of moving stuff on the screen). Let's begin to analyze the frame rate: it passes with disarming naturalness from 25 frames per second up to the usual 50 of games in Pal format when there are no enemies and a very close view is used in very narrow spaces; moral of the story? 25 frames per second constant in 90% of situations. You will all be thinking that this 3do title will therefore have exceptional graphics, curved surfaces at full blast, sprites overflowing with touches of class scattered here and there capable of annihilating the characters of Tekken Tag or the magnificent robots of Zone Of Enders. Well, first of all forget the facial animations, forget about mouths wide open in amazement, replace the idea of eyes that look around or that open and close and obviously forget about the single fingers that move, the clothes that deform according to the your movements and everything you expect after you've sipped a spesuccia that is around a million between consoles, games and memory cards to save, listen, listen, at any moment of the game (excellent feature, it must be said!). The only noteworthy peculiarity towards Alleron is that, at least, every time you change his armor, it will change on your alter ego (.erhow to say..I know that this is the minimum per day of 'today but trust me when I tell you that it's really the only positive thing I can say). How do you say? How were your enemies made? I would like to say at the same level as the protagonist but unfortunately it's not like that..... ok, some monsters, especially the bigger ones, are not at abominable graphic levels, they navigate in the most absolute mediocrity but wait until you see those thirty polygons covered with some texturina spread here and there that should agglomerate a zombie and then we'll talk about it. Let's come to the backdrops: some not bad play of light and a slight fog effect give a certain atmosphere, no doubt about it, shame about the flatness of the backdrops (with consequent small number of textures) and a mist at the bottom of your field action that irritates even more the undersigned, who incredibly does not benefit in any way the limping frame rate! That sucks Coming to the audio section, let's start with the music, no thud or no bgm worthy of being remembered forever, only compositions that blend well with what happens on the screen (oh my God NDLL77 ^_^'); we continue with the sound effects and here too we are in the most absolute average, let's say they are overtested, no search for the new here too and we end with the Italian dubbing. Now, the undersigned has nothing against Italian adaptations, but certainly, thanks to my medium-high knowledge of English, there have been many times that I have preferred to play with the Yankee versions of various popular titles on computers and consoles precisely based on the quality of the dubbing or subtitles implemented in the country of pasta. It's true, I agree that Italian voice actors are among the best in the world, just look at some good films or the Italian language edition of Neon Genesis Evangelion, the mthe best anime (cartoon) in existence to realize it by yourself but I prefer to close with a pitiful veil the performances regarding the adaptation of Warriors Of Might And Magic by 3do. Playability and longevity This spin off of the Might And Magic saga is a slashem'up with rpg elements. Okay, I spoke ostrogoth, let's translate what was said earlier: the game mechanics include a lot of alternate fights in search of keys, switches and anything else to continue your mission. Each time you kill an enemy, your experience level will gradually increase, until you advance in level, at which point it is up to you to choose which characteristics of Alleron to improve: strength, physical resistance, magical power, intelligence, etc. The game interface, which involves the massive use of Sony's dual shock 2, may seem complicated at first sight but 2 minutes are enough to burn it properly (pirates, don't get it wrong!! Nd LL77 ^_^): in practice, with the left stick you move, with the right you look around (when the virtual camera doesn't rincitrullisce), with the action keys you hit (nice idea of chaining attacks in combos as lethal as they are unattractive), use magic and jump, with the back keys parry enemy blows, operate switches, open ajar doors, change objects while with the digital cross, among other things, use the selected object. The game is also quite long, those who have played it for you tell you so, but it is one thing to be forced to do it, it is another matter not to be. The real-time sequences to which the continuation of the narrative during the game is entrusted to keep the gamer glued to the television do not help much. To the good connoisseur.. Conclusions Let's weigh all the items under consideration: graphically it is frighteningly dull (with a few tweaks to the bass it could very well run on the Nintendo 64, losing only in detail), acoustically it is adequate, the fun hardly escapes from the DVD and the longevity.. well, if you have already bought it and you have no alternatives on how to spend your free time YOU MIGHT even try to finish it but we are in summer, the sea is, friends are, the girls are (especially NDLL77), the disco is, the concerts and I could go on and on.. Pros: MIGHT be a little fun at first Cons:but later you'll throw it out the window technical realization monotony Italian dubbing An endless saga Relatively little known in the universe of consoles, the Might And Magic saga has been able to gain a fair number of fans over the years, always with their mouth watering when we talk about a new chapter inspired by this series. Unfortunately, bad luck wants the franchise to be in the hands of 3do, a software house known to most for its (many) demerits rather than for the masterpieces it has been able to churn out (only the Requiem for PC springs to mind, a little, it would be , rightly so to say) while in the middle there are games that would go into a hypothetical Dantesque purgatory, given that in general we are talking about products with a mediocre-sufficient realization that invites the fan of a certain videogame genre to buy an ~x  title, despite its precarious quality. Warriors Of Might And Magic fits into this band, a pale emulator of decidedly more famous titles such as the wonderful Severance for PC or the fun saga of Medievil, which hopefully will become, thanks to the Playstation 2's Emotion Engine, a trilogy. How do you say? Yes, calm down, the undersigned knows that the Might And Magic saga is not based on real-time combat, they are not action games but role-playing games with a certain tactical-management component (similar to the upcoming Heroes Of Might And Magic, expected in DVD format for June 22), but it is also true that all sagas with a certain popularity can sometimes generate real spin-offs, this is the time of W.O.M.A.M. No more delays, let's get started!", "date": "2001-06-05", "grade": null}
