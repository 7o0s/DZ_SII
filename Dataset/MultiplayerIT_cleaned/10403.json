In recent years, the combination of Nintendo Wii and casual player has produced an infinite and boundless series of puzzle games of decidedly fluctuating quality: from the excellent BoomBlox to the semi-amateur Super Fruitfall, the list dedicated to the genre is long and diverse. From today we can download yet another puzzle directly from the Wii Ware service: Spaceball Revolution. Regardless of the specious title that refers to alleged revolutions, the title in question is a classic and tested puzzle-game in which we have to try to hit squares to form precise geometric figures. A grid appears on the screen on which some drawings vaguely reminiscent of the geometric figures of Tetris are drawn from time to time. In the central part there is the game area made up of a 3D room with a top view: the ~floor~ is made up of the same grid that we see on the side, and it is our job to throw balls on the underlying squares to ~turn them on~ and try to form the same design shown above. Definitely easier to prove than to explain: the concept is simple, but complicated by numerous elements that distract the player, divert the trajectory of the balls we throw, and interpose themselves in front of the areas to be hit. Speaking more clearly: they increase the difficulty in reaching the targets to be hit. We have three lives to complete each of the 15 schemes. Whenever we lose one, the view zooms out, so as to distance the grid to hit more and more and make it more difficult to reach the exact points we are aiming for. Bank game The numerous objects and impediments that appear in front of the grid to be hit make, pattern after pattern, the achievement of the objective in the respective set time increasingly difficult. Spaceball Revolution is a frenetic and fast game that doesn't leave room for a lot of reasoning: you have to be shrewd and quick to figure out which is the best trajectory to get to the ~square~ to hit and illuminate. The gameplay is simple and intuitive, but fails to capture and kidnap the player's mind for a long time, becoming boring and repetitive after a short while. The ~things to do~ in Spaceball Revolution are very few and the appeal of the whole package is only raised by a good competitive multiplayer that sees two players face off in split screen, each with their respective grid to light up in front of them. Between scheme and scheme, to try to lift morale, shooter-style mini-games appear in which we have to hit a series of objects that appear on the screen, just like in the classic Duck Hunt or Wii Play. The Virtual Toy developers, responsible in the past for the Torrente series, as well as for some episodes of ~Giulia Passione~ on Nintendo DS, certainly didn't squeeze themselves to obtain a particularly elaborate or effects-rich graphic sector. The style of Spaceball Revolution is minimalist but pleasant, simple and essential to the proposed gameplay, without many frills. The sound accompaniment is along the same lines, decidedly elementary (recalling the 8-bit era), not very inspired and repetitive right from the start. Spaceball Revolution is a fun but short, simple but nice game, above the average of many WiiWare productions but definitely not a game that manages to rise in its genre. The price is right: 800 Wii Points.", "date": "2009-11-06", "grade": "5.8"}
