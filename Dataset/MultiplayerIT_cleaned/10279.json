What could be really interesting in a concept seen and reviewed dozens of times since the dawn of videogame entertainment? Quite a lot, we assure you. Not only is Shatter a brilliant example of how good gameplay made of balls and bricks to break is still valid, but more generally it represents one of the best titles ever available on the PlayStation 3 PSN. How to renovate a dinosaur The basic idea of Shatter is, as already mentioned, almost as old as the video game itself; on one side of the screen there is a mobile platform, controlled by the player, and on the other side a series of blocks to be destroyed with bouncing balls in order to move on to the next level. Much more complex said than done. What the programmers of Sidhe Interactive did therefore was to take this idea, and shape it to your liking, mix it with some elements of the arcade shot'em ups, to create a truly spectacular and fascinating experience. First of all, through the back keys it is possible to partially manage the trajectory of the sphere, thanks to a ~force~ capable of attracting or repelling it with respect to the platform. This is a key element which finally makes active not only the moment of the rebound, but also the entire path and trajectory followed by the ball. Secondly, the management of one's own lives finds new life, which in Shatter are made up of the same balls that can be freely used at any time; this means that if, for example, you have 3 lives, then you can throw up to three balls at the same time at any time you wish, increasing the offensive potential but also the difficulty in managing them. And again, the destruction of the blocks releases fragments, to be collected with the same attractive force as above; in addition to increasing the score, these allow you to fill a bar that can be used to generate a shield or to release a sort of special attack that is particularly useful for quickly cleaning up the level or against bosses. Yes, because at the end of each of the worlds that make up the main mode there is a different boss, with specific attacks and weak points to hit repeatedly. But that is not all; the behavior of the blocks to be destroyed, for example, is linked to different qualities of the same, such as to make them remain motionless, or explode, or resist multiple blows, or wander across the screen responding to the player's push or call solicitations. In this case, particular attention must be paid, since hitting one's platform against a block leads to a short but often fatal disappearance of the same from one's position. Also interesting is the choice not to limit oneself to the classic ~rectangular~ stages, but to place them side by side with the decidedly more demanding circular ones. The multiplicity of innovative elements inserted in a classic mechanic therefore makes Shatter a fundamentally fresh and engaging game, immediate but at the same time open to a constant sense of progression and improvement thanks to the scoring system and online rankings. All this is then supported by a leading technical component, with graphics that are certainly not impressive in terms of complexity but equipped with an excellent, colorful and full of pleasant effects futuristic style. The soundtrack is excellent, composed of electronic songs that would not look out of place on a music CD. Too bad only for the absence of any multiplayer mode and for the brevity of the main campaign, which is accompanied by only a couple of not too interesting secondary modes.", "date": "2009-12-30", "grade": "8.8"}
