Not necessarily new titles or leading labels but rather, simply, products that deserve to be taken into consideration. Even more so if you don't have to pay even a penny. Video game developers must have creativity and imagination, that's for sure. Having a digital platform like iTunes available to interface with, with its millions of songs and the possibility, for each one, of listening to a free preview, FreshPlanet has seen fit to mix the genre of multiple choice quizzes with online multiplayer asynchronous, and seasoned it all with a really well thought out progression system, capable of stimulating replayability and pushing us to play ~one more game~. The end result is SongPop, a nice casual game that we tested in its Free version, available both on the App Store (for iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad) and on Google Play. The question arises spontaneously and therefore let's try to provide an answer immediately: what changes between the free version of the game and the paid one (1.59 euros)? In the latter, the previews of the music tracks are of higher quality, the number of games that can be played simultaneously is doubled and there are no small advertising banners. For the rest, the two products are identical and therefore you can choose to try SongPop Free for as long as you want, without limitations, possibly choosing to switch to the ~pro~ version if you think that the work done by the developers is worth your money. Guess who? As mentioned above, the FreshPlanet title combines some rather trendy elements, namely multiple choice quizzes (in this case with an emphasis on the speed of response) and asynchronous online multiplayer, i.e. the possibility of playing a game made up of beatings and replies, which can be resolved virtually in a few minutes or last for days, depending on the readiness with which the counterparty will make his move. Once the game is installed, you can enter the name of a friend to challenge, find him on Facebook (in cross-platform with the SongPop social application) or start a game with a random opponent. Whoever makes the first move has the right to choose the playing field, in this case the playlist to which the five questions that make up the round will refer. There are thirty playlists in all, spanning various genres and historical periods, from classic rock to indie, from popular love songs to 80s hits, and so on. At the beginning we'll only have a handful available, and to unlock the others we'll have to buy them by spending the gold coins that are earned at the end of each match (or which, of course, we can get through in-app purchase). The ~progression~ factor also plays into the playlists, because as we provide correct answers for a certain category, we will see our ~experience points~ rise and at a certain point the list will extend to new songs. Finally, as regards the practical development of the game, everything is very simple: five audio previews are played in sequence and our task is to alternately indicate the title of the song or the name of the singer / band who performs it among the five names that appear from time to time. If the first round is ours, the opponent will be able to see the answers we have provided ~live~, as if the competition were taking place in real time. Shorter reaction times will produce more points, ultimately deciding the winner.", "date": "2012-08-26", "grade": "7.8"}
