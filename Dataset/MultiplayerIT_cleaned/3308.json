{"name": "Exit the Gungeon", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/exit-the-gungeon-recensione.html", "text": "The review of Exit the Gungeon assumes that the new Dodge Roll title presents itself as something different from the equally excellent Enter the Gungeon, which landed a few years ago on PC and console. From a narrative point of view we are faced with a sequel that sees the protagonists determined to finally get out of the underworld that has seen them fight against all sorts of adversaries, but the project is in all respects considered a spin-off. In fact, gameplay, structure and visuals change, in a sort of homage to Super Crate Box which abandons the twin stick shooter vocation in favor of a two-dimensional platform-based approach, in which increasingly difficult challenges alternate starting from a degree of difficulty that already in principle it is anything but trivial. However, the hardcore imprint does not arise as a gimmick to hide some scarcity of content under the carpet: the enemies we will find ourselves facing are numerous and include a wide range of difficult bosses, which we will be able to eliminate only by acting with the utmost promptness and determination. Gameplay and style Exit the Gungeon can be played with traditional touch controls or with a fully supported Bluetooth controller. Choosing one or the other option actually modifies the experience: in the first case the aim is automatic and it is possible to take advantage of some bullet times in the most frenetic moments, while in the second case you have to manually direct the shots and you do not enjoy of any help. Ultimately, with the physical commands, we must prepare ourselves psychologically for an even more concrete challenge, which will see us incur an abundant amount of game overs before being able to reach certain points in the campaign. Trapped in the most classic of videogame elevators, we will in fact have to move quickly left and right, jump and dodge to avoid the many bullets that will rain down on us, all while trying to use the many weapons at our disposal, alternating randomly, to take out opponents who come from all over the place. A set of little hearts represents our vital energy, which fortunately is increased by progressing through the stages and therefore allows you to have a minimum margin of error to compensate for the inevitable blunders in timing and the damage that we end up suffering almost necessarily when the enemies charge us head-on after having fired a barrage of radially developed blows. There are some variations on the theme and a certain replayability value, represented in particular by the possibility of unlocking new characters to face the adventure again. This is perhaps the most interesting aspect of Exit the Gungeon, which in terms of mechanics and complexity inevitably loses something compared to the first game of the series and cannot boast the same charm; while also presenting itself in this spin-off with a captivating audiovisual style, which takes the form of quality pixel art and a functional soundtrack to the action.", "date": "2019-12-26", "grade": "7.8"}
