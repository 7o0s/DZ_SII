{"name": "Minority Report", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/minority-report.html", "text": "The Minority Report Once you leave the Precrime headquarters, you learn of the existence of the so-called ~Minority Report~. In practice, the three Precogs do not always have the same vision: sometimes only one of them can predict an event, and in this case its reliability is questioned. Is this the case? You can't know if you don't go back to basics... Those who have seen the film Minority Report will have no problem following the plot of the tie-in taken from it, which differs from the film only for a few tricks. First of all, the protagonist has been reinvented, probably due to the impossibility (or onerousness) of using a digital reproduction of Tom Cruise. Furthermore, the alleged assassins, who in the film simply get caught by the Precrime without putting up any resistance, in this case will become real end-of-level bosses, who will face you with heavy weapons. The general atmosphere also changes, as the storyline of the game unfolds through well-made comic strips, but very distant from the spirit of the film. Struggling with fate The first levels of the game will have you acting as a normal Precrime agent, with the task of catching people who are about to commit murder. Making you wander around the levels until the subjects in question were found wouldn't have been much fun, and so you'll have to watch out first for the attack of dozens of street thugs who don't like the police officers very much, then from your former colleagues. To defend yourself, you can use the pistol as a blunt weapon (from close range) or shoot. You will find other weapons scattered along the stages, and each of them is distinguished by firepower and ammunition consumption. Anderton shoots by pressing the A button, while the B button is used to jump. To direct the shots, he must necessarily use the viewfinder (L or R keys) and scroll through the possible targets until he finds the one he wants to hit. Be careful, because killing civilians will cost you a life. To face the most crowded situations, you need to take advantage of the shelters offered by the levels: benches, flower beds and so on. By pressing one of the directions of the d-pad twice, you can perform a somersault and then take cover behind an object, to fire only at the right moment. This is a system that should have been tested better, however, because the character's reaction times are too slow and you end up taking numerous hits trying to do a ~clean~ job. Pros and cons The slowness of the character, in the end, is the element that more than any other undermines the playability of Minority Report. The developers have rightly tried to provide the main sprite with a certain number of animations and frames, but in the wrong context: only the act of turning left or right ends up requiring precious moments, in which one can end up under enemy blows . Moreover, when an opponent starts shooting at us, it's really difficult to escape his attack and you end up losing a life in the stupidest way. Very frustrating, actually. It must be said, on the other hand, that the levels are well made and the exploration of the same pleasantly entertains the player. It's a shame that the only items worth finding are weapons, because there are far too many vitality and ammo bonuses. Not that the game is easy, mind you: you can only brilliantly pass a level if you face it with coolness and calculation, eliminating enemies as soon as they come within range of your weapons. The sound amazes for the quality of some BGMs (especially the introductory one), while offering average effects for GBA titles. Concluding... We are faced with a good conversion. It's hard to think of better solutions than those chosen by the developers to turn a film like Minority Report into an action game for a portable console. Technically discreet, this title unfortunately suffers from some defects that seriously undermine its playability. On the one hand, the slowness of the main character, which forces you to approach the levels in a certain way to overcome the limits of a control system that needed to be revised. On the other hand, the repetitiveness of a game structure that doesn't offer particular fun or any surprises for those who have already seen the film. However, if you already own the most representative titles for the GameBoy Advance, perhaps this Minority Report could represent a ~variationion on the theme~ capable of entertaining you for a few hours. Provided you don't expect a masterpiece, however. Pros: Discreet graphics Some well-crafted music Cons: Slow character in some movements Sometimes frustrating Repetitive We are in the near future, and murders as we know them have ceased to exist. The ~Precrime~ organization, in fact, manages to foresee them and thwart them before they happen, thanks to the support of three mutants called ~Precogs~. The system seems perfect... As Agent John Anderton, who has worked for years in Precrime as a commander, you are truly convinced of the absence of flaws in the foresight program. After yet another foiled murder, however, the Precogs have a new vision and communicate the names of the next victim and its perpetrator... you! It seems impossible, in less than forty-eight hours you should kill someone you don't even know. There must necessarily be a mistake, but the first thing to do is to cut the rope and think about it calmly...", "date": "2003-01-09", "grade": null}
