{"name": "X-Men Legends 2: Rise of Apocalypse", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/x-men-legends-2-rise-of-apocalypse.html", "text": "United we laughed At the base of X-Men Legends 2 there is a plot that is certainly not very original but capable of paving the way for new gameplay elements. As the subtitle suggests, in this episode the threat is represented by the evil Apocalypse, determined to conquer the world with the help of his four horsemen: the extent of the danger is such that the X-Men find themselves forced to unite the forces with their archenemies, Magneto and his Brotherhood henchmen. It is therefore easy to understand how X-Men Legends 2 offers the user a large roster of selectable characters (16 to be precise), drawn from both mutant factions. For the rest, the game scheme turns out to be identical in all respects to that of its predecessor: by guiding your own small handful of four characters (one directly controlled and the others managed by the CPU) you launch yourself into a whole series of quests and sub-quests of various kinds, collecting objects, killing enemies and collecting experience points essential for level-ups and various upgrades. Quantitatively, X-Men Legends 2 is certainly a very rich action rpg: in addition to a considerable number of scenarios and missions to complete (for a total of about 25 hours of single player gameplay), the Activision product proves to be very generous also in terms of party management, with a deep and convincing character growth system that is divided between skill points to be distributed within various parameters, super-powers to be managed and items of equipment to be assigned. The downside - as in the prequel - however unfortunately identified in an interface that is often not very suited to the purpose, with menus that are not always clear and which certainly could have been made better. But this is not the only flaw of a sequel that would have deserved a few more corrections... Mutant you are and mutant you remain X-Men Legends 2 can boast a record that is certainly not flattering: having revived all, absolutely all the defects that afflicted the previous episode. So here is that the title Barking Lizards continues to offer a substantially enjoyable gameplay, but penalized again by some structural naiveties. Beyond the inconvenience of the menus, the constant feeling of confusion caused by clashes with enemies should be underlined, in which the difference between a successful hit and a missed one is still almost indistinguishable. The AI of one's companions is definitely not helpful in this case, seen and considered how they tend to always act head down, regardless of the behavioral patterns assigned to them. X-Men Legends 2 can be played very well, mind you, but the annoyance caused by these structural moles is still difficult to swallow. It is clear that the developers of Barking Lizards have skipped a bit on the story mode of the game to focus on the multiplayer department, an aspect in which X-Men Legends 2 actually presents some interesting innovations: in addition to the always welcome cooperative option for four players via Bluetooth , the N-Gage Arena service has also been well exploited, which provides for the possibility of unlocking new missions or trying your hand at a peculiar turn-based game, pleasant but honestly not exciting. In short, the efforts are appreciable, but perhaps it would have been wiser to mainly improve the single player experience. Before concluding, a few words should be spent on the audiovisual department of X-Men Legends 2, which - needless to say - does not present major improvements compared to the prequel: graphically the Activision product remains more than appreciable, with well-finished and large sprites (but a bit lacking in terms of animations) and expertly crafted scenarios. The same goes for the sound, qualitatively unchanged in this sequel: some dynamic music accompanies the clashes, while normal sound effects and incredibly compressed speech surround everything else. Comment X-Men Legends 2 is a rather conventional sequel after all, in the sense that it re-proposes the formula of its predecessor without distorting it either positively or negatively: this means that the title Barking Lizards retains both the strengths and weaknesses of the first episode, of fact revealing a mere extension of something already widely seen. Of course, the adventure is richer and longer and the multiplayer support is new, but the overall evaluation of the Acclaim product weighs a little bitterness for many aspects that deserved improvements that have not materialized at all. Pros Technically valid Enjoyable gameplay Deep and long-lived Cons The exact same flaws of the prequel Confusing in some respects Loses its edge in the long run Difficult, almost impossible in the worldof video games, that a title capable of obtaining good critical and commercial results is not followed within a more or less short period of time by a sequel eager to repeat its success. Not even the heroic X-Men mutants escape this simple law of the market: and in fact, after a series of not exactly unforgettable games, they immediately took advantage of the good feedback from X-Men Legends to try to slip the one-two punch with a second episode as timely as possible.
