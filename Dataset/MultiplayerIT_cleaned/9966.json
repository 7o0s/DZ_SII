{"name": "Ravenlok", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/ravenlok-recensione.html", "text": "Difficult not to notice the games of the Cococucumber team even in the midst of the anthology of stylish indies that invade the market at a regular rate: the choice of the particular voxel leads to an unmistakable trait, so much so that it has made it a sort of stylistic code for their productions. Ravenlok's review should certify the achievement of the pinnacle of the ~voxel trilogy~ conceived by the developers and, in some respects, the goal is undoubtedly achieved, even if perhaps we would have liked to see greater maturity also achieved in terms of structure and gameplay, as well as the aesthetics and atmosphere that could alone be worth the ticket price. The team's intention was precisely this: to create an interactive fairy tale capable of recalling Alice in Wonderland and mixing it with gothic and classic teen movie, with those inspirations from the 80s that now represent a constant in the productions of Cococucumber, as we had already appreciated in the preview of Ravenlok. From this point of view, the operation was fully successful, because the game really drags us into a strange story built according to the most classic trappings of the fairy tale, starting from the morphological elements of Propp's theory. For the rest, it also builds on it a well-made action adventure as regards the mix of action and puzzles, although everything is rather diluted in side missions and a level of challenge set a little too low. Through the mirror Ravenlok in front of the queen's castle The story is deliberately kept simple, developing according to the standard plot of the fairy tale: the protagonist is Ravenlok, a raven-haired girl who has just moved into an old family home in the countryside at the behest of her parents. She is not very convinced of the choice, which reveals the classic dynamic of the teenager who finds herself thrown from a known world to one to be built, bringing out her most rebellious and adventurous side. The question is barely mentioned, because the game doesn't linger too much on dialogues and introspections, limiting itself to staging exchanges that could come directly from an illustrated book for children: however, we note a basic allegory, with the protagonist who decides to put his liveliness and desire for rebellion at the service of a revolt in the strange fantasy world he finds when crossing the old mirror discovered in the stable. The reference to Lewis Carroll's writings is clear and is a characteristic element of the whole game. Through the looking glass, Ravenlok finds a wonderful world populated by strange talking creatures and equipped with incredible scenery, but over which the threat of an evil queen hangs, who has subjugated the inhabitants by breaking the peace and serenity of the place. Ravenlok in the early stages of the world ~through the looking glass~ Fulfilling an ancient prophecy that spoke of a black-haired savior, our heroine enthusiastically sets out on a mission to free the world from the queen's game, but to do so she must first collect three emblems with which to open the castle gate. each of which connected to various chained missions. The construct is elementary, but rightly so: the fairy tale is fully respected in its structural terms (initial situation, complication, development and ending), reflecting Propp's scheme and most of the classic actants. After all, much of the charm comes from the visual representation of the world of Ravenlok, which fully manages to transport us to fantastic and varied worlds. Action and adventure The masque theater is particularly successful in Ravenlok Also on the gameplay front, Ravenlok seems to refer to classic models without adding practically anything new, staging a ~mannered~ action adventure that looks to Zelda with some action RPG elements, but always remaining very light. All too light, to tell the truth: despite the presence of some spectacular clashes with various bosses, the game never sinks the blow, always remaining on a very low level of difficulty. This leads us to think that the potentially most suitable audience is particularly young, also given the narrative mode chosen, although it is a product suitable for different age groups. With a slightly raised third-person view, we find ourselves exploring the wonderful landscapes by eliminating various enemies without too much effort with the use of the sword and some special techniques that are conquered by advancing in the game, to be managed respecting the associated classic cooldowns. Some bosses are spectacular Dodge and shield complete the picture of the system dthe combat, actually not very developed but still able to offer a few moments of satisfaction especially during the fight against some bosses. For the rest, a large part of the game mechanics is based on the solution of puzzles and the completion of the numerous quests which are triggered by talking to characters around the strange realm. There are some puzzles that require a minimum of concentration, above all to put together the clues scattered throughout the disparate scenarios that we find ourselves exploring, but in principle the missions are directed above all on the tracks of the classic ~collection missions~ that see us go around retrieving items and bring them to the various NPCs. In line with the general superficiality of the gameplay, the few RPG elements are limited to a progression between levels that leads to a simple incremental logic of the statistics, with the leveling that takes place by manually investing the experience points at a ~bank~ for the enhancement of the protagonist . A wonderful world in voxels Ravenlok's vistas are always mesmerizing The greatest strength of Ravenlok lies in its particular aesthetics, which derives from the voxel graphic style that has become a real stylistic signature of the Cococucumber team. Not for nothing, the very concept of a ~voxel trilogy~ at the base of the three main titles developed by the team (Riverbond, Echo Generation and Ravenlok) has a stylistic characterization, which evidently turns out to have great importance in the design of the games themselves. On this front, the game achieves its goal perfectly, managing to create a fantastic and wonderful world that is truly a pleasure to explore and of which we would like to continue to see new settings, in the continuous and sudden changes of sets and atmospheres to which we are subjected. The team has achieved considerable mastery in the management of the voxel, which in this case is mixed with more complex 3D structures and models in order to also present softer and more refined shapes and surfaces, but still maintaining the typical angularity of this type of stylization. The only partially modifiable shot still manages to always present a good portion of the scenario, contributing to the ~expository clarity~ which is typical of the whole game, in its general simplicity. The desire to kidnap the player in the particular fairy-tale atmospheres is also evident from the amount of times in which Ravenlok lingers on panoramic observation points that allow for wider views of this strange wonderland. For the rest, the orchestral musical accompaniment is the right complement to the general climate, even if it is a bit repetitive.", "date": "2023-05-10", "grade": "7.0"}
