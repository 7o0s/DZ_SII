The platform created by Mark Cerny winked at the great titles of the past but proved unable to give the public the same emotions, due to the most disparate reasons. The combat system was mundane, the story lacked depth, and ultimately the whole game felt like it was too lightly developed. Apparently, however, the projects for Knack were not limited to just one opening chapter and therefore, almost surprisingly, a sequel arrives on store shelves today that is not particularly awaited but which promises to patch up the mistakes of the past. Japan Studio has certainly grown in recent years and user feedback may have been fundamental in giving Knack 2 a new face, finally making it a pleasant title to play while remaining aimed at a young audience. Enlarge your Knack The goblins are back on the attack threatening the world and it will once again be up to Knack and his faithful adventure companion Lucas to put things right. Don't expect a particularly deep or exciting plot but rather a linear story without major twists designed solely to give the player a reason to continue through the levels and jump seamlessly from one setting to another. In Knack 2 we will thus pass from city locations to fiery deserts, meeting frozen lands and intricate jungles, in a series of clichs seen and overseen in all the titles of the genre. Some well-known faces also return to the delight of the fans, among which we cannot fail to mention Ryder and Vargas, who will always remain marginal to the narrative, while new antagonists will undermine the evil Gundahar (or almost). More than ten different levels are crossed, for a total duration of the campaign of about eight or nine hours, which can be further extended if you want to discover all the secret passages and collect every single collectible. As usual, the hidden passages do not require particular ingenuity to be identified but rather a trained eye and the desire to meticulously sift through every smallest nook and cranny. The rewards that await you are particularly useful, however, given that crystals are hidden in the hidden chests to change the appearance of Knack but also powerful gadgets thanks to which you can obtain fairly interesting passive bonuses. You will thus be able to take advantage of a teleportation in case you fall into a precipice or even a viewer that will show the vital energy of the enemies on the screen. All tools designed to lower a challenge that is not particularly difficult in itself and in any case mitigated by the possibility of choosing between different levels of difficulty. Japan Studios therefore seems to have learned from its mistakes and have adapted its Knack to the target audience, simplifying the title but letting the player decide how much sweat to throw on the game. With the difficulty set to normal, for example, Knack 2 runs smoothly and without a hitch, with the deaths that occur almost exclusively during the platform phases, allowing the fun to prevail over the frustration tasted in the first chapter. Size matters 2 Even the clashes are back significantly improved, with a higher number of moves than in the past. The basics are the same as in the first chapter, with enemies equipped with a good variety of attacks, all to be dodged, parried or rejected, in the case of those from a distance, and then responded quickly with short combinations of kicks, grips and punches. Nothing particularly sophisticated or brainy is clear but always pleasant to play. Knack retains its ability to absorb relics scattered throughout the game world, increasing its size and consequently becoming more aggressive, resistant and dangerous. The bigger we are, the more damage we will cause and the slow and heavy gait of our virtual alter ego returns good feedback. The difficulty of the clashes is cushioned this time by an automatic health regeneration, with the lost relics rejoining Knack automatically after a short period of time, allowing a more daring approach to the clashes. In short, forget about dying from a fortuitous blow from an opponent and also all the rage that followed. Knack has learned new moves and his offensive arsenal has grown to the point of offering him different combat options, to be further improved thanks to a system of talents to be unlocked with the classic experience points, obtained by killing enemies. Knack 2 moves within safe confines, leaning on simple thingslicit and basic but exploiting them in the best possible way. In this case it seems that Japan Studios did not want to take excessive risks, a choice that is anything but senseless given the results of the first chapter. Thus the possibility of absorbing various elements and materials in a similar way to what happened in the original title also returns, with solutions designed, however, to give greater depth to the environmental puzzles and exploration rather than further weighing down the duel mechanics. Impossible not to love even the little one Knack 2 also tries to improve the exploration and platforming phase despite the use of the fixed camera, which alternates moments in 2.5D with larger sections, and things aren't going so badly. The calculation of the depth for the jumps is almost always optimal but it is the riddles and puzzles that guarantee the necessary variety so as not to get bored. You play with Knack's relics as weight to use trampolines and elevators, you work your wits to open secret passages and you also use the conduction of electricity to bring energy to deactivated structures. The intent is to amuse the player without ever stressing him, meeting the little ones even with an always available help command, thus avoiding the impossibility of being stuck in one point due to a too difficult riddle. Fights and puzzles/platforms divide the various levels equally, adding in this case also spectacular sections where you can take advantage of the quick time events while enjoying the action. The response of the commands is good and it will not be unusual to have to quickly zoom in and out of Knack, abandoning all the relics behind him to overcome some more dynamic sections, with well-designed, albeit not particularly original, level design choices. When Kanck gets rid of the excess relics, the combat is almost always set aside, preferring to let the player work only with intelligence, even proposing some stealth sections with which to grapple, a clear sign of how Japan Studios wanted to be forgiven for the excessive flatness of the first chapter. The co-op for two players with a fast and functional drop in / drop out system also takes care of adding even more irons to the fire. When playing in two on the same console, a whole series of interactions between the two heroes are activated on the screen, with combined attacks and moves to be performed in unison and a comfortable teleportation is also added during the platform phases so that you can drag towards yourself the least skilled player. A solution clearly designed to encourage family games and already exploited by many other titles belonging to the genre. I only enjoy it in HD Knack 2 arrives on the market taking full advantage of the support for PlayStation 4 pro, putting three different types of display on the plate. If you prefer constant 60 frames per second then you just need to choose the appropriate mode to guarantee the frame rate, while if you want a higher resolution you can push Knack 2 up to a resolution of 3200x1800 using checkerboard rendering, however losing about 15 frames per second. In case you have not yet switched to the new Sony home console instead, you will have to settle for a resolution of 1080p but at a frame rate that will constantly fluctuate between 40 and 50 frames per second with the QTE sections anchored instead at 30. The animation sector is sufficient but does not particularly shine, as well as the settings, various but not beautiful to look at. A separate discussion for the enemies instead, with the old goblins also seen in the first Knack reproposed with a shameless copy paste, only to then recover in the second half of the game when giant robots and tanks enter the scene, to be faced and piloted, giving that push further to a title that had so much to be forgiven and that, perhaps, this time he succeeded.", "date": "2017-09-05", "grade": "7.5"}
