{"name": "Irreversibile", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/157931-life-is-strange-episode-5-polarized-irreversibile.html", "text": "Life is Strange is a series consisting of five episodes. This is the review of the fifth episode, written and spoken in English. Contains cruel spoilers. Max wakes up in Mark Jefferson's darkroom, a maniac fixated on the search for the moment in which purity, understood as a union between youth and innocence, is tainted by corruption. Perhaps it is no coincidence then that Max wears a shirt with a death's head sphinx drawn on it, one of the clues on which agent Starling investigates in the Silence of the Lambs. The beginning of the fifth episode suffers from the lengths that have characterized each episode of Life is Strange, with the characters who can't resist explaining in every detail what they feel and want, without leaving much room for subtext, but it's only a small initial toll for what is one of the most complete and satisfying endings encountered in this genre of games. It's also an ending where you watch a lot and play a little, but that's now an integral part of the genre. Thankfully, when it's time to play, the decisions you make matter. The writers make us experience an escalation that ends up cornering us in a credible but surprising way. When the end credits appear, we have finally established who Max Caulfield really is, at least as regards his vision of life and the world in that precise season of his existence. Well, if you've followed us up to here, you'll know that we've never been fascinated by Max and his world. The events of Life is Strange have always sounded false, remote, still on the surface. And that inexplicable tornado we feared was a Lost-style gimmick - we put it because it causes havoc but God only knows we'll find a valid reason before the end. As if the writers of Life is Strange didn't have full control over what they were creating. Instead it is clear that they knew their stuff. The tornado has an explanation, the apparent superficiality of the events too, and Max finally casts the mask of the perfect girl that everyone must love to show the disturbances and shadows that stir in her conscience as in that of every human being. But let's go in order, indeed, according to the scheme of Life is Strange, let's do everything in reverse, let's start from the end. Which is then the beginning. Life is Strange: Polarized takes the story to its extreme, and gives meaning to the series Willing is power? At the end of the series (tremendous spoiler coming), Max is alone with her friend Chloe in front of the famous tornado. We learn that the environmental havoc is a consequence of the havoc Max caused when he first saved Chloe's life. Since that moment, fate, the universe, God or any force superior to the will of individuals has tried to correct the error by directing Chloe towards a new death. But each time Max has resisted, and in doing so has created more and more disorder in the fabric of nature. That's why the story always seemed to remain on the surface: Max was trying with all his might to prevent any harmful alterations. Yet something always eluded her; new little coincidences added up and created branches that Max could no longer keep under control. Until it was no longer possible to contain the force of nature that manifested itself at the gates of Arcadia Bay. Faced with the terrifying tornado, Max must choose whether to let Chloe die that crucial day, and thus prevent a disaster that will claim many lives in the town, or oppose the supreme and indifferent will of nature and save her friend. Even at the expense of the many people who will be killed by the tornado. The ancient theme of self-determination adds up here to the insoluble dilemma of whether the life of an individual is worth as much as the life of many. Luckily for us, the game gives us the chance to make this impossible decision ourselves. However, before reaching this climax, Polarized takes us back and forth in time during a dream sequence that lasts throughout the central development of the story. We relive past scenes but with a new awareness, and we see the fate of people dear to Max that is shaped and altered in the face of our decisions. In this chaos there is also room for some particularly satisfying moments, such as when we talk to Jefferson during the class lesson of the first episode, knowing however that he is a sadistic murderer, or when we finally choose whether or not Warren is something more than a simple friend. Even our feelings towards Chloe are finally made clear, in a love triangle influenced by many choices made in previous episodes. In fact, it is not enough to replay the quinto episode twice to experiment with all alternatives. The train of causes and consequences of Life is Strange is in fact much more complicated than it may seem. Many past decisions intersect to produce or not certain effects in the final. Just think that if in the fourth episode we tried to protect Victoria, in the fifth chapter we discover that our generosity killed her. And this is just one of the many narrative lines with an ironic ending that occur when playing Life is Strange. Everyone can draw their own conclusion. He said something very clear to us: the results of our choices do not depend on the goodness or otherwise of our reasons. And it's not a trivial topic to think about. The yellow on which the whole story focuses, while another story develops in the background, represents the reality that Max cannot fix. In the end, someone will love it, someone will hate it, and someone else will have to die. Max, and we with her, is forced to find her own place in the universe. And when you think about it, that's not a bad thing at all.", "date": "2015-10-22", "grade": "8.0"}
