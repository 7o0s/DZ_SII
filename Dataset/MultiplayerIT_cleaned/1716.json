{"name": "Metroid Prime", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/metroid-prime-5.html", "text": "GBA connection Like a large part of the recent Nintendo production for the GameCube, Metroid Prime also offers interesting connectivity options with the GameBoy Advance, through the use of the appropriate connection cable: in fact, having a copy of Metroid Fusion for GBA it is possible to unlock juicy extras. By successfully completing Prime and connecting it to Fusion, it is possible to use Samus with the particular suit that characterizes her in the GBA version, instead completing Fusion will unlock the possibility of playing a full version of the first, legendary Metroid for NES directly on GameCube. With the possibility of being able to save your progress directly on the memory card. Please don't call it FPS Of course, the view is that: in first person from the eyes of Samus Aran, the beautiful historical heroine of the series, all blond hair, big blue eyes and mechanized suit with built-in plasma cannon. But the similarities between Prime and classic first person shooters stop there. The new Metroid is something different: there are those who hastened to coin the term FPA, first person adventure, for the occasion, welcoming the birth of a completely new game genre, but analyzing the situation coldly it is not exactly so . Metroid Prime offers a new gaming experience, but it is not innovative in itself, it does not create a genre never seen before: on the contrary, it skillfully combines and mixes already tested playful elements and systems to perfection, adding its own to it. And the final result fully hits the target: Prime is irrefutably, unequivocally Metroid in three dimensions, a journey into memory and into the clichs of the saga with an exquisitely retro taste overbearingly updated by a cutting-edge technical realization and exceptional game gimmicks design. From the very first moments of the game it is clear how the greatest efforts of the Retros have been concentrated in painstaking research and maniacal reproduction in three dimensions of all those elements that have made the previous chapters of the series great and unforgettable. There is exploration, with a large, coherent world that offers complete and total freedom of movement to the player. There is the action, with frenetic, spectacular and strategy-rich clashes with space pirates and the other creatures that populate the planet Tallon IV, theater of adventure. And above all there is that pervasive, oppressive feeling of being strangers in a foreign world and alone, damned alone on an alien planet, surrounded by hostile entities whose sole purpose is to end our existence. Not a contact with another human being for the duration of the adventure, not an external help: the player-Samus will be able to count exclusively on his own strength to save the universe from a threat as dark as it is terrible, left to himself on a planet dead for millennia, among the ruins of a civilization, that of the Chozo, which communicates with us only through ancient inscriptions and prophecies. Lots of extras for the PAL For once it was worth waiting for the PAL version of the game. The work done by Nintendo of Europe on the local edition of Prime is in fact masterful. In fact, not only is the translation of the game, with manual and screen text entirely in Italian, excellent, but a considerable amount of extras has been added, not present in either the US or Japanese versions of the game. More spoken, in English, both in the presentation and during the game and, hear hear, a revised difficulty level upwards, with more resistant and tough enemies and fewer bonuses. It goes without saying that the game fully supports 60hz display mode. Retro's designers have thoroughly studied Nintendo's unwritten bible of game design, and they demonstrate this in every single step and gimmick implemented in Metroid Prime. The game, strongly oriented towards exploration and action, introduces and takes full advantage of some interesting elements such as the use of different viewers (including a thermal viewer and an X-ray viewer, very useful for discovering secret passages and the weak points of certain opponents), with the ability to ~scan~ a multitude of objects and enemies to enrich a database of information and ~Logs~, written communications through which to follow the plot of the game. An intriguing gameplay mechanism that pushes you to explore and search for the element to scan, triggering a perverse information collecting mechanism a-la Pokmon. The plot supporting the game is little more than a pretext, but it is still well structured and functional to the gameplay, helping the player to immerse himself in the suggestive atmospheres of Tallon IV, placing him at the center of the adventure without oppressing him and being intrusive. The control systemo, true fulcrum and basic element of every Game with a capital G, is almost perfect, and has been refined to make the most of it in the peculiar structure offered by Prime. The player-controller-console interface is instinctive, although it requires a minimum of learning given its substantial difference with the control modules of classic FPS, a genre to which, we repeat, Prime does not belong: let's forget about the double stick or keyboard combination and mouse to simultaneously control movements and view, given that in the new Metroid the left stick of the joypad controls both Samus' movements and, after pressing the appropriate key, the direction of her/our gaze. The focus is therefore all on movement and the entire system aims to offer the most natural and comfortable interface possible for exploring the game environments. An example above all of how the system works wonderfully comes from the management of jumps, the direction and length of which is always difficult to perceive and judge in a game with an exclusively first person view: well in Prime, after a minimum of initial practice, the he jumping action is natural and instinctive, so much so that there are entire levels full of platforming. However, it is necessary to point out that, although the system works excellently, in some situations one feels the lack of the possibility of moving while at the same time moving one's gaze in another direction. But we are still talking about very sporadic moments. Another fundamental difference with standard FPS, in addition to the impossibility of orienting gaze and movement independently, is given by the peculiar combat system, which places the emphasis not so much on the need to aim precisely, the real cornerstone in classic first person shooters , how much to discover and apply the right strategy to beat each opponent, while taking into account the surrounding environment. Once we have directed our gaze towards an enemy, in fact, it is enough to press the appropriate key to focus our attention on him and activate a lock-on function in all respects similar to the Z-Targeting introduced for the first time in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time: in this way you keep your gaze and weapon constantly pointed in the right direction, but it is up to the player's ability to discover the weak points and movement patterns of each enemy and apply a winning strategy, while taking care to avoid any attacks. It is necessary, in this juncture, to point out the excellent artificial intelligence with which the space pirates are equipped, Samus's real natural enemies together with the Metroids: especially in the advanced stages of the game it is impossible not to be stunned by the cunning of some tactics of attack and defense of the most intelligent opponents. A second opinion Metroid Prime succeeds in the almost impossible intent of taking a famous series, completely distorting its graphic approach (and not only) while keeping the feeling and atmosphere that made the Samus saga perfectly intact. Despite some marginal and completely undiscussed flaws, the work done by US programmers is incredible and lays solid foundations to say the least for the continuation of the Metroid name in the era of the polygon. Definitely a must buy. Edited by Andrea ~Sano~ Palmisano Another strong point of Prime is the level design, absolutely one of the best we've ever seen. Environments full of details and gameplay ideas, incredible for variety, so much so that you never come across two rooms or corridors, even if only similar to each other. The game structure, linear in itself but with full freedom of movement, is however by its very nature strongly oriented towards backtracking, or rather the need for the player to retrace his steps several times by repeatedly visiting the same environments. Fortunately, backtracking in Metroid Prime is not heavy at all, as the possibility of obtaining new powers, and therefore of visiting previously unreachable areas, invites the player to explore and sift through the same stages several times in search of new passages and bonuses. Then there is to point out how, intelligently, the enemies that populate a given area change several times during the game, always keeping the level of challenge and the variety of action quite high. The longevity is also excellent, which far exceeds twenty hours of play, considering that the internal clock that calculates our stay on Tallon IV stops while we are reading the logs or consulting the map, and in fact does not take into account the time lost in following any inevitable deaths that force the player to repeat the same sequence several times. Done thatI'm still sporadic given the excellent calibration of the difficulty level of the game. Sci-fi realization In addition to a leading play structure Metroid Prime can boast a technical sector of absolute importance, so much so that it can be defined as one of the best games in terms of audio and video of the current 128bit era. The graphics engine is undoubtedly one of the best ever made, capable of moving masses of polygons with ease, which form complex three-dimensional structures and detailed enemies, without batting an eyelid and without ever falling below the threshold of the proverbial 60 frames per second. ensuring exceptional fluidity. And the textures are also exceptional, on which we can see a few too many pixels only by bringing our virtual eyes too close and the visual effects, with exceptional plays of light and ingenious tricks to increase the sensation of presence and immersion of the player: we only mention the condensation that clouds up the armor visor due to sudden changes in temperature or the reflections of Samus' face when you are too close to a strong light source. A feast for the eyes therefore, but not only: to accompany us in our wanderings on Tallon IV, in fact, in addition to the excellent sound effects, the fabulous soundtrack by Kenji Yamamoto, historical composer of the saga. An evocative soundtrack, which adapts perfectly to the alien atmospheres by loading the player's sense of loneliness and estrangement. Simply brilliant. Comment For longtime users, a simple sentence is enough: it's Super Metroid in three dimensions. For the others we limit ourselves to repeating verbatim some of the concepts already expressed at the beginning of the review: Metroid Prime is a rare pearl, a masterpiece of game design, the best transposition of a classic 2D in three dimensions (Mario 64 permitting), a killer application for GameCube and one of the most solid technical-artistic bulwarks of the 128bit era. I would say that nothing else needs to be said. Pro Captures the classic essence of Metroid and brings it back in three dimensions Fresh and original game structure, top-notch gameplay Fantastic technical realization Excellent PAL adaptation A legendary series, a character of undisputed charisma, all the difficulties of transposing the sensations and game structure of a saga that made the history of video games into three dimensions. The task facing Retro Studios, the newborn US division of Nintendo, was far from simple: a minimal mistake would have been enough to challenge credibility and, what is worse, send one of the franchises on which the big N plus was aiming to gain a slice of the so-called 'adult market'. Just the fact that a US team would take care of the new Metroid, and that the series would abandon the tested two-dimensional structure, made all the purists turn up their noses at the time of the first announcement, and the situation got progressively worse over the months subsequent, with the succession of alarming rumors about the actual quality of the game and with continuous friction between Nintendo and the (then) high echelons of Retro Studios. Then came E3 2002 and a short demo, in fact the introductory-tutorial level, was enough to sweep away any doubts and make Prime leap to the top of the personal ranking of most wanted titles of a good portion of the gaming population. Miyamoto's magical fluid and NCL's continuous supervision of the project have done the miracle: Metroid Prime is a rare pearl, a game design masterpiece, the best transposition of a classic 2D in three dimensions (Mario 64 permitting), a killer application for GameCube and one of the most solid technical-artistic bulwarks of the 128bit era. All enclosed in an eight-centimeter diameter silver disk that is finally available, to the delight of the Italian people, also in the European version.", "date": "2003-03-21", "grade": null}
