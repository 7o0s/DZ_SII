This rule applies more or less to everything on this planet, but when it comes to products that need to be sold and lasted, the rule becomes a mission, an obligation, to the point of being the only true faith to submit to. PUBG (or Playerunknown's Battlegrounds to be more precise) has lived a double life. A title that has brought the genre of battle royale to the peak of public demand, it is also the one that most of all has experienced the competition of the light-hearted cousin and without too many pretensions to realism. The war between PUBG and Fortnite has been at the basis of the gaming market in recent months and has brought with it great confirmations and just as many question marks. Where it seemed that users wanted the most immersive and plausible experience possible, the Epic title changed the cards on the table, thanks to important choices such as cross play on consoles and the not negligible possibility of being played for free. These elements have prompted the Korean boys of PUBG corp to take a different path. Standing by their principles, they worked to bring a particular map to market. Smaller and more frenetic, changing a lot of the approach to the game, but not eliminating the tactical foundations that made it the most played title last year. Three maps and lots of content When we reviewed PUBG last December, we were talking about an undefeated title. It is true that the pressure of Fortnite's user growth was starting to be felt, but the power of thirty million paying users and the great success on platforms such as Twitch, allowed PUBG to still stand as the undisputed king of its genre. A little over six months later, luck seems to have turned its gaze and, if it is true that it still maintains a hard core of fans and a good amount of investment in regards to events and tournaments, the Korean title no longer enjoys the favor of the general public. It certainly cannot be said that the game is left to itself. The updates continue to arrive almost daily, but it is the additions and the real news that are in hiding. To date PUBG is the only battle royale able to count on three maps available, complete with the possibility of filtering one's choice based on current preferences. There where the first, Erangel, still remains the main choice of the players; the second, Miramar, after an initial period of excitement, has given way to the reality of a battlefield that is too large and often a harbinger of long and exhausting outings in the cosmic void. It is for this reason, and for the need to get closer to the players of the competition, that Sanhok was born, the third and last map, with a forest and tropical setting, significantly smaller and more frenetic than the previous two. Always one hundred players and the same amount of paraphernalia scattered around the map, but in such a small perimeter as to lead the players to collide in almost every point of the terrain. From the idea of making the games more frenetic, the result of these months of testing before the launch, has resulted in something new for PUBG players, but this does not mean that the relationship of trust created with those players who they have always preferred tactics to the wildest delirium. Small agglomerations of huts give way to rural areas, up to lush bushes that reward positioning and knowledge of the map. Precisely this conformation, aided by hills and valleys, justifies a teamwork and a tactic that remain at the base of the PUBG gameplay. Working on outflanking operations and natural covers are just one of the possible approaches. And precisely the smaller extension makes it difficult to think of spending entire quarters of an hour not firing a single shot. This net of a single problem of the pace of the matches which, despite the work of recent months, is still not completely resolved. Often and willingly you will find yourself in servers that will halve within a matter of minutes, making the initial and final phases of the games a real massacre. This leaves room for slightly slower central sections, which sometimes end up breaking the pace of the action a bit. Nothing devastating from the point of view of the experience, but there is no doubt that a map like Sanhok, designed for the brevity of the games and the frenzy of the fights, could confuse some players in the middle of the matches. Graphics and optimization Given the latest implementations, it is appropriate to take stock of the situation on what PUBG graphics are and their optimization. It's uselesshide behind a finger: the nature of PC products in early access has given way to a substantial change in the approach to the market. Titles far from complete arrive on Steam and make good times and bad times. In recent months we have finally seen the final release of some of these games and PUBG is the best example. After a very short gestation period, which lasted about nine months, its final version fixed several flaws, giving us a title that was not perfect, but certainly worthy of interest. With another six months behind us, the situation is still improving and it's hard to believe the few who still deem it an unmanageable game unless you have a NASA machine. We are certainly not talking about a title that puts a polygonal mass and textures on the plate to justify who knows what technical resource, but for this very reason, seeing how the game runs smoothly today and without too many hitches, only brings a few smiles. Above all, the new map, also thanks to the reduction of the extension, is a pleasure for the eyes. Certainly there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of animations, but what is functional to the gameplay runs as it should. The same can be said of the audio sector, which has improved a lot from the point of view of spatiality, but certainly still passable with certain expedients.", "date": "2018-07-03", "grade": "8.0"}
