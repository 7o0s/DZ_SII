Where fans start applauding a shonen, you know, there is always Bandai Namco in disguise ready to take notes to develop a themed game. The Seven Deadly Sins: Knights of Britannia is the first in the franchise, and arrives exclusively on PlayStation 4 offering us the frenetic clashes between the Holy Knights and the Deadly Sins. All without neglecting a bit of narration linked to the actual plot, useful for those who have never heard of Nakaba Suzuki's work. How did it go? Let's say that there is still a lot to improve, but in the end nobody is perfect: the Deadly Sins teach us that. Forgive my sins The Seven Deadly Sins: Knights of Britannia is a perfect opportunity to get in touch with Suzuki's work, in the form of a videogame product. Of course, those who follow the story of his characters will live in a constant state of excitement for the ten hours necessary to complete the main story, but even those who have never heard of the Deadly Sins before will be able to enjoy the game. One of its main advantages (there are not many, in fact) is that it faithfully follows the narrative arcs released so far, even if there is not the time to delve into the backstory of each important character as one should. The events revolve around the mission of Elizabeth and Meliodas: to reunite the Seven Deadly Sins to save the kingdom of Lionesse. Long ago the Deadly Sins were the paladins of the realm, mighty warriors. While each had committed a terrible crime, the source of their immortality, they had protected the kingdom of Britannia from outside threats. However, they were accused of having killed a Holy Knight, Zaratras, therefore they were defeated, dispersed, and considered real wanted. In reality, not even the Holy Knights were to be these very good people: now that they have hatched a plot to overthrow the king and take control of the entire Lionesse, Britain's hope lies in Elizabeth, the daughter of the rightful ruler. And it consists precisely in bringing together the seven ancient warriors to defeat the Holy Knights. Knights of Britannia then allows us to travel throughout the entire kingdom of Lionesse, moving the Hawk piglet on the game map as if it were a ~pawn~, and reopen our inn (the Boar Hat) in every important town. The inn acts as an improvised hub and as a ~menu~ of the story mode: from here we will be able to undertake the various main missions, the secondary ones, or enhance our characters with new magical objects. Knights of britannia is a curious hybrid between action and fighting game: for the most part it simply asks us to control one of the Deadly Sins in a small area, and to take out a certain number of enemies before time runs out. The standard opponents, the simple knights, have no hope of facing one of our immortals: it is possible to overcome most of the levels simply by moving from time to time and spamming the same attacks to the bitter end, given that the overall difficulty of the title is at historic lows. From time to time, however, we also switch to a real fighting game, albeit simplified: and here the influence of Naruto Shippuden is felt. Our hero, in these cases, has to face only one opponent, and this time at his height. Usually it is a Holy Knight with particular powers: Gilthunder fights with lightning, Guila dominates the explosions, but there are really all those of the work. Each character available to the player has the same types of attack: Triangle for the heavy blow, Square for the light one, Circle for the ranged blows. The spells use the same keys, accompanied by the simultaneous pressing of R1. Finally, the final, devastating move of each Deadly Sin: after having accumulated enough energy in the pink sidebar, we will be able to use R2 to unleash our Sin. Playstation 4 trophies The Seven Deadly Sins: Knights of Britannia gives away a platinum trophy that is particularly easy to obtain. To unlock all trophies you will need to complete Story Mode, and get an S rank for all main and side missions. It seems like a tall order, but after all it isn't, given the difficulty of the title tending downwards. We will then have to perform each character's special move at least once, and in general try them all a bit: thanks to the Duel Mode they will always be at hand, after having unlocked them in the main storyline. Devastating clashes, but little convincentives Bandai wanted to propose with The Seven Deadly Sins: Knights of Britannia all the dynamism of the clashes of the anime. And he succeeded, because they are made very faithfully. The pity is that everything turns out to be too unbalanced: the clashes against normal soldiers pass, which in any case are repeated in missions that are all terribly the same until the end of the game. But even when we face the Holy Knights, or other Deadly Sins, it is clear that some are too much more powerful than others. Take little King for example: he's practically unplayable. The idea was to give him an edge in close combat, but try to make him compete with Melodias any who start throwing ranged attacks at him in bursts. After a few minutes he will be defeated, mainly because, in contrast, King's ranged attacks are too slow and inaccurate to have any effect. The same goes for some characters with truly devastating finishing moves due to the speed and amount of damage inflicted. The imbalance is acceptable playing story missions, online it becomes more problematic. Knights of Britannia, in fact, also offers a second game mode, simply called Duels. Here the soul of the fighting game is the master: you choose the warriors, you choose the arena, and the blows fly in medieval Britain. It is also possible to play locally with a friend, and provided you choose Sins and Knights that are equivalent, here the title gives some satisfaction. But elsewhere there aren't many others. The ~rumour~ mechanic in open inns for Lionesse is fun and original, but it's a mere indicator of game progress, disguised as something more. The jokes of the characters, before, after and during the battles, are 2-3 each, and are always repeated the same. The game arenas are terribly bare. The missions are all the same. From a technical standpoint it doesn't get much better: the camera occasionally goes its own way, the enemy lock system (which is automatic) graduated from the same faculty as the camera, and conspicuous drops in frame rates of occasionally they visibly slow down the title, especially in the most agitated phases. In short, more defects than merits, however it must be considered that fans of the Seven Deadly Sins will be able to ignore them all in order to enjoy the adventures of their favorites on the home TV, beating up the Holy Knights. After all, the charisma of the characters is rendered perfectly, as are the atmospheres, and there are some nice winks at the fans. But without really solid mechanics, we find ourselves in our hands a barrel simulator halfway between action and fighting game, not very solid, not very finished, which cannot offer more than a few hours of fun.
