{"name": "Hogwarts Legacy", "ref": "https://multiplayer.it/recensioni/hogwarts-legacy-recensione.html", "text": "Twenty-six years have passed since an innocent child mysteriously survived an attack by the most powerful dark wizard of all time. Twenty-six years since little Harry Potter, resident of number four Privet Drive, received the unexpected letter of admission to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, throwing open the gates to a magical world he captured within its welcoming confines millions of children and young people scattered across the five continents. Twenty-six years studded with spells, stories, films and video games that have explored every corner of the Wizarding World, giving a second life to the pages of the novels to the point of imprinting them on fire in the hearts of fans. an irreplaceable life partner for well over a generation, if it has turned into a safe haven ready to lighten even the most difficult moments, it had never happened to actually be able to cross the doors of the great hall of Hogwarts, to follow the lessons, to spend the night in the dormitories of the castle, in short, to caress the life beyond the ink promised by Hogwarts Legacy. The title of Avalanche Software is a creature with a dual soul, with changing forms: for some, in fact, it is a role-playing game like many others, set in an open world taken from a famous literary saga; for others, however, it represents the realization of an impossible dream that has been harbored with hope for decades. Through which lens should it be viewed? With the loving gaze of the first-hour enthusiast, or with the critical eye of the severe father who nitpicks? It's time to wake up from that lifelong dream: Hogwarts Legacy is without a doubt the best video game dedicated to the world of Harry Potter ever made, a tribute to the wizarding world embroidered with great care and overflowing with content. But his is a path made of lights and shadows, of flashes and stumbles, of great beauty and cumbersome imperfections. The more intense the love one feels for the Harry Potter universe, the more dazzling its positive sides will become, to the point of making the veil that separates the experience from the actual game almost invisible. But if the result pursued was to take the enthusiasts by the hand and lead them through the backdrops and atmospheres of the saga, then it can be said to be fully achieved. As? We tell you about it in our review of Hogwarts Legacy. Once upon a time... Welcome to your new home We are in 1890. Albus Dumbledore is still too young to attend Hogwarts, the birth of Harry Potter is ninety years in the future, while the headmaster of the school is the hated Phineas Nigellus Black, progenitor of the famous Sirius. The wizarding world is in turmoil: still burned by the riots of 1752, the Ministry of Magic shows concern for the uprisings that are maturing among the Goblins, led by the revolutionary Ranrok and strangely active in the Scottish countryside. But otherwise life in the Wizarding World proceeds as if nothing had happened, between trains full of students marching towards the highlands and droves of magical families who flock to the enchanted shops of the village of Hogsmeade. It is in this frame that the protagonist - or the protagonist - of Hogwarts Legacy enters the scene, a blank canvas on which to draw with the imagination to give life to one's alter ego. Its peculiarity? For some strange reason he was taken over by the magical world a few years late, therefore he will be admitted to the fifth year of Hogwarts school on a very exceptional basis. In order to fill the gaps due to this condition he is joined by Professor Eleazar Fig, and it will be in the course of training that the strange couple will make a disconcerting discovery: the young wizard has a mysterious link with ancient magic, a source of power lost for centuries and once capable of erecting none other than the legendary walls of Hogwarts. An ancestral force that appeals to many, especially the aforementioned goblin Ranrok and the dark wizard Victor Rookwood, leader of a group of feared mercenaries sadly known as Ashwinder. Hogwarts Legacy wastes no time and immediately jumps into the heart of the adventure Thus begins the journey of the new ~chosen one~, a long training course marked by the passing of the seasons. While the colors of autumn fade together with the yellowed leaves and give way to the first snows of winter, the adventure proceeds split in half, treating in parallel fragments of everyday life within the walls of Hogwarts and a secret mission on which the future of the whole magical universe. It's a double life: on the one hand they datelessons, friendships are cultivated, one gets lost in the labyrinthine corridors of the school and bumps his nose against all facets of magical education; on the other hand, however, we are confronted with dangers that go far beyond the preparation of a fifth year student, exploring immense enchanted ruins and escaping the clutches of the most feared dark wizards. The narrative component of Hogwarts Legacy makes its own, without ever exaggerating: it feeds on this dual identity to stage a light, climatic and unpretentious story, taking advantage of the busy days at Hogwarts to delve into the depths of the Wizarding World. Alongside the great story of ancient magic, many minor adventures emerge which, using the supporting actors as a springboard, dive directly into the canon of the series, joking with already known places and dynamics. And perhaps this is precisely the biggest flaw of the plot: not the lightness that has always characterized the magical world, but the fact that too often we find ourselves faced with situations already read in novels or seen on the big screen, re-proposed here in excessively similar if not the same way, in a weird amalgam that is a triumph of fanservice. The structure of the magical world The first steps in the castle are not easily forgotten In the middle of the Scottish highlands stand the towers of Hogwarts castle, the ancient School of Magic which dominates a carpet of dense forests reflected by the still waters of the lakes; squeezed by the embrace of the mountains, the sloping roofs of many small settlements radiate, among which the village of Hogsmeade shines. The valleys are crossed by the express train tracks that run towards London, while going beyond the last ruins on the horizon you reach the coast, where the rock walls drop straight into the sea. Hogwarts Legacy adopts a completely open world structure, lifting the curtain on a vast open world that allows you to wake up in the morning, leave the dormitory, stroll through the courtyards and walk to the village of Hogsmeade, perhaps to buy a new flying broom or a couple of ingredients for potions. And it is an open world that is anything but empty, on the contrary, in some ways it ends up being too full of content. The architecture is in fact that of the classic large region dotted with small points of interest, from the Trials of Merlin - environmental puzzles that expand the inventory upon completion - up to the camps full of dark wizards to be knocked down, from the minute caves in which to recover some pieces of equipment up to the numerous lairs of fantastic animals. Every hundred steps you come across a ruin touched by ancient magic, a place dedicated to observing the stars, a small interaction that houses a treasure room, to such an extent that it becomes extremely difficult to understand whether this density is a value or a defect. If recently the works that have chosen this kind of structure have been strongly criticized, the big difference lies in the fact that here we are in the world of Harry Potter. Instead of shooting an arrow or swinging a sword, here you have to use the most suitable spell for the context; instead of bumping into crocodiles and families of deer, you'll cross paths with groups of Hippogriffs and Thestrals. This dynamic is a perfect metaphor of the entire experience offered by Hogwarts Legacy, which completely changes shape and color depending on who is observing it: it is made up of simple interactions, already seen, sometimes even trivial, which however draw immense added value when they feed the eyes of first-hour enthusiasts. The environmental puzzles are very simple and just as quick The matter changes when you cross the gates of Hogwarts, an area so vertical and intricate that you can count on a dedicated world map, a labyrinth of shortcuts and stairways so extensive that we are sure we have not yet explored every corner. It is in the castle that the artistic direction shines, capable of extracting all the best from the original saga to translate it into a coherent and interconnected three-dimensional construct. There is the statue of the one-eyed witch that hides the secret passage to reach Hogsmeade, there is the bathroom of the Prefects on the fifth floor, there are all - absolutely all - the elements and views that one would expect to find in the school, replicated with a level of detail and craftsmanship simply not found anywhere else outside the walls. Walking through the corridors, one is surrounded by the magic of the series, which emerges as much from the chance encounters with the poltergeist Pix and the famous ghosts, as from the scenography itself, colored by moving paintings, coughing armor andmusical instruments that play symphonies independently. Of course, the school is also chock full of little puzzles and environmental interactions - most of the time superficial and dry - from paintings that open up hidden rooms to ancient locks that are impossible to pick with a simple Alohomora. take center stage in Hogwarts Legacy: Avalanche Software has managed to perfectly capture the soul of the saga and then return it in a feast of settings and details that - until today - lived exclusively in the imagination of the most avid ~potterheads~. The architecture erected by the developers is decidedly more suggestive to see than it is deep in the mechanics, it is clear that it has not invented anything new, it certainly should not be understood as a magical Grand Theft Auto in which to fire spells on companions and observe their reactions . On the other hand, it manages to carry out the arduous task of which it was invested in an excellent way: that of dragging enthusiasts beyond the looking glass like Lewis Carroll's Alice, with the big difference that instead of Wonderland we find ourselves catapulted in the wizarding world of Harry Potter. The typical day at Hogwarts Theme of the day: Accio spell Life at Hogwarts proceeds marked by the passing of the seasons, which travel in parallel with the pace of the main narrative. Four seasons, four acts, four game sections each characterized by a long series of activities: in fact, an extraordinary amount of content moves against the background of the horizontal plot, sometimes completely optional and in other cases indispensable to proceed with the adventure. The clock does not tick forward until the list of the most important tasks has been exhausted, and at the same time it can happen that you find yourself without a goal if you neglect the side offer excessively. It is in fact essential to take part in the lessons to learn spells, the basics of herbology, the noble art of potions, and it may happen that access to certain missions is precluded precisely because a certain magic has not yet been mastered. Basically, the numerous windows of life that open up on everyday life at Hogwarts intertwine with the fabric of the story, staging what is the most classic of days in the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Wake up in the dormitory of your own home, touch run to take a seat among the desks to study Professor Sharp's recipes or the curses guarded by Hecat, not to mention that there is also no shortage of homework, or special tasks to be completed in order to get your hands on even more advanced magic formulas . For example, it may happen that Howin, a Magical Creatures teacher, asks to capture a couple of particularly rare species after class, offering a certain spell as a reward. Whether you choose to get lost in the exploration of the open world or to remain anchored in the course of study, obviously one must not forget to socialize with the other students. There are many Hogwarts students who have something to tell, and if in most cases they do it through negligible folklore missions, in the midst of the cloisters there is also room for building deeper relationships. A trip to Hogsmeade with Natty from Gryffindor The protagonist can, in fact, make real friendships with certain companions, for example the Slytherin Sebastian, the Gryffindor Natty and the Hufflepuff Poppy; know that we have chosen Ravenclaw, and our belonging to this house has not influenced in any way the maturation of relationships, except for some specific lines of dialogue dedicated to the topic. In addition to accompanying us during some essential points of the adventure, the supporting characters are further characterized through the bond missions, long narrative chains aimed at cultivating the relationship, enriched by the presence of special rewards and full of depth - both in terms of writing and on that of the gameplay - which is lacking in the activities and favors of the open world. Hogwarts Legacy indeed gives its best in the context of linear missions, adventures that drag the player to the four corners of the magical world and even go beyond those borders, raising the curtain on historical settings, on immense lost ruins and on dungeons far more complex than we could imagine. These are the rare parentheses ready to open up on the darkest mysteries of Hogwarts and its surroundings, and it is only on such occasions that the work takes on some risk in terms of complexity, both in terms of narrative and in terms of mechanics.
